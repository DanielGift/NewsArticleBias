0,Adams,Scott,jdsupra,"A new zoning ordinance ( adopted by the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors on March 23, 2021, significantly changes data center development in Fairfax County, Virginia.

The ordinance includes a new definition and specific design and building size regulations for data centers. Previously, data centers were interpreted to be telecommunications facilities under a longstanding interpretation. Under the new regulations, the size of the data center determines where the use is permitted — by right, versus by special exception — in the conventional zoning districts. Other new regulations relate to the location of the accessory equipment necessary to operate data centers.

The new regulations governing data centers in Fairfax County are summarized below:",0,https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/fairfax-county-adopts-new-data-center-8173436/
1,Adams,Scott,jdsupra,"Through the recent adoption of a new zoning ordinance (zMOD), Fairfax County has taken steps to establish distribution centers closer to consumers.

The ordinance includes a new use category for “goods distribution hub,” which, among other things, allows repurposing of commercial buildings to accommodate distribution centers and revitalize brick-and-mortar destinations. While the ordinance limits the quantity and size of delivery vehicles, it makes available a special exception approval to increase the building size or the number or size of delivery vehicles stored on-site.

McGuireWoods attorneys and planners were intimately involved in the creation of this new use category and are available to discuss strategies and opportunities to maximize distribution center and retail opportunities.",0,https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/new-fairfax-county-zoning-ordinance-7026677/
2,Adams,Scott,jdsupra,"Several years of work culminated in the March 23, 2021, adoption of a new zoning ordinance (zMOD) by the Fairfax County, Virginia, Board of Supervisors. This is the first comprehensive zoning update since 1978.

The new ordinance was designed mainly to modernize existing regulations and create a more user-friendly experience. However, it also created several new zoning categories, updated use definitions and requirements, and modified the list of permitted uses in certain zoning districts. Watch for future McGuireWoods updates on new use categories for distribution facilities, data centers and impacts on residential development.

Highlights from the adopted ordinance include the following:

Planned District (P District) Standards zMOD removed the requirements that P districts generally conform to provisions in the most similar conventional district. That update provides more design flexibility within P districts. Updates Planned Development Housing (PDH) district secondary use limitations. Under zMOD, the secondary uses must be designed as an integrated component of the development. The existing ordinance requires that they primarily serve the residents in the PDH district.

New Uses and Revised Use Categories Stacked Townhouse Dwellings – zMOD creates a new use category for what are commonly referred to as two-over-two units. This use previously was classified as multifamily and the new use requirements generally mirror the multifamily requirements. However, zMOD increased the parking requirements for this use and aligns it with single-family attached and detached units for affordable housing calculations and building setbacks. Live-Work Development – This new use category applies to reuse of existing buildings in which individual units are designed to accommodate residential dwellings and a flexible workspace for office uses. Office – Seven current uses are consolidated into the office use category. Additionally, the requirements permit increased office uses in certain commercial retail zoning districts. Data Centers – Creates a new use category for data centers, which previously were categorized as “telecommunications facilities.” The new use category expands where data centers are permitted, but also adds new design requirements and size limitations that will require special exceptions for most modern data centers. Goods Distribution Hub – Creates a new use category for last-mile delivery distribution, including both small-scale and large-scale operations.

Commercial Revitalization Districts (CRDs) – zMOD reorganizes and consolidates requirements in CRDs. It also adds flexibility for building heights and provides clarifications on setback requirements. The new regulations also increase requirements for interior parking lot landscaping and parking reductions.

The new ordinance goes into effect July 1, 2021. Applications submitted and accepted before that date will have until July 1, 2022, to obtain approval under the old zoning ordinance.

Anyone seeking development approvals after July 1, 2021, should review the new ordinance draft and determine the impact of zMOD on their project. McGuireWoods attorneys and planners have been involved with zMOD since 2017 and are available to discuss impacts on specific projects.",0,https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/fairfax-county-virginia-adopts-new-2174505/
3,Adams,Scott,jdsupra,"On Feb. 23, 2021, the Board of Supervisors of Fairfax County, Virginia, amended its Workforce Dwelling Unit (WDU) policy to target lower income levels, with a commensurate reduction in the percentage of affordable units required in development projects.

The recently adopted policy changes cover only rental units and are anticipated to have a financial impact on development projects. Any owners or developers with multifamily rental projects planned or in the entitlement process should evaluate their projects to ensure they reflect the updated policy.

Under the new policy, WDUs target those making 60 to 80 percent of area median income (AMI) and eliminate units targeting the 100 and 120 percent AMI tiers. The specific AMI tiers and expected percentage of units to be provided are included below.

Five-Year Review of the Affordable Housing Master Plan (AHMP). Arlington County’s review of the AHMP is expected to recommend tools to increase the number of on-site affordable dwelling units constructed in the county. Affordable Housing Building Height Zoning Ordinance Amendment. Arlington County is considering a zoning ordinance amendment to permit the County Board to approve buildings up to 60 feet taller than what is permitted under current zoning for projects providing 100 percent low- and moderate-income housing (up to 60 percent of area median income). The proposed zoning ordinance amendment is in addition to the bonus density currently available for those projects. The County Board could approve this amendment as early as April 2021. Multifamily Reinvestment Study. Arlington County recently rebranded its Housing Conservation District (HCD) effort as the “Multifamily Reinvestment Study.” The Multifamily Reinvestment Study broadens the HCD effort by creating new zoning tools that would help preserve existing affordable housing, create new committed affordable units, and increase the supply of new market-rate multifamily housing. The Multifamily Reinvestment Study could be completed later in 2021.

These three efforts are in addition to the Missing Middle Housing Study Arlington County launched in late 2020.

5,Adams,Scott,jdsupra,"This alert was originally published Sept. 16, 2020. New information has been added.

The Fairfax County Board of Supervisors recently moved forward in its consideration of a new Economic Incentive Program (EIP) that would provide tax abatements and other incentives for development in this Northern Virginia county’s designated revitalization areas. Authorization is scheduled for July 28, and the program could take effect as early as Jan. 1, 2020.

The primary benefit of the EIP is a partial real estate tax abatement equal to the difference in value between the base value (predevelopment) and fair market value (post-development) for up to 10 years. In addition to the tax abatement, eligible applications would receive expedited processing for zoning applications, site plan review and building plan review, as well as inclusion in the Land Development Services Project Management Program and a 10 percent reduction in site plan fees.

The EIP applies to new commercial/industrial/multifamily projects in one of Fairfax County’s revitalization areas, which generally include Annandale, Baileys Crossroads/Seven Corners, Lake Anne Village Center, Lincolnia, McLean, the Richmond Highway Corridor and Springfield. Draft eligibility criteria also require that projects consolidate at least two acres of land and two parcels, although the Board of Supervisors can modify certain requirements.

The program was adopted on Sept. 15; however, the 10-year tax abatement window begins on the following dates:

July 1, 2022, for projects in the Baileys Crossroads/Seven Corners EIP area

July 1, 2024, for projects in the McLean, Richmond Highway Corridor and Springfield EIP areas

Jan. 1, 2025, for projects in the Annandale and Lincolnia EIP areas

7,Adams,Scott,sharemovingmedia,"How often do you scroll through your preferred social media feed? Check your email? Tune into a webinar? With the rise of new digital tactics influencing consumer behaviors every day, it’s easy to fall into the fallacy that print marketing is dead.

No one can doubt the importance of digital marketing channels like your website, search engines, social media, and more. While digital marketing plays a crucial role in your overall sales growth strategy, you can still keep traditional tactics in your back pocket to meet your end objectives.

However, print marketing isn’t a substitute for digital marketing, but rather a strategic partner that compliments your brand and helps you deliver personalized experiences. 7 out of 10 people find print advertising more personal than online ads.

Let’s take a look at how you can integrate your digital and print marketing for healthcare initiatives to drive long-term revenue and customer loyalty.

Why Should Medical Suppliers Invest in Print Marketing for Healthcare?

You might think print marketing for healthcare is outdated and lacks innovation. However, by marrying digital and traditional tactics, you can develop a robust strategy that meets your customers at every stage of their customer journey.

Here are a few reasons to consider utilizing print marketing in collaboration with your digital campaigns:

Touch: With so much digital noise out there, print marketing thrives on touch and taps into your customer’s haptic memory to build an emotional connection with your brand.

Engagement: 78% of executives agree that an integrated digital and print marketing approach drives the most results and a higher engagement rate with customers.

Personalization: You’re able to develop personalized print campaigns based on demographics, location, interests, past purchases, and more, which is instrumental in connecting with physician offices across the country and distributor reps.

Trust: In the digital age, 63% of consumers trust and read print ads more than digital campaigns.

What’s the biggest benefit of print marketing for healthcare? You don’t have to choose print over digital. By developing a consistent experience across each channel, you can pair print with your digital marketing strategy to drive results that engage and convert your customers.

3 Ways Print Marketing for Healthcare Supports Your Digital Campaigns

To reach your target audience, you need to develop a powerful combined digital and print marketing healthcare strategy. Here are a few ways both channels work together:

1.Drives Website Traffic

Direct mail postcards and published print advertising is a great way to drive traffic back to your website. Whether you’re targeting specific leads or a larger industry audience, you can send hyper-personalized content directly to their mailboxes that target their pain-points and persuade them to learn more.

For example, postcards act as mini product catalogs that give your customers a snapshot into your full offering. Consider adding a quick response (QR) code and personalized URLs (PURLs) to track who is going back to your website so you can deliver a personalized experience and better report on your return on investment (ROI).

2.Increases Newsletter Signups

Email marketing provides you the opportunity to send personalized, frequent messages to contacts who are interested in your products. Email marketing provides an average return rate of $42. It’s a great way to showcase your brand, educate customers on product tips, and highlight upcoming events.

However, it can be difficult to grow a qualified email subscriber list. By utilizing table tents or direct mail postcards, you can consistently promote your newsletter’s benefits and encourage recipients to subscribe. You can also employ your print and email marketing initiatives in your workflow automation to provide touchpoints throughout the customer’s journey.

3.Boosts Social Media Following

Have you considered sending a print newsletter or sponsoring content in a print ad? Both are great ways to reach your target audience on a more personal level to establish credibility or flagship product updates. These print marketing initiatives are also a gateway to building your social media following.

Since your print marketing already demonstrates your expertise, you can utilize it as a platform to encourage recipients to follow your social media accounts for even more information. Tease out more incentives, product education, and more to work on growing your online presence.

Combine Print and Digital Marketing to Target Your Ideal Customer

While you might believe “print is dead,” that sentiment couldn’t be farther from the truth as more consumers are starting to tune out digital noise. It’s essential to mix both digital and traditional tactics to engage with your target audience and create a powerful marketing strategy for your medical products. Instead of siloing your strategy, you’ll be able to meet your customer at every point in their journey to boost your bottom line.

8,Adams,Scott,sharemovingmedia,"Search engine optimization is one of the most effective inbound marketing tactics you can employ as a healthcare manufacturer. SEO optimizes your company website so that it ranks higher in search engines like Google, driving organic, unpaid traffic to your primary sales portal.

This allows your target audience to find you naturally on the internet based on their interests. Instead of blindly trying to target potential leads, you will have potential leads coming to you. These leads will already have an expressed interest in your market area, making them more likely to convert.

Done right, SEO can drive conversion rates of 14.6%. Consider that traditional media advertisement has a conversion rate of 1.7% to put that into context. Given those statistics, it’s no wonder that more companies are investing in SEO.

That said, SEO marketing for healthcare sales requires a unique approach compared to other industries. This guide explains the complexities of SEO in healthcare and provides step-by-step guidance to help you improve your search engine page rankings.

How the “Your Money or Your Life” Principal Impacts SEO in Healthcare

Google, the primary gatekeepers of SEO rankings results, is incredibly strict regarding so-called “Your Money or Your Life” (YMYL) sites.

YMYL content is information that could impact an individual’s health, safety, emotional well-being, or financial stability if it’s presented untruthfully, incorrectly, or deceptively. Examples of YMYL content include medical and financial advice.

Smart manufacturers must present their products objectively and ensure any medically relevant information is clear and factual.

A Quick Guide to Healthcare SEO

When someone types a phrase into Google – say “hearing aid manufacturer” – they get many search results pages. Being at the top of that first page of results boosts your website’s visibility dramatically. Research reveals that the first position in the SERPs achieves an average click-through rate of 28.5%. The CTR drops to 15% for the second search result and continues to decrease, with the search result in the tenth position achieving a CTR of just 2.5%.

Here’s how to increase your odds of climbing the SERPs.

Ensure Your Content Meets the E-A-T Principle

High-quality, value-added content is critical to successful SEO, especially in the YMYL category. Your content should meet Google’s E-A-T guidelines, demonstrating expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness.

You can boost your EAT score by citing high-quality sources, for example. Always provide data for any assertions you make, ideally with citations to reputable “.gov” or “.edu” sources. Medical journals are also a great source.

Make Your Website Technically SEO-Friendly

Your content further needs to be optimized for SEO. This is a way of structuring your on-page content so that Google’s algorithm-driven bots can “crawl” through it, figure out what it’s about, and confirm its relevance and value for internet users.

Here’s a quick on-page SEO checklist to get you started. For each page on your website, you should:

Select one primary keyword to include in the content.

Choose three to four secondary keywords to include in the content.

Add the primary keyword in the webpage’s title tag, meta description, and H1 header.

Break up content into scannable chunks with H2 and H3 headers.

Include at least one image.

If you want to know more about technical SEO, Google offers a wealth of resources.

Tap into the Power of High-Value Backlinks

Google recognizes a website as trustworthy and providing valuable content to consumers via backlinks – when other websites link back to your website. Getting high-quality backlinks from high-ranking, authoritative sources is a great way to improve SEO results.

Getting backlinks from respected healthcare publications is one option. You can further drive valuable clicks by publishing your blogs, whitepapers, and more on platforms like LinkedIn or Medium.

Infographics are another great trick for generating high-quality backlinks. An attractive visual with relevant, industry-specific facts or statistics is share-worthy. Create your graphic, email it to thought leaders in your field, and invite them to share it. They should include a backlink when they publish it.

Don’t Forget to Make Your Site Mobile-Friendly

Google ranks mobile-friendly websites higher. Ensure your website is mobile-friendly, both technically and in terms of content structure. For example, since mobile screens are smaller, it’s best to use larger fonts.

To get you started, Google has a free tool that can tell if your website is mobile-friendly. It even gives you hints on how to improve, for example, by telling you if the text is too small to read or the links are spaced too closely together.

9,Adams,Scott,sharemovingmedia,"Content development enables sales teams to drive brand awareness, demand, and convert leads into loyal customers — making it a direct connection to your ROI and buyer engagement.

Situated throughout the lead funnel, effective content development also gives your sales reps everything from website content and presentations to nurtured qualified leads throughout the entire buyer’s journey with advanced case studies and whitepapers.

When you have a sales enablement strategy in place, utilizing the right types of content can benefit your overall bottom line and create more cohesion between your internal teams. After all, 73% of sales teams agree that cross-functional collaboration is key to the overall sales process.

Let’s take a look at what sales enablement is and how you can develop impactful content to aid healthcare sales reps.

What is Sales Enablement for Healthcare?

Your medical distributors are an integral part of your business, responsible for selling your products to healthcare facilities across the country. Since they’re spread throughout different regions, it’s essential to arm them with content resources that successfully educate key audiences on your product’s use cases and benefits.

Sales enablement is the process, technology, and content that empowers these sales reps to sell your product effectively. When you provide content that educates, offers solutions, and breaks down barriers, you enable reps to improve their sales conversions and ultimately spend more time selling.

77% of companies currently use a content marketing strategy to empower sales teams. You can get started with the following steps:

Understand what makes your customers move through your buyer’s journey and create content for every stage

Develop customer-centric content that targets pain points and positions your product as the solution

Make content accessible to your sales teams, such as using cloud storage or CRM tool

Utilize sales analytics to understand what content your reps using and where you can improve

By aligning distribution sales reps and marketing teams to create quality content, you’re more likely to see higher engagement and conversion rates.

6 Types of Content that Aids Healthcare Sales Reps

By developing a sales enablement strategy, you can create content for every interaction your distributors have with existing and potential customers. Here are a few types of quality content to aid healthcare sales:

1.Competitor Research

If you understand your customer’s pain points and needs, it’s essential you analyze where you stand amongst the competition with real statistics. To create successful competitor analysis, you also need to educate your sales teams on how they can persuade potential customers to make the next final conversion step by filling in your competitor’s gaps and highlighting the success of your products.

2. Case Studies

Case studies are true testaments to your products and help prospects resonate with your brand. High-quality and customer-centric case studies demonstrate your audience’s struggles and showcase how your services are a valuable solution.

You can develop case studies in several ways:

Written testimonials

Video interviews

Reviews

4. Blog Posts

Blog posts are utilized in an early stage, search engine optimization (SEO) marketing strategy, but they are also valuable sales tools to help nurture prospects. While they typically live on your website, you can turn your blog posts into one-page reference flyers for your sales team to quickly send to customers.

4. Ebooks or Whitepapers

High-quality ebooks and whitepapers often provide in-depth educational material and statistics around your product’s benefits. Typically used in the early stage of the sales process, they are ideal for a quick pitch or last-minute call to provide additional information and proof.

5. Video

Video marketing results in 66% more qualified leads in your pipeline. By developing education video content, you can explain your product’s benefits, features, and even instructions beyond your sales rep knowledge. Videos are also more digestible and hold attention for longer periods, so they are excellent material to showcase in a presentation, webinar, or email.

6. Onboarding Content

Often overlooked by marketing teams, developing engaging onboarding materials help train your sales reps on how to effectively sell your products. Not only does onboarding content provide valuable company and product information, but it also establishes your ideal sales pitch for each customer interaction, so your reps feel confident nailing the sale.

Start Developing Content to Aid Healthcare Sales and Boost Your ROI

For marketing to impact the success of your sales reps, it’s essential to develop quality content that meets their needs, helps streamline the process, and improves your ROI. Your content should not only affect each stage of the buyer’s journey but also help your team be more prepared to interact and educate customers. When marketing and sales collaborate, you’ll be more equipped to engage and convert your customers into long-term brand advocates.

11,Adams,Scott,jdsupra,"The Fairfax County, Virginia, Board of Supervisors recently approved a 60-day emergency ordinance that permits flexibility for uses impacted by state or federal COVID-19 requirements. The ordinance suspends any proffer, development condition or ordinance provision to the extent it would otherwise preclude a temporary modification to an activity, use or structure, as determined by the zoning administrator.

Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors has moved quickly to logically evolve its operational and regulatory framework to provide much-needed flexibility that responds to both applicable public health considerations and the practical business and operational concerns of businesses and industries that provide jobs and services to county residents.

This action responds to Gov. Ralph Northam’s COVID-19 executive orders, which triggered a wide range of modifications to uses, activities and structures. The ordinance fulfills the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors’ stated intention to remove unnecessary obstacles to businesses while following state and other governmental COVID-19-related requirements. On Nov. 17, 2020, the Board of Supervisors will hold a public hearing to establish a permanent ordinance for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic emergency.

By way of example, Fairfax County, through its Zoning Ordinance Modernization Program, is proposing a new use category for “Goods Distribution Hub.” A new hub would allow additional permitting and flexibility for distribution centers to be located in more zoning districts and ultimately serve more urban and dense population centers. This new use category creates more permissibility in commercial retail districts, including to allow repurposing of commercial buildings to better accommodate distribution centers and help revitalize and stabilize brick-and-mortar destinations. COVID-19 has accelerated the need to creatively repurpose commercial real estate — a trend that will continue across the real estate industry and business communities as retailers develop solutions for success in the highly competitive e-commerce environment.",0,https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/maximizing-retail-opportunities-through-74782/

The new administrative guidance is expected to give developers and property owners much-needed flexibility to consider residential, live-work and other options that, in many cases, could be beyond what existing planning guidance permits.

Arlington County’s administrative guidance would provide a set of key areas for Arlington County staff to consider when reviewing 4.1 and phased development site plan projects seeking to reposition a property away from office use.

Outreach is currently underway with business community stakeholders and decision makers and will continue in the upcoming weeks. The administrative guidance will likely be in place by the end of 2020.

They released two important reports that provide a potential roadmap for the Lee Highway corridor’s eventual redevelopment.

These reports, released Aug. 31, 2020, will strongly influence the redevelopment options ultimately established in the final Plan Lee Highway, which is expected in 2022. Property owners looking to pursue redevelopment opportunities in the Lee Highway corridor should closely review and analyze these reports. This is a major corridor in Arlington County and a significant commercial hub for businesses and transportation linking Rosalyn to East Falls Church, Virginia.

The recently released reports include a Historic and Cultural Resources Report, which provides research, documentation and a survey of historic and cultural resources in the Lee Highway planning area; and Neighborhood Inspiration – A Guide for Developing Future Plans, which describes conditions and attributes of different neighborhoods along Lee Highway. The findings include initial and general recommendations for further identification and public recognition of Lee Highway’s cultural resources, plus recommendations that are consistent with the policies of the Historic Preservation Master Plan and Historic Resources Inventory regarding preservation, interpretation, documentation and storytelling techniques for the Lee Highway corridor.

The Neighborhood Inspiration report gives the most important insights into what the eventual land scenarios could look like in the final Plan Lee Highway. It breaks Lee Highway into five distinct neighborhood areas, with activity nodes featuring each area’s mix of uses, mix of housing types and development intensity, based on the area’s guiding vision and proximity to rapid transit and other neighborhoods serving commercial centers. The report analyzes the potential land uses, housing types, transportation needs, historic preservation elements and appropriate building form for each neighborhood area.

The Neighborhood Inspiration report will serve as a foundation for Plan Lee Highway Phase II, which begins this fall. Phase II will develop land use scenarios illustrating different options for the corridor and neighborhood areas. Phase II will culminate in a Preliminary Concept Plan map in early to mid-2021, with Phase III launching soon thereafter.

18,Adams,Scott,jdsupra,"The Fairfax County Board of Supervisors recently moved forward in its consideration of a new Economic Incentive Program (EIP) that would provide tax abatements and other incentives for development in this Northern Virginia county’s designated revitalization areas. Authorization is scheduled for July 28, and the program could take effect as early as Jan. 1, 2020.

The primary benefit of the EIP is a partial real estate tax abatement equal to the difference in value between the base value (predevelopment) and fair market value (post-development) for up to 10 years. In addition to the tax abatement, eligible applications would receive expedited processing for zoning applications, site plan review and building plan review, as well as inclusion in the Land Development Services Project Management Program and a 10 percent reduction in site plan fees.

The EIP applies to new commercial/industrial/multifamily projects in one of Fairfax County’s revitalization areas, which generally include Annandale, Baileys Crossroads/Seven Corners, Lake Anne Village Center, Lincolnia, McLean, the Richmond Highway Corridor and Springfield. Draft eligibility criteria also require that projects consolidate at least two acres of land and two parcels, although the Board of Supervisors can modify certain requirements.

Authorization of the amendment to the Fairfax County Code is scheduled for July 28, 2020, with the program’s adoption scheduled for the Sept. 15 Board of Supervisors public hearing. The effective start date has initially been proposed as Jan. 1, 2021.

19,Adams,Scott,jdsupra,"In early June 2020, Arlington County will roll out a new virtual Site Plan Review Committee (SPRC) process that should streamline Arlington’s community review process in the short to midterm.

The SPRC, a committee of the Arlington County Planning Commission, typically holds three in-person meetings with numerous representatives from Arlington’s commissions and civic associations to review 4.1 site plan projects before the Planning Commission and the Arlington County Board hold meetings.

To keep projects moving during a time of social distancing, Arlington County devised a new online SPRC process:

Applicants and staff will participate in two separate “online engagement” sessions involving recorded presentations from staff and the applicant as well as written feedback from the public.

The SPRC will then hold a virtual, real-time meeting with the applicant to discuss unresolved issues raised by the public in response to the two required online engagement sessions.

The new online SPRC process is a good opportunity for developers who are thinking of pursuing a 4.1 site plan project in Arlington County in the near future. Expect the new online SPRC process to cut down on the amount of time it takes to schedule and complete the SPRC process, and to cut down on supporting costs (e.g., printing plan sets, consulting fees for participating in in-person meetings).",0,https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/arlington-county-va-to-roll-out-virtual-19864/
20,Adams,Scott,jdsupra,"Beginning May 29, 2020, Northern Virginia entered Phase 1 of Gov. Ralph Northam’s “Forward Virginia Plan.” Phase 1 permits greater use of outdoor spaces, particularly for restaurants and health clubs. Use of those spaces will be subject to occupancy and social distancing limits outlined in the plan.

Maximizing Phase 1 outdoor space provisions also requires greater flexibility in current zoning approvals and regulations governing use of outdoor spaces in most Northern Virginia jurisdictions. The majority of these jurisdictions have implemented, or are in the process of implementing, changes to allow that flexibility. Efforts in Arlington County, the city of Alexandria, Fairfax County and Loudoun County are summarized below.

Arlington County

On May 26, the Arlington County Board approved an ordinance allowing restaurants to apply for temporary outdoor seating area permits as part of Phase 1. Under this ordinance, Arlington County staff can approve temporary outdoor seating area permit applications expeditiously through an administrative process. Businesses proposing temporary outdoor seating areas located on private property will receive temporary approval shortly after submitting their applications, at which time they may establish those seating areas. Businesses proposing temporary outdoor seating areas on public property will need to wait for administrative approval from Arlington County staff before establishing these temporary seating areas.

The Arlington Board’s action will allow restaurants to serve customers in outdoor areas while indoor dining remains prohibited.

Restaurants can apply for permits, free of charge, by following the procedures outlined on the county’s website.

City of Alexandria

In anticipation of Phase 1, the City of Alexandria announced a temporary program to expand restaurant outdoor dining areas, effective May 29, 2020. Subject to review by the Department of Planning and Zoning, the City will temporarily suspend enforcement of certain code requirements for the use of public right-of-way areas — on-street parking spaces, sidewalks and parking lots — to permit outdoor dining. Once permit applications are reviewed and approved by City staff, the expanded outdoor seating will be available for 90 days, subject to change upon the decision of the City Manager.

Restaurants can apply, free of charge, using this form.

Fairfax County

On May 28, the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors adopted an emergency ordinance to provide significant flexibility for restaurants and health clubs reopening, subject to Phase 1. For both uses, businesses may expand their outdoor occupancy, subject to certain parameters, without further approvals from Fairfax County. This includes using any existing paved areas, such as parking spaces, for outdoor seating. Health clubs can also utilize existing grass areas.

More information on specific provisions and requirements is included in the Fairfax County ordinance.

Loudoun County

On May 28, Loudoun County issued guidance for restaurants seeking to expand outdoor seating during Phase 1. Expanding a restaurant’s outdoor seating is subject to Loudoun County approval of a temporary outdoor seating permit application. Restaurants can apply for such a permit, free of charge, but must include a sketch of the expanded outdoor seating area. More information, including the application form, is available on the Loudoun County website.",0,https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/northern-virginia-prepares-for-phase-1-80952/

22,Adams,Scott,jdsupra,"ABC Policy Changes

Beer/Wine/Mixed Beverage Takeout and Delivery. For the first time in ABC history, ABC adjusted its licensing regulations on March 20 to allow businesses with on-premises licenses (restaurants, eat-in establishments) to sell wine or beer in sealed containers for curbside pickup in a designated area and to deliver beer and wine to customers’ homes without holding a delivery permit. Gov. Ralph Northam followed up on ABC’s March 20 policy change by announcing on April 8 that mixed beverage licensees could sell mixed beverages for takeout or delivery. These two changes provide a much-needed revenue source to restaurants with beer and wine and/or mixed beverage licenses during the pandemic.

Distillery/Winery/Brewery Delivery and Pickup. ABC also announced on March 20 that breweries/wineries/distilleries with off-premises licenses could sell their products to customers for pickup or may deliver their products without a delivery permit to the customer’s home if the customer lives in Virginia. This policy change, which is unprecedented in Virginia ABC history, is intended to support Virginia’s burgeoning wine, beer and distillery industries when their facilities would otherwise be closed by Gov. Northam’s emergency order.

Other Changes. ABC has adopted a number of additional policy changes addressing a wide array of issues:

Wholesalers accepting the return of product from retailers Waiving the requirement that wholesalers must obtain a retailer’s signature coincident with product delivery, and the same for delivery permittees to consumers Authorizing distilleries to manufacture hand sanitizer Expanding the types of containers that may be used to sell wine and beer for off-premises consumption Extending the expiration date for licenses and permits that otherwise would expire in March, April and June 2020, for 90 days from date of expiration, without penalties and fees

Timeline. ABC’s policy changes remain effective so long as Gov. Northam’s stay-at-home order (Executive Order 51) remains in effect or by extension of ABC. As of April 23, 2020, the executive order is set to expire June 10, 2020.

New ABC Laws

Commercial Lifestyle Center License. Gov. Northam signed legislation (SB 181) on April 6 allowing mixed-use commercial developments located on a minimum site area of 10 acres to hold a commercial lifestyle center license. The commercial lifestyle center license allows licensees to sell alcohol to customers who can then consume alcohol anywhere within the mixed-use commercial development. SB 181 builds on legislation passed during the 2019 legislative session by reducing the minimum required site area from 25 acres to 10 acres. It’s likely that SB 181 will make more mixed-use commercial developments eligible for a commercial lifestyle center license and will allow developers to provide a unique amenity to their tenants and customers. SB 181 will go into effect July 1, 2020.

ABC License and Fee Reform. Other legislation (SB 389) signed into law on April 10 reorganizes all alcoholic beverage control licenses within the industry’s three-tier structure. In summary, this legislation consolidates many licenses with common privileges, aligns license fee amounts with enforcement demands and standardizes quantity limits on alcohol samples. The intent behind SB 389 is to streamline and harmonize ABC’s disparate licenses and fees into a more user-friendly system for licensees. Unlike most legislation passed each year, SB 389 has a delayed effective date of July 1, 2021.",0,https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/virginia-alcoholic-beverage-control-30011/
23,Adams,Scott,jdsupra,"Arlington County, Virginia, has enacted several policies and procedures to keep the county’s planning and zoning operations open and running during the COVID-19 crisis. While the situation continues to evolve, it is clear that Arlington County is finding creative ways to stay open for business and to help local businesses impacted by the pandemic.

County Board Meetings

On March 24, 2020, the Arlington County Board approved an emergency ordinance allowing the board to meet virtually to address the COVID-19 crisis and to handle matters essential to the continued operation of the county government. The board has held several virtual meetings since enacting the March 24 emergency ordinance, but county commissions, including the Planning Commission, have not met in March or April. The board and county staff spent the last few weeks deciding whether commissions essential to the land use process can and should meet virtually under the emergency ordinance. The county has not made a definitive decision on this issue as of April 20.

The board announced on April 16 that the April 18 and 21 board meetings would be deferred one week. The board made this decision in part to allow the Virginia General Assembly to consider a proposal by Gov. Ralph Northam to allow public bodies, including the Arlington County Board and local commissions, to meet virtually during the current state of emergency. Gov. Northam’s proposal, should it be adopted by the General Assembly, would provide clarity by definitively permitting commissions to meet virtually if authorized by the board. This means Arlington’s robust community review process for land use cases could continue in the near future with virtual commission meetings.

Planning Applications and Zoning Enforcement

Most planning applications — including 4.1 site plans, use permits and site plan amendments — are being processed electronically through the county’s Permit Arlington system. For the first time, the county is processing administrative change applications that are submitted to adminchanges@arlingtonva.us. Planning staff has been working remotely since mid-March, and applicants are regularly holding teleconferences with staff. County staff is processing applications with the intention of having the board review the applications at a virtual board hearing during the pendency of the pandemic.

On March 29, the county announced that it would relax the enforcement of certain zoning regulations for businesses particularly impacted by COVID-19. Specifically, the county announced that conditions associated with use permits and site plans will not be enforced for the following commercial retail, restaurant and food establishments, or building uses:

Drive-thru facilities

Food delivery service (groceries, and food and beverages to off-site locations)

Parking lot/sidewalk sales associated with retail/restaurant establishments

Provision of signs for retail and restaurants establishments on-site, indicating the availability of pickup, drive-thru and food delivery service

County board-approved loading dock hours with special exception site plans and use permits

Small Business Grant Program

On April 16, Arlington County unveiled a small business emergency grant program. The program provides grants of up to $10,000 to businesses and nonprofits with less than 50 employees. Businesses may use the grants for employee salary and benefits as well as for other business capital and operating expenses directly related to the immediate impacts of COVID-19. The application process is expected to start in early May.",0,https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/arlington-county-covid-19-related-27253/
24,Adams,Scott,jdsupra,"On April 14, 2020, the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors (BOS) in Virginia held its first virtual meeting, adopted a number of important ordinances and held a full slate of public hearings on land use cases.

Of particular importance, the BOS extended the validity period for certain expiring development approvals. It also approved an ordinance setting up procedures for virtual meetings of the Planning Commission and Board of Zoning Appeals.

Extension of Development Approvals Validity

The BOS approved an ordinance extending the validity period for certain categories of expiring approvals. Specifically, it automatically extends the validity of Land Development Services director-approved plans, permits or modifications that would have expired during the public emergency. The ordinance defines a director-approved plan, plat, permit or modification as “any plan, plat, grading permit, parking reduction, Public Facilities Manual modification, or Public Facilities Manual waiver approved by the Director.”

The extension does not, however, include building plans or building permits approved by the Fairfax County Building Official or preliminary subdivision plats.

This blanket extension will eliminate the need for case-by-case extensions and will function as a good stopgap measure for approvals with near term expirations.

Electronic Meetings of Boards and Commissions

The BOS also authorized various Fairfax County boards and commissions and independent boards (including the Board of Zoning Appeals) to meet electronically during the COVID-19 emergency. These include, among others, the Planning Commission, Board of Zoning Appeals, Board of Building and Fire Prevention Code Appeals, Chesapeake Bay Preservation Ordinance Exception Review Committee and the Geotechnical Review Board.

The ordinance gives fairly wide discretion to each board and commission regarding whether to meet and the scope of items it will review. For example, it is up to the chair of each board and commission to determine whether the body will continue to meet. Additionally, for those choosing to meet, the body itself must identify its essential functions and services and the scope of matters necessary to meet those essential functions and services.",0,https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/fairfax-county-board-of-supervisors-73001/

26,Adams,Scott,jdsupra,"McGuireWoods is closely monitoring how Northern Virginia jurisdictions are adjusting policies and procedures in response to COVID-19. At the time of this writing, Fairfax County is still proceeding with development reviews, inspections and permitting, albeit with adjusted procedures. For zoning cases, the Department of Planning and Development is primarily working remotely and has adjusted to receiving electronic resubmissions. The Department of Land Development Services has provided detailed information on revised procedures.

Below is a review of current Fairfax County practices.

Department of Planning and Development

Public Hearings Planning Commission public hearings are canceled through April 1. All cases will be rescheduled at least 30 days out. The April 2 PC hearing remains scheduled, and county staff is currently determining dates for deferred hearings. The Board of Supervisors public hearing scheduled for March 24 remains on the calendar at this time; however, most land use cases have been deferred to April 14 or May 5. The Board of Zoning Appeals hearings are canceled through the end of April. County staff is reaching out to all applicants and determining a plan for rescheduling. Local governments and industry are working with state officials in Richmond to clarify and expand the ability of local governments to hold public meetings and public hearings on development applications. McGuireWoods will provide updates as this effort proceeds.

Application Processing Individual staff coordinators are reaching out to applicants and requesting/coordinating fully electronic submissions. At this time, if there is a need for paper submissions, the county has a drop-off system on the first floor of the Herrity building. For other needs, such as interpretations and requests for additional time, the county is accepting materials electronically. Required fees will be deferred until an appropriate time.



Land Development Services

As mentioned above, the Department of Land Development Services (LDS) and its partner agencies have created a comprehensive website that is regularly updated. LDS has significantly improved its electronic submission capabilities in the past year and recently released its Site Records Viewer, which includes digitized versions of previously approved site documents. The e-Plans program continues to accept many types of site plan submissions. Additionally, all non-e-Plan submissions can now be sent through ProjectDox. Instructions are accessed here. All in-person counter operations have changed to drop-off operations located on the first floor of the Herrity building. The county highly recommends doing as much as possible online (e.g., permit applications, ePlan submissions, etc.). This will facilitate electronic review, as more and more county personnel are telecommuting.",0,https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/fairfax-county-covid-19-update-19087/
27,Adams,Scott,jdsupra,"On Dec. 17, 2019, the Arlington County Board unanimously approved a set of zoning ordinance amendments designed to increase the supply of senior housing in Arlington, Virginia, through the 4.1 special exception site plan process. These amendments were driven by the increased demand and limited supply of senior housing in Arlington, as evidenced by the fact that, according to staff, the two newest senior housing communities were established in 1999 and 2011.

The zoning ordinance amendments made three significant changes to how senior housing projects are approved in Arlington:

Expanding the number of zoning districts that permit assisted living facilities and nursing homes from five to 18, and expanding the number of zoning districts that permit independent living facilities and continuing care retirement communities from zero to 18 Revising the minimum parking requirements to 0.5 spaces per bedroom for assisted living and 0.5 spaces per bed for nursing homes Modifying several use definitions (assisted living facility and nursing home), replacing several existing use definitions (independent living facility and continuing care retirement community) with new definitions, and incorporating a new use definition into the zoning ordinance for elder case uses

The new zoning ordinance amendments should result in more opportunities to develop senior housing in Arlington.

28,Adams,Scott,jdsupra,"As previously posted, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law in December 2017 (the “2017 Act”) made significant changes to the federal wealth transfer system with respect to gift and estate tax transfers during the calendar years 2018 through 2025. One of these changes was increasing the basic exemption amount that can be transferred free of gift, estate and generation skipping transfer (GST) taxes. Prior to the enactment of the 2017 Act, the exemption amount was $5 million (as adjusted for inflation in years after 2011). Under the 2017 Act, the exemption amount was doubled to $10 million, which, after being adjusted for inflation, is now $11.4 million in 2019 (or $22.8 million for a married couple). However, the increased exemption amount is scheduled to “sunset” on January 1, 2026, to the 2017 levels, as adjusted for inflation.

One recommendation included in our earlier blog post was for individuals to consider using their increased exemption amounts to make significant gifts to family members. While almost any asset can be used for making gifts, interests in closely held businesses can be an attractive asset to use for a number of reasons, including business succession and tax valuation reasons. This can be especially true if such significant gifts are combined with other estate planning strategies, such as gifts to intentionally defective grantor trusts. However, there are always a number of tax considerations that need to be taken into account in making significant gifts, including whether such gifts are made efficiently from an income tax perspective. In any event, an advantage of making such significant gifts would be to use the increased exemption amounts prior to their sunset in the year 2026, or earlier if the tax laws are changed by Congress before such time. This is similar to estate planning that occurred in late 2012, when the exemption amount was scheduled to be reduced from $5 million per person to $1 million per person.

One concern of making such lifetime gifts prior to the sunset of the increased exemption amounts is whether the IRS would try to “clawback” such gifts into someone’s taxable estate when he or she later died, if the amount of such person’s lifetime gifts exceeded the exemption amount at the time of that person’s death. For example, if someone makes a $10 million gift in 2019 (when the exemption amount is $11.4 million) and then dies 10 years when the exemption amount has been decreased to $5 million (as adjusted by inflation), would the IRS take the position that estate taxes are owed at the time of that person’s death? This has been a concern because the gift and estate tax system is “unified,” and the amount of lifetime gifts is taken into account in calculating estate taxes in a decedent’s estate.

In November 2018, the Treasury Department issued proposed regulations stating that in such a situation, the credit to be applied in computing estate tax in a decedent’s estate would be based upon the higher exemption amount in effect at the time of the gift. Thus, there would be no clawback of lifetime gifts that later exceeded the exemption amount at a decedent’s death, if the exemption amount is decreased due to the sunset of the increased exemption amount in the 2017 Act or other changes by Congress.

As gift and estate tax laws change (either due to the sunset of the increased exemption amounts or potential changes by Congress), we will update the Family Business Advocates blog to inform clients and others of such changes, and the advisability of making lifetime gifts in connection with such changes.",0,https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/proposed-tax-regulations-eliminate-28151/
29,Adams,Scott,jdsupra,"The IRS and Treasury Department recently released proposed regulations providing guidance for investors looking to take advantage of the capital gains deferrals available in the opportunity zone program created under the 2017 Tax Act.

The 2017 Tax Act designed these opportunity zones (see map of Virginia’s designated qualified opportunity zones) to spur investment in distressed communities throughout the country through deferrals of tax on almost any capital gain up to Dec. 31, 2026, through an appropriate investment in a qualified opportunity fund (QOF).

While opportunity zones are a product of federal income tax law, they create a number of strategic development and investment opportunities specific to Northern Virginia’s real estate markets. The location and configuration of Northern Virginia’s opportunity zones include significant amounts of equally strategic real estate that also benefit from local planning and zoning recommendations — such as Embark Richmond Highway — that, in many cases, support significant redevelopment and/or value-add opportunities.

What Is a Qualified Opportunity Fund?

A QOF is any investment vehicle that is organized as a corporation or partnership for the purpose of investing in qualified opportunity zone property — with the exception of another QOF — and that holds at least 90 percent of its assets in qualified opportunity zone property. Such property includes qualified opportunity zone business property or certain equity interests in an entity that qualifies as a qualified opportunity zone business.

To satisfy this 90 percent asset qualification under the proposed regulations, a QOF can invest in an equity position in a qualifying trade or business within the opportunity zone, or may operate a trade or business directly. To qualify, a trade or business must be one in which “substantially all,” otherwise specified as 70 percent, of the tangible property owned or leased by the taxpayer is qualified opportunity zone business property.

Investors placing deferred capital gains into a QOF and holding that investment for longer than five years may exclude 10 percent of the deferred gain from inclusion and income, with investments longer than seven years allowing an investor to exclude 15 percent of the deferred gain. Investors who hold their QOF investment for at least 10 years also may qualify to increase their basis to the fair market value of the investment on the date it is sold (which frequently results in no taxable gain to the investor).

Who Is Eligible to Take Advantage of a Qualified Opportunity Fund?

Eligible taxpayers — individuals, C corporations including RICs and REITS, partnerships and certain other pass-through entities, S corporations, and certain trusts and estates — may defer recognition of some or all of their eligible capital gains through investment in a QOF. The election to defer gain into a QOF typically must occur within 180 days of the date of the sale or exchange that gives rise to the gain.

Property Owners

Opportunities exist for property owners within a qualified opportunity zone to consider a sale or ground lease of their property to — or arrange a joint venture with — a QOF that can bring together the resources and expertise necessary to entitle and successfully develop a property.

These joint ventures can be critically important, since a qualified opportunity zone business — to qualify under these proposed regulations — can share no more than 20 percent common ownership between the qualified opportunity zone business and the seller of land.

Additional opportunities exist for revitalization of buildings within a qualified opportunity zone, where “substantial improvements” are made. “Substantial improvements” means spending an amount equal to the basis of the buildings acquired.

Developers

Developers with experience identifying and implementing improvements — whether revitalizing existing buildings or developing underutilized land — can benefit from lending their expertise to help property owners and QOFs leverage qualified opportunity zone property and capital into realized developments.

Investors

Existing, even recently constructed, buildings within an opportunity zone that are “substantially improved” can be a qualifying investment for a QOF.

Whether as an existing sophisticated fund with capital gains to defer or as an entity with experience raising funds, an investor stands to reap significant benefits, not only on existing capital gains taxes — but also on gains realized after the sale of an investment held for a minimum of 10 years.

With only 180 days after a relevant sale or exchange to invest in a QOF, every day lapsed could cost investors the opportunity to exclude 10-15 percent of deferred capital gains.

Property owners, developers and investors looking to reinvest recent or upcoming capital gains earnings should begin formulating a strategy now. McGuireWoods’ real estate, private equity and tax attorneys offer extensive experience facilitating successful development and revitalization projects, fundraising, and providing strategies to help ensure an optimal outcome for taxpayers. They maintain well-developed relationships with all relevant decision-makers, regulators and stakeholders.

30,Adams,Scott,jdsupra,"Fairfax County recently completed the Embark Richmond Highway Comprehensive Plan Amendment for the Richmond Highway Corridor in northern Virginia. The amendment created a substantial amount of new density — much of it residential — along the route of the proposed bus rapid transit (BRT) system and, ultimately, the proposed Metrorail extension.

The Northern Virginia Transportation Authority recently approved funding to widen Richmond Highway to six lanes in Hybla Valley and support the BRT project. The BRT’s current preliminary design and environmental evaluation phases are anticipated to be completed by the end of 2019.

Four areas along Richmond Highway are the big winners of this planning effort — Penn Daw, Beacon/Groveton, Hybla Valley/Gum Springs and Woodlawn. Each area is a community business center (CBC) where density is allocated according to a form-based code rather than traditional floor area ratio. With maximum permitted heights reaching 22 stories, the plan will allow a substantial amount of new density.

This opportunity applies to property within the Dranesville, Hunter Mill, Providence and Sully Magisterial Districts. Significantly, this process does provide an opportunity to re-evaluate planned uses and density in strategic submarkets such as Tysons, Merrifield and portions of the Route 50 corridor.

There are a number of procedural requirements and limitations. The timeframe for decision-making is also somewhat protracted. Notwithstanding these realities, opportunities for owners or potential contract purchasers to propose changes to the plan historically have been limited. For that reason alone, this tool is worth exploring to address properties and circumstances that are clearly out of step with current or anticipated market realities. In addition, the procedural requirements for making a nomination are generally manageable.

There are powerful, unelected people in high places who just don’t want the pandemic to end.

That’s the opinion I’ve formed after this week’s COVID-19 news, wherein federal health officials suspended use of the Johnson & Johnson single-shot vaccine, and Dr. Anthony Fauci continued his disastrous messaging crusade of telling people that your life won’t change once you get your shot.

Let’s start with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration, which halted the J&J jab after six people out of 6.8 million reported blood clots. There’s less than a one-in-a-million chance something happens, but millions of people worldwide (the rollout was suspended in Europe, too) will be delayed in getting vaccinated over this drastic overreaction.

By comparison, about 50 people per year are killed by lightning out of 3.1 million total deaths in the U.S. You have a far better chance of being struck and killed by lightning than you do in suffering blood clots from the J&J vaccine.

This comes on the heels of the previous attempt to discredit the J&J vaccine, which was reported as being inferior to other vaccines when, in fact, it isn’t.

Related:Kentucky suspending Johnson & Johnson COVID vaccine amid report of blood clots

True, it was less effective in clinical trials than Pfizer and Moderna’s two-shot regimens of preventing COVID-19, which is often asymptomatic. But it was 100% effective at preventing hospitalization and death. The J&J drug is literally foolproof and keeping you alive, requires a single dose, and it is much easier to store than its counterparts — and yet the perception was allowed to permeate that it was a second-class vaccine.

Now, communities of color are worried they are getting crappy drugs while white communities are getting the good stuff. What a complete and total messaging failure.

This crazy move by the CDC and FDA comes as COVID-19 cases have risen for four straight weeks, proving there’s no time to spare in ramping up vaccinations. A few hours after the FDA’s initial announcement, the agency’s head, Dr. Janet Woodcock, said she only expected the pause to last “for a few days.”

Exactly what will that solve? Nothing. But the ripple effects will live on forever, increasing vaccine hesitancy among already skeptical populations.

Appearing on CNBC on Tuesday morning, Dr. Kavita Patel, a primary care physician who worked on health-care initiatives in the Obama administration, called the FDA’s decision “a devastating blow to this J&J vaccine effort in the United States.

“To anybody who is hesitant, I would tell you: Think about the fact we are still dealing with deaths, hospitalizations and the effects of even mild cases of COVID,” Patel said. “Vaccines have been shown to be effective in all those situations. Preventing death is a much better option.”

How can we expect the pandemic to end if unelected bureaucrats can artificially prolong it with these disastrous decisions? Is no one at the FDA weighing the costs of an announcement like the J&J pause? More damage was done here than prevented. We are incessantly told to listen to the science, and yet the scientists themselves are often proving unworthy of our ears.

Millions of Americans who have dutifully worn their masks, shut down their businesses, cut their family visits, and home-schooled their kids are wondering what the hell is going on here.

This problem isn’t limited to the FDA. It reaches to Dr. Anthony Fauci who is on an inexplicable media crusade to tell people that, once you get your shot, nothing changes — stay inside, keep your mask on and live in fear.

“I don’t think I would — even if I’m vaccinated — go into an indoor, crowded place where people are not wearing masks,” Fauci said.

Why in the world would he say that? From a public relations perspective, this is sheer lunacy. The White House is already projecting that by May, there will be more vaccines available than demand, and Fauci is making it worse.

Here are the facts: The vaccines work. All of them. All messaging should revolve around getting as many shots in arms as possible. And that message is clear and easy: Get your shot, live your life.

But for the unelected portions of our government botching their vaccine message, there is no accountability. Those people know there is a day, if the pandemic is allowed to end, that their media appearances will dry up. Their power will abate. Their obscurity will return.

And I am starting to wonder if that reality is setting in. How else do you explain their actions? I began the pandemic as a Fauci cheerleader. I wanted to believe there was a doctor in Washington we could trust to see the nation through, even as Trump bumbled around and said — let’s face it — really stupid stuff.

But I’ve come to believe Fauci is in way over his head. He might be good at looking at infectious diseases under a microscope, but he stinks at talking to the American people. He has wasted his gravitas by arbitrarily moving the goal posts and sitting for photo shoots with fashion magazines.

Fauci and others are driving an unnecessary culture of fear that is manifesting itself in bizarre ways. A Washington Post poll taken in late March said only 69% of Americans would feel comfortable attending a sporting event if they knew everyone in the arena had been vaccinated.

At least a third of our country is cowering in fear, thanks to Fauci and the rest of the bureaucracy.

How long will we live with the wrongs of this pandemic? We are still giving ourselves tennis elbow from all the sanitized wiping despite clear data that shows that surface transmission of COVID-19 just isn’t a thing.

We are requiring people to wear masks at PGA golf tournaments and other outdoor events despite clear data showing outdoor transmission isn’t a thing.

We still have schools closed — particularly in blue states — despite clear data showing school transmission just isn’t a thing.

The people driving this culture of fear will never appear on a ballot, but the politicians they work for will. Voters should act accordingly and demand accountability from our leaders who should, at a minimum, extract some mea culpas and humility out of our embarrassing federal bureaucracy.

""January 6 changed me.

Manchin is, of course, still a committed Democrat at heart, more likely than not to support liberal policies. But his hesitation to remake the Senate into a carbon copy of the US House of Representatives, where bills pass with a simple majority and bipartisanship is nowhere to be found, is refreshing.

Manchin risks little politically by standing in the way of his party's progressives who seek to move the nation too far to the left. His home state of West Virginia, after all, is full of Republican voters who overwhelmingly voted for former President Donald Trump in 2016 and 2020.

But he certainly risks headaches, chiefly from left-wing partisans who have no interest in reaching out to Republicans to seek compromise. After an election that produced Democratic control but relative stasis in Washington, DC (an even Senate, nearly an even House and a presidency built on 44,000 votes in a handful of states), many liberals would discard the average conservative's ideas in a New York minute, giving little thought or care to what that would do to America's body politic.

Whether Manchin ultimately compiles a center-left voting record is irrelevant. I expect him to vote for most, if not all, of Biden's agenda, as Manchin himself tries to shape -- and perhaps moderate -- some of the administration's most progressive ideas.

Most consequential are Manchin's views on the Senate itself -- and his unwillingness to allow the character of the unique body to be changed by eliminating the legislative filibuster rule or using the process of reconciliation to steamroll the minority party.

Reconciliation was ""never intended to be our main focus or our main vehicle for legislation. That's not legislating. It has to be used from time to time. I understand that,"" Manchin told CNN. But, he added, there is ""a time and a place.""

The Senate was designed as the cooling saucer, in former President George Washington's estimation, to sit under the House's sloshing hot coffee cup. The passions of the people boil over in the House, producing legislation that can be cooled, improved and made palatable in the Senate.

In theory, the two chambers wind up legislating in a way that satisfies the most people, and at least gives comfort to those unhappy with the outcome that their voice was at least heard and considered. The House was made to ignore minority viewpoints and the Senate was made to listen and act accordingly.

""I've watched people that had power and abused it,"" Manchin said. ""I've watched people that sought power and destroyed themselves, and I've watched people that have a moment of time to make a difference and change things and used it -- I would like to be the third.""

Our closely divided country could benefit from leaders who can produce outcomes that solve problems without trampling on half the country's views. Getting rid of the filibuster and abusing reconciliation is simply not keeping with the spirit of the body, and Manchin knows it.

Yes, the Senate was made for this moment in our divided nation, and perhaps it was made for someone just like Manchin, who, if he keeps his word on these vital procedural matters, will be long remembered as a leader who strengthened an institution -- instead of joining the angry mob of his own party trying to burn it down.",1,https://www.msn.com/en-ca/news/other/opinion-what-joe-manchin-gets-exactly-right/ar-BB1fuuEB?li=AAggFp4&srcref=rss

For the last year, Americans have experienced an unusual circumstance. People they’d previously never heard of (or at least thought much about) have wielded an unusual amount of control over their day-to-day lives.

The chief control freak is Dr. Anthony Fauci, who became a household name during the Trump Administration for putting his palm to his face while the former president spoke at a coronavirus briefing last March.

From that point forward the narrative was set: Trump was an idiot and Fauci was infallible. All it took during the Trump era to become a hero was do something snarky in opposition to Trump. You could be a complete failure at life, your profession, or whatever— but hero status was within reach even for the biggest losers.

Take New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who was botching his COVID-19 response badly when he wasn’t, allegedly, sexually harassing a number of his female employees. He was deified immediately by the anti-Trump media because his press conferences were the opposite of Trump’s.

Back to Fauci, whose government title is Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. His unofficial title is Pope of Telling You What You Can’t Do, whether the evidence backs his edicts or not.

With Trump gone, Fauci remains the embodiment of the now meaningless phrase “listen to the science.” Anyone who questions him becomes public enemy number one.

Enter Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), who went after Fauci in a Senate hearing on March 18, peppering him with good questions about masks and why immune people are forced to wear them.

“Given that no scientific studies have shown significant numbers of reinfections of patients previously infected, or previously vaccinated, what specific studies do you cite to argue that the public should still be wearing masks well into 2022?” Paul asked.

You may like:Sen. Rand Paul again clashes with Dr. Anthony Fauci over masks, COVID-19 immunity

But Fauci kept up his argument that even if you have natural immunity from COVID-19 antibodies or you have been vaccinated, you must wear a mask (two of them!) for the foreseeable future.

But why? Rand is right, after all. Reinfection rates are statistically insignificant, the vaccines work, and there’s no evidence that immune people are spreading the disease. So what’s the deal?

It’s simple: Fauci is trying to manipulate you.

Now, before you freak out that I’ve maligned the Pope of Nope, consider that Fauci has already admitted to manipulating the public before.

At the beginning of the pandemic, the U.S. government’s guidance on masks for the public was not to wear one.

""…there's no reason to be walking around with a mask,” Fauci said on 60 Minutes before poo-pooing their effectiveness.

“When you're in the middle of an outbreak, wearing a mask might make people feel a little bit better and it might even block a droplet, but it's not providing the perfect protection that people think that it is,” Fauci said.

The reason for the manipulation? Supply worries. There weren’t enough masks for doctors, so Fauci, in the same 60 Minutes interview, discouraged their use among the general public. You could argue this was a reasonable decision, but you cannot argue that it was anything other than manipulation.

Fast forward to December, when Fauci admitted to moving the goalposts on herd immunity, in an interview with the New York Times:

""When polls said only about half of all Americans would take a vaccine, I was saying herd immunity would take 70 to 75% ... Then, when newer surveys said 60% or more would take it, I thought, ‘I can nudge this up a bit,’ so I went to 80, 85. We need to have some humility here .... We really don’t know what the real number is. I think the real range is somewhere between 70 to 90%. But, I'm not going to say 90%.""

You may like:Staff slamming Teen Vogue's editor. Protesters targeting cheerleaders. Where is our grace?

Fauci continues to ignore those who have already been infected in his herd immunity calculations, according to Dr. Marty Makary at the John Hopkins School of Medicine. Fauci wants between 70 and 90% of the U.S. to have protection. If 60% of the population gets the vaccine, and 55% of us have natural COVID-19 immunities (whether we know it or not), according to Makary’s estimation, we are nearing herd immunity now.

If Fauci includes naturally immune people in his herd immunity calculations, he likely thinks fewer people will get the vaccine. Again, he’s manipulating us to achieve an outcome — more shots. Fauci is very much an “ends justify the means” bureaucrat.

And why the continued mask theatre? More manipulation. A portion of the population is skeptical of the vaccine. If Fauci lets vaccinated or naturally immune people take off their masks, the unvaccinated population will likely follow suit.

But the flip side is that if Fauci (and President Joe Biden, for that matter) continue to argue that even fully protected people cannot take off their masks and live their lives, then vaccine-hesitant people will become even less likely to sign up. “If I can’t resume normal life, why get the shot?” they might think.

As with most topics, honesty is the best policy. Paul and Makary are right — about reinfection rates, about masks, about herd immunity, and about the resumption of normal life in America. We are achingly close to normalcy if people continue to get their shots, which data happily shows is happening at an increasing rate. In fact, Biden’s White House is worried that by mid-May there will be more supply than demand for the vaccine, according to the New York Times.

So, get your vaccine as soon as you can. Live your life. Take care of your neighbors and be responsible. But understand that a fair bit of the public health advice we’ve been given for the last year has been to manipulate the public instead of “following the science.”

(CNN) Watching President Joe Biden's first press conference today, all I could think was that his performance showed there's little chance he is running for reelection -- despite the fact that he said his ""expectation"" was to do so. He equivocated on this matter when CNN's Kaitlan Collins followed up later.

Over the course of an hour or so, his most coherent moments seemed to come when he looked down to read directly from his policy note cards. He frequently became lost in thought or sucked into a word salad when he looked up to riff or go off script.

On immigration, Biden appeared not to understand how his campaign rhetoric and presidential policies are impacting the surge of migrants and unaccompanied minors at the southern border right now. And he was only willing to commit to full transparency for journalists in border facilities at a later date -- yet to be determined.

Biden also said the filibuster was being abused, apparently not recognizing that his own party, a minority in the US Senate for the last six years, used it quite liberally during the Trump administration.

In fact, he took it a step further and said he agreed with former President Barack Obama that the filibuster was ""a relic of the Jim Crow era."" Does he not remember his 2005 Senate speech passionately defending the filibuster?

Tens of thousands of immigrants from Central America and Mexico, including thousands of unaccompanied minors, are journeying to the border. In February, the US Customs and Border Protection says it tracked over 100,000 migrants crossing the southern border, almost a 30% increase over January. Nearly 10,000 were unaccompanied minors, and more than 14,000 of those minors are now in US custody.

And the problem worsens every day.

Yet White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Monday refused to characterize the situation as a ""crisis,"" instead, calling it a ""circumstance."" This comes at the same time the Biden administration is restricting press access to border facilities, prompting backlash from CNN and other news organizations.

The most recent photos we have of the conditions at the border came Monday morning from Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Democrat from Texas, who visited an overflow facility in Donna, Texas, to witness the crisis first hand. He shared pictures with Axios showing children crammed and penned amid plastic sheeting.

That's right -- kids tightly packed in detention facilities, sleeping on mats on the floor with aluminum-like blankets. For all of the hue and cry from the left hammering former President Donald Trump for keeping ""kids in cages"" at our southern border, Biden has now served in two administrations -- first as vice president and now as President -- in which migrant children are being held in terrible conditions.

When this happened during the Trump administration, his staffers and cabinet members were harassed, heckled and even forced out from restaurants in protest. Time magazine went so far as to run a cover showing a towering Trump looking down upon a crying Hispanic little girl.

Make no mistake -- this is a crisis, and one of Biden's making. Some media organizations have managed to interview some of the migrants. Over and over, the reporters were told the same thing -- these migrants were coming to America because Biden told them they could. Biden issued a 100-day moratorium on most deportations, which a federal judge blocked, and ended the Trump administration's ""Remain in Mexico"" rule. He has also halted the construction of Trump's wall, though some scholars question the legality of pausing mid-build.

If there was one bright line dividing the Democratic and Republican parties in last year's election -- and in the actions of the last two chief executives -- it was immigration. Biden ran against Trump's so-called ""racist"" policies and pledged to reverse his immigration restrictions and border security measures. The message was sent loud and clear: with Trump gone, the border is open.

Now in office, laughably, Biden and his Department of Homeland Security secretary are trying to put the genie back in the bottle. Biden is telling migrants not to come, and Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas says the ""border is closed."" Too little, too late.

However, the bell cannot be unrung, and Biden's first crisis as President is at hand -- whether he admits it or not.",1,http://www.msn.com/en-ca/news/other/opinion-biden-is-botching-his-first-crisis/ar-BB1eT0eI?li=AAggFp4&srcref=rss

As it turns out, not only did Bradford coin a phrase that we still use today, but he foreshadowed his own demise. He was imprisoned in the Tower of London by Queen Mary I (“Bloody Mary,” to rabble rousing Protestant reformers like Bradford) and burned at the stake in 1555 for allegedly trying to stir up a mob.

I knew as much about Bradford last week as I did the magazine Teen Vogue. But when the publication — which bills itself as “the young person’s guide to saving the world” — popped into the news I had reason to study both.

The magazine hired a new editor-in-chief named Alexi McCammond, a well-regarded 27-year-old journalist. At first, her hiring was heralded by many — a career triumph for a young and accomplished woman of color.

But then began the ritualistic flogging of someone unfortunate enough to have been a teenager in the Twitter era. McCammond, at the age of 17, had mocked people of Asian descent and used the words “gay” and “homo” as slurs.

This was not a new disclosure, by the way. Her tweets were first surfaced in 2019; she apologized at the time.

But her plea for forgiveness fell on deaf ears among the woke mob that writes for Teen Vogue, which circulated a letter slamming McCammond’s hiring and, according to reporting from The Daily Beast, complained to McCammond’s bosses at Condé Nast publishing.

The staff of a magazine that caters to teenage girls made a firm statement: no mercy for anyone who tweets or says something stupid or insensitive as a teenager. Teen Vogue’s writers aren’t “saving the world.” Rather, they are trying to destroy it, one person at a time.

College student:Being in college shouldn't disenfranchise me from democracy. HR 1 defends voters like me.

McCammond’s episode — including two public apologies in the week since her hiring and ultimately her resignation Thursday from the job she never got a chance to start — is part of our new normal, where we all have collective amnesia about how stupid we were as teenagers and college students.

Remember Carson King, the 24-year-old Iowa man who raised over $1 million for charity before his local paper started digging through dumb tweets he sent as a 16-year-old? He did something nice and wound up punished for it, and the reporter involved had his own stupid tweets unearthed, too.

Or Josh Hader, the star pitcher for the Milwaukee Brewers? He was 24 in 2018, and during that July’s All-Star game some insensitive tweets he sent as a 17-year-old began to trend. His family was attending the game and were forced to remove jerseys bearing Hader’s name and replace them with generic ones.

We have an epidemic of gracelessness in America. The pursuit of decade old tweets — from our teenage years! — is staggeringly stupid, self-defeating and a pox on American culture. I suspect many youngsters, just entering the workforce, live in constant fear of an old enemy digging up a dumb post. If I had a nickel for every contemporary who has said to me “thank goodness social media didn’t exist when I was in high school,” I’d be a rich man.

This is America:We share to protect the women after us

But the point isn’t to wax nostalgic for days gone by. It is to acknowledge that we grow. We change. We become wiser. And as we do, so should our capacity to forgive and overlook the sins of youth.

But something has happened to us lately. I don’t know if it's COVID-19 or something else, but we are just brutalizing each other. Why? Have we taught young people that they live in a zero-sum world, where others must be destroyed for them to succeed?

In downtown Louisville the other day, about 30 Black Lives Matter protesters ganged up on a group of adolescent cheerleaders, “chanting into megaphones and calling on sparkly dressed kids to recognize their white privilege,” The Courier Journal reported. One parent said a woman screamed “your white f------ privilege allows you to do this,” at her daughter, and another yelled that the girls looked like “drag queens.”

Not a single parent or child walked away from that experience with a better impression of the racial justice movement. Everyone is worse for the wear because the protesters couldn’t muster a thimble full of grace for a bunch of frightened elementary school kids.

In Fairfax, Virginia, a 15-year-old girl and her family were humiliated by workers at a Whole Foods grocery store. The disabled girl — confined to a wheelchair, unable to walk or even feed herself — can’t wear a mask because of her condition, which should have been obvious. Nonetheless, two store workers chased the family down an aisle and ejected them from the store. Another scalp for America’s self-appointed, if utterly pointless, mask Gestapo.

This isn't right:My disabled daughter and I were booted from a grocery store because she can't wear a mask

No common sense. No compassion. No grace. You get a chilling “I was just following orders” vibe when reading about the encounter, which did nothing to stop the spread of COVID-19 and everything to traumatize a defenseless little girl and her family.

We’ve been through enough. More than 534,000 people are dead. Millions of lives turned upside down. The well-being of countless children, destroyed. The next time you have the chance to show a little grace to someone, do it.

Like Mr. Bradford — who begged for forgiveness before his burning and offered forgiveness to anyone he had wronged — you never know when you may need it yourself.

(CNN) President Joe Biden's speech Thursday night contained a long section about ""the truth,"" and he said the truth is that the only way to get our lives back to normal is to ""beat the virus."" If he believes that, why did so little of the Covid relief bill he signed today go toward doing just that?

Scott Jennings

The merits of this bill are more than debatable, as less than 10% of the $1.9 trillion plan is spent on direct Covid spending and just 1% is for vaccine distribution.

Biden closed by again talking about ""the truth"" as he prepares to hit the road to sell a piece of legislation that has already passed and been signed into law. We've been inundated with polling that claims the American Rescue Plan is overwhelmingly popular, so why go to such lengths to sell it now?

Because the word is out -- the bill has little to do with Covid relief. A $1,400 check is not going to lift anyone out of poverty, despite slobbering to the contrary. The cold political truth is that the economy is already improving without the bill, but Biden wants to connect that improvement with legislation that will have little to do with our recovery.

I read a gripping story in the New York Times the other day that contained the following passage:

“The story highlights the tensions between a student’s deeply felt sense of personal truth and facts that are at odds with it.”

The journalist, Michael Powell, did a superb job of detailing a chilling tale wherein two staff members at Smith College in New York had their lives ruined over allegations of racism by a Black student.

The university hired a law firm to conduct a thorough investigation and found the student’s accusations of racism were unsupported by the facts. Nonetheless, the student did find her “personal truth” supported by other students on campus who “walked out of autumn convocation in solidarity” and whispered, “there goes the racist” when the falsely accused cafeteria worker walked by.

The story, at its core, is of a person constructing an alternate reality inside an ecosystem that nurtures “personal truth” over, well, actual truth.

Politics:Mitch McConnell throws shade after Donald Trump takes credit for his reelection

This is becoming all too common in the education space, where indisputable truths are discarded in the pursuit of alternate realities that solve perceived injustice.

In Oregon, the state’s department of education recently promoted training for teachers in the field of “ethnomathematics,"" which argues that “white supremacy culture” has infiltrated math classrooms by forcing students to focus on getting “the right answer” and on showing their work.

Fox News obtained a toolkit associated with this training that encouraged teachers to ""come up with at least two” different answers for various math problems.

""The concept of mathematics being purely objective is unequivocally false, and teaching it is even much less so,"" the document for the ""Equitable Math"" toolkit reads.

I was but moderately proficient at math during my school days, but even I recall that if I have two apples and you hand me two more, I now have four apples. There aren’t multiple answers, just apples and counting.

What little education our children are getting these days, thanks to the unnecessary and corrosive school lockdowns, is further polluted by this thinking. Would you feel good about sending your kid to a school that teaches math problems have different answers depending on the race of the person working them?

Conservatives are buzzing about these stories because they highlight the insanity of the American liberal mindset, and the excesses of people who believe racism explains virtually every negative feeling, perceived slight or missed math problem.

Coronavirus:Trying to find vaccine in Kentucky? Here are some suggestions on where to look

Does racism exist? Certainly, it does. Are these stories examples of how to move America in a better direction on that front? Heck no.

But at the same time the American right plots a return to power by presenting itself as the cure to this galaxy brain thinking, it has largely succumbed to a “personal truth” narrative of its own.

Enter Ron Johnson, the Republican senator from Wisconsin who spent copious amounts of time in a recent committee hearing on the Jan. 6 Capitol riot regaling us with wild tales that fly in the face of what we all saw on our television screens.

Johnson read into the record portions of an op-ed that claimed “agents-provocateurs” and “fake Trump protesters” were responsible. This, even though videos and court filings clearly show plenty of authentic Trump supporters ransacking the seat of our government.

What is the difference between what Johnson and other conservatives are doing regarding Jan. 6, versus the Smith student or the crazy racial math people?

Nothing. Nothing at all.

Johnson, just like the others, has constructed a “personal truth” (or, if you’d rather, is pushing Trump’s personal truth) to explain a perceived injustice — in this case, the erroneous view that the election was stolen from Trump. The former president himself bolstered the false narrative at his weekend speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference.

Unfortunately, partisans who inhabit both ideological extremes fully buy into these “personal truths” without looking into the facts or bothering to even wonder if these stories might possibly be false. If your tribe tells you it is true, you blindly believe it and hate anyone who challenges it.

For liberals, claims of racism against undeserved targets are rarely recanted or reconsidered. For conservatives, GOP apostates who refuse to follow Trump’s election lies are never forgiven. Both sides seem perfectly fine with mob rule, so long as the mob is partial to their point of view.

Conservatives are hoping the overreaches of the left will propel them in the 2022 midterms and beyond, absolving them of having to — gasp — write an actual policy platform. Returning to the electoral winner circle depends on voters perceiving Democrats as too indulgent or supportive of a massive leftward shift in our culture. This happened in 2016 after President Barack Obama’s eight years.

But for that strategy to work, your own house must be clean. If liberals are insisting that two plus two does not equal four, conservatives can’t beat them by claiming that three plus three does not equal six.

50,Jennings,Scott,msn,"Donald Trump's return to the national stage at the Conservative Political Action Convention (CPAC) was about what I expected: In a two-track speech where he was intermittently bored by a teleprompter and amused by his own adlibs, he teased a third presidential run, came home to his animating issue, immigration (which was inexplicably absent from his 2020 reelection campaign) and continued the farce that he actually won last November. He even ran through a ""hit list"" of Republicans to be ousted from the party.

Of note was Trump shooting down the idea of a third party, which is actually a good impulse. Republicans cannot win with a fractured party, nor can they win if it gets any smaller. I don't understand the quest by some Republicans to shrink the party. The GOP just lost the White House by nearly 7 million votes and hasn't won the national popular vote in a presidential election with someone other than a Bush since 1984. Republicans lost the White House and don't control either house of Congress in Washington, despite the relative equilibrium in the congress.

Yet, there was Sen. Ted Cruz at CPAC a couple of days before Trump, trying to excommunicate people he derided as ""country club Republicans"" -- Republicans who, I guess, Cruz finds distasteful for their incessant golfing and love of private dining. Is he unaware that Trump currently lives at a country club and owns a bunch of them?

Cruz copied Rep. Jim Jordan with these statements, who the other day declared that the Republican Party no longer tolerates people who drink wine and eat cheese and accepts only those who wear blue jeans and drink beer. How much wine and cheese do you think the good people of Mar-a-Lago consume on a daily basis?

The real question is: why can't the GOP have it all? What good does it do for the smaller of the two parties to shrink itself further? Does Cruz consider Ritz Carlton goers to be in or out? Because he just stayed in one in Mexico the other day.

As a practical matter, the GOP is currently capable of winning majorities in the 2022 midterms because of geographic, jurisdictional, and redistricting advantages -- along with the strong possibility that President Joe Biden will be far more liberal than advertised.

But there's no evidence the GOP can win the 2024 presidential campaign unless it embraces a more elastic brand, which welcomes country clubbers, white and blue collar workers, young and old, White and non-White. We need the insurance agent and the pipefitter. The retired Rotarian and the young welder. The grandma voting in her 12th election and her granddaughter voting in her first.

We need them all.

But who can lead the party to that broad coalition? There is direct empirical evidence that putting Trump at the center of our party in 2024 is a probable loser, as Trump twice got a smaller percentage of the vote than Mitt Romney. And that was before the failed insurrection wherein Trump violated his oath of office to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution.

Some Republicans (especially those most loyal to Trump) make the mistake of believing politics to be a game of subtraction when it is really a game of addition. It is entirely possible to construct a rational, center-right policy platform that attracts a broad coalition that includes Trump supporters. The Democrats, led by Biden, are already making it easy for the GOP to unify in opposition to what they see as far-left agenda. The follow-up task is to offer a competing governing alternative based on something other than grievances and conspiracy theories.

Trump actually ran on a policy platform in 2016 -- immigration, trade, drain the swamp. He ran on virtually nothing in 2020 and has left the Republican Party searching for an identity beyond blind loyalty to him. Where do we go from here? It's going to take a while to sort it out but running on nothing but ""more Trump"" and shrinking the party for the sin of joining a club like Trump's is unlikely to put a Republican back in the White House.",1,http://www.msn.com/en-ca/news/other/trump-and-his-cpac-fans-lead-gop-down-a-losing-path-opinion/ar-BB1e6oaM?li=AAggFp4&srcref=rss

(CNN) Donald Trump's return to the national stage at the Conservative Political Action Convention (CPAC) was about what I expected: In a two-track speech where he was intermittently bored by a teleprompter and amused by his own adlibs, he teased a third presidential run, came home to his animating issue, immigration (which was inexplicably absent from his 2020 reelection campaign) and continued the farce that he actually won last November. He even ran through a ""hit list"" of Republicans to be ousted from the party.

Of note was Trump shooting down the idea of a third party, which is actually a good impulse. Republicans cannot win with a fractured party, nor can they win if it gets any smaller. I don't understand the quest by some Republicans to shrink the party. The GOP just lost the White House by nearly 7 million votes and hasn't won the national popular vote in a presidential election with someone other than a Bush since 1984. Republicans lost the White House and don't control either house of Congress in Washington, despite the relative equilibrium in the congress.

Yet, there was Sen. Ted Cruz at CPAC a couple of days before Trump, trying to excommunicate people he derided as ""country club Republicans"" -- Republicans who, I guess, Cruz finds distasteful for their incessant golfing and love of private dining. Is he unaware that Trump currently lives at a country club and owns a bunch of them?

Cruz copied Rep. Jim Jordan with these statements, who the other day declared that the Republican Party no longer tolerates people who drink wine and eat cheese and accepts only those who wear blue jeans and drink beer. How much wine and cheese do you think the good people of Mar-a-Lago consume on a daily basis?

The real question is: why can't the GOP have it all? What good does it do for the smaller of the two parties to shrink itself further? Does Cruz consider Ritz Carlton goers to be in or out? Because he just stayed in one in Mexico the other day.

In Texas last month, a doctor named Hasan Gokal lost his job as head COVID-19 response coordinator at the Harris County Public Health Department. He was in possession of 10 doses of COVID vaccine that had been opened and would expire in six hours if not used. Not wanting the life-saving medicine to go to waste, Dr. Gokal scrambled to find people who would take it. One of them was his wife, who he injected with the final dose 15 minutes before it would have expired. For the transgression of practicing medicine, he was also charged with a misdemeanor by a lunatic district attorney.

When Dr. Gokal was fired, a human resources representative questioned the lack of “equity” in his choices, implying he had vaccinated too many people of Indian descent. Better no one get the vaccine than the wrong people, I suppose.

In Miami, 30 million precious N95 masks — among the most coveted pieces of gear for America’s health-care providers — sat idle for months in a warehouse in a country starved for them. Why? Our national system for getting DemeTech’s masks — along with other small private suppliers — into the national supply chain is so complicated, convoluted and impenetrable that the masks just sat there unused. Only after the New York Times highlighted the insanity did President Joe Biden’s coronavirus response coordinator, Jeffrey D. Zients, finally intervene.

In Alexandria, Virginia, a man who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 wearing horns, pelts and face paint is happily eating organic prison food after a federal judge ordered it so. The ""QAnon Shaman"" Jacob Chansley said regular food sickened him, and he refused to eat in the Washington, D.C., jail where he was housed after trying to overthrow the U.S. government. He demanded a transfer and a special menu, and somehow a judge saw fit to indulge this man’s sickening sense of entitlement.

In-person classes:JCPS reopening recommendation delayed as district opts for more board discussion

There’s an email sitting in my inbox, now a few weeks old, from a reader who absolutely hated something I wrote about President Donald Trump. I have opined that Trump is clearly responsible for the Jan. 6 riot and that Republicans have been lied to about the election being stolen. I said that even though Democrats have considered past Republican presidents to be illegitimate for no good reason, Republicans shouldn’t stoop to their level. They should be adults and accept their loss.

The reader said: “Why do Republicans and the political right ALWAYS have to be the adults in the room?” (emphasis his)

I’ve thought about this missive for a solid month. Shouldn’t a major political party always aspire to present itself as the “adults in the room?” Are Republicans now running on being the party of irresponsible children?

Here’s a probing question: What the heck is wrong with us?

Are we really this unserious?

In Washington, President Biden sits in the White House after promising to “listen to the science” in beating the coronavirus. He would never interfere with scientists, he said, over and over and over.

And yet, less than a month into his term, that’s exactly what his White House is doing. His Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, said on Feb. 5 that “There is increasing data to suggest that schools can safely reopen and that … vaccination of teachers is not a prerequisite for safe reopening of schools.”

Bold move, Rochelle. You just got between Democrats and the teachers’ unions. Immediately, Biden’s spokesperson issued a statement saying Walensky was “speaking in her personal capacity,” a nonsensical smackdown of a top government scientist.

COVID-19:Where are Kentucky's regional vaccination sites located? Here's a list

The Biden White House then issued a statement saying it was the president’s goal to open schools at least one day a week, part of their “bold, ambitious agenda.” And then it forced the CDC to issue guidance that attached school openings to local transmission rates, which the CDC has previously admitted are not connected (schools have low rates and are not a meaningful driver of COVID spread). The new CDC guidance effectively means schools may never open in many places.

The Biden school opening fiasco is a deeply cynical, flawed and unserious approach to one of the biggest problems facing our society — the serious damage done to our children by keeping them out of school.

Abuse. Suicide. Malnutrition. Academic failures. It’s all happening because Democrats won’t open the schools in many places. Jake Tapper’s takedown of the CDC’s Dr. Walensky on CNN Sunday morning is worth the watch; Biden is wrong on schools and she knows it, but she’s obviously been kneecapped by the union’s political thugs over at the White House.

What is our nation’s future if we continue down this unserious path? Punishing doctors. Locking up medical equipment. Treating the “QAnon Shaman” better than we treat our children. Regressing into political adolescents. Putting union bosses ahead of scientists.

Bleak, that’s what.

In happier news, on the same day, Republicans rightfully upheld Rep. Liz Cheney's position as GOP Conference Chair in a crushing vote. Cheney had defended her support for impeachment of former President Donald Trump as a vote of conscience during a reportedly contentious closed-door GOP conference meeting. It is a disgrace that it came to this, but Cheney's gutsy demand for a vote herself called her opposition to the carpet. She had the votes, and they didn't.

The Republican Party has too much to do to continue wringing hands over whether to discipline conspiracy theorists or practice the politics of subtraction by attempting to excommunicate people like Rep. Cheney. President Joe Biden has taken a sharp left turn and the GOP hasn't won the national popular vote in a presidential election with someone not named Bush since 1984. We are in danger of losing the country to the left if Republicans can't screw their heads on straight and present a responsible, reasonable governing alternative to the Democrats.",1,http://www.msn.com/en-ca/news/other/opinion-the-gop-needs-to-screw-its-head-on-straight/ar-BB1dorLF?li=AAggFp4&srcref=rss

This is an op-ed by Scott Jennings, a Republican adviser, CNN political contributor and partner at RunSwitch Public Relations. This piece originally published in the Louisville Courier-Journal.

Let me take a crack at helping you understand how and why Senate Republicans landed where they did on Jan. 27, the day Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul forced a floor vote on a simple question: Is an impeachment trial of Donald Trump, now former president, constitutional?

Paul’s position — that Trump cannot be tried since he’s out of office — attracted 45 of the 50 Republican senators, including Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader. Paul’s gambit confirmed Trump will not be convicted, despite the horrific events of Jan. 6 (and others leading up to them) in which Trump obviously played a central role.

McConnell’s vote surprised some since he had publicly expressed such displeasure with Trump’s attempts to overturn the election. It was thought that perhaps McConnell might lead his conference to convict Trump, holding him accountable for his atrocious behavior.

But ultimately McConnell came around to Paul’s view — also shared by legal scholar Jonathan Turley, Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton, and several others — that the Constitution doesn’t permit the trial of a former president, and that perhaps impeachment just isn’t, as conservative godfather George Will wrote, “worth it.”

Capitol riot:Two more Kentucky residents charged, including for aiding or abetting

The questions before McConnell and his fellow Republicans were laced with more than a sprinkle of politics to go along with the constitutional issues. McConnell keeps his eyes on the future and his moves are always in service of producing outcomes. Siding against Trump on the Paul question would not have produced a different result.

As the leader of a conference, McConnell has responsibilities that go beyond those of a rank-and-file senator, including taking the temperature of his conference and driving as much party unity as possible. While McConnell can and sometimes does shape the views of others, they often shape his views as well.

McConnell is not a dictator among Republicans, but rather a consensus builder. He often jokes that being a Senate leader is like being the caretaker at a graveyard — everyone is under you, but no one is listening. He did not become the longest-serving Republican Senate leader by siding with five against 45 very often.

In this case, McConnell’s members had a passable off-ramp that protects them from taking an anti-Trump vote and might help the party move on (at least in the short term) as they focus on stopping the worst impulses of the Democratic Party. While many Republican senators know Trump is in the wrong, they simply didn’t want to confront him (and his supporters) when it wasn’t clear that conviction would have any real-world effect on him, anyway. The wisdom of this is in question, but the reality is not.

Does this make them feel good about themselves? Probably not. Who can feel good about allowing someone — even a former president — to get away with such egregious behavior? Letting Trump off the hook could incite a future president to push the envelope even further (now that presidents can absolve themselves by simply resigning following an unconstitutional bender), and it undermines a fundamental lesson we teach our children: that cheaters never prosper.

We haven’t seen the last of Donald Trump in our politics, and the Republican Party’s two factions are likely headed for a collision in the 2022 and 2024 primaries. But for now, he again escapes accountability for his actions.

Request for leniency:Kentucky protester enters plea in U.S. Capitol riot case

And McConnell is already back at work doing what he does best: unifying his conference to thwart the radical liberal agenda being pushed by President Joe Biden.

For a man who preached moderation and unity during his campaign and inaugural address, Biden sure has a funny way of showing it. His armada of executive orders was a veritable blue navy of bad ideas on which progressives are happily sailing the liberal fever swamps. If you think Republicans are hostage to Trump, then it is equally apparent that Biden is hostage to radical progressives. Neither circumstance, mind you, is good for America.

And the consequences for the economy could be disastrous. If Biden and his party pursue a $1.9 trillion COVID package through the partisan exercise of budget reconciliation (in which the majority party can effectively mute the minority), consider that one of the bill’s provisions — raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour — could kill as many as 3.7 million jobs, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

Many companies that would be devastated by an increase were recipients of loans through the Paycheck Protection Program, in which the federal government spent hundreds of billions to keep people employed through the pandemic.

Would it make any sense to have spent all that money keeping people employed, only to kill their jobs less than a year later simply to satisfy Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders? McConnell and his team are a hard no on that. Plus, Republicans just supported $900 billion in relief in December, money that has largely not permeated throughout the country.

A group of 10 Republicans has proposed a scaled-back package that better targets the money to the truly needy, strips out the non-germane progressive wish list and focuses on vaccine distribution and opening schools. Biden would be wise to deal with them, as partisan, progressive overreach cost his old boss —President Barack Obama — dearly in the 2010 and 2014 midterms.

On the one hand, you could judge American democracy to be quite healthy. In November, we had our highest election turnout in over a century. An engaged citizenry, after all, is vital to our system of government. Joe Biden received the most votes of any candidate in U.S. history, and Donald Trump the second most.

On the other hand, you can feel that something is not quite right. Since the insurrection of Jan. 6, I am catching up to the vast number of people taken in by outrageous conspiracy theories and by Trump’s lie that the election was stolen. A Quinnipiac survey found 31% of Americans — including 67% of Republicans and 32% of independents — believe Biden’s win to be illegitimate.

In one way, this is the continuation of a trend that began in 2000, when a great many Democrats refused to accept the legitimacy of George W. Bush’s presidency. Liberal intransigence continued into 2004 and then reared up again in 2016 after Trump was elected.

And yet this time is different. The people who think Biden is illegitimate took those views to the next anti-democratic level (egged on by Trump himself) by attacking the U.S. Capitol to try to subvert the Congress from performing its constitutional duties. The mob wanted to hang Vice President Mike Pence and apparently intimidate and assault (or worse) members of Congress to force them to change the results of the Electoral College.

This escalation represents a serious threat to our democracy, as millions of Americans have concluded that the only legitimate elections are ones in which their preferred candidate prevails. This is an extremely corrosive — and unpatriotic — viewpoint.

“If (Joe Biden) becomes our illegitimate president, we’re done. None of us will be voting again,” Kentuckian John Isaacs told The Courier Journal last weekend. Isaacs had traveled to Washington on Jan. 6 to be part of the “Stop the Steal” rally that led to the capitol violence. He told the newspaper that it was “mathematically impossible” for Biden to have won.

With all due respect, this is ridiculous. No American should be so wrapped up in a single politician that they declare they will never vote again because that person lost. Republican leaders have a responsibility to tell Mr. Isaacs and those who agree with him the truth: The election was won by Biden, fair and square. And they should take stock of who has lied to them during the same period.

For subscribers:Who are the people from Kentucky charged over US Capitol riot?

The high probability of a Trump loss was eminently predictable, even before the pandemic struck last year. In two elections he received a smaller percentage of the vote than Mitt Romney did in 2012. Trump’s party was wiped out in the 2018 midterm and then lost the Senate due to his Georgia sabotage. Trump had a rather low political ceiling to begin with, and it fell dramatically after the events of Jan. 6.

But Republicans have been stricken with a terminal case of magical thinking since 2016, when Trump, against all odds, predictions and polls won the presidency. Among many Republicans there was a feeling that, no matter how bad the polling or the president’s personal performance (did you watch the first debate?), it would all just somehow work for him.

It turns out magical thinking isn’t a good political strategy. Trump tried hard for about two weeks of his reelection campaign in late October and made it closer than many polls predicted, but it just wasn’t enough.

And that’s OK, because we are holding another election in two years, and another one two years after that. This is how we do it. Conservatives can rejoice in some of what Trump did (lower taxes, scores of conservative judges, Middle East peace agreements, etc.) even as we lament his post-election disgrace and chart a path back to national viability.

The new president deserves the loyalty of Republicans and fellow Americans who believe in the Constitution. This doesn’t mean changing our views or values, or even thinking that a single Biden policy is good for the country. (His early moves trouble me greatly, as I fear he cannot say no to the fringe left radicals in his party.)

But it does mean respecting our system, which produced a legitimate result and, therefore, a legitimate president. It means renouncing violence as a replacement for normal democratic engagement. And it means preparing to take your arguments to the American people in the next election instead of taking your vote and going home, or worse.

Mitch McConnell on Capitol riot:Mob was 'provoked' by Donald Trump

Most Republicans supported President Trump even though he wasn’t their first choice in the 2016 primary. They stuck with him through numerous self-defeating and outrageous episodes because they respected the election results even when Democrats did not. Republicans hoped he could win a second term and continue to deliver center-right policy victories.

But most Republicans did not sign up for the shocking level of pouting, lying and unconstitutional actions Trump delivered on his way out. I personally wasn’t creative enough to conjure a scenario in which the president of the United States would whip up a violent mob to threaten his own loyal vice president in a bid to overturn the election results.

Watching Biden take the oath of office Wednesday was a pleasant reminder that our system held, despite the recent assault upon it. And for Republicans, it was a rather unpleasant reminder of what happens when you descend into the magical thinking that losing an election is “mathematically impossible.”

The best path forward for conservatives? Unify and rejoice around a system that lets us choose our leaders. Work with President Biden to deliver the coronavirus vaccine while opposing the worst impulses of the left. Focus on our conservative ideas instead of unpredictable personalities.

And, most of all, tell the truth — to ourselves, and to the American people.

Inauguration Day:What McConnell and other Kentucky politicians had to say on Biden's first day

The House impeached President Donald Trump Wednesday for inciting an insurrection against the United States government, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has decided the trial should take place next week, when Senate Democrats will be in charge of the chamber.

This is significant because the majority determines the impeachment trial rules, just as Republicans did during Trump's first trial. We don't know exactly what kinds of changes this may bring to Trump's second impeachment trial, but the President cannot rely on Senate Republicans to construct for him a procedural fortress. This time, Trump is largely on his own.

There are a number of political issues at play for McConnell and his Republican conference, and reasonable people of goodwill are going to reach different conclusions about them. People I respect tremendously, like Republicans Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming in the House and Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, for instance, both voted to certify the Electoral College, making President-elect Joe Biden's victory official, but split on whether impeaching Trump is the right answer for our country.

Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, who stood with the Constitution last Wednesday as a violent mob stormed the capitol, has concluded an impeachment trial cannot take place after a President leaves office. Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, one of the most thoughtful Republican leaders I've ever known, is wrestling with whether impeachment is ""best to heal our country.""

And on top of all that, polling taken since the attack shows that Trump remains popular among many Republicans and is likely the frontrunner for the 2024 nomination, should he run for a third time.

Every Senator has his or her own political fortunes, morals and futures to think about. Senators are different from House members; they are not ""in cycle"" every two years (and this occasionally breeds courage and statesmanship during the intervening four years), and most are far more confident in their own political positions back home than the average representative. And the Senate, as designed and described by the Founding Fathers, is supposed to be the more sober, thoughtful and measured of the two chambers. I am sure many -- if not most -- senators are asking: If Trump's conduct isn't impeachable, then what is?

Republican Senators, 17 of whom would be required to convict Trump -- if all 50 Democrats do as well -- must tackle three questions: Can political violence and a direct assault on the Constitution and Congress go unpunished? Is it worth it (or allowable) to convict Trump after he leaves office? And, if the Republican Party has reached the political limits of Trumpism, is conviction a good way of separating the GOP from Trump? The answers aren't so simple, as we've seen in the mixed signals from Senators so far.

Even aside from from last Wednesday's shameful events, Republicans know there's a limit to what Trump can do politically. In two national elections, he received a smaller percentage of the vote than Mitt Romney did in 2012, and Republicans aren't in control of anything in Washington as Trump leaves town. One of Trump's final acts was to sabotage Republican chances in the Georgia Senate runoffs, costing the GOP its majority.

If a Senator believes Trump to be the wrong person to lead the Republican Party moving forward, and/or that he must be punished for subversive actions, the question then becomes: Does convicting him make him go away faster or does it make him a martyr? I've seen persuasive arguments on both sides of this question.

Even before last Wednesday, Republican leaders were wondering what to do with Trump (or, perhaps, what he would do to them). Trump was defeated, fair and square, but has clearly been a source of new people and new money for the Republican Party, even as he's also a source for the disastrous lie that he won in a landslide.

He is also the single greatest motivator for new Democratic voters and money, driving up their turnout more than his own. He clearly doesn't intend to retire from politics, and grassroots Republicans remain grateful that he smashed the Clintons and routinely smashes the media. He has also caused a great many Republicans to buy into the magical thinking that he -- and he alone -- possesses some secret political sauce that delivered him the presidency in 2016 against all odds, and would have in 2020 had he not been ""cheated.""

And perhaps most disturbingly, he has signaled a future where extra-constitutional, extra-procedural and extra-legal measures can and will be taken when political outcomes don't go his way. The call to the Georgia Secretary of State, the vulgar harassment of Mike Pence, the organization of the deadly mob -- all of it stems from an unwillingness not just to accept the results of the election and a desire to subvert the legislative branch of government, but also to ignore the finality of decisions made by the judicial branch.

No matter what Republicans do with Trump, I fear we've entered a political period when far too many on the right and left are willing to tolerate political violence and rule breaking. For a solid year, many on the left have tolerated riots and mobs in major American cities (along with the flouting of Covid-19 safety measures) with the explanation that as long as the cause is righteous you can do what you want. One could make the argument that Trump's supporters have simply adopted that frame of mind; we know that Trump didn't win, but they don't.

Mind you, none of this is good, helpful or in adherence with American democratic norms, nor should it be tolerated. But it exists as part of our reality, so we must deal honestly with it.

The president has floated a third run for the White House and, before this week’s siege of the Capitol, would have entered the 2024 primary as the prohibitive favorite. It seemed as if he would leave office with a lock on the Republican Party, despite losing the election.

But Trump has forfeited any claim he once had to continue holding any position of national responsibility. The Republican Party — my party — can no longer tolerate someone operating so clearly outside the bounds of democratic norms. And he must be kept from running in 2024. We now have clear evidence from two straight national elections that Trump cannot even win a plurality of the votes. And that was before Wednesday’s national disgrace.

Setting aside the insurrection, Trump has dramatically weakened his party since November, costing Republicans the Senate majority (a loss that reportedly delighted him). Trump’s phone call to Georgia’s top election official, begging for a “recalculation” of the votes cast in his race, was an abject disaster, as was his message to his supporters that their votes might not count. It turned out some of them were listening, just as they were at the rally on Wednesday morning, when he urged them to march to the Capitol.

It didn't have to end like this for Trump. George W. Bush lost the popular vote in 2000, but then governed in a way that delivered a majority vote four years later. His was the template Trump should have followed: Prove your critics wrong — especially the ones who treated you as illegitimate — by surprising them on policy and politics. Reach out to all Americans, not just your supporters. And sometimes zig when they expect you to zag.

But Trump went backward, losing by 3 million votes in 2016 and then by 7 million in 2020. He could have cleaned up leftover messes from previous administrations, cutting a new path through the wilderness of Washington's bipartisan failures.

Trump largely failed to do that. He did score some victories on criminal justice reform, gaining traction on the issue in a way that left his critics wondering whether the president’s unorthodox style might be what the country needed to break the partisan impasse. But he turned out not to have the attention span for forging other policy wins, including in areas that would have endeared him to moderate suburbanites who were wary of him in 2016, weary of him by 2018, and worn out by him in 2020.

Trump, who had billed himself as the ultimate deal maker, failed again and again to make deals that would have helped his reelection. At one point, he had congressional Democrats talked into $25 billion for his border wall in an agreement that would have also taken care of the nation's ""Dreamer"" population. But he just couldn't close the deal.

Playing solely to his base lost Trump the election, alienating former Republicans in the suburbs who might have overlooked his character flaws had he given them more to chew on than uncouth behavior and conspiracy theories. The Georgia Senate runoffs showed again that the Republican Party under Trump has major problems among traditional center-right voters, even as it has picked up some support among other demographics. To win in the future, the party must find leaders who can (and will) appeal to both.

Trump’s failure to understand the possibilities of his own policy influence — and the political rewards to be reaped from it — sank his presidency. Perhaps he thought that by cutting deals to appeal to America's center he would lose his base. In retrospect, though, that was terrible judgment. They would have followed Trump anywhere, as we've seen in his disastrous quest to overturn the election results.

Every conversation about his term — and his obituary — will begin and end with the insurrection he fomented against the U.S. Congress because of his unwillingness to accept the results of a free and fair election.

Republicans cannot nominate Trump again in 2024, for both political and national security reasons. To nominate him again would divorce the party from the wide political spectrum that has defined the United States since its founding. Trump's legacy could have been something positive despite his losing the election; that's all wiped away now.

Republicans must cut all ties with Trump. We didn't want him to leave office in a blaze of disgrace; he chose that path himself. We accepted him as our party leader and our president, and many worked faithfully to shape his administration in a positive way. But he clearly doesn’t want us anymore, and we should oblige this final request.

Several people stood tall on Wednesday, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Vice President Mike Pence, who rejected Trump’s demands to disregard the Constitution. Those are the true Republicans and patriots who did the right thing.

But many did not, including GOP Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri and Ted Cruz of Texas and Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama, who were effectively Trump’s deputies in fomenting an attack on the Capitol. Even after the mob was cleared, they and a few others plowed ahead with their illegitimate electoral objections, disqualifying themselves from pursuing the presidency or other positions of leadership going forward. They threw in with those who occupied the U.S. Capitol wearing animal pelts and horns. Utterly disgraceful.

The party has interesting voices on the horizon, including Sens. Tim Scott of South Carolina and Tom Cotton of Arkansas. They and others can lead as we move on from Trump, banishing him to the political wilderness for violating his oath and staining the office of the president with his actions. Perhaps now we can return to a GOP anchored on principles instead of personalities, with leaders who serve for the good of the nation instead of their own personal self-aggrandizement.

Jan. 6, 2021, will be remembered as one of the darkest days in American history.

And it will be remembered as Mitch McConnell’s finest hour.

The Senate majority leader, in his last official action in that role before turning over the title to Chuck Schumer of New York, led a group of American patriots on the floor of the Senate to reject Donald Trump’s election conspiracies, to repel the self-dealing antics of some of his colleagues, and to uphold the guardrails of American democracy set forth in the U.S. Constitution.

“The voters, the courts, and the states have all spoken. If we overrule them all, it would damage our republic forever,” McConnell said in a speech that more than met the moment, which was indeed a high bar.

The final, dramatic interaction between McConnell and Trump comes at the conclusion of a presidency that will forever be defined by a wild, seditious mob, incited to action by the president himself. And it culminates a post-election period in which McConnell proved to be one of the last adults in Washington D.C., guiding our political institutions away from Trump’s depressive chaos.

Just days before standing tall for American democracy, McConnell took heat for slowing down Trump’s (and Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer’s) hasty idea to spend nearly half a trillion dollars on stimulus checks without screening for actual need.

Many of the checks would have landed in the accounts of “perfectly comfortable families” making upwards of $350,000 per year, according to the Washington Post.

More:Trump and his cultists will surrender to democracy on Jan. 20, like it or not

Even the Post’s liberal editorial board begged for this idea to be stopped. And one man—apparently the last adult left in Washington—stepped in to scold the children and save them from their worst impulses: Mitch McConnell.

In this case, the children include the President, the Speaker of the House, the Democratic Leader of the Senate, a socialist Senator from Vermont, and a handful of Republicans who could not care less about the money but were desperate to earn a pat on the head from Trump, who started the $2,000 craze via Twitter and then headed off to the golf course.

Why $2,000? Why not $4,000? Or $8,000. Or how about $50,000. Or one million! Nobody knows where the number came from, but it is round and sounds like a lot. Even Sen. Rand Paul, normally a staunch Trump ally, said, “It's a really foolish, eggheaded, left-wing, socialist idea to pass out free money to people. So I part ways with the president.""

Even as McConnell was putting out that fire, he was fixing another of the president’s lame-duck mistakes by leading an override of Trump’s veto of the annual defense bill, the first override of Trump’s term. McConnell had protected Trump from two overrides in 2019, but this veto was indefensible.

Interestingly, while Trump argued for $2,000 checks to be indiscriminately fired from Washington’s money cannon, he vetoed boosting the average junior enlisted soldier’s salary by $860 per year.

But McConnell could not have known what his Wednesday would entail when he rose to defeat one final act of childlike nonsense, as a handful of Senate Republicans planned to join dozens of House Republicans in a bid to overturn the results of the Electoral College.

Trump’s Lost Boys in this dark fairy tale were Josh Hawley of Missouri and Ted Cruz of Texas, both likely to seek the presidency in 2024 and hoping to inherit Trump’s mantle. Cruz’s fealty to Trump on the issue of election fraud is amusing since Trump accused Cruz of engaging in it to win the 2016 Iowa Caucus.

McConnell warned his conference from engaging in these tantrums of magical thinking, before and after the insurrection. And he largely prevailed, as the vast majority of Republican Senators (and several constitutionally minded others, including Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky) stuck with McConnell on the matter.

Also:After DC riot and invasion of Capitol, we must impeach Trump to protect our democracy

Republicans who joined the Hawley/Cruz effort handed Democrats the single best argument ever made for abolishing the Electoral College, the only reason Trump was elected in the first place. And their disgrace only deepened when, even after the insurrection, they returned to the Senate floor to plow forward with their cynically self-interested effort. Democracy be damned; there’s a primary to win!

The conspiracy theories in play were deranged and dangerous. Five people are dead because of Trump’s nightmare fuel. Some of the rioters were — before and after the siege — calling for Vice President Mike Pence’s arrest and execution for treason because he failed to singlehandedly award the presidency to Trump.

Yet, despite Trump’s rage and the vice president’s previous endorsement of the Hawley/Cruz plan, Pence stood tall on Wednesday alongside McConnell to defend the Constitution and subvert the treasonous rioters.

Ultimately, though, it was McConnell who set the tone for the Republican Party, making clear that Trump is done as president and should not be allowed back. For all the policy good that was done under Trump, the thing we’ll remember most is the Day of Insurrection that stained his name, his presidency and American history. The day that he truly, deeply violated his oath of office to preserve, protect and defend the U.S. Constitution.

And at the same time, we’ll remember the senior senator from Kentucky, Mitch McConnell, who stood against Trump’s insurrection and helped crank forward the gears of the world’s oldest — and most important —democracy.

If there’s a silver lining to this dark hour, it provided a clear line of demarcation to discern between those who believe in our Constitution and those who don’t.

(CNN) – This is literally an insurrection. The fact that the US military hasn't secured the seat of our government already is a failure of leadership by the commander in chief.

President Donald Trump caused this insurrection with his lies and conspiracy theories about the election process being rigged against him. It was not stolen, but this madness was fomented by the President and his top advisers over the past several months. His attorney Rudy Giuliani, at a rally on Wednesday, called for ""trial by combat"" to a roaring crowd.

Let me be clear: These rioters are not Republicans. These are not conservatives. These are not patriots bursting into the US Capitol, accosting police officers and destroying public property.

These are domestic terrorists, and they ought to be treated like any other terrorist uprising with the full force and fury of the US government. Trump's video calling out these terrorists -- which he released on Twitter -- was a complete failure of leadership, a half-hearted and wholly inadequate attempt to stop these individuals.

Republican Sens. Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley and their group of objectors should withdraw their objections to the election results immediately. We are beyond lectures about Rutherford Hayes and Samuel Tilden and their great White House compromise. We are now going to decide whether this country is capable of self-government, or whether we are going to perpetually devolve into two tribes unwilling to accept the results of election, the pillar of democratic self-governance.

Republicans supported Trump in the election. It is over. We lost. Now, all Republicans have a duty to support the republic and the Constitution by condemning this terrorism, rallying around the peaceful transfer of power and our constitutional institutions, and demanding all of the actions within the power of the President of the United States to restore order to our Capitol.

To anyone attacking the Capitol, you are no different than any violent Antifa rioter you claim to despise. Today, you are them.

I'm ashamed and embarrassed for our country, and for any Republican who fails to condemn this shameful behavior.

(CNN) This is literally an insurrection. The fact that the US military hasn't secured the seat of our government already is a failure of leadership by the commander in chief.

President Donald Trump caused this insurrection with his lies and conspiracy theories about the election process being rigged against him. It was not stolen, but this madness was fomented by the President and his top advisers over the past several months. His attorney Rudy Giuliani, at a rally on Wednesday, called for ""trial by combat"" to a roaring crowd.

Scott Jennings

Let me be clear: These rioters are not Republicans. These are not conservatives. These are not patriots bursting into the US Capitol, accosting police officers and destroying public property.

These are domestic terrorists, and they ought to be treated like any other terrorist uprising with the full force and fury of the US government. Trump's video calling out these terrorists -- which he released on Twitter -- was a complete failure of leadership, a half-hearted and wholly inadequate attempt to stop these individuals.

Republican Sens. Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley and their group of objectors should withdraw their objections to the election results immediately. We are beyond lectures about Rutherford Hayes and Samuel Tilden and their great White House compromise. We are now going to decide whether this country is capable of self-government, or whether we are going to perpetually devolve into two tribes unwilling to accept the results of election, the pillar of democratic self-governance.

Rodney Robinson, a Virginia social studies teacher, was named the 2019 National Teacher of the Year, praised for creating a “positive school culture” and teaching his students to be “civically minded.”

By the end of 2020, Robinson was advocating for violence against Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader.

""Who are Mitch McConnell’s neighbors? I’m just saying Rand Paul’s neighbor did what a true Kentucky hero should do. It’s your turn to step up,” Robinson tweeted on New Year’s Eve. Sen. Paul was attacked by his neighbor in 2017, breaking several ribs and having part of his lung removed.

Days later Robinson got his wish when vandals spray-painted McConnell’s house. Although the “teacher of the year” desired a more violent encounter, the vandals nonetheless left their mark by demanding in huge red letters: “Weres [sic] my money?”

Robinson and the linguistically challenged vandals are mad that $2,000 checks aren’t going out from the federal government to millions of Americans who just received $600 checks. Never mind that many of the checks would have landed in the accounts of “perfectly comfortable families” making upward of $350,000 per year, according to the Washington Post.

Even the Post’s liberal editorial board begged for this idea to be stopped. And one man — apparently the last adult left in Washington — stepped in to scold the children and save them from their worst impulses: Mitch McConnell.

In this case, the children include the president of the United States, the speaker of the House, the Democratic leader of the Senate, a socialist senator from Vermont, and a handful of Republicans who couldn't care less about the money but are desperate to earn a pat on the head from Donald Trump, who started the $2,000 craze via Twitter and then headed off to the golf course.

Why $2,000? Why not $4,000? Or $8,000. Or how about $50,000. Or 1 million! Nobody knows where the number came from, but it is round and sounds like a lot. Even Paul, normally a staunch Trump ally, said of Trump’s $464 billion idea: “It's a really foolish, eggheaded, left-wing, socialist idea to pass out free money to people. So I part ways with the president.""

McConnell has given Trump a lot of leash over four years, always shepherding the president’s agenda to the Senate floor. And in this case, McConnell filed a bill containing all three of the president’s desires — the $2,000 checks, a repeal of a law that protects social media companies from lawsuits and an election fraud commission.

But the Democrats, who of their own free will made Trump their lead negotiator in this madness, would not go for it. It’s unclear why not, as it would’ve immediately delivered the checks, scraped the most damaging conspiracy garbage from the internet, and provided another vehicle to prove that the 2020 election was not, in fact, stolen. President-elect Joe Biden, after all, supports both the checks and a repeal of the tech company protections, so why didn’t his party call McConnell’s hand?

I am starting to get the idea that maybe — just maybe — congressional Democrats care more about manufacturing campaign issues than taking yes for an answer.

Even as McConnell was putting out that fire, he was fixing another of the president’s lame-duck mistakes by leading an override of Trump’s veto of the annual defense bill, the first override of Trump’s term. McConnell had protected Trump from two overrides in 2019, but this one was indefensible.

Interestingly, while Trump argued for $2,000 checks to be indiscriminately fired from Washington’s money cannon, he vetoed boosting the average junior enlisted soldier’s salary by $860 per year.

McConnell faces one final act of childlike nonsense this week, as a handful of Senate Republicans will join dozens of House Republicans to vote against congressional acceptance of the Electoral College.

Trump’s Lost Boys in this fantasy are Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri and Ted Cruz of Texas, both likely to seek the presidency in 2024 if Trump does not. Cruz’s fealty to Trump on the issue of election fraud is amusing since Trump accused Cruz of engaging in fraud to win the 2016 GOP Iowa Caucus.

McConnell warned his conference from engaging in these tantrums of magical thinking. And he has largely prevailed, as the vast majority of Republican senators (and several constitutionally minded congressmen, including Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky) will stick with McConnell on the matter, thank goodness. Republicans who join this effort are handing Democrats the single best argument ever made for abolishing the Electoral College, which is the only reason Trump was elected in the first place.

The conspiracy theories in play here are dangerous, with some calling for Vice President Mike Pence’s arrest and execution for treason if he fails to singlehandedly award the presidency to Trump. Yet, despite the threat on his life, Pence, himself a presidential aspirant, has endorsed the Cruz/Hawley plan. Has the litmus test to become the next presidential nominee for the conservative party become whether you believe the federal government should be powerful enough to override the results of a presidential election?

And will any of these folks have second thoughts after Trump’s phone call to Georgia’s secretary of state, wherein he outright (and perhaps illegally) pressured him to “recalculate” the results of the election and to “find” votes in the president’s favor? If it weren’t already January 2021, Trump would likely be facing his second Rudy Giuliani-induced impeachment over a galactically stupid and immoral phone call.

Most children eventually learn that contests have winners and losers. And, at least this time, there’s an adult around to remind them of that simple fact, and to keep Washington from losing its collective mind.

“Well, first of all, I am going to treat him a hell of a lot better than Chuck Schumer ever treated Donald Trump.”

My chat with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell came last week, shortly after he eulogized the Trump Administration and acknowledged Joe Biden as president-elect. His speech on the Senate floor was a crisp packaging of Trump’s successes and a nod to the cranking of America’s democratic gears.

“The Electoral College has spoken,” McConnell said.

With Trump leaving The White House in January, the question on many minds is how McConnell’s and Biden’s relationship will impact policymaking. In McConnell’s estimation, relations between the two parties and two branches of government are bound to be better from the start because the Kentucky Republican does not intend to “bring the administration to its knees” the way Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer did when Trump took over.

Just days after Trump’s inaugural, Schumer, bowing to the wishes of the #resistance mob swarming his Twitter account and his home, sent a loud and clear message to the new president: There will be no peace, no cooperation, and no comity between the legislative and executive branches. Schumer even voted against Elaine Chao, McConnell’s wife, for Transportation Secretary, despite her being the most qualified choice for Trump’s cabinet.

In Washington, personnel is policy. And Schumer’s intentions were clear: If we can’t beat Trump at the ballot box, we’ll do everything we can to cripple his ability to make policy.

The decision by Schumer to lead a filibuster blockade against Trump’s cabinet and sub-cabinet nominees (people you’ve never heard of but who nonetheless had important jobs to do), plunged Washington into partisan dysfunction. Although it was Trump who ran to blow up Washington’s traditions and norms, Schumer beat him to it. During Trump’s first two years, his nominees faced five times more cloture votes than did the six previous presidents in their first two years, combined.

Jennings:The biggest political fight is happening right now: Beshear vs. Fauci (and everyone else)

On 128 occasions, Schumer led filibusters against Trump appointees, forcing McConnell to file cloture (the Senate procedure for breaking a filibuster and moving forward with a vote) just to get Trump’s people confirmed. This left government positions unfilled for months and ate up days and days of valuable floor time clearing procedural hurdles instead of debating policy.

Schumer’s liberal use of the filibuster against non-controversial appointees had never been done in the history of the Senate and destroyed any pretense that Democrats wanted to find areas of agreement with Republicans.

“Not allowing the administration to take over the government is the wrong thing to do,” Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri said in 2017. “It is unacceptable. It’s outrageous. Something has to change.”

It seems that Blunt — and many other senators who detested Schumer’s attitude — might get their wish.

“They (Biden’s nominees) aren’t all going to pass on a voice vote, and they aren’t all going to make it, but I will put them on the floor,” McConnell said. Two Biden nominees who face a tough road are Neera Tanden, a hyper-partisan Democratic operative (with detractors on the right and left) nominated for director of the White House Office of Management and Budget; and Xavier Becerra, nominated for secretary of Health and Human Services with an extremist, pro-abortion record that most Senate GOP’ers can’t stomach.

Aside from personnel, McConnell said he interpreted the election results as a message from Americans for the two parties to operate “between the 40-yard lines.” He anticipated that the two parties could find common ground on infrastructure spending, although “we still have to figure out how to pay for it.

“I think the American people expect us to look for areas of agreement in a divided system while setting aside for debate the things we don’t agree on,” McConnell said, a mantra he employed during the recent COVID relief negotiations. McConnell’s position finally prevailed in the year-end package, after months of damaging, partisan intransigence from Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

McConnell described his relationship with Biden as a “friendship,” and noted that he was the only Senate Republican to attend Beau Biden’s funeral. This will be the first time in McConnell’s career that he has known a new president for as long and as well as he has known Biden.

Joe Gerth:My thoughts on McConnell finally acknowledging that Trump's a loser

During the Obama years, it was often McConnell and Biden who forged agreements that staved off some crisis. Both men are fiercely partisan, but neither view their political duties as incompatible with their official responsibilities. Biden will fight for Democrats and McConnell for Republicans, just as they always have. And no one should expect Senate Republicans to begin rubber-stamping Pelosi-written legislation anytime soon.

But both are pros, two veteran Washington knights who know how to raise their visors in friendship from across the battlefield and mean it. And both know how to make deals. Maybe — just maybe — the American people will get a calmer, more functional Washington because of it.

Contributing Columnist

You might’ve thought that since November's election has come and gone, we can cool it with the political fights for a while.

But you’d be wrong.

The biggest and most consequential political fight is happening right now: Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear vs. Dr. Anthony Fauci, over whether schools should be open during the coronavirus pandemic. Our children’s futures are at stake, and Beshear has sided with his campaign supporters instead of the nation’s leading infectious disease scientists.

Follow the science? More like follow the money, at least when it comes to Beshear’s decisions made at the behest of a union that supported him with massive contributions. Teachers’ union bosses want the schools closed, so they are.

Beshear is fond of lecturing his constituents, often saying, “We must listen to the science.” It’s what Democrats like Beshear say to end the debate about pandemic policies; anyone who disagrees with their decisions is labeled as anti-science or accused of trying to kill their fellow man.

On the same day that Dr. Fauci said “the default position should be... to keep the children in school,” and that virus spread “among children and from children is not really big at all,” Beshear was telling Kentucky parents “don’t try to find an exception” to his edicts, which have closed all public and private schools.

Which made me wonder: does Beshear think Dr. Fauci is anti-science? Does he think Fauci is trying to kill people?

But it’s not just Fauci. Dr. Robert Redfield, the Director of the Centers for Disease Control, says that a school is one of the safest places for a kid to be. He’s been raising alarm bells for months about the “significant public health consequences” of school closures.

Amid Beshear’s war on in-person learning, Dr. Redfield last week reiterated his view that schools aren’t significant spreaders of the virus, telling a public forum: “I just think it's healthy for these kids to be in school…the data clearly shows us that you can operate these schools in face-to-face learning in a safe and responsible way.”

There’s little doubt that we are in for rough winter with this virus. But schools are not part of the problem and the downsides of closing them are beyond real.

Democrats like Beshear have been playing pandemic politics all along. Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York called the arrival of the vaccine “bad news” and even said he might institute his own vaccine review board, apart from the federal government’s.

COVID Watch:Who should get a vaccine? This doctor plans to get one as soon as he can

Just how many people does Cuomo intend to kill by stalling or poo-pooing vaccines in New York? Will it be more or less than the number who died when he sent coronavirus-infected nursing home patients back into long-term care facilities?

It’s the rise of the anti-science Democrat governors!

Beshear and Cuomo aren’t the only Democrats ignoring science. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who visited a hair salon in violation of lockdown rules earlier this year, is Beshear’s spirit animal when it comes to school closures. She told CNN that ""going back to school presents the biggest risk for the spread of coronavirus"" and that it was ""malfeasance and a dereliction of duty"" to say that schools need to be open.

Beshear and Pelosi could not be more wrong, and everyone knows it. It is clear who suffers most in the school closure fiasco, and it isn’t rich families with names like Beshear and Pelosi.

“Broadly speaking, children with poorer parents suffer more,” concluded a study by the National Bureau of Economic Research. “First, even without any parental adjustments in investments, children from lower-income households suffer more from the school closures, since for them a larger part of educational investment comes from the government. Second, as a reaction to the school closures, rich parents increase their investment into children by more than poor parents,” said the researchers.

Dr. Danielle Dooley, of the Children’s National Hospital, laid bare the immediate consequences to NPR: mental health problems, hunger, obesity, and the risk of child abuse.

""Going to school is really vital for children. For many, they get their meals in school, their physical activity, their health care, their education, of course,” she said. And this weekend, the Associated Press reported emergency rooms were seeing massive numbers of children and teenagers in need of psychiatric care.

“With schools closed, routines disrupted and parents anxious over lost income or uncertain futures, children are shouldering new burdens many are unequipped to bear,” the AP reported.

Beshear leads a poor state, where income inequality, health, and education are pervasive problems. The gap on all these fronts will only grow between rich and poor thanks to Beshear’s school lockdowns, and all because he’d rather please a political donor than “listen to the science.”

74,Jennings,Scott,news,"“How can we possibly tell millions of Americans who registered to vote, who came to the polls in record numbers ... to simply get over it and move on?"" said the congresswoman, unwilling to accept the results of November’s election.

The year was 2005, and Democrats were on the floor of the U.S. House trying to stop the Electoral College from selecting George W. Bush as president. The congresswoman, Stephanie Tubbs Jones of Ohio, argued that ""numerous, serious election irregularities"" in Ohio, caused ""significant disenfranchisement of voters."" Remember the crazy Diebold voting machine conspiracy theory?

Democrats had previously tried to stymie the Electoral College in 2001, after Bush narrowly defeated Al Gore.

''There is overwhelming evidence that George W. Bush did not win … the Florida popular vote,'' said Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson, a Texas Democrat. She said, according to the New York Times, that Bush should be ''on notice that without justice there will be no peace.''

In 2017, after Donald Trump’s shocking victory, Democrats again waged a congressional floor fight to stop certification of the Electoral College.

“I object because people are horrified by the overwhelming evidence of Russian interference in our election,” said Rep. Barbara Lee of California, as she and others attempted to toss the electors from Alabama, Florida, Michigan, Texas, Mississippi and the Carolinas.

President Donald Trump isn't ready to concede the election.

Plenty of Democrats haven’t accepted the legitimacy of a Republican president since 1988! So spare me the whining about Donald Trump destroying democracy on his way out the door.

The Trump chapter is over

Nonetheless, it is clear: President Trump has lost the 2020 election. Yes, there are fishy things that deserve full investigation, like: how did at least two counties in Georgia forget to count several thousand votes?

But for Trump, this chapter is over. And that’s OK. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. And, with apologies to fictional minor league catcher Crash Davis, sometimes it rains. Trump’s reelection, in fact, was washed away by the nation’s white-collar suburbanites, who had seen enough — enough tweets, enough insults, enough coronavirus press conferences. They aren’t allowed to act like that at their offices, they thought, and don’t think the president should, either.

Story continues

It was an incredibly close election, though. Trump turned out a massive group on Election Day, as non-urban dwellers stuck by their guy and brought friends to the polls. Trump defied expectations and once again deployed a special sauce that blinds pollsters to millions of people who have had it with the coastal elites and the media.

It's not a 'Trump vaccine': I took the COVID vaccine to show anti-vaxxers that science works

But what to do now if you are Trump? Pretty simple — have yourself the fastest political bounce back of all time. The stars have aligned for Trump to exit on a high note and well-position him for 2024 should he again seek the presidency.

The most recent jobs report (which didn’t get much notice) was excellent, showing a full point drop in the unemployment rate to 6.9% as job creation outpaced expectations. Trump truly built a resilient economy, even as the virus rages.

And then came news of the major leap forward in vaccine development, with two companies showing their drugs to be 95% effective. Trump’s leadership and bold congressional action have us on the cusp of the fastest vaccine in human history. It normally takes many years to do this, and Trump delivered in just a few months.

Focus on COVID-19

But as usual, Trump’s triumphs are overshadowed by the worst parts of his personality. Failing to concede the election and tweeting out crazy conspiracy theories relegated his good news to the back burner. Biden, who ran his campaign claiming to have a foolproof plan to control the virus, now says he doesn’t have enough information “to begin planning,” according to NBC News, a story made possible by Trump’s refusal to allow for a normal transition.

Biden’s duplicitousness aside, beating the virus is too important to mess around with. Trump should help Biden's transition and cement the delivery of a vaccine as the 45th president’s greatest achievement. And while he’s at it, Trump should work with his congressional allies to fund the government, pass the defense authorization bill and perhaps strike a deal on the next COVID-19 relief package.

2020 election: Republicans as a multicultural working class party? That's Trump-level delusional thinking.

That would be a heck of a December for Trump and set him up for the ultimate political revenge in January — helping Republicans win both Senate seats in Georgia. Delivering comeuppance to Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, the two people most responsible for pushing the narrative of Trump’s illegitimacy, would be sweet, indeed.

It is folly for Trump or his lead attorney, Rudy Giuliani, to challenge the Electoral College the way crazy Democrats have done for two decades. Don’t stoop to their level, guys. Accept the results, score as many points as you can on the way out the door and prepare to make a dramatic comeback in 2024, if you are so inclined.

78,Jennings,Scott,latimes,"In this time of high political drama, we’ve asked Republican political strategist Scott Jennings and L.A. Times columnist Robin Abcarian to have a weekly discussion of how things are unfolding.

ABCARIAN: Well, Scott, it appears that our four-year national nightmare is over. Joe Biden will be sworn into office as our 46th president on Jan. 20, and Kamala Harris will take her place in history as our first female vice president, and the first person of color to hold the office. For the moment, I’m trying to savor the victory rather than dwelling on the unexpected closeness of the race or the reckless assaults on our democracy unleashed by Trump’s inability to lose with grace. I’m breathing a sigh of relief that we can now get back to some sense of political and scientific normalcy. This country is in the middle of a public health crisis that is worsening each day, and we desperately need a leader who can pull us together to fight it. I don’t think there’s any question whether Trump will go; he doesn’t have a choice. But I do worry about how much damage he might do on the way out. Scott?

But I take Andrew Yang’s point that Democrats have to work harder to win back this group, which has been battered by economic forces beyond its control. Moving beyond the presidential ticket, I’d have to guess that Mitch McConnell, who comfortably won reelection in your state of Kentucky, is the happiest man in Congress right now. It looks likely he’ll maintain his powerful role as majority leader, and he won’t have to deal with Trump’s craziness anymore. I saw an Axios report that McConnell is already planning to nix Biden cabinet picks he deems too progressive. The good news is, even with McConnell obstructing Biden at every turn, our new president will have plenty of opportunities to undo the damage wrought by Trump and his enablers. He can return the U.S. to the Paris climate accords. He can reverse Trump’s draconian immigration policies. He can populate the federal government with smart, capable people. I’m feeling pretty good about the next few years, Scott. You?

JENNINGS: Draconian immigration policies? Are you hoping Biden returns to the mass deportation days of the Obama years? I feel fine — happy, actually — because we had massive turnout, America’s democratic institutions proved very durable (despite apocalyptic predictions to the contrary), and Republicans did perfectly fine down the ballot. I agree it seems likely Republicans will keep the Senate, but Mitch McConnell will wield significant power no matter how Georgia’s Senate runoff elections turn out. This is a good thing for America because it makes it virtually impossible that Democrats can eliminate the legislative filibuster in the Senate, the last mechanism in Washington enforcing the clear voter demand for bipartisan governance. A lot of folks on TV are saying we are more divided than ever, but I disagree. I think we are united in a desire that neither party wield too much power. Biden won, yet Republicans picked up seats in the U.S. House and will likely hold the Senate. Republicans didn’t lose a single state house fight, either. Makes me think that a center-right governing philosophy is just fine with Americans as long as the messenger isn’t offensive. Do you think Speaker Pelosi will be chastened by losing seats and finally accept some compromise with her colleagues in the Senate, or do you think she’ll continue to be hostage to her more progressive members?

ABCARIAN: Actually, Scott, I wasn’t referring to deportations. I was referring to the inhumane policy of ripping children from their parents at the border. It hurts me to think of the 545 children who have yet to be reunited with their parents. I’m talking, too, about restoring policies to allow people to remain in the U.S. while their asylum applications are pending, rather than forcing them to wait in Mexico. As someone who lives in a border state, I desperately hope to see an end to any expansion of Trump’s disgusting wall. As for Nancy Pelosi, she’s still in control of the House. I hardly would describe her as “hostage” to her progressive members. She’s occasionally been dismissive of “the squad” when she feels they’ve overstepped, but they’re on the same side. Pelosi is an adept negotiator, leader and cat-herder. She never takes her eye off the ball. Also, I always got a kick out of how she flummoxed Trump. I think we’re all a little beaten down by the drama of a Trump presidency. Do you think we’ll see a change of tone in our political discourse once Trump is gone, if he ever goes?

JENNINGS: I think American institutions have been extremely durable throughout this presidency, despite fears to the contrary, and they will remain strong in this period of transition. We are going to count the votes, courts are going to adjudicate any valid claims, and then when all that is done the electoral college will meet and choose the president-elect. Ultimately, it is hard to do too much damage when an entire process is working just as it was designed to work, even if it takes a few days. I suspect Republicans will support the president’s desires for legal relief until it is clear that all valid claims and avenues have been exhausted.

Opinion contributor

We gather to bury a familiar trope, an old chestnut that hung around for years but finally succumbed to the facts last Tuesday night. It never should have lasted this long, frankly, but was artificially kept alive by the witch doctors who know how to do such things.

The myth of Mitch McConnell’s unpopularity is finally dead, buried by the Senate majority leader’s crushing 20-point victory over Amy McGrath. And replacing that urban legend is simply the truth: McConnell is, in fact, the most popular Kentucky politician in modern history.

Kentucky’s longest-serving senator has now been elected seven times by his people. He has won 56% of the 9.983 million votes cast in his races, versus just 43% for his Democratic opponents.

More:Mitch McConnell not critical of Trump's election fraud claims

In this year’s race, McConnell won every region of the state outside Louisville, according to a CNN exit poll with 1,657 respondents. The survey had other nuggets: He won the suburbs and rural areas. He carried 18- to 24-year-olds and senior citizens. He carried 90% of Republicans and nearly half of independents. He won 15% of Black voters, far higher than your typical Republican. He won people who make more than $100,000, and people who make less than that. He won 56% of men and 59% of women.

You read that right: McConnell's win was greater with women than it was with men, running against a female opponent. He won female voters in 2014, too.

People like voting for McConnell. Yet every six years we enter a familiar echo chamber of lies about how everyone hates him, propped up by shoddy polls underpinning the dumbest liberal wishcasting imaginable.

“McConnell has been unpopular in his home state for years, but his approval rating plunged in one poll to a rock-bottom 18 percent — with a re-election campaign looming in 2020,” reported some intrepid Rolling Stone reporter last year.

FACT CHECK:We analyzed President Trump's speech about the election. Here's what we found.

Much of this urban legend was created by my friend and fellow columnist Al Cross, who has been blazing this dead-end trail for years. He has frequently attributed McConnell’s electoral wins to money, the political environment or weak opponents. In other words, anything but the truth: that McConnell’s politics and positions are in line with most voters in Kentucky.

“The Reagan coat-tails apparently carried in Mitch McConnell…” The Courier Journal editorial board wrote on these pages in 1984, after McConnell won his first race over Walter “Dee” Huddleston.

Cross called Harvey Sloane, McConnell’s 1990 opponent, a “weak challenger” from a “divided opposition party.” He called McConnell’s strategy that year “Big Mean” and “Big Green.”

After McConnell’s impressive win in 1996, a double-digit victory despite Bill Clinton carrying the state for Democrats, Cross said McConnell “ran a hard-hitting, saturation TV campaign” against Steve Beshear, who “had to spend so much time raising money that he was not able to spend enough time on personal campaigning.” As if shaking a few more hands would’ve erased a 13-point deficit. Please.

How, I wonder, will Cross and his media cohorts explain this year’s election?

McGrath’s campaign raised nearly $88 million through Oct. 14, a number sure to climb higher when more paperwork is filed. And that doesn’t count the tens of millions McGrath’s super PAC allies spent aiding both her campaign and that of the Libertarian candidate. Amy McGrath Inc. raised enough money to fund two statewide campaigns, and both failed spectacularly. She campaigned aggressively across the state, flying herself from town to town and scoring an impressive amount of media attention.

McConnell, on the other hand, has raised $57 million, a $31 million deficit. It must have been a strange sensation for him to be massively outspent, but McConnell stunningly won 117 of 120 counties en route to scoring the second-highest vote share of his career.

Cross is hardly alone in propagating the McConnell myth. Sports and politics commentator Matt Jones, a frequent sparring partner of mine on the lecture circuit, wrote in his book “Mitch, Please!” that, “If you are a rational human being with some degree of care for your fellow man then you have to dislike Mitch McConnell and everything he represents.”

The book was released in March, just a few months before McConnell would score 58% of the vote. Has there ever been a more out-of-touch statement about the nature of Kentucky’s electorate? To avoid stating the obvious about McConnell’s popularity, Jones slandered nearly 60% of Kentuckians as irrational lunatics who hate their neighbors.

For subscribers:Hospitals facing surge in COVID-19 cases as beds fill, health care workers get virus

National outlets like The New York Times lap up Cross' and Jones' horrifically inaccurate punditry because the people who work and live in blue bubbles want to believe in this tired yarn, even as the cold, hard facts stare them in the face. McConnell is an effective conservative, so we hate him and everyone in Kentucky must hate him, too.

But none of these geniuses ever stop to ask themselves: Could we be wrong? By what metric are we making that judgment? The man wins elections at home and in his Senate conference, has personally overseen his state party’s ascendance to crushing dominance, and is the most consequential Senate majority leader since Lyndon B. Johnson. For the next three decades, we’ll be referring to the Supreme Court as “McConnell’s Court,” for goodness sakes.

Accept the truth, guys: Kentuckians love McConnell and reward his conservative positions, stature, record and calm disposition (a frequent target of scorn by the dumb pundits) with their votes. He’s not a backslapper, but he gets stuff done, keeps his wits about him, and has firmly planted Kentucky at the center of the political universe.

McConnell never gets a pass in his campaigns, always facing well-heeled candidates with strong political or professional credentials. And since his 2008 race, the national Democratic Party has thrown everything at him but the kitchen sink. Yet he stands victorious once again, a capstone victory akin to Ted Williams, perhaps the greatest hitter who ever lived, smashing a homerun in his last at-bat.

As the Senate majority leader said to me the other day: “Not too bad for a guy who’s so unpopular!”

82,Jennings,Scott,msn,"The case for President Donald Trump is simple: He made the economy work for so many Americans, kept us out of new and costly wars and even brokered peace deals in the Middle East.

© Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images US President Donald Trump speaks at a ""Make America Great Again"" rally at Raymond James Stadium's parking lot on October 29, 2020, in Tampa, Florida.

He believes our taxes should be lower, not higher -- and signed into law sweeping tax relief for businesses and the vast majority of federal income tax filers. He thinks government shouldn't overregulate, rolling back numerous Obama-era overreaches, while working with his Republican allies in Congress.

Load Error

And despite his relative dovishness, he has invested in our military and in the men and women who wear the uniform. As a result, our enemies know we are more than capable of finishing them. Just ask the former leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi or former Iranian General Qasem Soleimani.

Beyond that, Trump stands up against the worst impulses of the American left and the radicals who seek to banish from the public square those who dare to think differently. Heck, even the Girl Scouts deleted a tweet congratulating Amy Coney Barrett on her elevation to the Supreme Court because of pressure from the liberal Twitter mob. Is that the kind of American we want, where unhinged progressives can shut down even a simple tweet of congrats to an accomplished female judge?

Whatever problems I have with him -- and there are more than a few -- Trump's willingness to stand up to this kind of mob impresses the hell out of me. Standing by Justice Brett Kavanaugh during a tough confirmation fight, for instance, was a particularly proud moment.

Trump is not a perfect person. His personal history, and the way he speaks to and about people can be atrocious. But Trump did become the first sitting president to attend the March for Life Rally this year, where he voiced his unwavering support for ""unborn children,"" who he said ""never had a stronger defender in the White House."" Whether his views on abortion are pure or transactional, I care not. He stands up for the unborn who can't stand up for themselves -- and has appointed judges, like Barrett, who will hopefully do the same.

Elections are choices. Pro-life or pro-choice. Higher taxes or lower taxes. Support free speech or coddle censorship. No politician ever satisfies me fully, but Trump comes far closer than Joe Biden ever could.

There's room for Trump to improve, but in no way does Biden represent a step in a policy direction that I can support as a conservative. He fails the test on virtually every issue I care about, and I expect the United States would move radically left on his watch, especially on abortion.

And for all of the President's missteps, including his rhetorical failures in dealing with coronavirus, this vote is about the next four years. We will likely have a vaccine soon (and in large part thanks to Trump's leadership on Operation Warp Speed), and we will defeat this virus no matter who wins.

So, who can lead us through that day and beyond, restoring the American economy and stopping the radicals from tearing up the American political institutions they find inconvenient?

Donald J. Trump.

There's room for Trump to improve, but in no way does Biden represent a step in a policy direction that I can support as a conservative. He fails the test on virtually every issue I care about, and I expect the United States would move radically left on his watch, especially on abortion.

And for all of the President's missteps, including his rhetorical failures in dealing with coronavirus, this vote is about the next four years. We will likely have a vaccine soon (and in large part thanks to Trump's leadership on Operation Warp Speed ), and we will defeat this virus no matter who wins.

So, who can lead us through that day and beyond, restoring the American economy and stopping the radicals from tearing up the American political institutions they find inconvenient?

Amy McGrath, the Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate in Kentucky, is closing her campaign with a peculiar message about America and the people who live here:

“We are a stalled democracy. Right now I’d say that we are an embarrassment.” That’s quite a message in a state that will award Trump upwards of 60% of the vote.

McGrath has been on quite a journey in the Trump era. In 2017, she described her feelings after Trump’s win:

“The only feeling I can describe that’s any close to it was the feeling I had after 9/11. What just happened? Where are we going from here?' It was that just sinking feeling of sadness, and I didn’t know what to do.”

But then she lost a congressional race in 2018 and changed her tune on Trump as she launched a bid against Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader.

“Kentucky makeover: Amy McGrath challenges Mitch McConnell as a pro-Trump Democrat,” blared the headline in The Courier Journal.

'You know that we need change':Amy McGrath appeals to voters a week before election

During her congressional campaign in 2018, McGrath said she opposed Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court. When her Senate campaign launched, however, she said she supported him, ostensibly to bolster her pro-Trump bona fides. But she abandoned the position almost immediately after everyone made fun of her and the liberals in her party melted down.

McGrath’s pro-Trump gymnastics nearly cost her the Democratic nomination for Senate. Charles Booker, an authentic progressive, made a late surge but came up just short, succumbing to McGrath’s crushing financial advantage.

And today, we are back where McGrath started — that America, under Trump, is an “embarrassment.” It’s a perfectly valid political opinion, it just isn’t shared by most of the people McGrath seeks to represent in the U.S. Senate.

About the worst political scandal you can stumble into these days is one of authenticity. If voters get the idea you are saying things because a consultant told you to instead of what’s truly in your heart, they will punish you.

And it seems McGrath will be punished for her phoniness on Tuesday, as public polls indicate McConnell will win a record seventh term. There’s no mystery in why McConnell wins races. His conservative views better reflect those of most Kentuckians, and his authenticity and honesty are beyond question.

McConnell tells you exactly what he is going to do, and then he does it. His has been the most responsible Republican voice on dealing with the coronavirus, and it is indisputable that Kentucky “punches above its weight” in the U.S. Senate, his rather non-ideological closing argument.

McGrath’s view that America is an “embarrassment” would come as news to the revolutionaries who wrote the Declaration of Independence and Constitution, the soldiers who stormed the beaches at Normandy, the astronauts who stood on the moon and the doctors who cured polio and other terrible diseases.

And she fundamentally misunderstands the greatness of our country, which flows from the durability of our values and our republic’s institutions, not from individual politicians. We have elections every two years. The same party doesn’t win every time. To throw a fit like McGrath’s is fundamentally unserious.

And no matter which side you are on, you should rejoice in the act of an election itself more than in who wins or loses. If Donald Trump wins a second term, will McGrath consider it to be a third 9/11?

For the Trump supporters out there, you cannot treat a potential loss like the end of days, either. The president appears headed for defeat, if the polls are correct, and Republicans must prepare for this likely disappointment.

MoonPie politics:Why McConnell has the respect and support of rural Kentucky

The most patriotic thing an American can do is accept the results. That means embracing the greatness of a political system that allows us to choose our leaders, speak our minds and do it all again in two years.

It means rejoicing in the high voter turnout that’s clearly happening nationwide.

Acceptance is the key virtue that has made America governable for so long.

This is something Democrats never did following Trump’s 2016 win. If we are a “stalled democracy,” as McGrath said, it is because Trump never had a loyal opposition. He was hounded every day of presidency, treated as illegitimate, and even ridiculously impeached.

Trump hasn’t covered himself in glory every day, mind you, but to pretend that Democrats have acted responsibly is pure poppycock. The liberal party has been one rolling tantrum for four years, an actual “embarrassment,” if McGrath cares to find one.

But no matter. It can all end and reset on Tuesday.

Acceptance. That’s what America needs more than anything.

85,Jennings,Scott,hotair,"Beyond that, Trump stands up against the worst impulses of the American left and the radicals who seek to banish from the public square those who dare to think differently. Heck, even the Girl Scouts deleted a tweet congratulating Amy Coney Barrett on her elevation to the Supreme Court because of pressure from the liberal Twitter mob. Is that the kind of American we want, where unhinged progressives can shut down even a simple tweet of congrats to an accomplished female judge?

Whatever problems I have with him — and there are more than a few — Trump’s willingness to stand up to this kind of mob impresses the hell out of me. Standing by Justice Brett Kavanaugh during a tough confirmation fight, for instance, was a particularly proud moment.

Trump is not a perfect person. His personal history, and the way he speaks to and about people can be atrocious. But Trump did become the first sitting president to attend the March for Life Rally this year, where he voiced his unwavering support for “unborn children,” who he said “never had a stronger defender in the White House.” Whether his views on abortion are pure or transactional, I care not. He stands up for the unborn who can’t stand up for themselves — and has appointed judges, like Barrett, who will hopefully do the same.

I was perusing the pages of The Washington Post and ran across a column by a professor at Johns Hopkins University about the political dustup over Hunter Biden’s laptop. It was a miracle I found this column, mind you, given the media and tech industry’s determination to stop us from learning about the Biden family’s business dealings.

Despite this unprecedented and outrageous modern-day book burning, I quickly realized why this column was allowed to exist. It contained the following sentence:

“We must treat the Hunter Biden leaks as if they were a foreign intelligence operation — even if they probably aren’t.”

Huh?

I’ve been wondering what to make of it. On the one hand, the laptop would confirm something we already knew: Joe Biden’s son was constantly trying to make money on his famous father’s back, and it raises questions about whether the former vice president knew or had a hand in it. And it was credible enough for presidential debate moderator Kristin Welker to bring up the other night.

On the other hand, it was produced by Rudy Giuliani, Donald Trump’s lawyer, who was recently duped by Borat.

More:Will we know who won Kentucky races on election night? Results to come faster than primary

It is no secret Hunter Biden followed the well-worn gilded path of many of Washington’s ne'er do well sons. He was paid $500,000 by MBNA as a “consultant” while his dad was voting for a bankruptcy law favored by the credit card companies. He was paid several million dollars by a Ukrainian gas company while his dad ran point on the Obama Administration’s Ukraine policy.

Hunter had five qualifications for these jobs: B-I-D-E-N.

Hunter later admitted to “poor judgment” in Ukraine. His dad apparently agreed, issuing a statement last year promising to never let this happen again should he return to the White House.

This is what the Bidens do. Dad serves in office, and Hunter makes money from it. The Senate Intelligence Committee released a report confirming numerous “questionable financial transactions between Hunter Biden and his associates and foreign individuals, including the wife of the former mayor of Moscow and individuals with ties to the Chinese Communist Party” but stopped short of alleging any criminal wrongdoing on the part of his father. The report, it should be noted, was written before the laptop surfaced.

I’ve never personally believed Joe Biden did anything illegal as it relates to Hunter’s dealings in Ukraine or China, but something need not be criminal for it to smell and therefore become part of a larger record for voters to consider. Which brings me back to the laptop and Democratic explanations for it.

“I think we need to be very, very clear that what [Trump is] doing here is amplifying Russian misinformation,"" stated Biden’s deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield, who has never let competence get in the way of confidence.

What?

House races to watch:GOP looks to add to supermajority, while Dems seek to flip suburbs

But the talking points have gone out. The Biden campaign claimed Russia had planted Hunter’s laptop. And all their minions fell in line. The New York Post, which broke this story initially, still can’t get into its Twitter account (it was locked because they tweeted a link to their own story, even though Twitter has backtracked on the reasons it censored the Post in the first place), but millions of people and high-ranking Biden officials (including the candidate himself) are allowed to claim — without evidence — Russia is responsible.

What is said to be contained on the laptop should be a matter of extreme journalistic and public concern; how can we confirm or dispute the information if we can’t even talk about it? Combine it with the statements of Tony Bobulinsky, a former Biden family business partner who claims to have had personal conversations with Joe Biden, and there’s clearly enough here to warrant public discussion.

And further, there’s good reason to believe Democrats aren’t credible on topics related to Russia, anyway.

On CBS’s 60 Minutes program this weekend, Joe Biden said — with a straight face — Russia was “the biggest threat to America.” His old boss, former President Barack Obama, and their media friends laughed Mitt Romney off a debate stage in 2012 for making the same statement. Does the 1980s still want its foreign policy back, Joe, or is that joke too hackneyed even for you?

Mitt was right in 2012. And Russia is even stronger now because it ran wild during the Obama/Biden second term. On their watch, Russia invaded Crimea, took advantage of Obama’s weakness in Syria, violated treaties with the U.S., and meddled in the 2016 election. Obama and Biden couldn’t have been weaker on Russia if they tried, and American foreign policy has paid the price.

One senior Obama administration official summed it up this way after the 2016 election: “I feel like we sort of choked.”

Related: Trumps says people can change their votes. But is that legal in Kentucky?

And now Democrats have returned to Russia because it fits the liberal narrative that Donald Trump wouldn’t exist as president without Putin’s help.

Hence our friend in the Washington Post: “We must treat the Hunter Biden leaks as if they were a foreign intelligence operation — even if they probably aren’t.”

For the Democrats, as it is on so many issues, the only thing that matters is narrative. Donald Trump won because of Russia, they say, and now, at the end of the 2020 race, Russia must be responsible for Hunter Biden’s “poor judgment.”

This isn’t true, but as it has been since 2012, the Democrats have treated Russia like a political punchline instead of a real adversary. An entire party put on a virtual reality helmet and completely committed to an alternate universe, even as it repeatedly stumbled into the living room furniture.

They say Trump is weak on Russia, but which party constantly does Putin’s bidding? I’ll give you a hint: It ain’t the Republicans. When it comes to the Bidens and today’s Democratic Party, the Russian misinformation call is coming from inside the house.

What happens if the unity candidate is actually leading a movement of anger and revenge-minded partisans?

Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee for president, often casts the presidential race as a “battle for the soul of the nation,” which sounds great to a generation of Americans who grew up thinking ""The West Wing"" television show was closer to reality than ""Veep.""

Biden thinks of himself as a modern-day Jed Bartlett, apparently, who can rise above today’s polarized politics and unite the country.

“Today, once again we are a house divided,” Biden said during a recent speech at Gettysburg. “But that, my friend, can no longer be. We are facing too many crises. We have too much work to do. We have too bright a future to leave it shipwrecked on the shoals of anger and hate and division.”

As soaring as this sentiment is, it in no way reflects the kind of politician Biden has been during his 50-year career, nor does it reflect the attitude of the people he leads.

Joe Biden in debate:'Cops aren't happy to see what happened to Breonna Taylor'

Biden is the same guy who once said that Mitt Romney, his and Barack Obama’s opponent in the 2012 election, would put Black Americans “back in chains,” and famously led the vicious “high tech lynching” against Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.

Joe Biden’s entire career has been marked by extreme partisanship and opportunistic policy changes on everything from abortion to fracking to the Green New Deal to you name it.

Biden changes his stripes more than a chameleon in a Skittles factory. And he’s doing it again by claiming the mantle of unity in this election. Today’s Biden is a made-for-media candidacy untested by interactions with his base.

If Biden did interact with his supporters, his message would come face-to-face with anger and hate. Biden won’t acknowledge it, but his campaign and that of his party’s Senate and congressional candidates are fueled (financially and otherwise) by an unhinged Trump resistance with little appetite for rapprochement.

“So, let us brace ourselves. The task is two-fold: the terrorist Trump must be defeated, must be destroyed, must be devoured at the ballot box, and then he, and his enablers, and his supporters, and his collaborators, and the Mike Lees and the William Barrs, and Sean Hannitys, and the Mike Pences, and the Rudy Gullianis and the Kyle Rittenhouses and the Amy Coney Barretts must be prosecuted and convicted and removed from our society while we try to rebuild it and to rebuild the world Trump has destroyed by turning it over to a virus,” said liberal mouthpiece Keith Olbermann, who wants to throw everyone on the other side of the ball in jail.

More Jennings:Cameron wrongly targeted in tragic Breonna Taylor case that leaves us feeling empty

This is the elevator speech of Biden’s actual base.

Biden lives in fear of people like Olbermann. I know this because, despite sitting on a rather large national lead, Biden and his running mate, Kamala Harris, repeatedly make fools of themselves by refusing to give a straightforward answer to the question of court packing, a horribly unpopular idea emanating from the radical left.

If Biden really believed himself to be a unity candidate, he’d prove it by telling the Olbermann’s of the world where they can stick it. Biden meekly said this week that he’s “not a big fan of” court packing, which is more than enough wiggle room to leave people wondering where he really stands.

The fact that Biden won’t put this norm-busting idea back in its Pandora’s Box tells us all we need to know about his campaign’s rickety facade — a pretty storefront hiding some angry customers inside. And at the Biden Store, the customer is always right.

Trump is not in a good place politically at the moment, although he looked healthy and energized at his Florida rally on the same day that Biden forgot Mitt Romney’s name, forgot what office he was running for, and confused Ted Kennedy with Robert Byrd.

And Trump has yet to meaningfully lay out a second-term agenda, even as his opponent leaves us wondering whether he will pursue the agenda of the democratic presidential primary or the general election, as Biden has changed a number of his positions this year.

Also:Trump's abrasive debate behavior may have worsened his relationship with female voters

But despite all of Trump’s problems and mistakes, I fear another four years less than a Biden “transitional” term, because it is painfully obvious that Biden lacks the vigor and self-confidence to stand up to the radicals in his party.

Like most Louisvillians, I've been sorting out my feelings on the Breonna Taylor case and coming up empty. Amid discussions of the law and police processes, my mind always returns to the gut-wrenching human tragedy: Someone is dead. A parent will forever grieve. Several lives are ruined. And trust is understandably eroded between the African American community and our police.

This case put several people in situations not of their choosing. Ms. Taylor and her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, did not know the police were coming that night. The Louisville police officers assigned to serve the warrant did not know Walker was in her apartment and didn’t expect to be fired upon.

Kentucky's Attorney General Daniel Cameron — a friend of mine for more than 10 years — could not have expected that prominent African Americans would use his race against him to try to influence the execution of his sworn duties. Because of this brutal spotlight, Cameron has suffered harassment at his home and undue attempts to influence his work from celebrities like Oprah, Beyonce, and Lebron James. And he has faced deeply personal and racist attacks.

Just look at Gov. Andy Beshear, who demanded — despite the sacrosanct nature of grand jury proceedings — that Cameron release all case material so he could review it and decide “the truth.” Did Beshear, just 37 himself when he was elected attorney general in 2015, ever face demands to release grand jury transcripts?

Another white liberal, Shannon Ragland, said in this newspaper that Cameron had “screwed up” the Taylor case and that he lacked the “expertise” to be a “great attorney general.” Ragland, mind you, is a disbarred former attorney and a convicted felon who stole money from his clients and was sentenced to 10 years in jail. Being a white liberal Twitter troll means never having to learn the word humility.

Cameron kept a difficult case instead of pawning it off, marshalled the experience of career prosecutors to ascertain the truth, and took it to the grand jury as Kentucky law requires. Despite that work, I feel empty because, as Cameron said, the law isn't meant to assuage every grief or sorrow.

Read this:Breonna Taylor grand jury recordings officially released. Here's what we know

But it does protect the two officers who shot Taylor, because they were returning fire in self-defense. It matters not whether they announced themselves, or whether Walker, who admitted to shooting his 9 mm pistol, believed they were cops or a romantic rival.

And it should protect Walker because he clearly believed his life was in danger when people burst through Taylor’s door at 12:43 a.m. Neither Walker nor the cops knew the other was coming, which isn't either of their faults. But it is someone's fault, and I pray that the Department of Justice figures it out during its ongoing civil rights investigation.

If someone bursts through my door in the middle of the night, prepare for more than one gunshot is all I can say. I hope Cameron's task force to review the procurement and service of search warrants refines, tightens and improves the process. A death like Taylor's should never happen again.

I want to make that point again: A death like Breonna Taylor’s should never happen again.

I agree with Cameron that anyone calling for revenge isn't calling for justice, although those words are being dangerously conflated in our society. The press conference held by the Taylor family and their attorneys on Sept. 25 veered onto this dangerous track and included racist attacks on Cameron.

“Daniel Cameron is no different than the sell-out Negroes that sold our people into slavery and helped white men to capture our people, to abuse them, and to traffic them while our women were raped, while our men were raped by savages,” activist Tamika Mallory said.

Mallory, outrageously calling Cameron a race traitor, is arguing for a criminal justice system based on the skin color of the prosecutor and the victim instead of on the facts, evidence or laws. This is a destructive attitude that will divide our community rather than unite it.

And to have Jacob Blake's father in the anti-Cameron press conference was troubling, as his son is credibly accused of sexually assaulting a Black woman at a time when our community is talking about how to better protect Black women from violent interactions. In no way is the Blake case analogous to Taylor’s, nor does Blake have any business in Louisville commenting on Cameron’s work.

Liberals and conservatives can — and should! — unite around a series of reforms that make everyone safer. But positive outcomes will be difficult to reach if the moment is hijacked by people pushing false narratives and extreme political agendas, like defund the police. And it will be lost if white conservatives can't see the tragedy of Taylor and Walker by imagining themselves — or their children — in their shoes.

If we do unite as a community, we can make lasting change that ensures we never stop saying the name: Breonna Taylor.

USA TODAY Editorial Board: Presidential debate didn't help Trump catch Biden, but horror show scared America

Trump’s theory was to come out and pummel his opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden, get under his skin, and then watch him dig deep holes from which he could not climb out. It’s not a theory without merit, as Biden had lost his temper on numerous occasions when challenged by voters and other candidates (remember him screaming at Elizabeth Warren?)

But Trump didn’t let the strategy breathe. His unrelenting interruptions never allowed Biden to dig those holes. Biden couldn’t do much of anything, in fact, as Trump was on him — at least for the first hour — like a hungry wolverine, scratching and clawing at the Democrat’s every syllable.

President Donald Trump debates Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden in Cleveland.

Beyond that, Trump made the classic incumbent president mistake: focusing too much on your accomplishments over the last four years and not enough on what you’d do in the next four.

Trump needs to offer a choice between his second-term agenda and Biden’s (especially on economic policies), and instead he kept himself and his abrasive style solely at the center of the election. A referendum, in other words, that plays into Biden’s hands.

Story continues

Sure, there will be Trump supporters who loved the performance. If you hate politicians and the media, you love it when Trump punches them collectively in the mouth. But Trump squandered what initially had the makings of a good debate by interrupting so much and making it so personal, according to a veteran political debate coach I consulted afterward.

Biden wouldn’t answer court packing questions, was dishonest about his health care plan and the Green New Deal (contradicted himself from one sentence to another), but Trump overplayed it by being such a bully on the stage. He crossed the line from being on offense to being offensive. Game over because Biden didn’t fall down dead, my friend said.

David Mastio and Jill Lawrence: Trump-Biden presidential debate in Cleveland: Once is enough. Please make it stop.

Trump’s performance wasn’t without flecks of smart messaging. He repeatedly brought up Biden’s 47 years in Washington in a legitimate way: Why didn’t you do something about these problems in the last half century? He had some good riffs on public safety and even on defending his coronavirus record, which has weighed him down in the polls as of late. And he did get in some licks on his economic chops versus what he described as slow growth while Biden was in office.

But overall, I was looking for moments that would speak to the people that Trump must recapture to win, chiefly, center-right suburban women and senior citizens, who don’t seem to hate Biden near as much as they hated Hillary Clinton. And I just didn’t find them. Trump spoke to Biden and moderator Chris Wallace more than he spoke to the American people and that’s not going to cut it.

Now it is true that Clinton was judged to have won all three debates over Trump in 2016, and that the media tends to overreact when Trump appears to have done something offensive. Historically, Trump being judged to have lost the first debate is on par with several previous incumbent presidents of both parties, some of whom won reelection (Obama, Bush 43, Reagan) and a couple who didn’t (Bush 41 and Carter).

We mustn’t forget that this electorate is largely ossified, and so the vast majority of viewers won’t budge an inch. Trump’s strongest supporters will love his smash-mouth brand of debating. Biden’s team will feel aggrieved (their most comfortable gear) and donate even more money than they already have. And those looking to learn something last night will feel empty, because there was little to learn that we didn’t already know.

We are bombarded daily with information about serious issues — the presidential campaign, the coronavirus, police interactions and the ensuing demonstrations and riots, to name a few.

But as these events unfold, unreliable narrators are popping up to confuse, mislead and distort the truth. Historically, we have been able to rely upon honest brokers of information to differentiate between facts and agendas. But those folks seem few and far between these days.

Let us start with attorney Benjamin Crump, who often appears on television in the aftermath of police-involved shootings. In case after case, Crump frequently issues statements that turn out to be false, often with serious consequences.

Last month in Louisville, following a meeting between Attorney General Daniel Cameron and the family of Breonna Taylor, Crump announced that “we do expect charges to be filed sooner rather than later” against the police officers involved in Taylor’s death. The problem: Crump was not in the meeting, and Cameron’s office said no promises were made beyond a thorough and fair investigation. Crump’s reckless language roiled a community already on edge about how the Taylor matter will be resolved.

Crump:All charges against peaceful protesters should be dropped

In the case of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin, Crump initially claimed his client was shot by police while breaking up a fight between two women. However, an investigation revealed that police were “attempting to arrest [Blake] for violating a restraining order stemming from an alleged sexual assault,” according to the New York Post. Serious riots have befallen Kenosha, and minority neighborhoods are among the hardest hit.

In 2014, Crump helped create the untrue “hands up, don’t shoot!” mantra following the shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. Protesters still chant the phrase today, even though Barack Obama’s Department of Justice found that version of events to be untrue.

But Crump is hardly alone in creating damaging, untruthful narratives. Sen. Kamala Harris of California, now running for vice president, said that she would not trust a COVID-19 vaccine if one emerges before the election.

She even predicted that scientists would be “muzzled… suppressed… sidelined,” a ludicrous assertion rebutted by the pharmaceutical companies and Food and Drug Administration officials involved.

Her running mate, Joe Biden, sensing the reckless and irresponsible mistake Harris had made, was forced to announce that he would take a vaccine “tomorrow” if one becomes available.

Read this:Louisville's chief health strategist and Trump offer different takes on vaccine timeline

Of course, when it comes to the pandemic, Trump’s administration, and the president himself, have sent mixed messages. Initially, Dr. Anthony Fauci and others told Americans not to wear masks. Then, as the guidance changed and masks became the principle way to stop the spread, President Trump was slow to embrace their use.

Now, he holds indoor campaign rallies where masks are not required. This inconsistency has unfortunately created a cultural and political divide on a basic virus mitigation strategy.

Both President Trump and public health experts have been maddeningly contradictory. Revelations from Bob Woodward’s new book indicate that the president was aware of the potency of the virus as early as January, long before its seriousness was relayed to the public. Meanwhile, the New York Times reported that “public health experts decried the anti-lockdown protests as dangerous gatherings in a pandemic. Health experts seem less comfortable doing so now that the marches are against racism.”

To some people, your health risk depends on your politics.

Everywhere we turn, unreliable narrators are undermining truthful public discourse. Biden, in a tried and untrue Democratic trope, earned “four Pinocchio’s” from the Washington Post for claiming Trump will destroy Social Security. Of course, Trump has his own wide collection of Pinocchio’s as well, often on statements that are easily disproven.

The Atlantic, a venerable news magazine, recently published an article fueled completely by unnamed sources claiming Trump made terrible statements about members of the U.S. armed forces and refused to visit a military cemetery in France because of concerns about his hair. Since the story published, more than 20 on-the-record, named sources have refuted the claims, even some who are decidedly unfriendly to Trump like former National Security Advisor John Bolton.

Earlier:In new book, John Bolton reportedly says Trump worried about 'son of a b**** Rand Paul'

Allegations this explosive deserve some on-the-record sourcing to be taken seriously, it seems to me.

Trump’s former lawyer, Michael Cohen, has a book selling like hotcakes on Amazon. A man who pleaded guilty to lying to Congress is now supposedly telling us “the truth” about his former boss. If you hate Trump, you will apparently believe anything and anyone, no matter their track record.

I could go on, but, now more than ever, we all have a responsibility to be vigilant in processing information. Words matter and have enormous consequences. People who should know better are becoming dishonest information brokers because of their personal political crusades, with Americans left sifting through the damage to our towns and public discourse.

(CNN) Donald Trump's town hall with ABC News did not go well, although I give him credit for agreeing to a road game in a hostile gym. The President had a few decent moments in Philadelphia Tuesday, but the event showed he is simply better in a pugilistic debate with an opponent than he is in addressing individual voters in a ""townhall"" format.

Scott Jennings

Not that the negative interactions were all his fault. This was billed as a conversation with ""uncommitted"" voters, which is, charitably, baloney. Most of the questions were hostile, and several of the questioners quite clearly have no intention whatsoever of voting for Trump.

It actually speaks to a larger question about the American electorate -- is there really anyone uncommitted at this point? There is no ambivalence about Trump. You love him or you hate him. And some people who love him are going to vote against him, because they are exhausted. And some people who hate him are going to vote for him because they see his opposition as unhinged and ridiculous.

Scott Jennings | Savannah Morning News

America’s left-wing has taken a dark and dangerous turn, now openly expressing a desire for its political opposition to be delegitimized, criminalized, intimidated and ultimately banished.

This attitude has been boiling since Donald Trump became president. He’s too dangerous to be allowed to speak, they said, as the likes of Sen. Kamala Harris called on Twitter to suspend his account.

But that seems quaint compared to the left’s rhetoric of the last few days. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi labeled Republicans “domestic enemies” and “enemies of the state” in an unhinged rant rivaling any of Trump’s crazier tweets. And that was after Rep. Ayanna Pressley called for GOP officials to be harassed with “unrest in the streets.”

Words have consequences. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and his wife, Kelley, were put in danger as they walked out of Trump’s GOP acceptance speech in Washington on Thursday night.

As the video shows, Kelley Paul described being “swarmed by a threatening, screaming mob” and “unable to move” until police rescued them from the Black Lives Matter and Antifa radicals.

Earlier this year, Democratic Senate candidate Jon Ossoff of Georgia said he wanted Republicans “beaten so bad” they can never “show their face again in public.” I might allow for a poor choice of words with dual meanings on the former, but the latter is clearly a personal preference.

The goal is to intimidate conservatives into silence. A future controlled by liberals is one where political opposition won’t be tolerated. The only speech allowed will be that which is approved by the left-wing authorities and their media enforcers.

Look at the approved speech patterns for describing the violent protests sweeping American cities. This was literally reported by ABC News:

""Protesters in California set fire to a courthouse, damaged a police station and assaulted officers after a peaceful demonstration intensified,"" read the tweet from ABC to nearly 16 million followers.

Take cover when your peace begins intensifying, I guess?

The latest left-wing conspiracy theory pushed by liberal opinion leaders like MSNBC’s Joy Reid is that the riots are actually caused by super sneaky white supremacists who then deftly blame it on left-wing protesters.

There’s no evidence for this, but then again there wasn’t any for the U.S. Postal Service canard, either. For all the wailing about conspiracy theorists infiltrating the Republican Party, it seems they are already well ensconced in the Democratic Party.

The official component to this is coming into focus. Democrats — who may win control of the U.S. Senate in November — are plotting to eliminate the legislative filibuster, stripping the minority party of debating rights that have safeguarded bipartisanship for decades.

Senate Democrats have no interest in passing legislation with Republican input, and plan to banish bipartisanship in the Senate just as their political thugs banish conservatives from the public square.

America’s left-wing has taken a dark and dangerous turn, now openly expressing a desire for its political opposition to be delegitimized, criminalized, intimidated and ultimately banished.

This attitude has been boiling since Donald Trump became president. He’s too dangerous to be allowed to speak, they said, as the likes of Sen. Kamala Harris called on Twitter to suspend his account.

But that seems quaint compared to the left’s rhetoric of the last few days. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi labeled Republicans “domestic enemies” and “enemies of the state” in an unhinged rant rivaling any of Trump’s crazier tweets. And that was after Rep. Ayanna Pressley called for GOP officials to be harassed with “unrest in the streets.”

Words have consequences. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and his wife, Kelley, were put in danger as they walked out of Trump’s GOP acceptance speech in Washington on Thursday night.

As the video shows, Mrs. Paul described being “swarmed by a threatening, screaming mob” and “unable to move” until police rescued them from the Black Lives Matter radicals.

“They called me a ‘bitch’ and ‘racist wh---' alongside an endless torrent of ‘f--- yous,’” she wrote after.

Earlier this year, Democratic Senate candidate Jon Ossoff of Georgia said he wanted Republicans “beaten so bad” they can never “show their face again in public.” I might allow for a poor choice of words with dual meanings on the former, but the latter is clearly a personal preference.

A future controlled by the left

The goal is to intimidate conservatives into silence. A future controlled by liberals is one where political opposition won’t be tolerated. The only speech allowed will be that which is approved by the left-wing authorities and their media enforcers.

Look at the approved speech patterns for describing the violent protests sweeping American cities. This was literally reported by ABC News:

""Protesters in California set fire to a courthouse, damaged a police station and assaulted officers after a peaceful demonstration intensified,"" read the tweet from ABC to nearly 16 million followers.

Take cover when your peace begins intensifying, I guess?

The latest left-wing conspiracy theory pushed by liberal opinion leaders like MSNBC’s Joy Reid is that the riots are actually caused by super sneaky white supremacists who then deftly blame it on left-wing protesters.

Social justice takes the hit:Rioting is beginning to turn people off to BLM and protests while Biden has no solution

There’s no evidence for this. For all the wailing about conspiracy theorists infiltrating the Republican Party, it seems they are already well ensconced in the Democratic Party.

The official component to this is coming into focus. Democrats — who may win control of the U.S. Senate in November — are plotting to eliminate the legislative filibuster, stripping the minority party of debating rights that have safeguarded bipartisanship for decades.

Senate Democrats have no interest in passing legislation with Republican input, and plan to banish bipartisanship in the Senate just as their political thugs banish conservatives from the public square.

“What (Americans) don’t expect is for one party — be it Republican or Democrat — to change the rules in the middle of the game so that they can make all the decisions while the other party is told to sit down and keep quiet. The American people want less partisanship in this town, but everyone in this chamber knows that if the majority chooses to end the filibuster — if they choose to change the rules and put an end to democratic debate — then the fighting and the bitterness and the gridlock will only get worse,” an American political leader once eloquently stated.

For once, I agree with Barack Obama, circa 2005.

Former Republicans join the scourge

Of course, Obama in 2020 leads the norm-busting parade, as he now says the filibuster is racist. This is how you do it — label every political inconvenience, contrary view or opposing politician racist to make them magically disappear.

Some anti-Trump, former Republican political mercenaries have joined in the scorched earth tactics, even opposing Republican senators they consider to be Trump “enablers.” The next time you hear from these hacks, they will be screaming: “You were supposed to eat me last!”

A Biden win isn't in the bag:Don't get too excited about Biden's lead in the polls. A close election is dangerous

Liberals are openly telling us their plans for American political discourse. And once given the power to force conformity, they won’t make allowances for the so-called principled conservatives who helped them.

Remember, before Democrats claimed Trump was a dangerous racist, they said the same about Mitt Romney, George W. Bush, John McCain, George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan. It isn’t just Trump they hate, but anyone who rises to prominence in the Republican Party. Remember when Vice President Joe Biden claimed Romney's policies would put Black people “back in chains”?

This is a frightful, dangerous moment for America, where free speech and robust debate are under assault by one half of America’s political spectrum. Hopefully, Americans will stand up to the bullies in November.

(CNN) Republicans are off to a nice start on the first night of their convention with a solid roster of diverse voices delivering optimistic and compelling messages. If they keep up this hopeful tone — and combine it with a continued healthy dose of policy contrasts throughout the week — this will be a successful, if unusual, convention.

GOP national chairwoman Ronna McDaniel laid it out in her opening night address: ""You probably noticed Democrats spent a lot of time talking about how much they despise our President. But we heard very little about their actual policies, policies that would have been unthinkable a decade ago,"" McDaniel said, before riffing on the greatest policy hits from the Democratic presidential primary on fossil fuels, illegal immigration, healthcare, and public safety issues.

This is the challenge for the Republicans this week: To reframe the conversation around voting issues and the consequences of liberal policy choices, versus the preferred Democratic framing around Joe Biden being a nicer person.

There are two ways to win an election — thrill voters by nominating someone exciting and lovable, or, in case you nominate someone who sucks, scare the bejesus out of people so they vote for your guy anyway.

The Democrats have settled on the latter for 2020. Yes, Joe Biden is presently winning the presidential race against President Donald Trump (although CNN’s Sunday night poll had it effectively tied), but most reputable polling indicates little enthusiasm for the former vice president, and Democrats know it.

Therefore, worried about maintaining a shaky lead, Democrats and their conspiracy theory-crazed followers (led by High Conspiracy Priestess Nancy Pelosi) have plunged headlong into a plan to scare people to death in the hopes they will overlook how aggressively mediocre Biden is.

The latest conspiracy theory (following the ones about Russia, Ukraine, and that the Trump tax cuts would cause “Armageddon” and mass death) is that Trump is sabotaging the post office with a Republican donor who apparently has the power to single-handedly stop all Democratic ballots and Social Security checks.

Conspiracy goes mainstream

The conspiracy theory went full mainstream Sunday night when House Speaker Pelosi called her chamber back into session to deal with the “crisis.” Immediately, every Democrat and those most severely afflicted with Trump Derangement Syndrome joined in her hoax.

Look out:Trump has a plan to steal the election and it's not clear Democrats have a plan to stop him

Even former basketball player/turned iPhone thief/turned misinformation purveyor Rex Chapman tweeted a picture of some locked mailboxes in Burbank, California.

“In your entire life have you ever seen a LOCKED mailbox at the USPS? Now you have. A disgrace and immediate threat to American democracy. Shame on them. Shame on the GOP. Where are you (Mitch McConnell)?” Chapman alarmingly tweeted, garnering tens of thousands of retweets and likes.

Rex’s brick was immediately disproven by a reporter named Chuck Ross, who used a highly sophisticated research tool called Google to find a 2016 article explaining why the boxes are locked:

“Turns out that fishing, or stealing mail, has become so common that postal officials have been retrofitting boxes around the San Fernando Valley and other areas to make them more tamper proof, said Richard J. Maher, spokesman for Post Office operations in Los Angeles and Orange counties.”

Set aside for a moment that Chapman is spreading a baseless conspiracy that would make even the most committed Russian operative blush. Does he think that California is a swing state? Or that a senator from Kentucky controls the mailboxes in Burbank? Or that people can’t mail a ballot from their house?

You may want to get your political news somewhere other than Rex’s Twitter feed. But the former Kentucky Wildcat is hardly the only unhinged liberal going on about the post office.

Pelosi herself, in her weekend letter, announced the U.S. House had to convene to, among other things, make sure people can still get their Social Security checks.

Wait… what?

Fine for Obama, fine for Trump

Back to Google, where we find out that President Barack Obama stopped sending Social Security checks in 2010, moving all but a small number of recipients to direct deposit. We also find that, in 2016, the U.S. Postal Service removed some 12,000 mailboxes during Obama’s second term, another tenet of the “Trump is sabotaging the post office to steal the election” conspiracy theory.

Google also tells you that in 2012, Obama tried to cancel Saturday delivery of the mail, a significant attack on mail access for rural voters (who really disliked Obama, by the way). But no conspiracy theory or national uproar emerged over Obama’s postal moves.

Real concerns:USPS badly needs an overhaul, but not smack in the middle of the Trump-Biden campaign

Why? Because it wasn’t a conspiracy! And neither is today’s postal dust-up. Unfortunately, on Tuesday the Postal Service announced they are suspending some of these operational changes until after the election to avoid the appearance of foul play. In reality, the Republicans and Democrats have a major policy disagreement over the post office, which boils down to this: Liberals want to give it a bailout, and conservatives want to reform it.

That’s it. That’s all this is about, but Democrats are purposely conflating these issues with disagreements over mail-in voting to scare the bejesus out of people, especially older voters. The post office has plenty of money and capacity to operate the 2020 election, no matter what the Democrats say, and Trump himself has blessed a coronavirus relief bill that would send billions in additional funding to the Postal Service.

While Democrats and the media howl about Republicans embracing conspiracy theorists and misinformation, Pelosi, Chapman and countless others are spreading flat-out lies to freak people out. It is wrong, and voters will hopefully see through it come November no matter which method they choose to cast their ballot.

Well, I’m finally back home from Fantasy Farm. The first Saturday in August always brings out Kentucky’s political stars for old-fashioned stump speaking and politicking on the grounds of St. Jerome Catholic Church deep in Western Kentucky’s Jackson Purchase region.

A misty rain couldn’t keep away thousands of Republicans and Democrats who vote Republican to hear from Gov. Andy Beshear and U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell and his November opponent, Amy McGrath.

Beshear, who as you know transcends all politics and divisiveness, warmed up the crowd with a 10-minute game of “Mother, May I?” The governor delighted in disallowing the Republican side of the pavilion from moving at all, despite their reasonable requests, while letting the Democrats do whatever they pleased.

Gerth:McConnell's Republicans tried to slip $1.8 billion wet kiss for Trump in COVID bill

Afterward, when questioned about the arbitrary nature of his decisions and the apparent double standard, Beshear said: “We can only control what we can control.”

The big matchup between McConnell and McGrath did not disappoint. Despite being late (McGrath’s camp forgot Fantasy Farm was happening Saturday and then couldn’t find it on the map), the picnic first-timer gamely defended the rioters in Portland, Oregon.

“Those folks trying to burn down the federal courthouse, that’s just peaceful protesting,” McGrath said. “I mean, look over there,” she said, gesturing at the smoking barbecue pits.

“What’s the difference between Antifa and those arsonists setting fire to that wood? And we aren’t tear gassing them, are we?” McGrath said, as confused church volunteers looked on.

McGrath’s speech ended when bored Democrats drowned her final words in chants of “Book-er, Book-er,” referring to her close primary in which she spent over $31 million to win just 45% of the vote.

McConnell’s speech was interrupted by a ringing iPhone on his belt. He answered it on speaker and a familiar voice boomed.

“Mitch? Mitch? It’s Donald. Look, I know you want to have the election in November, but honestly if we wait a few months Biden may not make it that long,” said President Donald Trump, his voice carrying for all to hear.

McConnell, sighing heavily, finally hung up on Trump and plowed ahead, zinging McGrath on her recent voter-registration efforts.

“I read that you personally registered 15 new Democrats,” McConnell said. “Your party has lost 6,783 registrants since 2014, when I was last reelected. So, you only have 6,768 to go to get back to zero.” Official statistics show Republicans, during that same time, have gained over 281,000 voters in Kentucky.

Related:Barack Obama's first wave of endorsements doesn't include Amy McGrath

First District Congressman James Comer, facing no serious opposition in the fall, discussed his new perch as ranking member on the House Oversight Committee. But there was an unmistakable buzz in the air about his future, as picnic patrons wondered if Comer will take another shot at Kentucky’s governor’s mansion in 2023.

“I can’t believe how easy Congress is,” Comer said. “I’ve been there for like 10 minutes and already they gave me the job that Fox News loves the most!”

But Comer, ever mindful of his old Kentucky home, previewed a future race against Beshear by zinging the governor for winning less than 50% of the vote against former Gov. Matt Bevin in 2019.

“Next time, you won’t be running against someone less popular than your average family of fire ants,” Comer said, swatting two nemeses for the price of one.

Kentucky’s constitutional officers took their turns, save Secretary of State Mike Adams, who mailed in his speech ahead of time. Fantasy Farm picnic czar Mark Wilson dutifully carried Adams' speech to the lectern, opened the two envelopes in which it was packaged, and did his best Adams impression.

“To the good people of Western Kentucky, land of my ancestors, I salute your good nature and hearty souls,” the letter began. “Kentucky has a shortage of pole dancers and poll workers, but can you guess which is more urgently needed?”

Agriculture Commissioner Ryan Quarles, always at home in farm country, announced he’d come up with a way to transform hemp into bacon, and Attorney General Daniel Cameron discussed the federal issues he thinks will be important in 2026.

“I just thought that was a good year to talk about,” Cameron told a reporter afterward. “By the way, this is Mitch’s last term, right?”

Fantasy Farm 2020 was one for the history books, and we all look forward to being back next year!

Author’s note: The political speaking at the actual Fancy Farm did not take place this year, although church officials told me they sold all their barbecue and a lot of raffle tickets, t-shirts, and masks. The annual Fancy Farm tradition continued uninterrupted from 1881 until this year’s pandemic forced cancellation of the event.

106,Jennings,Scott,retailtouchpoints,"The retail industry is reeling from COVID-19. If it were a boxer, it would be against the ropes, close to a technical knockout by an opponent adept at dealing blows to the body. And what makes the fight particularly unfair is that the retail industry had arrived in the ring already battered, barely surviving its round with e-Commerce — over 9,300 stores closed last year alone.

This is a tough match, but one that retail can win if it’s willing to learn new moves. Retail, prepare to meet your new trainer: the on-demand economy.

Lesson 1: Agility

If you’re unfamiliar with the concept of the on-demand economy, it’s this: a business, service or product that allows users to request a physical object, a piece of data or a service, and have that request fulfilled. In short, it is dictated by the principle of instant gratification and leverages that principle to build loyalty. Ask customers why they prefer Amazon over other online retailers and the answer most likely comes down to two-day shipping — not quality or customer service.

Consumer expectations have changed; immediacy is prized above all else, and customers expect frictionless, seamless, personalized experiences throughout every step of the buying journey. It’s not enough to give a tracking number: customers want to watch their product’s progression to their front door. It’s not enough to give a customer service phone number: customers want to speak to an agent now via chat.

Advertisement

If retail plans to compete with the expectations customers now have, it will need to start adapting unprecedented agility. That will require no longer outsourcing to a delivery partner, but rather spinning up its own delivery service to retain a relationship with the customer and maintain control and transparency over the entire purchase process, from shelf to door.

A great example of this is Tractor Supply, which sells everything from riding lawn mowers to live chickens. Want 10 baby ducklings? Of course you do. Tractor Supply offers three ways to get them: curbside pickup, same-day delivery or in-store. And they know customers don’t want to stand in line at the store, so they offer mobile checkout right from your phone. That’s agility.

When retail locations open up after the pandemic, they can expect customers who have become accustomed to being accommodated. Behaviors have shifted since the beginning of the pandemic. For instance, expecting customers to stand in a line just to pay for the items they want will soon become an untenable business practice. To kill the line, retailers should have more cashiers than ever, and those cashiers should be able to provide exceptional customer service and check customers out anywhere in the store.

Retailers will need to stop relying on their bulk and begin to — as Muhammad Ali once said — “float like a butterfly and sting like a bee” by being fast, agile and ingenious.

Lesson 2: Upstarting

In boxing, an upstart is a new fighter with great potential. That’s how the on-demand economy views workers: they’re not liabilities, they’re assets. In a traditional retail model, however, workers mean cost. Onboarding is slow, and turnover is fast. If retail plans to win the match, it needs to start adjusting the way it perceives its labor.

And belief in the value of workers also means not limiting them to single silos. Warehouse workers can be trained not just on warehouse safety and best practices but also on how to manage deliveries. The on-demand economy realizes that one person can do many, many things: retail needs to capitalize on the intelligence of its workers by utilizing cross-training whenever possible. That prevents worker burnout and turnover while unlocking unprecedented workforce adaptability.

In the new world of retail, hiring equals revenue, and faster onboarding means faster profit. Some retailers still assume there’s no way to hire at scale without exposing the business to great risk, but that’s playing into the old way of thinking. With strategic, innovative onboarding processes, risk doesn’t need to increase as hiring ramps up.

Lesson 3: Transparency

The second half of Muhammad Ali’s famous butterfly quote says: “The hands can’t hit what the eyes can’t see.” Similarly, retail can’t adapt if it can’t see what it’s up against. Transparency is built into the on-demand economy — from seeing exactly how many items are in your cart and which coupon codes have been applied, to tracking your mozzarella sticks as they travel to your front door. Retail needs to adopt the same allegiance to transparency so they can perceive the entire business at once and adjust as needed.

One way this manifests as business value is through more accurate supply chain and onboarding forecasting. Without transparency at every level, it’s difficult to understand how increased demand for curbside pickup could lead to staff shortages down the road. The on-demand economy utilizes technology to understand its business in practice: retail should do the same.

The Final Round

Retail can not only win the round — it can become a knockout champion. The trick lies in how it responds now to prepare for a coming reality. Retail needs to start prioritizing agility, expansion and transparency to generate the kind of profit that will keep it sustainable for the years to come. Without that mindset and commitment to change, retail may as well throw in the towel.

I have no idea what Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron’s investigation will conclude about Breonna Taylor’s killing at the hands of Louisville police.

But I am sure that demanding the cops essentially be handed over to what amounted to a posse at Cameron’s house, under threats to “burn it down,” is fundamentally un-American and a bastardization of how our justice system is supposed to work.

Local demonstrators, national celebrities and even 10 million signatories to a Change.org petition have criticized Cameron for the Taylor inquiry’s duration, demanding “immediate” charges against the officers involved (often referring to them as “murderers.”) Because they are outraged — not an unjust emotion, mind you — they want Cameron to abandon thoroughness in favor of mob rule.

But if you consider Taylor’s killing a murder, or at a minimum an unjust act requiring some kind of a criminal indictment, what would it serve her memory or our collective desire for an improved justice system for an investigation to be short-circuited because … Beyoncé says so? Or because a public official was threatened by an angry mob on his front lawn?

This is not the justice system — or country — we want, where prominent citizens and angry crowds can influence prosecutors to criminally charge people absent a thorough investigation. That attitude, to the great detriment of African Americans, stained our nation’s past but should not define its future.

The deterioration of faith among African Americans in our criminal justice institutions is justified, and white Americans share their concerns. A Pew Research Center survey, conducted in 2019, found “84% of black adults said that, in dealing with police, blacks are generally treated less fairly than whites; 63% of whites said the same.”

And that was before the national demonstrations sparked by the George Floyd and Taylor killings. This data screams out for a restoration of trust in our institutions. But how can we restore trust if criminal investigations are influenced by external actors and threats of violence?

Diligence takes time. There is no justice to be had without the truth, and no truth without a thorough examination of the facts.

Two writers on these pages opened a recent piece critical of Cameron with the following: “The most important ethical duty of a prosecutor is to serve as the voice for the most vulnerable and underserved groups who cannot speak for themselves.”

A laudable sentiment, but that’s not the job of a prosecutor. According to the National District Attorneys Association, “The prosecutor is an independent administrator of justice. The primary responsibility of a prosecutor is to seek justice, which can only be achieved by the representation and presentation of the truth.”

And in its famous 1935 Berger v. the United States case, the U.S. Supreme Court defined a prosecutor as “the representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all; and whose interest, therefore, in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be done … while he may strike hard blows, he is not at liberty to strike foul ones.”

What should our expectations be of Kentucky’s attorney general in the Taylor matter? Very simple — obtain the entire truth, no matter what it is, and be as thorough as possible so that justice can be rendered impartially, and that Kentuckians have confidence in the outcome.

To rush such an important matter or charge the officers with crimes unsupported by the facts would indeed strike a foul blow.

Cameron should not be influenced by politics, celebrities or anyone outside the investigation. He should not rush, or stall, based on the demands of those who support the victim or the officers.

Cameron should regard only what is legal and illegal and tune out efforts to influence his investigation via celebrity pressure and personal invective.

Some argue that Cameron is in a no-win situation, facing a decision that is sure to anger this political constituency or that, and perhaps one that will lead to rioting and destruction if you take the demonstrators at their word.

But the glass-half-full view is this: A thorough investigation, no matter how long it takes, in which every piece of evidence and every witness is fully reviewed, could stand as a paragon of how a law enforcement action should be conducted even as we mourn a life taken because of a law enforcement situation gone terribly awry.

Two forces are colliding in 2020. One has no idea what it wants. The other is crystal clear.

Let’s start with Donald Trump, running for reelection as president of the United States. His answer on why he wants a second term has been, charitably, non-existent.

Here was Trump’s first swing at it, with Fox News host Sean Hannity:

“Well one of the things that will be really great: You know, the word ‘experience’ is still good. I always say talent is more important than experience, I’ve always said that. But the word ‘experience’ is a very important word. It’s a very important meaning. I never did this before, I never slept over in Washington. I was in Washington, I think, 17 times, all of a sudden I’m president of the United States, you know the story. I’m riding down Pennsylvania Avenue with our first lady and I say, ‘This is great.’ But I didn’t know very many people in Washington, it wasn’t my thing. I was from Manhattan, from New York. Now I know everybody.”

Given a mulligan by Sinclair TV host Eric Bolling a few days later, Trump whiffed again in a rambling response that lacked a cogent argument like “I fixed the economy once, and I’ll save it again.”

Trump ran on real things in 2016, namely how the political elite had left American workers behind on immigration and trade. He promised lower taxes, conservative judges and pro-life policies. He railed against political correctness run amuck, appealing to Republicans and blue-collar Democrats alike.

Unfortunately, the president has yet to formulate a similarly insightful argument for a second term as he struggles to manage the twin crises of coronavirus and social unrest. His speech at Mt. Rushmore — hammering the leftists attempting to erase America’s history (and its future) before our very eyes — was an improvement, despite what you heard from the homogeneous national political press that is dedicated to Trump’s destruction.

More from Scott Jennings:Riots give Trump a chance to rally his supporters and go after racism

But Trump — behind in his reelection and threatening to take the Republican Senate down with him — must now carry his argument forward by characterizing today’s rope-pullers as tomorrow’s policymakers in a Joe Biden administration. If you are worried about economic upheaval today, wait until the mob oversees Biden’s policy shop.

Anarchists, radical leftists, Democratic Party leaders, and their cheerleaders and apologists in the press cannot control or hide what is happening. It’s just the Confederate statues, they tell us, as Christopher Columbus sinks in a Baltimore harbor. It isn’t about disrespecting America, just ending police brutality, they claim.

Except that the spiritual leader of the other colliding force — Colin Kaepernick — released a video over the weekend calling the Fourth of July a “celebration of white supremacy.” There’s no other way to interpret his argument — the American experiment is built on an evil foundation and must be erased.

Apparently, top Democrats were listening. Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth — a leading contender to become Biden’s running mate — said on Sunday we ought to consider removing statues of George Washington and raised the specter of doing away with Mt. Rushmore altogether. She said Trump spent all his time “talking about dead traitors” this weekend, despite the fact that his speech was entirely about the Founding Fathers and other American heroes.

The guru says “jump!” and his followers shout “how high!”

Prominent Democratic operatives started this nonsense last summer by pushing to label all Trump voters as racist. Now, they bless an all-out assault on a core tenet of American political discourse – that we are all in this together — by arguing that not only are Trump and his supporters racist but that celebrating America’s founding means you endorse white supremacy.

Kaepernick’s cult knows exactly what it wants: to cancel its political opposition and then delegitimize the American story as we have always known it. They seek radical policy changes that can only be accomplished by removing the democratic guardrails of separation of powers and the protection of minority party rights in the legislative branch.

Read:100+ youth march 'for freedom' in downtown Louisville on Independence Day

Senate Democrats are signaling they will end the legislative filibuster if they gain control, effectively surrendering to the most extreme elements of the American left (they already run the House under Nancy Pelosi). Combine this change with a newfound taste for emergency powers exercised in the name of the coronavirus, and you can see how the left’s wildest and most radical dreams could come true in short order.

What does America look like when Republicans no longer have the procedural tools to save the country from extremism? Turn on your television. The people destroying American cities and public property — and the petrified, enabling Democrats too weak to stop them — will have your future in their hands.

112,Jennings,Scott,hotair,"The rampant mayhem is but the latest American upheaval, coming on the heels of the COVID-19 lockdowns and subsequent disruption to our economy. There’s a craving for leadership that can return some semblance of normalcy to our lives, where people can go to work and take their kids to school without driving past burning buildings or having a brick tossed through their windshield.

This presidential election may turn on which candidate can deliver light at the end of this long, strange and dark tunnel. Who can Make America Normal Again?

Flowing underneath this question is a powerful undercurrent — the idea that there are different rules for different people. Trump exploited this theme successfully in 2016, arguing that political elites get away with stuff that would get anyone else punished.

It seems to me that today’s demonstrations are based on a similar imbalance — one set of rules for white people, and a different set for black people when it comes to interactions with the police, which is, in many circumstances, objectively true. Trump should appeal to the peaceful protesters the way he did to the electorate at large in 2016: No matter anyone’s station in life, we should all be treated equally under the law.",1,https://hotair.com/headlines/archives/2020/06/riots-give-trump-chance-rally-supporters-go-racism/

Eighty percent of Americans in this weekend’s NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll said the United States is “out of control.” The easy analysis will revolve around President Donald Trump’s handling of recent crises, but depending on your political perspective, you might think things are spiraling for different reasons.

Take Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer, for instance, whose administration is out of control for the first time since taking office nine years ago. His performance has been shaky — at best — in the wake of the Breonna Taylor and David McAtee killings, and his constituents are letting him know.

WFPL reported Fischer was “confronted” by a group of young African Americans on Sunday who asked pointedly: “Why were you silent for two months on Breonna Taylor’s murder?” Another leveled a biting accusation: “You’ve been using us for photo ops for years.”

And Fischer’s recent meeting with Louisville’s police officers didn’t end well, either. Dozens of cops walked out on him because they “feel completely unsupported and disrespected,” according to Fraternal Order of Police president Ryan Nicholas.

Oof. You can feel the confidence draining out of City Hall, but at least Fischer succeeded in uniting the demonstrators and police on something.

More:Fairness Campaign yanks support for Mayor Greg Fischer after police 'gas his own city'

Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear must feel a bit out of control, too. After months of scolding Kentuckians with his folksy-yet-aggressive “y’all can’t be doing that” edicts and enjoying high approval for it, he did a complete 180 when thousands took to Louisville’s streets in full violation of his ban on mass gatherings. After essentially confining Kentuckians to their homes for months, Beshear praised the demonstrators for their supposed adherence to anti-COVID-19 guidelines.

“You've got better compliance in these demonstrations than we do just about anywhere,” Beshear said. Out loud. With a straight face.

For any Kentuckian who lost a job, turned their home into a school, missed their graduation, couldn’t hold a funeral or comfort a dying loved one, put off a wedding, or shut down a restaurant, Beshear thinks the demonstrators are doing a better job than you in preventing coronavirus spread.

Beshear’s contemptuous attitude is made all the more laughable by his repeated claims to be “done with politics” in his effort to “save lives.” He sold out his entire message on coronavirus to curry favor with Louisville’s demonstrators and rioters, despite the public health scoldings he’s given Kentuckians who dared question him.

But the governor is now boxed in. If there’s a COVID- spike because of the demonstrations, Beshear’s pandering will look even more foolish. If there isn’t, a whole bunch of Kentuckians are going to ask: What were we doing for the last several months, dude?

Beshear, in full defensive mode to head off the same pressure Fischer is under, pandered further last week by announcing that he favored removal of the Jefferson Davis statue from Kentucky’s Capitol Rotunda.

Joe Gerth:Jefferson Davis statue must be removed from Kentucky Capitol. NOW.

If Beshear really cared about removing the “symbol that divides us,” it would already be gone. It sits outside of his office, after all, and he could have had it removed any day since taking office. (And don’t give me any static about the Historical Properties Commission. They guy just put 40% of Kentucky out of work via executive order and closed every church. If he wants to move a statue, he can move a statue.)

His father, former Gov. Steve Beshear, left it in the Rotunda for a full eight years.

But the clan Beshear saved old Jeff Davis for a political rainy day, which has assuredly come. The governor is not worried about the symbolism, of course, just the politics. (For what it’s worth, Kentucky’s top Republican, Sen. Mitch McConnell, has steadfastly favored removal since 2015, as has this columnist).

These marches have made for fascinating politics. “Defund the police” is making its way rapidly into mainstream Democratic thought and comes on the heels of Joe Biden telling black Americans they aren’t actually black unless they support him.

And many conservatives have been wondering what would happen if people marched for different reasons, perhaps ones not so en vogue with the mainstream media?

What if there were pro-life or pro-Second Amendment marches? What if Donald Trump held a campaign rally?

What would the media and Democratic political narrative be? Would they imply these righteous causes had imbued their supporters with coronavirus immunity, as Beshear and other Democratic leaders have done for police and race demonstrators?

Of course not. They would label them selfish grandma killers.

Interestingly, demonstrators at the White House this weekend were photographed with anti-Trump “bunker bitch” signs, which has nothing to do with policing or racism. I’m no doctor, but their righteous cause immunity may not be as strong as they think.

News:Following fatal shootings, Fischer announces 'top-to-bottom' review of police department

Indeed, the world feels “out of control” to many conservatives, too. We mourn and demand justice for George Floyd. We want police reform. And we want jobs for black adults, over half of whom are out of work thanks in large party to the COVID-19 lockdown. We pray for the health and safety of demonstrators who are now at risk for contracting coronavirus, which has disproportionately affected African Americans already.

But we want one more thing: an end to the doublespeak and double standards that define the coverage and treatment of our national political discourse.

(CNN) We've spent the Trump years forcing people into binary political camps, with little allowance in our public discourse for nuance. But the tumultuous events roiling the American public today blow up the usual constructs that define much of our punditry.

Scott Jennings

From where I sit, here's where most people are, including President Donald Trump: George Floyd's killing was wrong, and justice should be meted out as swiftly as possible, within our system, on the cops who killed him. No angry mob should have a say in this and the cops should be given no special deference simply because they are cops.

We've all seen the video of Floyd's death, and though the criminal justice system has some bad actors, it is the system we have, and we must trust it to handle this situation appropriately.

At the same time, it is not contradictory to believe that we cannot tolerate violent riots and the destruction that has been taking place in parts of American cities night after night. When the President says he wants both justice for Mr. Floyd and a restoration of law and order, I believe him. If it takes a deployment of the US military to do it, because governors and mayors cannot get control of the situation in their jurisdictions, I think the President will find public support for it.

The most recent Gallup Poll studying the confidence Americans have in institutions tells the tale: the military, far and away, scored the best. Of those surveyed, 73% have a great deal or quite a lot of confidence in the military, versus just 8% who have very little or none -- a +65 rating. Interestingly, in the same survey that tests confidence levels in several institutions, small businesses clock in at +60 (68-8) and the police at +36 (53-17). These are by far the top three.",1,https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/03/opinions/trump-message-strikes-a-chord-jennings/index.html

To the people negotiating the return of baseball: You cannot fail. We are desperate for the things that bind Americans together because we are increasingly horrified by the politics and resentment tearing us apart.

We need our national soundtrack now more than ever. We need bat cracks, mitt pops and the satisfying “whoosh” of a hard slide into second base. Crowd murmurs and roars, even if they are piped in for awhile. Announcers begging a long fly ball to stay fair, and loud umpires bellowing “strike three!” when a pitcher paints the black with a cracking fastball.

We need baseball. Now. The alternative background noise is presently appalling, with the dumb and grotesque dominating our televisions.

Nancy Pelosi called the American president “morbidly obese.” The president is shamefully tweeting about the tragic death of a young woman — without regard for her family — because he’s mad at a TV host. Joe Biden has turned himself into a walking “23 and Me” kit by telling black people they aren’t actually black unless they vote for him.

Protesters in Frankfort, Kentucky, hung an effigy of Gov. Andy Beshear with a sign reading “sic semper tyrannis,” the words shouted by the traitorous coward John Wilkes Booth after shooting Abraham Lincoln.

Opinion:Coronavirus pandemic changes what it means to be an involved father

Unreasonable media voices have proven themselves more interested in shading the truth of state-by-state responses in order to score political points rather than simply reporting the facts.

Our politics and the information ecosystem that surrounds it is just plain awful. We can’t watch this with our children. We can barely stand to watch it by ourselves.

Americans have endured tremendous hardship. Almost 100,000 are dead, millions are suddenly out of work, and the economy is littered with the shattered dreams of small business owners who never imagined their life’s ambition would be wiped out by a coronavirus from China.

Our nation needs relief, not rank stupidity and hideousness. We need comfort and a sense of common purpose. We need to believe brighter days are ahead because America won’t leave anyone behind. We need something to root for.

Baseball brought us back together after 9/11. And it can bring us back again. I still get chills thinking of George W. Bush firing a strike at Yankee Stadium.

Americans aren’t shy about debates or hard-fought campaigns. We don’t mind vigorous disagreement. We appreciate a good zinger from the politicians we support and begrudgingly respect it when the other side gets in its own good shot.

But does this campaign seem like one we will collectively relish? It’s only May, and the back-and-forth is already too ugly and base for the gravity of the decisions that await the next commander-in-chief. Six more months of only this? No, thank you.

'Clearly, I was scared':Newly released police interviews shed light on Breonna Taylor case

Pray the baseball negotiators succeed this week. Money seems to be the sticking point (isn’t it always?), but my God print whatever it takes to get these guys on the field! We’ve spent $2.4 trillion on coronavirus relief so far. How much do we need to get major and minor league baseball going right now? Whatever the number is would be well worth it.

I am optimistic there will be a deal because the alternative for baseball would be so damaging to the game’s future that neither the players nor owners can allow it. We need Jobu and Jesus Christ to come together on this one, folks, much as they did once for the fictional Cleveland Indians.

I hope someone reminds baseball’s bean counters and player representatives what the game really means to America. That a nation in need of something positive and thrilling needs home runs. That a nation in need of hope needs a game built on hope, which springs eternal. In baseball and in America, there is always a chance.

And baseball, with its full nine innings and steady pace, is a uniquely communal experience, encouraging conversations and comfortable silence amid the familiar low hum of a stadium and the shouts of “hot dogs” and “cold beer here.” Though the season will be shorter this year, the moment that fans are again able to discuss the standings each day will restore the pulse of a public yearning for cheerful statistics.

Our politics will remain ugly for the rest of the year. But something better will hopefully replace it soon on our television screens. Crisp white uniforms. Green grass. Brown dirt. And the reds and blues and oranges and blacks and yellows of our favorite team logos worn by players of all races and creeds and geography.

America needs its beautiful baseball. Now more than ever.

(CNN) With the 2019 school year ending for most kids, parents like me have already turned their thoughts to the fall and to whether kids will be sent back to school. My wife and I have been homeschooling our four little ones since the pandemic closed their schools two months ago. They have August circled on their school calendars.

Do I want them to go back?

I am in the ""yes"" camp ... but I would be lying if I said I wasn't having doubts.

I am as anxious as anyone to get my kids back to school because I am worried about educational setbacks, both from what they've already missed and what they'll miss if they don't go back in the fall. My wife and I are doing our level best to keep up with their studies, but is it as good as what they'd get at school? I'd like to think so, but I am not sure (and allow me to praise the teachers instructing us and our children from a distance as best they can). But we are also worried: will they be safe?

Parents juggling full-time jobs with new homeschooling responsibilities are anxious, stressed and exhausted. A good friend of mine often says that ""when you are doing everything, you aren't likely doing any of it well."" And she said that before being thrust into juggling homeschooling and her job. Most parents I know are asking the same question every night: Am I f-----g this up for my kid?

On the other hand, our homeschooling efforts and supervised online learning sessions have been among the most fulfilling experiences of my adult life. Yes, there are frustrating moments (for the kids, too, who cannot possibly pay attention to this many Zooms), but the time I'm spending with them, picking up on their little learning habits and points of curiosity, is irreplaceable and simply wouldn't be happening if I hadn't been grounded from my normal travel and work schedule.

None of us will forget this precious time, and hopefully it will result in all parents taking far more interest in the day-to-day learning habits of our kids.

But as much as I want my kids to return to the classroom, I do worry about the trauma of the ""what ifs."" What if one child at school becomes extremely ill from Covid-19 or, God forbid, dies? What will that do to our kids, and what will it do to parents? Will they rush to pull their kids out immediately?

What if a teacher contracts Covid-19 and gets very sick ... or dies? Will the kids become too frightened of their environment to learn? And are we putting our teachers and school staff in harm's way? Undoubtedly, we are if they are older or have pre-existing conditions.

Most of the parents I know readily admit their dual impulses. We are plagued with doubt, and balancing competing interests -- health on the one hand, and the academic fulfillment and necessary socialization that schools provide our children. My kids are desperate for peer interaction. I could barely get them on their bicycles before all of this; now, they've formed a biker gang with the other neighborhood kids and go up and down the streets like there's no tomorrow.

I wonder what can be done to make going back to school feel safer to kids and parents. Should we be schooling over the summer? Should we be planning modified schedules, with smaller groups of students taking turns in the classroom two or three days a week and homeschooling the rest? Should classes be moved outdoors, where spread of contagion would be less likely than it would be in the confined space of a classroom?

If we knew there was a 100% chance of a vaccine coming in the next year, we'd likely all agree to tough it out --with the homeschooling and stir-craziness-- and wait for it. But the truth is we really have no idea when or if there will be a vaccine. So, as we make this decision, we should assume there won't be one.

That brings us to the next question: what exactly is our risk tolerance? We make, statistically speaking, risky decisions for our children every single day. Putting your child on a school bus or in another motor vehicle. Allowing them to play sports, especially football. Letting them go on overnight trips, like camping, away from us. Sending them to a neighbor's pool party. All are routine events about which we don't think twice.

But bus crashes, sports injuries, and tragic accidents occur all the time. The question is: are we disproportionately treating coronavirus as a riskier proposition than those seemingly routine risks we allow our kids to take?

According to columnist Justin Fox: ""For children, the risk of dying from Covid-19 appears to be much less than that of dying from influenza and pneumonia ...""

We don't cancel entire school years for the flu, or anything else. More than 12,000 kids under 19 die each year, a huge percentage of them in transportation and drowning accidents. But we haven't canceled buses, cars or swimming pools.

So how do we balance all of the risks against sending our kids back to school during a pandemic? Perhaps at least a temporary solution would be to allow our children to return to the classroom, but continue to keep them away from the most vulnerable, particularly the elderly (that's hard to write -- my kids' grandparents are jones-ing for some grandbaby time).

And, unfortunate as it may be, schools will have to sideline older teachers and staff members who shouldn't be exposed to highly populated closed environments. Finding ways to protect the most experienced teachers without losing their experience is vital; perhaps an army of Zoom tutors will spring up among this group.

The driving impetus of our national lockdown (including of schools) has been protecting vulnerable people and controlling the infection rate so hospitals aren't overwhelmed. Some hard-hit parts of the country are still struggling, but by and large we are achieving those goals.

It is the Democrats’ world. We are just living in it.

That’s what Republicans think of the sexual assault allegations against presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, now credibly accused by a former Senate staffer named Tara Reade. In a long interview with journalist Megyn Kelly, Reade says that Biden pinned her against a wall and penetrated her with his fingers.

“He had his hands underneath my clothes and it happened all at once,” Reade said, adding that Biden told her “I want to f--- you…‘C’mon man, I heard you liked me.”

These allegations went largely ignored for weeks by the media types and Democrat politicians who pilloried Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearings. Biden finally denied them, and a horde of liberal politicians and talking heads now say they “believe” Biden, or, even if he did it, so what?

“Compared with the good Mr. Biden can do, the cost of dismissing Tara Reade — and, worse, weakening the voices of future survivors — is worth it,” wrote Linda Hirshman, a well-known feminist author who believes in “sacrificing Ms. Reade for the good of the many.”

Read this:Joe Biden's sexual assault allegation puts Senate candidate Amy McGrath in a tough spot

Of Kavanaugh, she demanded his impeachment: “Kavanaugh … can be unbenched. Women are simply not going to accept this monumentally unfit man remaining on the Court regardless of what the Republicans manage to ram through this week.”

Now, with Hirshman and other liberal hypocrites cheering them on, Biden and his party are doing the ramming. There was no corroborating evidence against Kavanaugh whatsoever. Biden’s creepy shoulder rubs and unwanted hair sniffs are, on the other hand, legion, not to mention Reade telling people about it at the time.

It is clear now that Democrats never cared about the truth when they were grilling Kavanaugh, a sacrifice made for the sake of abortion. And it is clear they are again willing to sacrifice any objective view of a sexual assault allegation, again for the sake of abortion.

What’s a red-cloaked Handmaid’s Tale protester to do with her time, I wonder?

California Senator Diane Feinstein, who detonated the Christine Blasey Ford bombshell late in Kavanaugh’s process after sitting on the allegations for weeks, made a disgusting about-face when confronted with Reade’s allegations. The California Democrat savaged Reade, blaming her for waiting too long to come forward.

“And I don't know this person at all who has made the allegations. She came out of nowhere. Where has she been all these years? Why didn't she say something — you know when he was chairman of the Judiciary Committee or after that?” Feinstein said.

Her tune, of course, was far different during the Kavanaugh hearing. When Republicans raised similar questions, Feinstein said: “Victims must be able to come forward only when they are ready.”

McConnell:Biden vs. Kavanaugh sex allegations show Democrats's 'jaw-dropping hypocrisy'

Call it the Politics of Hypocritical Convenience, wherein you say whatever gets you through the moment regardless of what you said when the shoe was on the other foot.

This nasty habit is on display elsewhere in the Democrat Party. Several pro-abortion governors, attempting to justify unconstitutional or arbitrary orders issued during the coronavirus pandemic, say they are just “trying to save people’s lives,” a phrase uttered often by Kentucky’s Andy Beshear and his attorneys.

One can only wish Beshear’s pro-life epiphany had come before vetoing anti-abortion legislation sent to him by the state legislature. But don’t hold your breath it will last, even if you are just seconds away from taking your first one.

If Beshear thinks this phrasing works for him in the court of public opinion, it is decidedly not working in the court of law. He has lost five decisions in three federal lawsuits to Attorney General Daniel Cameron and a handful of private parties who sued over his banning religious services and out-of-state travel. And more legal challenges may be coming over Beshear’s arbitrary reopening timeline.

With 33% of Kentucky’s labor force unemployed — the highest rate in the nation — due to Beshear’s emergency orders, business owners and workers alike are beginning to ask questions:

If nearly 60% of all Kentucky COVID deaths are in nursing homes, why did Beshear wait until May 8 to “move toward” 100% testing of patients and staff in those facilities? Why did Beshear destroy Kentucky’s economy but waited to test nursing homes — the main source of deaths — until now?

Why has Kentucky consistently been in the lower tier of states for per capita testing?

Opinion:Seems Democrats don't mind coronavirus lies as long as Trump isn't telling them

Why was a $6.7 million state contract given to a company with ties to convicted felon and Democrat Party powerbroker Jerry Lundergan to build a field hospital in Lexington that never saw a single patient?

Why can my dog get a haircut, but I cannot?

The truth needs saving too, apparently.

Two things are true: When you give politicians more power and fawning media attention, it almost always goes to their heads. And the impulse to impose authoritarian policies is never higher than in an emergency, like the coronavirus pandemic.

Take the Governor of Michigan, Gretchen Whitmer, for instance. Amidst a flurry of softball national interviews and a campaign to be selected as Joe Biden’s running mate, the Detroit Free Press reported that she micromanaged her state’s commerce to the point that “purchases of Michigan Lottery tickets are still permitted, but buying a can of paint or a bag of seeds is off limits.”

Many Kentuckians wonder if the same thing is happening to Gov. Andy Beshear, who earned high marks for his early actions and “we are all in this together” tone. But over the last few weeks, Beshear, with a largely uncritical press looking (cheering him?) on, has made several decisions raising eyebrows, if not hackles.

Beshear crossed a line for many when he announced the state would record the license plates of people attending Easter church services. Since then, as big stores like Home Depot and Lowe's swell with lines of patrons wrapped around their buildings, people wonder: Why can 500 people safely buy pruning shears, but 50 people cannot attend church?

'It takes guts':Andrew Cuomo praises Beshear for opposing McConnell on state bankruptcies

Also:In 'new normal,' Kentuckians will be asked to start wearing masks in public as of May 11

Further antagonizing the state’s social conservatives, late Friday night Beshear vetoed Senate Bill 9, the bipartisan and overwhelmingly popular “born alive” infant protection bill that passed the House 70-16 and the Senate 30-2. Beshear shamefully kowtowed to his party’s extremist abortion masters who put their shoulder to the wheel during his narrowly successful 2019 campaign.

Hypocritically, after Beshear asked the state to pray for a 10-day-old baby stricken with the virus, he vetoed a bill that would save a 10-second-old baby from a failed abortion. Beshear called the bill “divisive,” a nasty habit used to deflect his most extreme positions.

Other citizens wonder if Beshear went overboard by banning out-of-state travel. During one court hearing in a citizen’s lawsuit, Beshear’s attorneys argued the governor could deploy the National Guard to Kentucky’s border to enforce his order. If you are worried about state troopers in your church parking lot, how do you feel about tanks on I-65, just south of Bowling Green?

Also:Louisville woman violated court order to self-quarantine by going to a Kroger, police say

Beshear often denigrates Tennessee’s pandemic efforts as the reason for his travel ban, but Tennessee has tested two times as many people as Kentucky with a lower per capita death rate. Maybe the Volunteer State should have banned us first.

Finally, business leaders have expressed concerns about Beshear’s “Healthy at Work” initiative, which originally required individual businesses to submit plans to the state before being allowed to reopen. The Beshear Administration quietly watered down the order last week, but questions persist about how much control Beshear’s political appointees will wield.

Hastily built field hospitals sit empty. Regular hospitals, furloughing workers, report no coronavirus surge and thousands of open beds. And as surrounding states move to reopen, it is worth noting, as policy journalist Avik Roy said, “that the purpose of lockdowns is to prevent Italy-style overwhelming of U.S. hospital ICU capacity. We’ve done that. Time to stop annihilating the economy.”

In the coming days, Beshear will face further pushback in the courts of law and public opinion. And we should all question whether any chief executive should wield this much unchecked power and instinct to mock the press, as our current predicament is quite likely a prelude to even bigger power grabs.

We are less than one year from a possible Democratic president and Democratic majorities in the Senate and House, to go along with existing Democratic governors who already have a taste of wielding emergency powers. How long before their supporters demand emergencies for climate change and guns, which they will say are just as deadly as coronavirus.

If you don’t think liberal activists are already plotting, I’ve got some contraband magic beans I’ll sell you. Once society allows its government to restrict commerce, religious freedom, and even human movement in the name of an emergency, it is not hard to foresee a slippery slope of emergencies declared to thwart pesky roadblocks like the U.S. Constitution.

Emergency powers were designed to allow for swift action to short-term problems like tornadoes or earthquakes, not to provide unchecked power for an unlimited amount of time. In just a few short weeks we have learned why. The inconsistencies and oversteps in Lansing, Frankfort and elsewhere could just be the opening act.

Gov. Beshear has done some things right, but he needs a loyal opposition and a critical press more forcefully questioning his decisions. We must not stop thinking about the governing precedents being set today and how they may be terrifyingly abused in the future.

A recurring joke in public relations is “I’ve decided to spend more time with my family,” a phrase used by people who are forced out of political or high corporate positions. The translation from modern English is roughly: “I sucked at this, but fortunately they decided not to be jerks and explain why that is.”

Heretofore, “spending time with my family” was a trope to everyone save Vito Corleone, an old school olive oil salesman who believed “a man who doesn’t spend time with his family can never be a real man.”

We are all “real men” in the eyes of the Godfather now. Because of the coronavirus pandemic lockdown, family time for fathers has sprouted as suddenly as the spring’s green grass. For me, that has meant ditching airport lounges and their free cheese cubes for juice boxes and granola bars with Winston, my kindergartner.

Gerth:Time for Beshear to put Kentucky General Assembly under coronavirus quarantine

Every morning we get up and begin the day’s schoolwork, carefully prepared by his wonderful teacher. It’s like Tchaikovsky sending over a piece of sheet music for some ham-fisted first-timer.

First, there’s a mix of videos to watch and activities to perform. On a recent Monday, I found myself on the foyer floor marking various intervals with masking tape to denote the hopping distances of grasshoppers, frogs and kangaroos.

And then there’s the writing.

My Winston is named after Winston Churchill, one of the orneriest world leaders in the modern age. And, like his namesake, he’s a bear to write with. Sir Winston would dictate beautiful speeches and letters long into the night (and long after his alcohol-infused dinners), driving his typists crazy. He would then review the work, mark it up by hand, and have them type it up all over again.

For my Winston and me, it’s the opposite. I drive him crazy with instructions, and then I review and make him do it again. A fight recently ensued over his peculiar forming of certain letters.

“Winston,” I said. “You are a Jennings! It is in your very genes to have good handwriting!”

“But daddy,” he replied, “I am not even wearing jeans!”

Touché, Winston.

Live updates:Here's the latest coronavirus news for the Louisville region

Our lockdown has given me an up-close look at how my children are educated, and I am deeply enjoying it and earning a newfound respect for the teachers and home-schoolers out there.

Before, I was content for my role to be that of chauffeur, ferrying my kids to and from the school bus and various activities. It was quite nearly a full outsourcing of their education, even as I coached baseball and helmed the Cub Scout pack.

Oh, sure, I donated to school fundraisers and volunteered here and there to be “involved,” but how much personal attention did I pay to the literal way my children were learning? Truthfully, very little. If a quarterly report said things were fine, I was happy to let the education program run on autopilot.

But that was then. The new normal for me, even when our lockdown ends, will be full involvement in what and how my children are learning. This is not to supplant or distrust their teachers — all are saints who do a terrific job — but rather to supplement and take personal responsibility for their academic success.

I am ashamed, frankly, I didn’t realize this before. But perhaps a wonderful outgrowth of this terrible era will be the realization that fathers were not put on this earth to ignore their children for most of each day. We were put here to raise them, which means something more than simply getting up, going to work and asking at dinner: “How was school?”

The workplace of the future is going to change dramatically, and it must respect parents who need more flexibility to be part of their child’s education. We can’t go back. We are learning anew from the pandemic that life is short and we aren’t in control. This is a time for old paradigms to die, including changing the definition of what it means to provide.

For most of my life, that definition did not include engaging so deeply in a child’s schooling. But that’s over, an antiquated attitude killed off by the coronavirus. The real men of the future will be teachers’ assistants, quite literally minding the p’s and q’s of their own Winstons as they simultaneously pursue their career goals. Fathers are proving right now it can be done.

And that, friends, is an offer none of us can — or should — refuse.",1,https://www.courier-journal.com/story/opinion/2020/04/14/coronavirus-lockdown-shows-fathers-must-involved-teachers/2987781001/

Anyone who has been around kids knows this game: A baby covers his eyes and because he can’t see you believes you can’t see him, either. Peekaboo is fun until reality sets in for the tiny ones.

But reality has not set in for the tantrum-throwing babies who, with eyes covered since Election Day 2016, have desperately wished for the American president to disappear. They called on Twitter to suspend his account. They impeached him, an effort to nullify an election and throw Trump off the 2020 ballot. And now their latest attempt to defy object permanence is the most absurd of all — demanding media outlets stop airing news conferences conducted by the president of the United States.

One prominent Democrat — a former senior aide to Nevada Sen. Harry Reid —claimed that media outlets airing the president’s viral afternoon updates are complicit in people dying unnecessarily. I’m sure the widespread viewership (8.5 million viewers on average, with one day reaching over 12 million) has nothing to do with it.

Or do the president’s poll numbers, up a few ticks since the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic started. The RealClearPolitics average of Trump’s job approval pegs him at 47.3%, the highest of his presidency. On Sunday, the ABC News/Washington Post poll put the president at 49% approval versus 47% who disapprove, an eight-point improvement since February.

Also:Democratic rival of Thomas Massie invokes Hitler on social media, he attacks back

But let’s set that aside and deal with the Democrat notion that a president — or candidate for the presidency — should be banned from television for lying.

Enter Joe Biden, who would fail this test miserably. He has lied repeatedly about his record on the Iraq War and the Trump tax cuts, and was once run out of a presidential campaign for plagiarism. The pandemic — a life and death matter when Trump lies about it, Democrats say — hasn’t stopped Biden from spurting misinformation. Biden is the Old Faithful of liberal dishonesty.

Despite media fact-checkers shooting it down, Biden has repeatedly claimed that Trump called the virus itself “a hoax.” That never happened, though Trump used the term to describe Democrat attacks on his administration’s response.

Biden has asserted that Trump cut funding to the Centers for Disease Control and the National Institutes for Health. Wrong again. The Washington Post scored this one “3 Pinocchios” and the Associated Press reported that financing increased to both agencies under Trump.

Biden said President Trump rejected World Health Organization coronavirus testing kits — more malarkey according to Politifact. And a Biden campaign video claiming Trump “silenced” medical experts was given “4 Pinocchios” by The Washington Post, which must be employing Mister Geppetto on its Biden beat by now.

Beyond that, Biden, like the rest of his party, has fumbled mightily on the issue of Chinese malfeasance. After Trump implemented travel restrictions on China on Jan. 31, Biden tweeted: ""A wall will not stop the coronavirus. Banning all travel from Europe — or any other part of the world — will not stop it. This disease could impact every nation and any person on the planet — and we need a plan to combat it.""

Joe Gerth:Trump has us fighting for coronavirus supplies in a battle Kentucky can't win

Dr. Anthony Fauci, our government’s foremost infectious disease expert who often appears at Trump’s side these days, said the Chinese travel restrictions “absolutely” made a difference and that Trump’s subsequent European travel ban was “prudent.”

Not satisfied with what the experts say, Biden continues to assail Trump’s posture toward China. At a town hall meeting, Biden said: ""this is no time for Donald Trump's record of hysteria and xenophobia, hysterical xenophobia ... and fearmongering.""

It’s too important to keep up the “Trump is racist” narrative than to admit the truth: That China plunged the world into death and chaos with its coverup.

There’s credible reporting that China has understated its coronavirus cases by “15 to 40 times,” while simultaneously trying to “expand its economic power through offering help to other countries which are trying to combat the virus.” And a Wuhan hospital official who “went public, saying authorities had stopped her and her colleagues from warning the world ... has now disappeared, her whereabouts unknown,” according to 60 Minutes Australia.

The Chinese are due a reckoning once this nightmare ends, but they won’t get it from Biden, whose dishonest viral campaign video never once mentioned China’s role in the crisis.

Democrats can whine about Trump’s trouble with the truth all they want ,but hiding their eyes from Biden’s rampant dishonesty won’t make it disappear. It seems that Democrats don’t mind being lied to, so long as Trump isn’t the one doing it.

(CNN) As the coronavirus crisis unfolds and media and Democratic bashing of President Donald Trump continues, a curious thing is happening -- his numbers are going up.

Scott Jennings

The Gallup poll this week recorded its highest ever job approval for the President (49% approve, versus 45% who don't). Likewise, Trump is generally getting decent marks on his handling of the pandemic, with Gallup showing 60% approval on the subject.

The question is -- why? Trump has lived in a very tight job-approval zone for most of his presidency, hovering around 42-43% among registered and likely voters. But today, FiveThirtyEight's Trump job approval tracker shows him with an average approval of 44.9% and the RealClearPolitics tracker has him at 46.3%.

He's been lifted, apparently, by his handling of the coronavirus, and perhaps by his opposition's mishandling of it. I think a few things are at work, and a smattering of each could easily explain his lift:

1. In its reporting on the pandemic, as with most issues, the press along with Democrat politicians have gone overboard criticizing the President. And because neither of those institutions is all that trusted by the American people -- 45% of respondents in a CBS poll this week said they think the media is overreacting -- they may see that overreaction as a signal that Trump has got this. Some 51% in the CBS poll said they think Trump is ""about right"" in his reaction to the crisis.

Ah, the perils of writing a newspaper column amidst a pandemic. No amount of Purell will help if today’s hot takes don’t exactly cover you in glory a week from now.

Everyone wants to know the political implications for President Donald Trump, but it is impossible yet to discern. He’s had some good (Chinese travel ban) and bad (Oval Office address) moments, but the jury is still out. The new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll showed the president’s job approval unchanged month over month; the haters still hate and the lovers still love.

I’m not surprised because reality hasn’t yet set in for most of us. My new normal began Monday morning with homeschool for our two oldest while keeping our two youngest out of their hair.

Compared to the single mom scrambling for child care, or to the grandparents and other caregivers now tasked with ensuring learning progress for their wards, my wife and I, blessed with flexible work environments, have it easy.

Tough coronavirus reality

But a bleak, tough reality will come for us all, catching up with some families faster than others. My sense is this period of abnormality will be far different for people who have children than those who don’t.

The coming economic disruption hasn’t yet manifested itself for most people. But it is coming soon. The interruption to customer-facing businesses and workers will be hard in the short term and downright intolerable in the medium and long term. Last fall, the American Payroll Association found that more than “74 percent of employees in America would experience financial difficulty if their paychecks were delayed for a week.” Another survey conducted in February found that “54 percent … are not currently prepared financially in the event that they contract a virus like COVID-19 and are unable to work for several weeks.”

I am saving my political judgments until we see what happens. Did we flatten the curve? Did we do enough for those less fortunate? Did we harness the full power of the American government to blunt the virus and save lives and jobs? Before the usual partisans rush out with their always certain and predictable pronouncements (“Trump has failed!” or “Trump is awesome!”) perhaps the most prudent punditry is to wait, see, analyze and reflect.

I am choosing to focus on the things I can control — teaching my kids, playing catch in the yard and putting together the Lego X-Wing fighter set in my basement.

And I will pray for those we may not see again. I’ll tell you a story about my 88-year-old grandmother, or Grandmommy, as I’ve called her for 42 years. She lives in a nursing home in Western Kentucky but was admitted to the hospital with heart problems late last week. She has refused further treatments and the doctors say what will happen will happen. People of her era were born ornery and will die ornery, I suppose.

Back in a nursing home

She’s going back to her nursing home, off-limits to visitors, and I’ve resigned myself to knowing I may not see her again. Hopefully this publishes in time for her to post it on the nursing home bulletin board.

I hope she knows how much her grandson loves her. I hope she remembers fondly, as I do, the summers and afternoons we spent together outside. I had never seen an old lady kick a ball as far as Grandmommy, and I haven’t seen one since. I hope she forgives me for endlessly pinging her roof with baseballs.

I hope she remembers how much I enjoyed her cooking. I hope she knows what an imprint her impeccable handwriting left on me. Holding something she’d written seemed almost royal, like it belonged on parchment under glass. I hope she remembers teaching me to whistle, and that she knows I am teaching my kids, too.

Above all, I hope she knows what a difference the safety and love felt in her home made to a little boy who was constantly shuttled between divorced parents, in perpetual need of distractions to replace the worries that flood the minds of all children of broken homes.

Grandmommy enthusiastically gave me her time and her love, creating memories that will last a lifetime. The silver lining of this pandemic is, perhaps, the chance to create a few indelible moments with our own children, same as the ones that Sue Jennings gave me. And it serves as a reminder that we should tell the ones we love how much we care about them as often as we can.

Things spreading across the globe: coronavirus, the lies being told by Democrats about it and liberal cheerleading when something bad happens because of it.

The virus, thankfully, hasn’t yet spread broadly in the United States (although it is reasonable to assume that many more cases will emerge in the coming weeks). But that hasn’t stopped the American left from saying outlandish things about the Trump Administration’s response.

Joe Biden, who claims to be the antithesis to Trump’s dishonesty, tried to incite public panic while campaigning in South Carolina.

“We increased the budget of the CDC. We increased the NIH budget. ... (Trump’s) wiped all that out. ... He cut the funding for the entire effort,” Biden said, harkening back to his days as Barack Obama’s vice president.

Not to be outdone, Mike Bloomberg, who claims to be the antithesis to Trump’s incompetence, went even further:

“There's nobody here to figure out what the hell we should be doing. And (Trump’s)…defunded Centers for Disease Control, CDC, so we don't have the organization we need. This is a very serious thing.”

Read more:Catholic churches tweaking Mass for coronavirus. Here's what Louisville Archdiocese says

These candidates, united by a reckless disregard for truth and responsible public rhetoric during a public health emergency, should be ashamed of their galactically irresponsible remarks. The Trump Administration has not “wiped out” or “defunded” the CDC or the National Institutes for Health. Further, there are several experts figuring out “what the hell” to do.

According to the Associated Press, funding has increased for both agencies during the Trump Administration, and the experts in charge have earned praise from across the political spectrum: Dr. Anne Schuchat, the CDC's principal deputy director, is so good Hollywood based a movie on her work, and Dr. Anthony Fauci, the NIH's infectious disease head, has advised six presidents.

It is outrageous that leading Democrats would so brazenly lie to the public about the American government’s response. But who will hold them accountable? Let’s check in with our national newspaper of record, The New York Times:

“Let’s call it Trumpvirus,” blared a headline atop a column written by Gail Collins, one of the paper’s most well-known writers. Columnist Paul Krugman, also using the “Trumpvirus” label, excitedly tweeted “Dow 25,000!” as the stock market tanked.

Other corners of the American left, ever disdainful of organized religion, pounded Vice President Mike Pence, who Trump tasked with leading the government’s response. As governor of Indiana, Pence once said he wanted to pray about a controversial needle exchange program in response to an outbreak of HIV/AIDS in his state. And a photo of his coronavirus task force with heads bowed in prayer earned widespread scorn, with one New York Times Magazine contributor tweeting that America is “so screwed.”

More opinion:End corporal punishment in Kentucky schools. Hitting kids doesn't work

I wonder: Do the liberals hammering Pence have the same thoughts about Democratic presidential candidates attending Bloody Sunday church services in Selma this past weekend?

As if we needed another reminder, Donald Trump has broken these people. Absolutely broken them. A virus jumps from an animal to a human halfway around the world and the liberal intelligentsia tries to name it after the American president, cheerleads a decline in the retirement fortunes of millions of Americans and crusades against basic religious practices.

There is no high-minded, we-are-all-in-this-together alternative to Trump. There is no paragon of honesty or virtue or competence waiting to turn the American presidency into a new season of ""The West Wing."" There is just a disgustingly disloyal opposition, whose happiest recent days were brought on by a global pandemic.

But even as his opposition grows more irresponsible, Trump is not absolved of the need for an accurate, clear and sober public message. He should not minimize the risk or engage in his usual hyperbole. This is where the rubber hits the road on public trust, and Trump needs to get it exactly right or face extreme political damage.

His best course is to simply be calm and honest: More people will get this virus, some will die, and washing your hands is a good way to stay healthy. The administration should give routine updates on progress toward a vaccine, mortality rates and travel advice. And he should put experts like Schuchat and Fauci on TV as much as possible.

There’s no room for error, and Democrats have already crossed the line. If Trump gets his coronavirus response right, it would represent a major turning point in how the public views his honesty and competence heading into the November election.

What’s worse: choosing a socialist for your party’s presidential nominee, or taking the nomination away from one at a contested convention?

With the presidential primaries underway, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is the front-runner for the Democratic nomination. In a fragmented field featuring several ambitious, funded and hard-headed candidates, Sanders stands the best chance of leading the delegate chase by the time Democrats hold their convention in Milwaukee in mid-July.

Why? His small-dollar donor army is stable, unmoved by news cycles and the ups and downs that befall other campaigns. The Bernie Bros stick through thick and thin, unlike, for instance, the fickle supporters of Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren. Party rules require a candidate to win 15% of the vote in any state to qualify for pledged delegates, and Sanders’ is the only candidacy guaranteed to do that in almost every state.

Sanders is in a similar position to Donald Trump in 2016’s Republican primary, benefiting from fragmentation below him among people who don’t know when to quit. The only difference is that Republican Party rules enabled Trump to rack up massive delegate hauls in several states while winning less than a majority of the votes, while Sanders cannot. The proportional allocation rules of the Democratic primary (no winner-take-all states) puts an anvil on Sanders’ head as he tries to rise up and grab the 1,991 pledged delegates necessary to win the nomination outright.

More on Bernie:Sanders was ridiculously naive about the Soviet Union. The Trump ads write themselves.

If Sanders gets close but falls short, all hell could break loose. After the first ballot, the Democratic “superdelegates” (establishment party leaders and elected officials) get involved and could turn the convention toward a more establishment-friendly candidate.

Can you imagine the absolute pandemonium if Sanders shows up in Milwaukee with the most delegates and leaves without his party’s nomination? All immediate chaos aside, a key political question emerges: Will Sanders supporters show up in November to support a Democrat who, in their eyes, stole the nomination?

Donald Trump's dream

This would be a dream scenario for President Trump and the Republicans. In 2016, although Hillary Clinton won more popular votes than Sanders during the primary, many of his supporters felt the nominating process was unfairly rigged against them. And then in the fall, one large study of voters found that 12% of Sanders supporters voted for Trump, enough, at least on paper, to have swung the election away from Clinton in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

If the Sanders people felt violated in 2016, this scenario would put that emotion on steroids in 2020.

More on the Democratic primary:Stop Bloomberg. He's showing billionaires how to buy the presidency and it's dangerous.

But what happens in the other scenario, where Sanders is nominated? A major political party would have put a socialist on a plausible path to the White House, a norm-shattering moment in American politics. While Democrats and Republicans have had their differences over the years, both parties have tended to nominate candidates from within the traditional guardrails of American policy debate.

That would end with Sanders. Jonathan Chait, a well-known liberal writer, recently penned a column called “Running Bernie Sanders Against Trump Would Be an Act of Insanity” and listed Sanders’ most extreme and unpopular positions: “…replacing all private health insurance with a government plan, banning fracking, letting prisoners vote, decriminalizing the border, giving free health care to undocumented immigrants, and eliminating ICE.”

Sanders' tax boost

And that list ignores taxes, which would increase substantially to pay for Medicare for All and Sanders’ pledge to wipe out all student loan debt, and abortion, which Sanders frequently refers to as “health care” (do the babies regard it as such?).

Remarkably, all of Sanders’ serious opponents for the nomination have adopted some or all of his extreme positions, gifting Trump the ability to call them all socialists. But while a more pragmatic Democrat might be tempted to walk back the “insanity” in a general election campaign against Trump, Sanders will double and triple down.

I tend to think it would be worse for Democrats to take the nomination away from Sanders, although choosing someone with such warm feelings for the Soviet Union seems downright crazy, too. But there’s no doubt that the energy in the Democratic Party is with Sanders and the young left-wing radicals who support him, like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. To deny them would splinter their party and suck the energy right out of the Left’s fall campaign at a time when Trump’s supporters are already more excited to vote, according to Associated Press polling.

Socialism is a harsh mistress. Democrats are damned if they indulge and damned if they don’t.

You hate to see it.

133,Jennings,Scott,seattletimes,"If you praise someone’s great moral character when it is in your best interest but refuse to do so when it is not, you aren’t doing it right.

That’s what I thought after Utah Sen. Mitt Romney collected a wheelbarrow full of fair-weather friends in the wake of his vote to convict President Donald Trump during his impeachment trial. It took America’s liberals about .00009 seconds to heap praise upon the 2012 GOP presidential nominee, a man they once pilloried as: a murderer, a tax cheat, a felon, a robber baron who destroys jobs and hates workers, a misogynist who would return women to the 1950s, and a joke for worrying about Russia’s malign influence on the world.

Romney was reborn a liberal hero when he explained his impeachment thinking like this: “As a senator juror, I swore an oath before God to exercise impartial justice. I am profoundly religious. My faith is at the heart of who I am.”

This is a perfectly fine way to arrive at a decision of this magnitude — laudable, even — and wholly consistent with the way Romney approached his politics in 2012 when running against President Obama. It’s surprising that Democrats would suddenly get on board with such a faith and politics rationale.

If you are a liberal extolling Romney today, ask yourself this question: What if Romney’s declaration had been about a vote to upend Roe vs. Wade? The pro-life Romney once wrote: “I believe that abortion is the wrong choice except in cases of incest, rape, and to save the life of the mother.”

Or do a gut check on yourself if he were announcing his position on same-sex marriage. “As a society,” Romney said in 2012, “I think we’re better off if we encourage the establishment of homes with a mother and a father.” He said that same-sex marriage isn’t “appropriate and needed for a strong society.”

Advertising

And, finally, ask yourself this: What if Trump gets another Supreme Court vacancy to fill and Romney casts the deciding vote for a justice that fits his socially conservative worldview? Will you stand with Romney on that day and praise his “moral courage”? After all, the vote to confirm would have been born of the same faith that led Romney to convict the president.

Still on the Mitt bandwagon, liberals? I didn’t think so.

I worked my heart out for Romney’s presidential campaign in 2012 and came to believe that he was indeed a compassionate man possessed of great moral courage who would have been a terrific commander in chief, who deeply loved his family and country, but who lacked the intangible, next-level political skills required to win a presidential campaign. (It’s true — he just isn’t as good at campaigning as Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Obama or Trump.)

Many in my party are also proving to be Romney’s fair-weather friends, or perhaps bad-weather enemies. They vehemently disagree with his conclusion that the president is guilty of abuse of power and should be thrown out of office and off the 2020 ballot. But just as liberals are wrong to cravenly adopt Romney now that it serves a political purpose, the GOP is wrong to organize an outrage mob against him.

Of course, Republicans and Trump have every right to feel angry. In his post-impeachment news conference, the president accused Romney of using “religion as a crutch” and he predicted that Romney’s poll numbers were “going down … big.” His unhappiness is understandable.

But just as Democrats haven’t gained a caucus member, any loose GOP talk of excommunicating Romney is not just wrong, it makes no sense as Republicans seek to hold the White House, the Senate and to retake the House.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has learned to play the long game with his conference members, even when they go the wrong way on things. Although he was “surprised and disappointed” in Romney, McConnell took a wise posture when asked how long Utah’s junior senator would be in the doghouse:

“We don’t have any doghouses here. The most important vote is the next vote,” McConnell said.

Romney is a Republican. His vote against the president doesn’t change that, even though it robbed Republicans of their narrative that Democrats pursued a completely partisan impeachment.

Even without that talking point, however, the president is in a terrific position: He has the highest job approval of his presidency and his ratings on handling the economy are better than any president since George W. Bush in the wake of 9/11, according to Gallup. The Democrats’ primary is in disarray and they may even nominate a socialist to run against him. One impeachment vote to convict — soon lost to history, even if it came from a principled Republican — won’t hinder the former or help the latter.",1,https://www.seattletimes.com/opinion/liberals-your-mitt-love-is-insincere/

DES MOINES, Iowa — For a long time, I didn’t understand this recurring image in my twitter feed — Sesame Street’s Elmo, a panicked look on his face and arms raised above his head while standing in front of a wall of flames. I guess because Elmo doesn’t have eyelids he necessarily looks panicked all the time, but the inferno definitely adds to the vibe.

But now I get it.

When it became clear last week that Senate Republicans had heard enough and there would be no further witnesses in the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump (further, because, despite what you heard, there were 18 witnesses and nearly 30,000 documents presented by the House managers), the panic among the Trump-obsessed began to manifest itself on social media, cable television and the floor of the U.S. Senate.

It was not pretty.

Trump is now functionally a king! The 2020 election is already stolen! Every future president will invite other countries to rig our elections! If John Bolton (who, amusingly, was one of the biggest boogeymen to the American left until he became their new hood ornament) isn’t allowed to testify, then the Constitution is meaningless! Trump and his lawyers are like Stalin, Hitler and Mussolini!

And so on and so forth.

Adult humans, many paid to help us find deeper meaning in our politics, morphed before our eyes into Inferno Elmo, arms up and ready to burn.

The Great American Impeachment Meltdown of 2020 followed the Great American Mueller Meltdown of 2019, which followed the Great American Kavanaugh Meltdown of 2018, which followed the Great American Inaugural Meltdown of 2017, which followed the Great American Election Meltdown of 2016.

I’m not sure which puddle is deeper — what I found on the streets of Des Moines during the Iowa Caucus as the snow gave way to unseasonably warm temperatures, or what the American Left has become after three years of Trump’s presidency.

Pelosi:It was 'sad' for McConnell to 'humiliate' Chief Justice with witness vote

We live in the greatest country the world has ever known, with the most durable and genius governmental framework ever devised by man. Our economy is humming. We are blessed with work (there are more jobs available than people who want them). Our ancestors struggled against the Nazis; we struggle to choose which emotional support iguana to take on our next vacation.

For Americans looking to leap from the nearest tall building over Trump’s acquittal, please back away from the ledge. There is absolutely nothing wrong with American democracy. In fact, it is pretty darn healthy.

In 2018, we had the highest voter turnout for a midterm election in 100 years. This November’s presidential election turnout will likely top 65%, with millions of additional people participating over four years ago.

In other words, things are fine. They were fine. Nobody is stealing this election, and nobody stole the last one. We will pick the next American president right on schedule after a free, fair and vigorous contest. Trump will win. Or he won’t. And the world keeps spinning no matter what.

Opinion:If McConnell wasn't in lockstep with Trump, there might be justice in the Senate

If you hate Trump, here’s some advice: Stop worrying about Ukraine and instead worry that impeachment actually helped him. The latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found more Americans oppose Trump’s removal (49% to 46%) than prefer it, and “that the president’s political standing has strengthened in recent months, due largely to a more energized Republican Party base.”

Trump’s “strongly approve” number hit the highest mark of his presidency, he improved among independent voters, and “gained ground” against the leading Democratic candidates. The latest Associated Press national survey found that “Democrats are nervous wrecks and Republican excitement has grown.”

Essentially, impeachment was for people who already hated Trump while the rest of America either yawned or moved in his direction. Democrats setting their hair — or Elmo’s fur — on fire trying to beat Trump should rethink their strategy.

Conservatives and independents who were soft on Trump in 2016 tell me over and over that they still don’t love the guy’s style but that Democratic antics — during primary debates and the impeachment trial — have driven them closer to the president than they ever thought possible. The people I know aren’t attracted to socialism or fatalism or perpetual outrage. They just want to live their lives, go to work, raise their kids and not be overly taxed, blamed or shamed for it.

And therein lies the strategic problem for Democrats. Acting like Inferno Elmo is simply incongruous with how most Americans feel about their country. And prescribing socialist solutions for a capitalist nation enjoying historic prosperity doesn’t jibe with the mood of America, either.

I’ve become fascinated with the rules of President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial, mostly the ones restricting the activities of the U.S. senators deciding the fate of our commander-in-chief:

Attend all proceedings. No speeches and no talking to your neighbor. Read only materials pertaining to the matter at hand. No cell phones or electronic devices; in fact, lock them in another room.

Basically, senators must sit quietly in their assigned seats and focus six days a week. Impeachment is giving us a much-needed lesson on the ills of screen time, talking too much and truancy. I may let my kids watch this after all.

The rule banning electronic devices is particularly intriguing. Over in the U.S. House, during the Judiciary Committee’s hearing to advance the Articles of Impeachment, Rep. Cedric Richmond (D-LA) was caught watching golf on his tablet, a forgivable sin since Tiger Woods was playing and Democrats had long ago decided to impeach Trump. Like, before he was sworn in.

More:McConnell's proposed rules for Trump's Senate impeachment trial could set up heated debate

Removing cell phones from 100 people whose brains are constantly distracted by a steady stream of news clips and tweets that reinforce their existing worldview is a good idea. In fact, we all ought to try it. How much more efficient would our workplaces be if the chief justice of the United States were standing over our shoulder, prepared to smack our hands with a gavel if we so much as look at our Twitter app?

A great plague on our national public affairs is that we apparently can no longer stand to be confronted with information that challenges our personal bias. I see this affliction up close in the comments left on these columns and after my CNN appearances. While the creativity varies, they revolve around the same argument: Since this person said something I disagree with, he must be a liar and therefore should not be allowed to opine on a medium I might encounter.

I used to believe an epidemic of mistrust was plaguing American culture, but I am starting to think it goes deeper than that. Living in the world’s oldest and most successful democracy, how did we become so lazy as to rely upon “you are a liar” as our default political argument?

I can assure you I am not lying. Mine is an authentic opinion built on facts and information as I have digested it, same, I presume, as any liberal commentator who appears on these pages or in the other talking head box. But that doesn’t necessarily make any of us liars. Gullible? Myopic? Insightful? Prescient? Maybe all four, from time to time. But to conclude that every pundit with whom you disagree is a liar is …something else.

You may like:McConnell called 'Midnight Mitch' for controversial proposed impeachment trial rules

We’ve made it too easy to filter out information and commentary that might cause our brains to work harder at politics. Hate Trump? You can cultivate a news feed delivering a steady information diet that makes you hate him even more. Love him? There’s a cable channel dedicated to making you love him more than you thought you ever could.

What makes political counterprogramming so jarring to us is that we have no tolerance for it; technology and our splintered media ecosystem has put our precious brains in thick bubbles, creating a nation of snowflakes who melt when confronted with a differing view.

That’s why it’s a good thing the senators have had their phones and speaking privileges taken away. No doubt roughly 100 of them have already decided how they plan to vote, but confronting information that challenges their assumptions is, at a minimum, a good exercise for their brains. “Good therapy,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell jokingly called it.

And it's also why the Democratic posture on calling witnesses has been so disappointing. I don’t care if senators want to hear from witnesses (the outcome won’t change), but both sides must be allowed to bring people forward. For the Republicans, this means calling Joe and Hunter Biden, the whistleblower who started this and Congressman Adam Schiff.

When confronted with this possibility, most Democrats melt down and claim Republican witnesses are “not relevant,” a ridiculous position for people who spend a fair amount of time screeching about a “fair trial.” In what American courtroom would the prosecution be allowed to determine all the witnesses? Can Democrats not stand to hear from people who could burst their impeachment information bubble?

138,Jennings,Scott,latimes,"A year ago, it hardly seemed possible that the country could become more polarized. Then came impeachment. Today, it is as if Americans are on two separate ships, facing each other across a harbor with all cannons firing, cheering when an opponent falls overboard.

To Democrats, the Trump presidency is sheer madness. To Trump supporters, that outsider’s “madness” was required to blow up Washington and deliver results.

For the record: An earlier version of this story said that Nancy Peolsi had special pens made to sign the impeachment documents. The pens were not made specially for the signing.

Impeachment isn’t likely to accomplish much but driving the two sides further apart. But perhaps, as the process unfolds, we should at least try to understand the motives of the other side.

With that in mind, let me try to explain the worldview of Republicans like me when it comes to Trump’s impeachment. For starters, we aren’t being willfully blind. We’re not liars or hypocrites. We haven’t abandoned our ethical standards. We do, however, have concerns about what’s driving this impeachment and whether the proposed punishment fits the alleged infraction.

Republicans believe Democrats are operating in bad faith, because impeachment has been their goal since before the president was sworn in. It doesn’t help when a Democratic member of Congress is selling “Impeach the MF’er” T-shirts on her website, or that Nancy Pelosi used multiple pens to sign the articles of impeachment and then handed them out to her colleagues as souvenirs.

Republicans believe Democrats simply never got over losing the 2016 election and have been casting about since then — frantically, desperately — for a way to make it all go away as soon as possible. Hence the obsession with Russia (he couldn’t win without their help, you know), and now the obsession with Ukraine (he can’t win again without Ukraine’s help on Joe Biden, you know).

And, I hate to break it to you, but Adam Schiff was the wrong person to lead this inquiry. After his disgraceful media performances in the Mueller period, I can’t think of anyone less credible to a Republican than Schiff.

Another issue is the Ukraine matter itself and how to remedy it. Republicans have varying views. Some don’t think Trump’s actions are a big deal, while others have serious concerns about the president’s judgment, actions and choice of close associates.

But no matter where you fall on that spectrum — I find the phone call itself less than compelling, but believe deputizing Rudy Giuliani was galactically bad judgment — the question is: What’s the remedy? Democrats gave Republicans only two choices: throw the president out of office or do nothing.

Pelosi’s binary choice locked out any chance of a Republican joining Democrats’ partisan crusade to hold the president accountable. Even Republicans who are disturbed by the Ukraine issue don’t think it rises to the level of nullifying an election.

In addition, many Republicans believe Democrats have chosen to simply dismiss facts that are inconvenient. There is no doubt, for example, that Biden apparently ignored conflict-of-interest warnings from the Obama State Department about Hunter Biden’s work for a Ukrainian natural gas company. It was poor judgment all the way around from the Biden family, so much so that Joe Biden has been forced to say it won’t happen again should he win the White House. Republicans wonder why Trump is being punished for raising legitimate questions about what the Bidens themselves admit was “poor judgment.”

And then there’s the matter of the Ukrainian aid. Republicans perceive Democrats as simply ignoring the long history of administrations using aid to reward or punish foreign governments for their actions. Why is Trump, they wonder, being held to higher standards than Biden himself, who bragged about withholding aid from the Ukrainians in exchange for their firing a prosecutor who had been investigating the company his son was working for? And don’t get us started on Democratic attacks that Trump is acting like a rogue president by — gasp — asserting executive privilege and resisting congressional oversight. He learned it from Obama. Who learned it from Bush. Who learned it from Clinton. And on and on.

Given all these things, Republicans wonder why we can’t just settle everything in the upcoming election. You want a remedy? Let’s vote! If Americans believe the president’s actions should be punished with removal from office, they’ll soon get their chance.

For Congress to throw out a president would be unprecedented, of course, since America has literally never done it. Do we really want the first time to be on an issue that has split the country down the middle, with a House impeachment vote driven by only one party?

The Democratic retort is that Trump is a clear and present danger to the republic and must be removed immediately, an answer blown to smithereens by Pelosi’s head-scratching decision to withhold the articles for several weeks.

Impeachment will come and go over the next few weeks, and I am sure some as-yet-unknown revelations will deepen our national disagreement along the way. But no matter what side you are on — impeach or not — take heart: America’s Founders, in all their wisdom, gave us regularly scheduled ways to resolve our differences. Even disputes like this one.

139,Jennings,Scott,pressdemocrat,"Jennings: Why Republicans will stick with Trump

Recently, a close friend and fellow Republican told me he was “personally shocked at what the evangelicals have been willing to stomach” from Donald Trump. I'm not shocked at all.

My friend's sentiment - a variation on the empty “if Obama had done this, Republicans would've impeached him” - has become a staple of Democrats and Never Trumpers. “Are you ready to turn on him yet?” Republicans are asked over and over.

No one ever says yes. The Republicans who make a living hating Trump today hated him before he was elected. The rest of the party remains solidly behind him. The reason for that, as we enter this election year, is less granular than feeling happy or sad about a specific presidential behavior. Rather, it has to do with the general direction of the nation: Trump and whoever the Democrats nominate represent such fundamentally different directions for our country that it is almost unthinkable for a Republican voter to be seriously torn.

Imagine standing at a train station in Louisville, Kentucky, staring at the schedule board. You want to get to Los Angeles, and you have a choice of two trains - one headed to San Diego and one headed to Washington, D.C. Neither gets you exactly where you're heading, but there's really only one choice as the alternative to San Diego is to go precisely the wrong way.

Even if the San Diego train sometimes hits bumpy tracks, and the conductor comes on the PA and says crude and dumb stuff, and there are people on the train you really wish would get off: It is still taking you basically where you want to go.

To the average Republican voter, like the passenger on that train, the destination is what matters.

I tried to explain this to my friend. I told him that, for Christian conservatives, the choices are Trump versus people who prefer full-term abortions and believe that that our country should functionally have no borders. To vote against Trump is to vote for a party that fundamentally believes Republicans are deplorable - and racist.

The decision isn't hard.

“But the porn stars! The crudeness! The immorality!” my friend says.

To a Christian conservative voter, the individual behavior of an imperfect human pales against the importance of protecting human life. If the imperfect president appoints pro-life judges and takes your values into account when making policy, you don't worry so much about one sinner's struggles with morality. You just pray for him, while also giving thanks for all he does to advance your cause.

Choosing any of the Democrats running for president isn't simply boarding a train headed in a slightly different direction, or one going the same way with a nicer conductor. It means completely turning around. For goodness' sakes, Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden have both proposed plans that would spend taxpayer dollars on gender assignment surgery!

And that's what has been so illuminating about this Democratic primary race: Because of their extreme tilt to the left, none of these candidates have a prayer of peeling off a statistically significant number of Republican voters. No matter what the Never Trumpers in your Twitter feed tell you, Trump - win or lose - will have the support of more than 90% of his party.

Some people used to argue that the two parties are basically the same. It wasn't true then, and it's especially not true now. Most of Trump's governance has been what you'd expect from any Republican president (conservative judges, lower taxes, deregulation, an embrace of pro-life policies), and the wild extremism of his would-be opponents is causing some center-right voters who were lukewarm on Trump three years ago to feel closer to him than ever before.

The exception to that is the cohort of suburban women who clearly abandoned the Republicans in the 2018 midterm and strongly disapprove of Trump now. But will losing them be enough to derail the Trump train?

I consulted the impeachment polling aggregator on Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight website on Dec. 29, and it said that 48% of Americans prefer impeachment and removal versus 46% who did not. As has been true for three years, the polls say men basically want Trump and women basically don't.

Impeachment has become a political Rorschach test, and Trump might easily win reelection with a two-point deficit in the popular vote. The question isn't how Republicans can still vote for Trump, but how the Democrats became so radicalized as to present no viable alternative to huge swaths of nonurban America.

I have spent the last 20 or so New Years’ Eves glued to the SyFy Channel’s “Twilight Zone” marathon. My wife and I love the writing, the plots and picking out famous actors in their one-off roles for the classic television series.

Maybe I’ll write an episode of my own, complete with a Rod Serling-worthy opening monologue:

“The year is 2017. Donald Trump is inaugurated as president of the United States, and mass amnesia has washed over America. Half the country can no longer remember anything that happened before Jan. 20. The former president, Barack Obama, is literally sitting right there. Yet, his own party cannot remember one thing about his eight years…”

It is one of the strangest phenomena of the Trump era — the memory-holing of Obama’s executive powers. Democrats continuously act as though they’ve just fallen off the Washington turnip wagon when Trump does anything.

From Jennings:Which Democrats have what it takes to beat Trump? Not Biden or Warren

Trump’s illegal immigration policies are draconian! He’s deporting too many, they screamed, forgetting that…Obama deported more. A lot more. And, you know those cages on the southern border? Obama built them, not Trump.

Trump’s defying congressional subpoenas! No president has ever stonewalled Congress, they screamed, forgetting that Obama’s Attorney General, Eric Holder, was held in contempt of Congress for…defying subpoenas related to the Fast and Furious scandal. There were at least eight other times when Obama’s Administration defied congressional oversight, even preventing people from testifying (sound familiar?).

When Trump announced his “America First” policy during his inaugural, Democrats apparently took it as literally as one can.

Now, they howl over Trump’s latest outrage: the airstrike that killed Iranian terrorist Qassem Soleimani, who was in Iraq fomenting attacks against the American embassy and, evidently, plotting future hits on American targets.

Washington Democrats whined about Trump authorizing a drone strike without their notification or consent. This, after Obama authorized at least 2,800 drone strikes in Iraq and Syria without congressional approval.

“When Obama accepted the Nobel Peace Prize in December 2009, he had authorized more drone strikes than George W. Bush had approved during his entire presidency. By his third year in office, Obama had approved the killings of twice as many suspected terrorists as had ever been imprisoned in Guantánamo Bay,” Newsweek reported.

Obama practically invented modern push-button warfare, for goodness’ sake! Eventually, the American people will have to choose between partisan disingenuousness or rank stupidity to explain Democratic reaction to Trump’s perfectly precedented decisions.

On Iran, Trump made a bold choice and sent a strong message that we aren’t going to take the regime’s provocations and hostility anymore. Obama sent them pallets of cash. Trump sent an MQ-9 Reaper.

Anyone who knows how this will all shake out is lying. They don’t. But the Commander-in-Chief took out the world’s most notorious terrorist, one with plenty of American blood on his hands. Trump is the good guy here, not the terrorist.

Yet, Democrats couldn’t wait to pounce. How many statements included perfunctory “yeah, Soleimani was a bad guy, but…” construction before hammering Trump?

Here’s a pro-tip: If your statement has a “but” in the middle (I’m looking at you, Elizabeth Warren), just eliminate the throat-clearing, political pablum that came before it and say what you really mean. We get it. Iranian Guy Bad, Orange Man Worse.

An interactive guide:Who is running for president in 2020?

This attitude will cost Democrats in the upcoming election. Not just on foreign policy, but across the board (they speak of the economy as though we are in another Great Depression). They just can’t give Trump an inch no matter how safe or prosperous the world is, thanks at least in part to the president’s decisions.

It hasn’t always been this way. After the death of Osama bin Laden, Republicans praised Obama’s decision to get him.

“Former Vice President Dick Cheney declared, ‘The administration clearly deserves credit for the success of the operation.’ New York’s former mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, said, ‘I admire the courage of the president.’ And Donald J. Trump declared, ‘I want to personally congratulate President Obama,’” according to the New York Times.

But no such allowance is given to President Trump, even when he kills a terrorist arguably more consequential and certainly more dangerous than bin Laden himself. As commentator Guy Benson tweeted, “The US auto industry is alive, and Baghdadi/Soleimani are dead,” referencing the ISIS leader Trump had killed a few months ago and recalling Obama’s reelection slogan.

Or, as Mr. Serling might say, “Democrats will soon wake up from their amnesia to an old lesson: Past is prologue. And it’s a Shakespearean seminar most acutely taken…in The Twilight Zone.”

Craft brings her rural roots, lessons to the national—and international—scenes





A little girl in Glasgow, Kentucky, raised her hand in her classroom at Bunch Middle School in 1973 to ask a question about the map on the wall. Fascinated by the world beyond her rural Kentucky home, the girl wondered: Will I ever visit any of it?

Fast forward to a crisp Friday last fall. The location is the United Nations Security Council meeting in New York City, and that Glasgow girl—now 57 and serving as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations—raised her hand again, this time to deliver a statement on the unfolding catastrophe in Yemen.

“We are proud of our continued role as one of the largest humanitarian contributors,” she says, “because the programs the United States funds … have a profound impact on the lives of ordinary Yemenis.”

The speaker is Kelly Craft, a Kentuckian with a long history in Republican politics, now on a rocket ship ride up the diplomatic food chain.

“I developed the moral compass needed for this job growing up in Glasgow. It has never failed me,” Craft says over lunch at a nearby Italian restaurant, where the waitstaff (and many others around the city) has grown to love the new American ambassador in town. After just a few months on the job, Craft has earned a reputation for treating everyone she meets—from security guards to fellow ambassadors—with the same level of respect.

A voracious letter writer, Craft wakes at 4:30 a.m. to handwrite notes to every new acquaintance before embarking on a 7-mile run through Central Park. A personal aide says Craft’s letter production reaches several dozen per day.

“I like her a lot!” bubbles the young woman manning a check-in table in the lobby of the U.S. Mission to the U.N., Craft’s office.

“She’s very charismatic, but extremely humble,” says another State Department staffer. For her part, Craft readily admits she has a lot to learn and spends a large chunk of each morning reading briefing materials to prepare for the day’s meetings.

“She listens, and she has strong connections to Washington,” according to Scott Taylor, a member of the State Department staff that advises Craft. “She’s actively trying to jump into situations where the United States can bring hope.”

Every person has value

Craft, who previously served as President Donald Trump’s U.S. ambassador to Canada from 2017 until she won Senate confirmation to her current post in 2019, says she prays for a chance to make a difference every day.

“God, give me a life to change tomorrow,” is Craft’s faithful, and nightly, refrain.

Talk with Craft for any amount of time and it’s clear that her faith in God underpins her public service. An October trip to South Sudan, Africa’s newest nation but one afflicted by political strife, drought and massive food shortages, really stuck with her.

“I felt such a burden to help, especially the children,” Craft says, noting that some 7 million South Sudanese are hungry. “I was carrying all of them with me on that plane ride home.”

Despite the country’s challenges, Craft’s visit was marked by the international language of smiles. In the town of Malakal in the country’s Upper Nile region, dozens of young students exchanged laughter with the ambassador, who also heard from women widowed during the Sudanese civil war.

And even some 7,000 miles from home, Craft found a home-court advantage in South Sudan. When she made a special trip to visit some of the 800 boys and girls who play basketball at a court named after famous Sudan native Manute Bol, both she and the players were decked out in University of Kentucky basketball shirts. Craft and her husband, Joe, are proud supporters of the Wildcats.

“One of my biggest requests was to spend some time with the basketball program here,” Craft told local reporters, “because it really promotes sports diplomacy and each player here is a student, and to really stress the importance of education and that they are role models today.”

The world faces an overwhelming number of humanitarian crises, many of them in remote places. Craft thinks her upbringing in rural Kentucky provides an immediate connection to people who live nowhere near an urban area.

“I grew up on a farm. When you are raised around people who work with their hands for a living, you really understand that every single person on this earth has value,” Craft says.

It was no accident that Craft chose South Sudan as her first overseas trip. Her views on the need for U.S. engagement in Africa were formed years ago, during her first U.N. stint as a delegate appointed by President George W. Bush.

“President Bush’s example and his initiative to cure AIDS on the African continent instilled in me the value of using diplomatic positions to help the less fortunate. And that’s what I am going to do,” Craft says. “It all goes back to human dignity, and that’s what I carry with me from Kentucky to the United Nations.”

She says she is proud to have served under two Republican presidents, even though they had distinctly different styles. Craft is grateful to President Trump for allowing her, from her perch in Toronto, to help renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement before promoting her to the U.N.

“Your personality, Mr. President has … given voice to many who thought their voice, their place, their standing, was forgotten for good,” Craft wrote in a thank you to the president (handwritten, of course, on her signature blue, engraved stationery). In her Kentucky upbringing, Craft knows she encountered many of those “forgotten” Americans who found their way into Trump’s winning coalition.

Craft exudes an infectious sense that anything is possible, and she hopes to inspire young girls growing up in rural Kentucky to aim high. She didn’t expect to be in perhaps the most important diplomatic post held by a Kentuckian since Henry Clay served as secretary of state under President John Quincy Adams, but now that she holds it, it’s evident that Craft won’t squander the opportunity.

“I never want to face the question ‘Why didn’t you?’ when I go home to Kentucky,” Craft says. “And when I meet God, I’m trying to earn a simple, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant.’”",1,https://www.kentuckyliving.com/news/from-kentucky-to-the-united-nations

Where Does the Time Go?

Hopefully your business emails and frantic work texts have slowed to a trickle by now. The Christmas season offers us a time to reflect on the year past and to consider what you might do with the next year the Lord has laid before us.

If I have one resolution for the coming year, it is to stop and think more often. To turn off the noise. To say “no” more often and use that time, instead, to consider the things that matter.

Stopping and thinking. It’s something we do too little of these days. We react to every email and text at warp speed. We make snap decisions. We drink from a fire hose daily, pretending to have it under control but quietly wondering if anyone else notices just how drenched we are.

How often do we engage in moments of reflection, not as sentimental exercises, but as guideposts for planning the best use of our time? How can we make ourselves, and the people who matter most to us, more fulfilled? How often do we really just … stop and think?

Not often enough. Why? Because of the time it takes. There never seems to be enough time to stop and ask ourselves: “What’s important? Does this matter? Is there a better way?”

""Because I’ve never seen a partridge in a pear tree and because the thought of lords a’ leapin’ keeps me awake at night, I decided to create my own 12 days of Christmas gift list. My Christmas wish is that these gifts find you during this holiday season.

May the first day of Christmas bring you excitement; excitement for the season and for the personal and professional challenges and opportunities that lie ahead over the next year.

May the second day of Christmas bring you joy in places and situations that you never thought possible.

May the third day of Christmas bring you chocolate cake; after all, it’s Christmas!

May the fourth day of Christmas bring you peace; peace to resolve those inner conflicts we all face or to help mend fences with a co-worker or neighbor. The world is overcrowded with angry people. We don’t need any more.

May the fifth day of Christmas bring you contentment; contentment to help you appreciate that while every day may not be a bed of roses, each day brings with it seeds of optimism and possibility.

May the sixth day of Christmas bring you more chocolate cake; after all, it’s still Christmas!

May the seventh day of Christmas bring you frankincense and myrrh, so, finally, after all these years, you know exactly what that stuff is!

May the eighth day of Christmas bring you (if you’re a Missouri Tigers fan) a Cotton Bowl-pickin’ good time in Dallas on New Year’s Day.

May the ninth day of Christmas bring you a white dress shirt, size 18 collar and... whoops, wrong list.

May the tenth day of Christmas bring you the idealism of small children, the energy of teenagers, the realism of middle age and the wisdom of old age.

May the eleventh day of Christmas bring you happiness. Some will find it in the third and sixth days of Christmas. Others may find the search more difficult but keep looking, it’s out there.

And may the twelfth day of Christmas bring you a gift so small it would fit under any tree, so large, no box could contain it, so inexpensive, a child could afford it, and so priceless, no one could ever buy it; the gift of time, time to treasure who you have, what you have and why you have it for as long as time will allow.""

Rick Arnold of St. Louis, Missouri, wrote those words in December of 2007. He didn’t know it, but that Christmas would be his last. His family, including his brother, Joe Arnold of Louisville, circulate Rick’s words to remind each other of the value of Rick’s 12th-day gift: time.

Hug your children and family one extra time. Call an old friend long reduced to a passing blur on your Facebook timeline. And take time for yourself to consider the best use of God’s most precious gift to us all: time on this Earth.

Merry Christmas, dear readers, and a happy and productive New Year to you.

Hearing former Vice President Joe Biden call an Iowa farmer a “damn liar” the other day — and then watching Biden challenge that same 83-year-old man to a push-up contest, a foot race and an IQ test — made me wonder: What would it actually take to beat Donald Trump, and which of the Democratic candidates possesses that quality?

Biden’s style — a poor man’s Jed Bartlet meets Bizarro Popeye — seems unlikely to succeed. According to Democrats, we already have an ill-tempered, gaffe-prone elderly bully in the White House with a blind spot for his children. Why would they nominate someone so similar?

I subscribe, rather, to the Extreme Pendulum Swing Theory of Presidential Displacement, wherein changing the party in power requires the total opposite of the current chief executive. Not in policy, necessarily, but in style and attitude.

Voters want a big reversal

In 1980, a feckless and besweatered Jimmy Carter gave way to the robust Ronald Reagan, whose strong and confident approach offered a shot in the arm to a country that had been down itself for over a decade.

In 1992, fuddy-duddy throwback George H. W. Bush lost to the cool and modern Bill Clinton. A lifetime of service? Please. This guy plays the saxophone on late-night TV!

In 2000, George W. Bush restored “honor and dignity to the White House.” After eight years of personal scandal and drama, the nation turned to a moral, conservative family man as it punished Al Gore for Bill Clinton’s numerous sins.

In 2008, the sales job was easy — America wants its seat back at the cool kids’ table. Barack Obama forms articulate and complete sentences, shoots hoops, hangs with celebrities and sounds like he has all the answers. Sold.

And in 2016, a nation no longer concerned with experience bought Donald Trump’s anti-elite pitch, as he railed against the elitist in the White House and the one opposing him. With the country having lurched too far left too fast, Trump’s job was easy.

So which 2020 Democrats provide enough opposite magic? There are three: Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar and Andrew Yang.

For reasons already explored, Biden is too much of a bully and a blowhard to fit this theory. Elizabeth Warren seems like an opposite on her face, but is she? For all the carping Democrats do about Trump making things up, Warren’s penchant for whoppers makes her a future Burger King franchisee. And she lacks a contrasting optimism to boot. Warren’s angrier about the personal hardships she made up than most people are about their real travails.

Mike Bloomberg? Septuagenarian New York City billionaire with an authoritarian streak who pisses people off on the regular. A reboot with different hair. And Bernie Sanders’ “get off my lawn” angry white man populism seems all too familiar.

Rise of the nerdy wonks

But Buttigieg, Klobuchar and Yang — while not exactly the ’27 Yankees of American politics — represent a near opposite choice. And Democrats often gravitate to and win with “nerdy wonks,” according to one Democratic strategist I trust.

In Buttigieg, you have a young, Ivy League-educated Navy veteran who speaks softly and offers a contrasting attitude regarding America’s place in the world. He enjoys Middle America street cred while espousing big-city liberal values. His biggest similarity to Trump? St. Pete’s confidence and ambition far outstrip his experience. Somewhere, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker is screaming (crying?) into a pillow watching Buttigieg’s rise and, I suppose, stands ready to fill this slot should the South Bend mayor falter.

Klobuchar, another Midwesterner, is a U.S. senator with real-deal political experience. Her deliberate and understated style (at least in public) is the opposite of bombastic. Nominating a woman plays to the gaping gender gap that has opened on Trump’s job approval. Her most Trump-like trait could be in the way she treats staff in private, if you believe the stories. Think Hillary Clinton without the nine tons of baggage and condescension.

Yang is a details-oriented Asian technocrat who, as he often says, likes math. He’s young and has worked in the modern economy as well as the non-profit sector. He appears to be having fun — how novel! While I find him to be Trump’s opposite in almost every way, his one similarity comes in his instinct that impeachment is ""a loser"" for Democrats.

“If all that happens is all of the Democrats are talking about impeachment that fails, then it seems like there is no vision,” Yang said. “It seems like all we can do is throw ineffective rocks at Donald Trump, and then it ends up leading unfortunately toward his re-election.”

I still consider Trump the favorite, although his struggles with women and college-educated whites are real political problems. To ride the pendulum fully across America’s political axis in 2020 and turn Election Day into Opposite Day, Democrats might find their best chance among this threesome.

In 2008, the sales job was easy — America wants its seat back at the cool kids’ table. Barack Obama forms articulate and complete sentences, shoots hoops, hangs with celebrities and sounds like he has all the answers. Sold.

And in 2016, a nation no longer concerned with experience bought Donald Trump’s anti-elite pitch, as he railed against the elitist in the White House and the one opposing him. With the country having lurched too far left too fast, Trump’s job was easy.

So which 2020 Democrats provide enough opposite magic? There are three: Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar and Andrew Yang.

For reasons already explored, Biden is too much of a bully and a blowhard to fit this theory. Elizabeth Warren seems like an opposite on her face, but is she? For all the carping Democrats do about Trump making things up, Warren’s penchant for whoppers makes her a future Burger King franchisee. And she lacks a contrasting optimism to boot. Warren’s angrier about the personal hardships she made up than most people are about their real travails.

Mike Bloomberg? Septuagenarian New York City billionaire with an authoritarian streak who pisses people off on the regular. A reboot with different hair. And Bernie Sanders’ “get off my lawn” angry white man populism seems all too familiar.

Rise of the nerdy wonks

But Buttigieg, Klobuchar and Yang — while not exactly the ’27 Yankees of American politics — represent a near opposite choice. And Democrats often gravitate to and win with “nerdy wonks,” according to one Democratic strategist I trust.

In Buttigieg, you have a young, Ivy League-educated Navy veteran who speaks softly and offers a contrasting attitude regarding America’s place in the world. He enjoys Middle America street cred while espousing big-city liberal values. His biggest similarity to Trump? St. Pete’s confidence and ambition far outstrip his experience. Somewhere, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey is screaming (crying?) into a pillow watching Buttigieg’s rise and, I suppose, stands ready to fill this slot should the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, falter.

Even whites can fight for black equality:Pete Buttigieg's real 'black problem': He has been convicted of white privilege

Klobuchar, another Midwesterner, is a U.S. senator with real-deal political experience. Her deliberate and understated style (at least in public) is the opposite of bombastic. Nominating a woman plays to the gaping gender gap that has opened on Trump’s job approval. Her most Trump-like trait could be in the way she treats staff in private, if you believe the stories. Think Hillary Clinton without the 9 tons of baggage and condescension.

Yang is a detail-oriented Asian American technocrat who, as he often says, likes math. He’s young and has worked in the modern economy as well as the nonprofit sector. He appears to be having fun — how novel! While I find him to be Trump’s opposite in almost every way, his one similarity comes in his instinct that impeachment is ""a loser"" for Democrats.

“If all that happens is all of the Democrats are talking about impeachment that fails, then it seems like there is no vision,” Yang told the Rolling Stone magazine. “It seems like all we can do is throw ineffective rocks at Donald Trump, and then it ends up leading unfortunately toward his reelection.”

I still consider Trump the favorite, although his struggles with women and college-educated whites are real political problems. To ride the pendulum fully across America’s political axis in 2020 and turn Election Day into Opposite Day, Democrats might find their best chance among this threesome.

Hearing former Vice President Joe Biden call an Iowa farmer a “damn liar” the other day — and then watching Biden challenge that same 83-year-old man to a push-up contest, a foot race and an IQ test — made me wonder: What would it actually take to beat Donald Trump, and which of the Democratic candidates possesses that quality?

Biden’s style — a poor man’s Jed Bartlet meets Bizarro Popeye — seems unlikely to succeed. According to Democrats, we already have an ill-tempered, gaffe-prone elderly bully in the White House with a blind spot for his children. Why would they nominate someone so similar?

I subscribe, rather, to the Extreme Pendulum Swing Theory of Presidential Displacement, wherein changing the party in power requires the total opposite of the current chief executive. Not in policy, necessarily, but in style and attitude.

In 1980, a feckless and besweatered Jimmy Carter gave way to the robust Ronald Reagan, whose strong and confident approach offered a shot in the arm to a country that had been down itself for over a decade.

In 1992, fuddy-duddy throwback George H. W. Bush lost to the cool and modern Bill Clinton. A lifetime of service? Please. This guy plays the saxophone on late-night TV!

In 2000, George W. Bush restored “honor and dignity to the White House.” After eight years of personal scandal and drama, the nation turned to a moral, conservative family man as it punished Al Gore for Bill Clinton’s numerous sins.

In 2016, Donald Trump’s message of busting political correctness won him the White House. Rejecting the Democratic Party’s identity politics run amok was a sneaky good strategy, working like a charm among working-class voters in America’s heartland. Trump, though he had just become a Republican five minutes ago, better sensed than the party’s established leaders the emotional needs of rank-and-file Republicans.

For all his faults, this is Trump’s superpower — sensing cultural undercurrents and reflecting the emotions of his target audience. He often says what regular folks are thinking but don’t feel they are allowed to verbalize.

Today, a great many Americans feel angst about their children inheriting a country that allows for the indiscriminate destruction of reputations via “cancel culture” and promotes narratives over truths in the name of political correctness. In 2020, Trump can rekindle his old strategy by giving voice to these concerns to overcome serious political headwinds.

Scott Jennings:How Beshear deals with GOP will decide if term is Kentucky Democrats' last gasp

Extreme uneasiness exists in middle America over cancel culture, the practice of journalists and woke activists unearthing old utterances of celebrities, athletes, and even some regular people for the purpose of embarrassing them and ruining their lives.

Do some human beings say or tweet dumb things? Yes. Does it often happen when a person is younger, less experienced in the world and not enlightened enough to know that at some point in the future someone might find their thoughtless tweet offensive? You bet.

If there’s anyone in America who could rally the canceled to his cause, it's Trump, who faces cancellation attempts every day. Heck, several Democrats have proposed taking his twitter feed for violating the platform’s terms of service.

But that’s the point — why should we tolerate a society in which a group of inquisitors is given carte blanche to silence people they don’t like, banish political thoughts that aren’t welcome in liberal enclaves and ruin people’s lives over things uttered years ago? Never one to eschew affiliation with the controversial, Trump is uniquely positioned to make this a voting issue in 2020.

In Washington, D.C., when a 12-year-old African American girl claimed that three white boys at her private Christian school pinned her down and shaved her dreadlocks, the media predictably fell for it hook, line and sinker, demanding answers of Vice President Mike Pence’s wife, Karen, who teaches at the school.

The account was too perfect for media types who crave stories confirming their own political biases: white-on-black violence, Christian school, connection to Trump. Instead of seeking the truth, however, the media — just as it did with the Covington Catholic and Jussie Smollett stories — was blinded by a narrative instead of approaching the fantastical claim with caution.

After a few days, the little girl confessed to making it up. I don’t blame her; in America these days, a good narrative is better than the truth when you want attention. Just ask the liberal politicians seeking the Democratic nomination for president.

Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris, for instance, falsely tweeted a debunked allegation that Michael Brown was “murdered” by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, never mind that President Barack Obama’s Department of Justice disproved the “hands up, don’t shoot” narrative long ago. In doing so, Warren and Harris cravenly served their political ends without regard for the societal damage done by spreading falsehoods on such tragic stories.

Scott Jennings:Trump's no angel, but liberals with their ugly threats have become what they claim to hate

Warren’s use of false narratives extends to her own origin story, which now includes multiple fabrications including that she is Native American and was once fired from a teaching job for getting pregnant. Last week, she misled a voter about sending her children to private school (she did, but claimed she didn’t).

Warren is not a “woman of color,” despite allowing employers to describe her as such, nor was she fired in the 1970s for becoming pregnant, according to recently discovered school board documents. But being a plain old white woman who declines job offers and is wealthy enough to send her kids to private school doesn’t sell in today’s Democratic Party, so she conjured a put-upon alter ego and rocketed to the top of the primary field.

No wonder our kids are inventing plights of their very own.

Americans are rightly worried about their children inheriting a sick culture. President Trump can jujitsu his political problems by relentlessly focusing on the need to defeat this cancer; he’ll get a lot of Amens in flyover country (think Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin) if he does, and no Democratic contender has the wherewithal to stop him.

147,Jennings,Scott,latimes,"Day One of the public House impeachment hearings on President Trump is in the books, and nothing that happened will move public opinion in a meaningful way. The folks who have wanted to impeach Trump since he won the presidency still do, and the folks who don’t still don’t.

In other words, it’s a lost day for Democrats.

The burden of proof is on Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank) to do more than secure impeachment, which is all but certain. Their job is to conduct these hearings in a way that moves public opinion to the point that the Senate will convict the president. That means giving Republican senators something that changes their impression of Trump’s conduct of Ukraine foreign policy. What’s alleged may make many members of the GOP uncomfortable, but it doesn’t come remotely close to requiring that the president be removed from office.

The opening-day witnesses — diplomatic officials Bill Taylor and George Kent — testified professionally and with honor, but they failed to deliver a made-for-TV gotcha. Rather, they simply reiterated that they had no firsthand knowledge of the president’s interactions and had not had conversations with the president directly.

“What I can do here for you today is tell you what I heard from people,” Taylor said at one point to the Democratic counsel, which is not exactly compelling evidence if you are trying to convince the American people that what happened is worthy of taking down a presidency. In Taylor’s defense, he said he did not appear as a witness for either side of this debate, but obviously Democrats were hoping people would view him as a witness helpful to their impeachment ambitions.

One of the best defenses Trump has against the allegations at issue is that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has stated publicly that he did not personally feel pressured during his July 25 phone call with Trump. Under questioning by Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-Texas), Taylor said he “had no reason to doubt” what Zelensky said.

Ratcliffe also scored points by asking both witnesses if they had come before the committee to report any offenses stemming from the Trump-Zelensky call that warranted impeachment. Neither would say yes, which for Democrats was a deflating moment.

Taylor did offer one significant element to the drama, related to Trump’s Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, who is slated to testify next week. Taylor claimed that a member of his staff overheard Sondland having a phone conversation with the president (at a public restaurant, no less!) regarding Trump’s desire for an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.

While Sondland’s appearance before Congress and the public was always sure to be must-see TV, Taylor’s revelation raises the stakes related to his testimony. It will be interesting to see how the White House attacks the comments of its own appointee and someone who apparently does have first-hand knowledge of the president’s conversations and state of mind.

If you listened closely to Wednesday’s testimony — especially New York Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik’s afternoon questioning of the witnesses — you were perhaps compelled to Google the underlying policy issues at play between the United States and Ukraine. If you did, you would have been reminded that Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014, during President Obama’s administration.

The invasion was a big deal. The Russians were testing Obama just as they were also embarking on their successful attempts to meddle in our 2016 presidential election. At home and abroad, Obama dithered when confronted with Russian aggression.

For two years, Obama and Biden, supposedly a Ukrainian savant, refused to send our allies lethal aid to beat back the Russians. And we know from the report of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III that they did nothing to stop election meddling. Russia beat Obama on both fronts.

An inconvenient truth is emerging for Democrats: if you are worried about Russian influence, Trump has done a much better job than Obama ever did. Under Trump, we actually sent the Ukrainians lethal aid, a policy that Taylor and Kent admitted is better than it was before. And under Trump, the 2018 midterm election was apparently conducted free from Russian meddling.

Democrats want to overturn an election based on merely a momentary halting of military assistance to Ukraine by Trump’s White House because Trump raised questions about corruption in a notoriously corrupt country. But they never bothered to ask the Obama White House why they held up lethal aid for two years when it was sorely needed.

Democrats claim Trump’s intent was corrupt and an abuse of power, but the net result of Trump’s decisions, by any measure, is a stronger response to the Russians than Obama ever delivered. Question Trump’s judgment in sending people like Sondland and Rudolph W. Giuliani to Europe all you want, but impeachment? Give me a break.

A friend recently tweeted a timely quote from etiquette maven Emily Post:

“Manners are a sensitive awareness of the feelings of others. If you have that awareness, you have good manners, no matter what fork you use,” Post said.

Recent events remind us that the American left — in its crazed, anti-Trump state — is afflicted with an extreme lack of awareness, fully, as we say in the country, “ate up” with politics.

Social media was abuzz last week with video of U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell taken at the memorial service for Congressman Elijah Cummings. One of Cummings’ pallbearers — a man named Bobby Rankin — pointedly snubbed McConnell, refusing to shake the Senate majority leader’s hand.

The latest:Pallbearer at Elijah Cummings memorial snubs Mitch McConnell in handshake line

Twitter liberals predictably celebrated the incivility, posting the video ad nauseam with comments like “this may be the best thing I’ve ever watched.” Never mind that McConnell, a Republican, delivered beautiful remarks about the Baltimore Democrat’s work to heal his city’s racial divide. The snub led news accounts of McConnell’s attendance instead of the words he spoke.

Cummings, a man known for his bipartisan friendships and calls for unity and peace, would likely not have approved of such rudeness or its amplification, which was as lamentable as the act itself. The media melts down when Trump acts petty but celebrated the clowning of a conservative at a funeral. I suppose honoring a dead man’s legacy isn’t as important as collecting those sweet, sweet retweets.

Back in McConnell’s hometown of Louisville, an elementary schoolteacher was making similar news for dragging politics into the classroom. As reported by The Courier Journal:

“Jefferson County parent Katina Alami wrote in a social media post Monday that her fourth-graders at Stopher Elementary got a homework assignment in which they were to determine whether commas were needed in several sentences. One sentence read: ‘He ran against Matt Bevin, for governor of KY so I voted for him.’”

It is no secret that Kentucky’s public schoolteachers have largely lined up against Bevin, the state’s Republican governor. But for a teacher to infect her classroom with political animus sends the wrong signal to children who need role models that aren’t ate up.

Opinion:Democrats want to close churches and raise taxes to pay for sex reassignment

Somewhere above America, a Southwest Airlines flight attendant couldn’t help himself when confronted with a Trump-loving passenger decked out in a T-shirt supportive of the president. The attendant posted a picture of the passenger on his personal Facebook page with the caption: ""Someone did NOT get my most Positively Outrageous Service today on my flight ... #notgoingtosuckitup #dumpTrump #eeew.''

Another passenger complained on Southwest’s Facebook page, prompting a PR headache for the company. Several commenters supported the ate-up attendant with comments like “Give this man a raise.”

Do liberals desire a separate but equal economy, where they won’t be forced to encounter people who are different? I seem to recall this idea being tried before, but I'll have to research it and get back to you.

Even talk show host Ellen DeGeneres, a reliably liberal Hollywood voice, wasn’t immune from backlash as she modeled good manners recently. After a photo surfaced of DeGeneres and former President George W. Bush laughing together at a football game, the ate-up Left came for her, too.

“Sorry, until George W. Bush is brought to justice… we can’t even begin to talk about kindness,"" tweeted actor Mark Ruffalo. The Incredible Woke — er, Hulk — is truly ate up, and he was supported by several other celebrities.

For her part, DeGeneres delivered a terrific monologue about her friendship with Bush.

“But just because I don’t agree with someone on everything doesn’t mean that I’m not going to be friends with them,” she said. “When I say, ‘be kind to one another,’ I don’t only mean the people that think the same way that you do. I mean be kind to everyone.”

2019 Kentucky election:All this Trump impeachment talk will help Matt Bevin win the Kentucky governor's race

We are reminded daily by our political media of how uncivil and mean President Trump can be, each of his Twitter insults begetting hours of breathless commentary. And some of it is right – an American president should portray kindness more often than meanness. But the people who hate Trump and his party the most are at least equivalent offenders, and oftentimes worse.

Emily Post once said: “Manner is personality — the outward manifestation of one’s innate character and attitude toward life.”

If the American Left hopes to wrest the presidency from Donald Trump, it needs more DeGeneres and Post, and less of the “ate up.”

I’m not sure what’s more jaw-dropping — the disdain Democratic presidential candidates have for rural Americans and their values, or their willingness to make it a centerpiece of their campaign to unseat Donald Trump.

Did they learn nothing from 2016?

Beto O’Rourke’s plans to confiscate guns from law-abiding citizens and to put churches out of business, combined with Elizabeth Warren’s stinging insult that conservative religious people are too ugly to find a suitable mate, are good reminders that the national Democratic Party has simply abandoned rural and Middle America. The presidential candidates' appearance last week at a CNN town hall tackling LGBTQ issues revealed a serious weakness in Democratic plans to defeat President Donald Trump.

Jennings:All this Trump impeachment talk will help Matt Bevin win the Kentucky governor's race

To be fair, these sentiments have been around on the left for quite some time, even if they used to keep it under wraps. When Barack Obama bemoaned “bitter” people “clinging” to guns and religion in 2008, he did so at a private fundraiser in San Francisco. His rival for the nomination, Hillary Clinton, used it against him in fliers and on the stump, saying she was “taken aback” at his “elitist” remarks.

Obama said the quiet part out loud, and Clinton pounced.

But Obama won the war, and Hillary learned her lesson. By 2016, she had gone from defending people in “small-town America” and handing out “I’m not bitter” stickers to calling Trump supporters “deplorable.”

And now, in the run-up to the 2020 election, the veil is completely off. The question was simple and so was the answer from O’Rourke, who has little chance to win his party’s nomination but has become a suicide bomber for whoever does.

“Do you think religious institutions like colleges, churches, charities — should they lose their tax-exempt status if they oppose same-sex marriage?” asked moderator Don Lemon. O’Rourke didn’t hesitate: “Yes.”

Say goodbye to your place of worship if Beto gets his way.

Jennings:With Democrats, every story ends the same: Republicans are racists or Russians

Somewhere, a staffer at the Democratic National Committee is wondering: What do we tell African-American church pastors as we try to turn out their congregants? You know, the ones who failed to show up in 2016.

This followed O’Rourke’s previous call for mandatory gun confiscation, which, to quote rural philosopher Emmett from the movie ""Roadhouse,"" went over “like an elevator in an outhouse.”

Beto’s answers on guns and religion weren’t all that surprising coming from a thoughtless, skateboarding ne'er-do-well trying to goose a flailing campaign. But the thunderous applause from the studio audiences will ring in the ears of rural voters for quite some time. It’s not just Beto — base Democrats really believe this stuff.

Front-running Elizabeth Warren is no better. The odds-on-favorite to win the nomination took Hillary’s “deplorable” quip one step further. Here’s NBC News recounting her viral moment:

“Let's say you're on the campaign trail and a supporter approaches you and says, 'Senator, I'm old-fashioned, and my faith teaches me that marriage is between one man and one woman.' What is your response?"" asked Morgan Cox, board chairman of the Human Rights Campaign, which co-hosted the event.

""Well, I'm going to assume it's a guy who said that, and I'm going to say, 'Then just marry one woman. I'm cool with that,'"" Warren said, to laughs and applause from the audience.

As the clapping subsided, the senator paused before going in for the kill — ""assuming you can find one"" — drawing sustained applause and cheers from the crowd.

Jennings:Trump's no angel, but liberals with their ugly threats have become what they claim to hate

It wasn’t good enough to stop at “marry one woman.” Playing to the audience, she added the final insult — that people (especially men) with conservative values on traditional marriage are just plain ugly. And this comes from a Democrat who routinely attacks Trump as divisive. What a hypocrite.

But it was an absolutely nuts policy position Warren took that will haunt her in swing states with substantial rural areas. Back in 2012, a more rational Warren, then a candidate for U.S. Senate, did not support using taxpayer dollars to pay for transgender surgeries for prison inmates.

But 2020’s version of Warren, further woke and delighted by applause from small crowds locked in television studios, said that now she believes inmates are “entitled” to transgender surgery, at taxpayer expense. Warren perhaps was catching up to former Vice President Joe Biden, who endorsed taxpayer-funded transgender surgeries back in September.

Imagine Democrats going door-to-door in the Pennsylvania countryside next fall on a platform of, “Well, I see that you are too ugly to find a spouse. Anyhow, we are raising your taxes to pay for inmate gender reassignment surgery. Do you have your gun and church directory handy, by the way?”

I hope the applause is satisfying in 2019, because the 2020 electoral results in rural America won’t be.

It wasn’t good enough to stop at “marry one woman.” Playing to the audience, she added the final insult — that people (especially men) with conservative values on traditional marriage are just plain ugly. And this comes from a Democrat who routinely attacks Trump as divisive. What a hypocrite.

But it was an absolutely nuts policy position Warren took that will haunt her in swing states with substantial rural areas. Back in 2012, a more rational Warren, then a candidate for U.S. Senate, did not support using taxpayer dollars to pay for transgender surgeries for prison inmates.

But 2020’s version of Warren, further woke and delighted by applause from small crowds locked in television studios, said that now she believes inmates are “entitled” to transgender surgery, at taxpayer expense. Warren perhaps was catching up to former Vice President Joe Biden, who endorsed taxpayer-funded transgender surgeries back in September.

Imagine Democrats going door-to-door in the Pennsylvania countryside next fall on a platform of, “Well, I see that you are too ugly to find a spouse. Anyhow, we are raising your taxes to pay for inmate gender reassignment surgery. Do you have your gun and church directory handy, by the way?”

I hope the applause is satisfying in 2019, because the 2020 electoral results in rural America won’t be.

As of last Thursday, the father and political consultant of Kentucky’s Democratic secretary of state are headed to federal prison to join the chief deputy of Kentucky’s Democratic attorney general and nominee for governor.

Alison Grimes and Andy Beshear, the top two Democrats in Frankfort, may be divided by a decadeslong intraparty feud between their fathers, but they are united by the misdeeds and malfeasance of their family legacy as voters prepare to render judgment on state government once more in November.

The convictions of Jerry Lundergan, Grimes’ father and a former Democratic Party chairman, and Dale Emmons, a longtime cog in the Democratic Party’s state wheel, of breaking laws related to Grimes’ unsuccessful campaign against U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell in 2014, breathed fresh life into an argument Gov. Matt Bevin has made many times: that voters should reject, once and for all, the culture of corruption and self-dealing that defined Kentucky’s Democratic Party for decades.

Not only were Lundergan and Emmons found guilty of breaking laws in the 2014 election, but federal prosecutors introduced evidence of similar corruption in the 2011 and 2015 elections, in which Grimes won and then successfully defended her current office.

Grimes claims she wasn’t aware of what was happening in the large campaign that was built for her in 2014, but that defense won’t fly in the cases of her much smaller races for state office. While approximately $18 million was spent by Grimes’ Senate campaign in 2014, less than $1 million was spent in each of her state races.

Background:What to know about the Jerry Lundergan and Dale Emmons convictions

It is hard to believe that over three campaigns, Grimes could claim no awareness whatsoever of how and why money was being spent on her behalf, out of committees bearing her name. Every Democrat who appeared on the ballot with Grimes in 2015 —Beshear especially — must now answer questions about whether they knew of campaign finance misdeeds that may have changed the outcome of the election. Grimes won by just 22,000 votes. Beshear, just 2,201.

We must consider that illegal money injected by Democrats in the 2015 election unjustly carried not one, but two offices.

For Grimes, the end of the road has come. As we face what figures to be an incredibly close election, it has become clear that Grimes, who serves as Kentucky’s chief election administration official, is woefully compromised and must resign. If she refuses, Bevin should strongly consider calling the General Assembly into session for the purpose of impeachment.

Beyond the campaign finance shenanigans, Grimes has earned impeachment via her conduct in office. An investigation by journalists working for ProPublica and the Lexington Herald Leader discovered that Grimes used the state’s voter registration file “to look up political rivals, state investigators and a range of political operatives.”

This “led critics to conclude her office abused its access to the system to gain information about her political opponents and those involved in multiple investigations of her conduct while in office,” according to the reporting.

Scott Jennings:Liberals with their ugly threats have become what they claim to hate

Even as Grimes accessed the voter file for improper reasons, she was ignoring a federal court order to clean up the file. Hundreds of thousands of improperly registered voters appeared on Kentucky’s list, leading to the possibility of fraud and draining resources from the judicial system that relies on the voter list to notify people of jury duty.

But Grimes refused to abide by a federal consent decree to clean up the voter list, again showing her willingness to flout the law if it does not align with her hyperpartisan worldview.

There are addresses across the state with numerous registered voters attached to them because of Grimes’ failure to comply. I checked my own address before filing this piece and found the people we bought our house from more than two years ago — who moved out of state — are still registered here. One state representative told me people he bought his home from more than six years ago remain registered at his address.

Grimes is now under two investigations by special state prosecutors and three state agencies — turmoil that swirls as she prepares to oversee a gubernatorial election featuring two candidates with whom she has well-known differences. Given her history of flouting the law and her own campaigns’ evident engagement in election fraud, no Kentuckian can trust Grimes to impartially oversee this election. If something goes wrong, we cannot have a compromised secretary of state in the middle of it.

Her resignation is imperative, and her impeachment is warranted. Hopefully, Bevin and the leadership of the General Assembly are already discussing next steps.

Opinion:You can't legislate the crazy out of humanity, but some gun laws make sense

154,Jennings,Scott,gastongazette,"With Congress reconvening, President Donald Trump has a golden opportunity to “own the libs,” as the conservative kids online say.

The Democrats, helped by the media, have spent August taunting the president and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., claiming they don’t have the guts to buck the National Rifle Association and put a gun reform package on the floor. Republicans have a golden opportunity to rebut the claim and show America they are listening.

Here’s how. The president should publicly communicate to McConnell and the Senate Republican leadership precisely what he would sign into law, giving GOP leaders the direction and certainty they need to move forward.

The package should include an upgrade to the existing National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, which is designed to stop criminals and ineligible buyers from obtaining guns. The NICS system has prevented hundreds of thousands of people from acquiring guns each year (and more than 1.3 million people since its inception), and Congress updated it in 2018 after the Parkland, Fla., and Sutherland Springs, Texas, shootings.

But if there’s any way to further prevent criminals and mentally ill people from obtaining guns, policymakers must find a way. Polling clearly shows that Americans want something beyond what currently exists.

As it was with the “fix NICS” bill that passed in 2018, the goal of expanding background checks should be eliminating as many chances for mistakes as possible. Human error costs lives, as we learned in the Sutherland Springs, Texas, church shooting when the Air Force missed six opportunities to put the shooter on the no-buy registry over a domestic violence conviction.

The second part of the package would be federal incentives for states to enact “red flag laws,” like the ones in California and in 16 other states, which allow police, mental health professionals, family members and other key players to file court petitions to block gun acquisitions or temporarily remove guns from people believed to pose imminent risk to themselves or others.

With proper due process protections, this idea is directly responsive to the president’s call to address the mental health aspect of this problem. Does anyone doubt that “red flags” existed with the shooters in Dayton and Parkland?

The third part of the package ought to be a resolution condemning all groups that use political rhetoric to justify violence, whether they are white nationalists, eco-fascists or antifa vigilantes. By endorsing this, Trump can lead a simple, yet powerful, across-the-board condemnation of violence and violent rhetoric coming from all extremes of the political spectrum.

With the president’s promise to sign it, McConnell could put the reforms on the Senate floor for an up-or-down vote. Some Republicans wouldn’t follow the president, but I’d bet that enough would join with Senate Democrats to get 60 votes, the magic number.

Hesitant GOPers who fear a slippery slope on gun control should ask themselves if they want this issue legislated with Republicans in control of two of three legs of the policy stool or zero, a political possibility always just around the corner.

And think of the pleasure for the president in forcing Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., to make a tough choice — deliver Democratic votes for the package, thus handing Trump a win, or urge a vote against it on grounds it doesn’t go far enough, making his conference members appear to be craven grandstanders instead of problem solvers. Trump wins either way, whether Schumer puts up or shuts up.

If Trump signs a gun reform package, he’ll have a second feather in his I-did-what-Obama-couldn’t-do cap, alongside criminal justice reform. And he’ll have a great conversation starter for the suburban women who abandoned the GOP in 2018’s midterm.

But most importantly, the president can reassure Americans that our government refuses to sit idle in the face of horrific carnage, which has shattered families and our national psyche.

Good policy makes good politics, and Trump has a clear way to win on both fronts.

A recent study by UC Davis found that the California law led to the removal of firearms from about 400 people between 2016 and 2018. In one case cited by the researchers, a man had threatened to kill employees at his family's business. After his mother petitioned the court, 26 guns were confiscated from him.

It's hard to know how many of the 400 would have been mass shooters, but a small number of flags in the vast ocean of American gun owners is clearly not onerous.

The people who have lost their minds can’t wait to talk to you.

While participating in a charitable activity with my children and other parents and kids, a goofy guy who worked at the venue heard just enough of a conversation about politics to insert himself.

“Did you hear that one of the Koch brothers died?”

The parents just looked at each other. The goofball plowed ahead.

“Well here’s hoping to a happy reunion!” he finished, clumsily wrapping up the non sequitur before returning to his task.

The goofball looked so happy, simultaneously celebrating the death of one person while wishing it upon another in front of children, right after telling us how excited he was about the upcoming Bernie Sanders rally.

More from Jennings:All Democrats think Republicans are racists or Russians

The hackneyed sickness normally reserved for anonymous Twitter users is spilling over into real life.

Hurricane Dorian offered the latest weather-related madness. Democrats fanned out across television to claim President Donald Trump was more concerned with emergency response in Florida than Puerto Rico because of — you guessed it — racism.

“Puerto Ricans have brown skin!” they exclaimed, smugly explaining that Trump cared more about Florida because it has electoral votes and, presumably, only white people.

When confronted with inconvenient facts like Florida’s near 30% Hispanic population, they just stared into the cameras and forged ahead with their mindlessly partisan argument, which now includes the outrageous and false allegation that Trump murdered 3,000 Puerto Ricans after Hurricane Maria two years ago. It was a historically bad storm that struck a woefully unprepared island with a rickety utility infrastructure.

Related:Puerto Rico's had a rough two years; Hurricane Dorian isn't going to make things easier

The weather madness wasn’t confined to domestic politics. International morons couldn’t help themselves, either.

“I’m rooting for a direct hit on Mar a Lago!” tweeted former Canadian Prime Minister Kim Campbell, excitedly wishing death and destruction on the thousands who work and live near Trump’s Florida property.

She later attempted a lame apology but even lied then, claiming “sarcasm” when it clearly was not. Sometimes, a simple “I’m sorry that I’m an idiot” would suffice.

Out in Hollywood, liberal actress Debra Messing rekindled the spirit of 1947 by demanding publication of anyone attending an upcoming Trump fundraiser in Beverly Hills, presumably for the purpose of harassment or blacklisting by the left-wing folks who run America’s entertainment industry.

In the late 40’s and 1950’s, some 500 people in Hollywood were black or “grey” listed because of ugly politics. Messing wants the same thing today — for people with the wrong politics mocked in the town square and drummed from the business.

Blacklisting is all the rage in Hollywood, be it personal or geographic. Earlier this year, several studios and media companies said they wouldn’t produce content in Georgia after the state legislature passed a pro-life law.

How many thousands of Georgians who care little about politics and mostly about feeding their families would be devastated by this liberal boycott? Hollywood doesn’t care, of course, because no amount of human suffering should stop a good political tantrum and self-righteous preening.

Check out:Marc Murphy editorial cartoons for August 2019

We’re told by Democrats like Joe Biden that if Trump isn’t defeated, “the character of this nation will be fundamentally and forever altered.”

Has he checked on his own party, lately?

Biden seeks to lead a party full of activists who wish death on a conservative donor who invested in causes he cared about.

The internationalists with whom Biden claims kinship publicly wish for powerful hurricanes to kill Americans and destroy our property.

The people who fund Biden’s party openly advocate a return to McCarthyism, hoping to destroy the livelihoods of conservatives unwilling to acquiesce to liberal orthodoxy.

Death. Destruction. Personal ruin. All conditions wished upon conservatives by liberal Democrats, famous and ordinary, trained to hate by political leaders who blame Trump for the ills of the world while themselves obtusely accusing him of hate and death.

What voters do they hope to persuade with these savage threats and browbeating? When they do engage in policy discourse, it is filled with narrative instead of truth, lies instead of facts. They’ve become what they claim to hate.

Trump’s no angel. He frequently sets a bad example by taunting and insulting his enemies and engaging in untruthful hyperbole on matters large and small. His antics range from head scratching to cringe worthy. He makes thing harder than they ought to be.

And because of this, we are told we must return control of the government to the people who know better. Who are civil. Who don’t lie. Who treat everyone with respect.

Let me know when they show up.

When Congress reconvenes in September, President Trump has a golden opportunity to “own the libs,” as the conservative kids online say.

The Democrats, helped by the media, have spent August taunting the president and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), claiming they don’t have the guts to buck the National Rifle Association and put a gun reform package on the floor. Republicans have a golden opportunity to rebut the claim and show suburban America — which, according to the latest polls and focus groups have gone south on the GOP — that they are listening when it comes to this tragic American problem.

Signaling to shooting victims, their families and the American people that heinous acts like those in Gilroy, Calif., and El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, are unacceptable is the right thing to do. Americans know bad people will sometimes do bad things, no matter how hard we try to stop them, but we expect our politicians to counter such horrors with their best efforts.

Trump has an opportunity to do that, and simultaneously splash mud on liberals who politicize these tragedies.

Here’s how. The president should publicly communicate to McConnell and the Senate Republican leadership precisely what he would sign into law, giving GOP leaders the direction and certainty they need to move forward.

The package should include an upgrade to the existing National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, which is designed to stop criminals and ineligible buyers from obtaining guns. The NICS system has prevented hundreds of thousands of people from acquiring guns each year (and more than 1.3 million people since its inception), and Congress updated the system in 2018 after the Parkland, Fla., and Sutherland Springs, Texas, shootings.

But if there’s any way to further prevent criminals and mentally ill people from obtaining guns, policymakers must find a way. Polling clearly shows that Americans want something beyond what currently exists, and the president ought to give it to them. As it was with the “fix NICS” bill that passed in 2018, the goal of expanding background checks should be eliminating as many chances for mistakes as possible. Human error costs lives, as we learned in Sutherland Springs, when the Air Force missed six opportunities to put the shooter on the no-buy registry over a domestic violence conviction.

The second part of the package would be federal incentives for states to enact “red flag laws,” like the ones in California and in 16 other states, which allow police, mental health professionals, family members and other key players to file court petitions to block gun acquisitions or temporarily remove guns from people believed to pose imminent risk to themselves or others.

A recent study by UC Davis found that the California law led to the removal of firearms from about 400 people between 2016 and 2018. In one case cited by the researchers, a man had threatened to kill employees at his family’s business. After his mother petitioned the court, 26 guns were confiscated from him.

It’s hard to know how many of the 400 would have been mass shooters, but a small number of flags in the vast ocean of American gun owners is clearly not onerous. With proper due process protections, this idea is directly responsive to the president’s call to address the mental health aspect of this problem. Does anyone doubt that “red flags” existed with the shooters in Dayton and Parkland?

The third part of the package ought to be a resolution condemning all groups that use political rhetoric to justify violence, whether they are white nationalists, eco-fascists or antifa vigilantes. By endorsing this, Trump can lead a simple, yet powerful, across-the-board condemnation of violence and violent rhetoric coming from all extremes of the political spectrum.

With the president’s promise to sign it, McConnell could put the reforms on the Senate floor for an up-or-down vote. Some Republicans wouldn’t follow the president, but I’d bet that enough would join with Senate Democrats to get 60 votes, the magic number.

Trump wins either way, whether Schumer puts up or shuts up. If the president wanted to engage in some next-level jujitsu, he could throw in a ban on high-capacity magazine and drums like the one used by the shooter in Dayton. This is a step further than some conservatives want to go (and a step back from the nebulous assault weapons ban preferred by liberals) but would be a meaningful step in attempting to reduce the carnage that occurs in mass shootings. The president should compare the drums to bump stocks, which he banned already.

If Trump signs a gun reform package, he’ll have a second feather in his I-did-what-Obama-couldn’t-do cap, alongside criminal justice reform. And he’ll have a great conversation starter for the suburban women who abandoned the GOP in 2018’s midterm.

But most importantly, the president can reassure Americans that our government refuses to sit idle in the face of horrific carnage, which has shattered families and our national psyche. Good policy makes good politics, and Trump has a clear way to win on both fronts.

I loved the ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" books as a kid. To open the door, turn to page 183. To attack the dragon, turn to page 79. Sometimes the choices resulted in a dead end, but if you read long enough you navigated to a happy ending.

Democrats employ a “choose your own adventure” strategy in their arguments against Republicans, except in their sadistic story there’s no way out — every ending is the same.

You are a racist. The end.

You are a tool of the Kremlin. The end.

You are shameful. The end.

They plan to browbeat and silence anyone who protests, constructing evidence-free conspiracy theories along the way.

For President Donald Trump, all arguments lead Democrats to scream that Trump and his supporters are racists and, more recently, “white supremacists.”

Check out:Matt Jones says his new book, 'Mitch, Please!' will even appeal to fans of Mitch McConnell

Joe Lockhart, former press secretary to President Bill Clinton, tweeted: “Vote for Donald Trump, and you are a racist. Don’t hide it like a coward. Wear that racist badge proudly and see how it feels.”

Studies indicate between 6.7 million and 9.2 million voters switched from Barack Obama to Trump in 2016; calling them racist en masse doesn’t seem like a good strategy to win them back. If Democrats canvass with a “to absolve yourself of racism, vote for us” script, they should expect a fair number of doors slammed in their face.

Following Trump’s rhetorical scrape with the city of Baltimore and Rep. Elijah Cummings, a Rasmussen survey reported that 32% of Democrats believe “any white criticism of politicians of color is racist.” Perhaps they should heed the advice New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd had for Squad Leader Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Consider the possibility that people who disagree with you aren’t necessarily doing so because of race.

The attacks on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell are equally ridiculous and always lead to the same dumb place. The Washington Post, MSNBC and third-tier Democratic political operatives who survive by running scam political action committees are colluding on a ludicrous narrative: McConnell is responsible for Russian election interference in 2016 and is encouraging it in 2020.

Joe Gerth:Why is McConnell so upset about being called Moscow Mitch? Maybe it hits too close to home

Having failed miserably at pinning the Russian collusion story on Trump, Democrats have migrated this farce to McConnell.

I’ll pause as you fetch your tinfoil hat.

When McConnell defended himself, Democratic Senate Leader Chuck Schumer challenged him to “prove” that he isn’t a “Russian asset,” as columnist Dana Milbank alleged in the Washington Post.

In the grand tradition of Joseph McCarthy, Democrats want all Republicans to prove they aren’t racist or Russian, whether there’s any evidence supporting the assertion or not.

Milbank subsequently admitted that he “exaggerated” claims that McConnell had done nothing on election security (McConnell appropriated $380 million for it), proving his original argument was built on an absolute lie. But the farcical narrative continues because, hey, why let facts obstruct a good fundraising gimmick?

Liberals rage at McConnell as he restocks the federal judiciary at warp speed and embarrasses House Speaker Nancy Pelosi time and again, most recently in their border funding showdown. McConnell runs circles around Sen. Chuck Schumer, too, so Democrats construct arguments in which McConnell is the villain no matter what.

McConnell was hounded by comedian-turned-partisan-hack Jon Stewart and would-be challenger and local gaffe machine Amy McGrath to pass funding for the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund. McConnell met with the New York City’s first responders, pledged to pass their bill before August and delivered ahead of schedule.

You may want to read:Democrats call McConnell a 'hypocrite' for flip-flopping on Supreme Court stance

McGrath’s response?

“It's too bad that Mitch McConnell had to be shamed into doing the right thing here,” she said, despite the first responders themselves praising McConnell as being “nothing but gracious ... he’s in the 1% of people keeping their word in Washington D.C. And while we don’t always agree on everything with Mr. McConnell … he’s actually helped us get here today.”

Manufactured damnation was always McGrath’s plan whether McConnell passed the 9/11 bill or not. That sort of vapid, unethical tactic is unbecoming someone who touts their military training as their chief qualification for office. A former Marine, McGrath was trained “to exemplify the ultimate in ethical and moral behavior” and “to never lie.”

McGrath, now serving under Gen. Schumer’s command, will need serious remediation when this ill-advised tour is over.

Allegations that her campaign moved to have Democratic critic Matt Jones fired from his public affairs television show exemplify that McGrath’s days running as a military officer with confidence and integrity are over.

Voters will become numb to this tactic, even as McGrath and whatever socialist emerges from the Democratic presidential primary are cheered on by their dishonest Hollywood and media enablers. What thrills the urban bubble dwellers will smell rotten in Middle America, but Democrats have already made their choice:

167,Jennings,Scott,medium,"Sherry Jean Jennings, my stepmom for 34 years, died on August 8 at the age of 72. She raised my sister and me, and I was honored to deliver this eulogy of a one-of-a-kind woman today in Dawson Springs.

We are gathered here today to celebrate the life of one of the orneriest women any of us ever knew — Sherry Jean Jennings.

It’s ok. You can laugh. We all used to laugh about this wonderful person and the way she conducted herself.

She was ornery. And I don’t mean that in any negative or pejorative way. She was ornery in the way people had to be who grew up and raised a family in the era in which she lived.

In life and even in death, Sherry Jennings was ornery and stubborn until the end.

And she was just about perfect. God’s perfect, ornery woman, who was handed difficult circumstances from time to time but always made the best of them…in the best way she knew how.

And in doing so, she made us kids who we are today.

###

It takes a special person to take care of someone else’s kids.

But that’s what Sherry did for my sister, Krissy, and me. She attended our baseball and softball games, took us to our practices and school events, and cheered us on as though we were her own.

She rarely missed a game. Because sports were so important to us growing up, she made it a priority of hers. Sherry’s was often the loudest voice in the bleachers, and the umpires all knew exactly who our Mom was.

She took us everywhere.

When you are a kid, you expect things to just happen. You don’t think much about how tired your parents are when you ask them to take you here and there, when you snap at them because you don’t want to clean your room, or when you blatantly disregard some instruction they’ve given you.

That’s the beauty of being a kid — you are ignorant. And you act accordingly.

And the beauty of being a parent is having attained the wisdom to know that your kids don’t know any better when they act like little “heathens,” which is a label Sherry give us kids most days of the week.

My Dad will no doubt recall my breaking Sherry’s favorite lamp and throwing a baseball through the window of our little house on Oak Heights.

She likely wondered in those moments — what, Lord, have I done to deserve this punishment?

But no matter how bad we were, Sherry always stood up for us. She was a Tiger Mom before anyone invented the phrase. I distinctly remember her marching up to the schoolhouse one day and dressing down a teacher of mine in the middle of an auditorium.

I don’t remember what I’d done. I only remember Sherry Jennings savaging this person on my behalf. I stood there in awe, and with each indelible tongue lashing our bond grew stronger and stronger.

My sister recalls a similar story. She never let anyone do wrong by the kids in her household.

When you are a kid and your parents aren’t together, you sometimes wonder: who is going to take care of me? Who is looking out for me?

Sherry was our advocate. It was always her. And no matter how unruly we were, Sherry put her heart and soul into us. She bought in. She fully committed.

Not because we were hers, but because we were our Dad’s.

She loved us because she loved our Dad. And we loved her because we saw how much our Dad loved her. And we saw how hard she was fighting for us.

She put her heart and soul into us…into our family. And because she was all in, so were we.

###

Sherry Jennings was a worker. I don’t know how else to put it — she just worked. All the time.

And the idea that you have to keep working and fighting and scraping and clawing…that was her greatest lesson to us.

She was there every single day — working, pushing, and yes … badgering us to work harder and to do better.

Every child should be so lucky.

I was laughing with my sister over the weekend about the White Glove Test.

When Sherry asked us to clean our rooms, we weren’t done until we passed her White Glove Test.

I can still smell the Lemon Pledge in my nostrils as I think about it right now.

It was enormously frustrating. But Sherry’s lesson endures — you do things the right way, or you don’t do them at all.

For a young Star Wars fan like myself, Sherry was like my own little Yoda — a font of wisdom and hundreds of years’ worth of knowledge she was passing on to a recalcitrant and impatient student.

All that we are — our work ethic, our desire to do things the right way, and how we teach our own kids — flows from her ornery example.

There’s that word again, ornery. She never let the world get the best of her, and she taught us never to succumb to the hardships and frustrations that befall every one of us.

Sherry worked hard to support our family. Through numerous factory layoffs and uncertainty we never went without.

Literally, she worked at gas stations in the middle of the night. And on her hands and knees cleaning people’s houses and offices.

She traveled hundreds of miles up and down the road every day to go to work at the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Factory, first in Madisonville and then in Union City, Tennessee.

She did what she had to do to support her family.

How many people do we know who would have never taken those kinds of jobs? We make it all too easy these days, don’t we?

But that would not do for Sherry. She was raised differently.

She worked herself to the bone to provide for the family she loved. And at the same time, she was giving us a lesson — it is your job to provide for your family, and no one else’s.

Sherry embodied the phrase “the dignity of work.” In a world where many succumb to the notion that you can get by while others carry your freight, Sherry Jennings taught us that were put on this earth to work, and that working is a good thing.

Even as she cleaned the homes of others, our home was never dirty.

Even as she waited tables at restaurants like the Hickory Pit, we always had a hot meal on our table, too.

Sherry always seemed to be in two places at once.

Because we needed it, she made it happen. Shoes. Sports equipment. School supplies. Clothes. Field trips. A computer on which to write my college applications.

It did not matter what we needed. Sherry Jennings was our advocate and our defender.

And our provider.

What better legacy is there for a mother, but to provide all the love and support a child needs to succeed in this world?

###

Sherry Jennings had opinions. She told it like it was.

Her opinions were … interesting. None of us were spared.

I assume some in this room went out to eat with Sherry on occasion.

And I assume you experienced her deliver a withering critique of the meal that had just been served by some poor teenaged waiter.

God forbid that steak came out one degree too hot or too cold.

But she wasn’t about to take less than what she had asked for. She had an opinion about the way it was supposed to be, and she delivered it.

Sherry Jennings was no shrinking violet.

I argue for a living, and no class or degree was a better education than learning at the feet of the master in the Jennings Household.

The truth is, Sherry Jennings invented being politically incorrect. The president has nothing on her.

###

My Dad and Sherry were married for 34 years.

I can’t tell you that I was terribly excited as a 7-year-old when they decided to get married.

Honestly, I didn’t know what to think. Children of broken homes endure a lot; that was true for my sister and me.

We had a new mom, and a new older sister, Alexia. We were too little to understand what was happening, and that of course sometimes manifested itself in ugly ways.

But Sherry never hesitated to treat us in a way that made us feel welcome. And loved.

With Sherry in the house, we got away with nothing; but we learned everything.

My Dad and Sherry had the kind of marriage most folks long for:

They had longevity.

They had adventures.

They raised kids who grew up to be hard working, good natured, solid citizens.

They sang karaoke like it was nobody’s business.

Jeff and Sherry loved each other through a lot of hardships. Like all of us, they made good and bad decisions, as I’m sure Dad would tell you.

But through it all, they were right there for each other.

Sherry’s commitment to my Dad was never in question. And Dad’s commitment to Sherry shone right through until she took her last breath after so many difficult months.

###

The only thing Sherry was as committed to as my Dad were…her pets.

I often thought growing up that if Sherry were to kill me over my latest transgression, coming back as one of her cats or dogs would be a pretty good consolation prize.

You can tell a lot about people in how they treat animals. And by that measure, Sherry had the biggest heart of anyone I know.

She leaves behind little Carlos today, who Dad reports has been licking her pillow, hoping for his mama to come home soon.

But we all know in this room who she really loved — her little white poodle, Scooter.

I tried to calculate how old that dog was when he died. I think Scooter lived to be 475 in people years.

I think the best Christmas present my Dad ever gave Sherry involved little Scooter.

He took that dog to a professional photographer, and they posed and primped him like he was Taylor Swift.

And when my Dad gave the pictures to Sherry for Christmas, her eyes welled up with tears. She looked at those photos, looked at my Dad, and she got up and retrieved a hammer…and used it to take our photos off the wall, to make way for Scooter’s glamorous portfolio.

Somewhere, my high school graduation picture collects dust while Scooter’s majestic Glamour Shot is under the same kind of glass they keep the Mona Lisa.

Lord have Mercy, Sherry loved that dog. Scooter and his mama are reunited and I am sure it is glorious.

###

Sherry was enormously proud of all of her grandsons.

Although my four won’t know her the way I did, I look forward to passing on to them the stories of our childhood and how she shaped our lives.

Sherry was a throwback. She embodied that small-town American resolve.

The never stop working attitude.

The pull yourself up by your bootstraps attitude.

The love your children and teach them right from wrong attitude.

The leave this world a better place than you found it attitude.

The never let anyone tell you your opinion isn’t valid because you are from little ole’ Dawson Springs attitude.

That attitude — which I fear we lose a little bit of every day — she embodied it so well. And for all of us in this room who experienced it with her, we can pass it on.

And if we all keep just a little orneriness alive in ourselves and in our kids, Sherry Jennings — devoted spouse and … our mom … will live on for generations to come.

Thank you all for being here today.",1,https://medium.com/@ScottJenningsKY/sherry-jean-jennings-my-stepmom-for-34-years-died-on-august-8-at-the-age-of-72-14aa9a3702b9

Only those with the hardest or darkest of hearts look at tragedies like the weekend shootings in El Paso and Dayton and pivot immediately to scoring political points. The rush to condemn any politician for the El Paso shooter’s white nationalist views or the Dayton shooter’s apparent affinity for Elizabeth Warren is not just wrong, but is detrimental to the efforts of those in public life who might want to do something about gun violence.

We must also resist the urge — as political actors — to savage any person trying to move the nation toward healing and solutions. No sooner than President Donald Trump had concluded his remarks on Monday — in which he clearly condemned white nationalism, hate and violence — did several Democratic candidates for president issue a stream of profane, vitriolic invectives that likely — especially for those still serving in Congress — render their voices useless in a constructive policymaking process.

Nor can we wait this out. Many conservatives fear opening the Pandora’s Box of putting this issue up for a debate on the floor of the House or Senate. The excuse is that no law can legislate the crazies and the truly evil out of existence. They are right, of course. And it is also true that some of the proposed laws would not have prevented any of the mass shootings that have befallen America.

Read this:If blood on McConnell's hands doesn't bother him now, it never will

But that’s no excuse for people of goodwill to simply throw up their hands in disgust and say there’s nothing we can do. There likely isn’t a law that can A) pass the Congress that would B) stop all mass shootings. But some laws would signal to the American people that we take this problem seriously.

Republicans in Congress should consider the following ideas as soon as possible:

1. Red-flag law. As the president stated, and if properly drafted, these laws allow everyday citizens in positions of responsibility to report people who may be a danger to themselves and others. Those being reported should get due process, but temporary placement on a no-buy list is a reasonable sacrifice if it means stopping people like the Parkland or Dayton shooters, whose history suggested huge red flags that would have put them at the top of any no-buy registry. Fellow conservative writer David French has a terrific write up on red-flag laws at National Review.

2. Universal background checks. The time has come for the Senate to open a process to consider the various background check proposals that have come forth in recent years. Whether that’s the Manchin-Toomey proposal of a few years ago or some other vehicle, the American people — and a vast majority of gun owners — find it imminently reasonable that one would undergo a background check no matter where and how they were purchasing a gun. Most Americans think we should prevent criminals and mental health patients from purchasing guns, and anything that can be done to cut down on human error in the system would be a welcome comfort.

Locally:Vigil for Dayton, El Paso shooting victims planned outside McConnell's office

Policymakers need to be clear with the American people that some of the recent mass shootings would not have been prevented by universal background checks —sometimes, people who exhibit few if any red flags buy guns and commit murder. But, again, that’s no excuse for not constructing a system that could, in theory, offer the possibility of future prevention.

3. Ban high capacity magazines and drums. I spoke to a veteran FBI agent about his advice to policymakers on these matters. James Gagliano, a fellow CNN contributor who I have come to trust implicitly on these issues because of the breadth of his experience and scholarship on these matters, said banning high capacity drums like the one used by the Dayton shooter is “low hanging fruit.” This would not eliminate all the high capacity magazines already in circulation, but it would send a signal that, as Americans, we are not comfortable with people walking around with the ability to unload 100 bullets in a matter of seconds. We already ban automatic weapons for that very reason. Gagliano compared it to the bump stock issue, which arose after the mass shooting in Las Vegas, and said “absolutely” Congress should do it.

4. Pass an unequivocal resolution condemning white nationalism, racism and violence. There’s no reason a resolution condemning the language in the El Paso shooter’s manifesto and anyone who uses political ideology as an excuse to murder his fellow citizens cannot be drafted and achieve a 100-0 vote in the U.S. Senate. There should be no squabbling on this. It would be of great comfort to the American people to see both parties lockstep on this message.

I wrote after the Parkland massacre that most Americans don’t want overreach on this issue, but rather commonsense, politically palatable solutions that attempt to get at the heart of the problem. Most people understand that there is no cure-all for this, and most people understand that our culture is sick and won’t be saved by politicians in Washington, D.C. None of these proposals erode in any way our Second Amendment, which, along with every enshrined right, must be preserved as we grapple with modern problems.

Also:McConnell calls for prayers, Democrats, others want action aftershootings

But there is a template to achieve progress. Both parties — and activists on both sides of the gun issue — came together under the leadership of President George W. Bush to create the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) in the aftermath of the Virginia Tech shooting. That law was updated last year by a Republican-led Congress to fix the system that failed in the case of the Sutherland Springs, Texas, church shooting in 2017, when the “United States Air Force missed six opportunities to alert law enforcement authorities about an airman’s history of domestic abuse that would have stopped him from legally buying firearms ... ”

Here’s the political reality: This nation won’t go for mass weapons confiscation, which is the natural outgrowth of the “ban assault weapons” demand of some liberal activists. And, on the other end of the spectrum, the American people will not accept doing nothing as our national psyche has been permanently scarred by these mass shootings.

Finding the sweet spot — aligning President Trump, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell — is the task at hand. Making sure the American people see our government working together, free of the damnable hyper-politicization already going on in some quarters, is vital.

You cannot legislate the crazy and the evil out of humanity. But you damn sure can let the American people know that political leaders of goodwill exist in our polarized world and that they will set all of the scar tissue aside to reassure a nation asking itself: “What is wrong with us?”

170,Jennings,Scott,latimes,"After watching two nights of Democratic debates, all I can say is this: Man, it’s a tough time to be Barack Obama. Democratic presidential candidates lined up to savage his record with more ferocity than former prosecutor Kamala Harris used to muster for a morning drug arrest docket.

These are Democrats, people! And they can’t hammer Obama enough on healthcare, trade and immigration. Dude probably has an approval rating of 95% to 98% among the Democrats they’re trying to woo, and yet the candidates are taking batting practice on him.

Healthcare is the most glaring divide among the Democrats — and a primary source of the attacks on Obama.

“Nobody can defend the dysfunctionality of the current system!” Bernie Sanders thundered on Night 1. That system, if you are keeping score at home, is Obamacare! The socialist senator from Vermont has moved most of the field his way, which means, in essence, they are advocating repeal-and-replace of Obama’s signature law. Sound familiar?

President Trump’s primary argument for reelection is that he is presiding over an era of peace and prosperity, and no Democrat on either night punctured that argument. While debating skills won’t determine if a Democrat can beat Trump (Hillary bested him, according to polling), I’ve yet to see anyone who worries me more than the others. The best debater they have is clearly Elizabeth Warren, but her dark vision of America will seem foreign to voters living in a country with low unemployment and rising wages.

Trump, like most incumbent presidents, is more likely than not to be reelected. He has all the tools and power of incumbency going for him, and opponents who are more beholden to woke Twitter activists than to average folks in the Midwestern countryside. There’s a lot of runway between now and next November, of course, and Trump has a penchant for stepping in his own you-know-what. But he’s the favorite, and the debates haven’t changed that.

Joe Biden effectively defended Obamacare in his exchanges with Harris and Bill de Blasio on Night 2, rattling his young tormentor from the first debate. But Biden has yet to face the real dragon: Warren, a far better advocate for socialist medicine than the flip-flopping Harris. On immigration, Biden came under withering fire for the Obama administration’s record on deporting illegal immigrants from De Blasio, who has garnered bipartisan consensus as the most annoying candidate in the race. Biden sidestepped the attack for the most part but did tell CNN moderator Don Lemon that Obama’s deportation rates would “absolutely not” be replicated by his administration if he won in 2020.

Fun fact: Obama deported more than 3 million illegal immigrants, versus about 2 million for George W. Bush and less than 1 million for Bill Clinton. Even the Trump Administration isn’t deporting people as fast as Obama did!

Biden tossed Obama under the bus again on trade and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, saying he would not reenter the agreement without renegotiating it — sounding a bit like Trump, who withdrew from the TPP days after taking office. Biden had been a top surrogate for passing the TPP in Obama’s second term, calling it “a game changer…comprehensive, high-standard trade agreement.”

But that was then.

Just a few weeks ago, Biden’s message was essentially that if we just reset everything to where it was during the Obama years, America would be back on track. But even Biden now seems to think the last Democratic administration made tremendous mistakes. I can’t help but wonder when Democrats will learn to treat Obama the way Republicans treat Ronald Reagan.

Tactically, the debates clarified that there was one serious group of candidates and that everyone else was pretty well done. Biden rebounded. Cory Booker had a decent night, too.

On the first night, Warren and Sanders satisfied their supporters. Although Montana Gov. Steve Bullock and Marianne Williamson had good moments, too, their time is probably limited. This thing has boiled down to Biden, Warren and Sanders in the top tier, and Harris, Booker and Pete Buttigieg in a second tier. Biden will continue to lead as long as Warren and Sanders fragment the progressive left.

Everyone else is at best white noise. At worst, the rest of the field could destructively drag Democrats left on immigration and abortion. Castro has continued his crusade to decriminalize illegal border crossings and offer free healthcare for illegal immigrants louder than anyone. While Biden countered him on the former, Biden never addressed the latter after raising his hand in support of this politically disastrous idea in the first debate.

Harris is now particularly vulnerable, as she was rattled by Biden on healthcare and flat out waylaid by Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii for jailing so many Californians. Booker may advance if Harris falls out of favor of the national political media, although his incessant whining about Democrats debating each other at a debate was weird.

A final word about a swing state — Pennsylvania. The attack on coal by several Democrats, including Joe Biden, could have a significant impact on his party’s ability to win back the Keystone State. For people who live in coal-producing areas, this is more than a climate issue. It is a cultural touchstone that badly hurt Hillary Clinton in 2016 and will haunt Democrats again in 2020.

Former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke is done. South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg didn’t have it for most of the night but has the money to fight on. Former Maryland Rep. John Delaney gets far too much time for a candidacy with such non-existent chances; he impressively butted in to nearly every exchange. Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper were largely non-factors.

To me, the people who stand out in debates are the ones who appear most committed to their ideas. From this perspective, Sanders won the health care section hands down. He fought off several gnats and showed outrage when challenged on his “Medicare for All” plan. “I wrote the damn bill!” he snapped at one point.

Trashing Obama's health care system

His best talking point is on deductibles, which have skyrocketed in the last several years, making people feel like they don’t have insurance at all. It is interesting to watch Democrats like Sanders simply hammer the current health care system, which is named after Barack Obama! “Nobody can defend the dysfunctionality of the current system!"" Sanders shouted. Too bad former Vice President Joe Biden wasn’t there to challenge him, although Bullock made a game effort.

Bullock, making his first debate appearance, made the most sense on immigration He is right that decriminalizing border crossings and offering free health care to illegal immigrants would exacerbate the border crisis. But the question for Bullock is: are there any Democratic primary voters who want to hear this reasonable view? If Democrats were smart, they’d listen to him instead of those candidates would drag them too far left on the issue that is now tops in America, according to the Gallup poll.

Story continues

Recipe for success: Democrats had a winning 2018 playbook. They should use it to beat Donald Trump in 2020.

Warren finally scored some points when the talk turned to electability. She effectively fought off Delaney and clearly has a better handle on what Democratic primary voters want to hear than he does. Delaney got more space in this debate than he has earned.

Bernie Sanders at the Democratic debate in Detroit on July 30, 2019.

All I could think about during the climate section was that Richard Trumka, the head of the AFL-CIO, was a pre-debate speaker. And he and the rest of the big labor union leaders have slammed the Green New Deal, which has been endorsed in some form or fashion by nearly every Democrat running.

To win in 2020, Democrats need to win back union members who switched from Obama in 2012 to Trump in 2016. And union leaders are telling the Democratic presidential candidates loud and clear that the Green New Deal is not “not achievable or realistic.”

Warren's smart pivot to education

Williamson had her best moment during a discussion of the Flint water crisis. She showed the same passion and authenticity on this issue that Sanders had on health care when she pointed out that people who live in rich areas wouldn’t suffer the same problems.

When it came to race, Warren made a smart pivot to building ""a better education system for all our kids."" Anyone can stand up there and call Trump racist, but Warren showed off her podium confidence by focusing on an issue that every parent cares about.

Some Democrats have begun explicitly saying that anyone who votes for Trump is racist, most notably former Clinton White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart. Klobuchar wisely said that not all Trump voters are racist. If Democrats follow Lockhart’s plan (“Don’t hide it like a coward. Wear that racist badge proudly and see how it feels,” he tweeted), they are going to have a devil of a time recovering white working-class voters in the upper Midwest who abandoned the Democratic Party in 2016.

Warren probably won on the economy, but honestly nobody stood out to me. “St. Pete” Buttigieg showed up at this point to remind us again that no other person in America is as Christian as him. I’m sure this tired routine elicits eye rolls from his fellow contenders.

A Williamson love boomlet?

There was some legitimate debate about whether it is a good idea to forgive all student loan debt currently on the books. What sells in the primary (loan forgiveness and free college) may not find a happy home in the general election, where people who already paid for their college will wonder: What about me?

Heed the centrists: If 2020 Democrats want to beat Trump, they shouldn't ignore moderates and indulge the left

There were no standouts on foreign policy aside from a decent moment from Buttigieg on his time as a soldier in Afghanistan. It is unwise for Warren and others to take preemptive nuclear strikes off the table; that position seriously weakens America’s hand. You don’t know what the world may throw at you and tying your own hands will sound weak to general election voters. Bullock got the best of Warren on this one.

No joke, Williamson will pop up a couple of points following this debate, giving us a boomlet of love, perhaps. If Democrats are serious about rural outreach, they will pay attention to Bullock, but I suspect there’s little appetite for what he had to say. Sanders and Warren pleased their supporters, but as long as they both stay in the race it makes it likely Biden is the nominee. Most people, I am sure, are waiting to see how Biden handles himself on Night Two.

Wear that racist badge proudly and see how it feels,” he tweeted), they are going to have a devil of a time recovering white working-class voters in the upper Midwest who abandoned the Democratic Party in 2016.

Warren probably won on the economy, but honestly nobody stood out to me. “St. Pete” Buttigieg showed up at this point to remind us again that no other person in America is as Christian as him. I’m sure this tired routine elicits eye rolls from his fellow contenders.

A Williamson love boomlet?

There was some legitimate debate about whether it is a good idea to forgive all student loan debt currently on the books. What sells in the primary (loan forgiveness and free college) may not find a happy home in the general election, where people who already paid for their college will wonder: What about me?

Heed the centrists: If 2020 Democrats want to beat Trump, they shouldn't ignore moderates and indulge the left

There were no standouts on foreign policy aside from a decent moment from Buttigieg on his time as a soldier in Afghanistan. It is unwise for Warren and others to take preemptive nuclear strikes off the table; that position seriously weakens America’s hand. You don’t know what the world may throw at you and tying your own hands will sound weak to general election voters. Bullock got the best of Warren on this one.

No joke, Williamson will pop up a couple of points following this debate, giving us a boomlet of love, perhaps. If Democrats are serious about rural outreach, they will pay attention to Bullock, but I suspect there’s little appetite for what he had to say. Sanders and Warren pleased their supporters, but as long as they both stay in the race it makes it likely Biden is the nominee. Most people, I am sure, are waiting to see how Biden handles himself on Night Two.

Gas up the car, Ethel. It’s almost time for our annual trek to Western Kentucky for the big picnic at St. Jerome’s Catholic Church, better known as Fancy Farm. The first Saturday in August begins to focus Kentucky voters on their choices in November’s election, especially in a gubernatorial campaign cycle. Here’s a reset on Kentucky’s race for governor as we pack the sunscreen and moist towelettes ahead of the best political barbecue in America:

Governor: Matt Bevin (R) vs. Andy Beshear (D)

Incumbent Gov. Bevin finds himself in a tough race for reelection as we enter the home stretch, but GOP strategists feel better about his position today than they did in May when he scored just 52% of the vote in a primary against three virtually unknown candidates.

Each time the Democratic presidential candidates debate, Bevin’s chances for reelection go up. As national Democrats lurch left, Beshear, the challenger, carries a party label that is increasingly unrecognizable for many rural Democrats. As Jonathan Martin reported recently in The New York Times, incumbent Democratic governors around the country “are alarmed that their party’s presidential candidates are embracing policies they see as unrealistic and politically risky.”

Joe Gerth:Why doesn't Elaine Chao 'go back' to China?

“I don’t think that’s good policy or good politics,” said Gov. Gina Raimondo of Rhode Island, the chair of the Democratic Governors Association, talking about Democratic plans for nationalizing health care and decriminalizing border crossings. Added Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico: “I think it scares people.”

Bevin was smart to latch onto immigration recently, endorsing legislation to ban “sanctuary policies” as President Donald Trump and national Democrats rage at one another over the crisis at the southern border. In a state Trump won by 30 points, the immigration debate is all upside for Bevin and remains intensely motivating for Republican voters who weren’t exactly enthusiastic about him in the primary.

Bevin is notoriously unpredictable in his public remarks, making it hard to foresee what direction he will take at an event he has never liked or embraced. For Beshear, the son of two-term governor Steve Beshear, the mission is clear: present a rationale for your candidacy beyond your last name.

“There’s anti-Bevin energy, but there’s no pro-Beshear energy,” an experienced Democratic strategist told me. He advised Beshear to stay above the fray and “tell voters why he’s running. Delivering attacks is not his thing. He’s yet to even talk about jobs.”

Outside groups are already investing heavily in Kentucky. The Republican Governors Association has run nearly $2 million worth of attack ads against Beshear since the primary, eroding the Democrat’s image to some degree. The Democratic Governors Association has spent less — just over half a million dollars — on a useless television ad that would have worked better if Beshear were running for reelection as attorney general instead of a promotion to governor.

Opinion:Kentucky is moving in the wrong direction on childhood vaccinations

Still to come from the pro-Bevin forces are arguments about abortion. Beshear’s endorsement from the National Association to Repeal Abortion Laws, or NARAL, ties him directly to his national party’s platform on the issue, which is far more liberal than where most Kentucky voters are. With NARAL pushing to allow abortions up to 40 weeks and Democratic presidential candidates and “The Squad” calling for taxpayer-funded abortions for transgendered females and illegal immigrants, Beshear will soon be on defense.”

At a Catholic picnic, Bevin would be wise to paint Beshear as the next Ralph Northam or Andrew Cuomo, the Democratic governors of Virginia and New York who pushed extremely liberal abortion policies.

Bevin is in better shape these days, but he’s not out of the woods. While Beshear’s image took a hit under a negative advertising barrage, Bevin’s job approval has not necessarily gone up.

But that could change if Bevin takes advantage of his record on the economy. As Kentucky Sports Radio’s Matt Jones told the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce in a forum we held at the group’s summer meeting, “I’m going to say something most Democrats won’t say, but it’s real. Economically, this state has a pretty good story of the last three years … in general, he’s got a decent economic story to tell.”

With three months to go, I rate this race a toss-up with a slight advantage to Bevin given Kentucky’s political bent and the promise of Trump rallying conservative voters on Bevin’s behalf. Even so, Beshear finds himself up a few points — the same place Democrat Jack Conway was in against Bevin at this point in 2015. Can he hold his lead, or is Beshear too “boring,” as Jones said, to win the race? Stay tuned.

(CNN) —

I’m glad President Donald Trump disavowed the “send her back” chant that broke out at his North Carolina rally. US Rep. Ilhan Omar and the rest of her “Squad” of House Democratic freshmen are as American as the rest of us, live under the same Constitution and enjoy the same First Amendment rights.

It strikes me as fundamentally weak and lacking in confidence if you think the best way to debate someone is to have them sent away and essentially censored. Good for President Trump for disavowing it; I am sure he’ll get a chance to put a stop to it for real at the next rally.

I don’t want to send US Rep. Omar back; I want to send her to the nearest television greenroom. I think she and The Squad ought to speak as freely and in front of a camera as often as possible. Every time they do, they continue to become the face of the national Democratic Party.

No matter whom the Democrats nominate for president, the message and policies of The Squad will make up the heart of the nominee’s platform. This is a disaster for the Democrats and a gift to the GOP, which is fighting to reassure educated suburban voters to stick with them. Sure, they may not love Trump’s behavior or rhetoric on some issues, but they’ll take a good economy and secure border over socialism, higher taxes and open borders any day.

This is a beautiful thing for Trump. The Squad jerks its party leftward every day; its members represent extremely blue, urban districts that just don’t match the battleground states Democrats need to win to deny Trump a second term. Even as the “send her back” controversy was erupting, Omar had other Democrats preparing to play defense over her “Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions” resolution, or “BDS” for short. If you haven’t heard of it, this is an anti-Israeli movement pushed by people whose “anti-Semitism often leads it to advocate violations of the law,” according to David French over at National Review.

And that’s on top of “The Squad’s” immigration goals, which call for eliminating the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency and the federal Department of Homeland Security, decriminalizing illegal border crossings and providing free health care for illegal immigrants. These are on top of their economic goals of rolling back the Trump tax cuts, implementing an expensive and disastrous Green New Deal and nationalizing all health care.

The Squad’s platform is not a mainstream set of ideas that could carry a party to a national election victory; it’s a far-left socialist dreamscape that will be rejected by voters in the states that Democrats need the most.

Even Nancy Pelosi is looking moderate and reasonable these days compared with The Squad, as it frequently weakens her hand in policy negotiations with the Republican-led Senate (see: the recent fight over the border supplemental spending bill). No wonder she swatted at its members in a recent interview with a New York Times columnist, which then caused an immediate Squad backlash on Twitter.

The Democratic presidential primary has already seen most of the candidates adopt Squad-approved positions that will cost their party in next year’s general election.

175,Jennings,Scott,latimes,"The night of the first Democratic debate, even for those of us who watched it, already seems like a distant memory. Nothing much important happened, and virtually none of the people on the stage has a prayer of becoming the president.

Nonetheless, this Republican, middle-American viewer observed a few things I’m hoping you left-coasters can explain before the whole sorry show is forgotten.

Where was Joe Biden?

He was never supposed to be on the stage, of course, since he’s slated for Thursday night. But the clear front-runner for the Democratic nomination was mentioned by … no one. It was a huge missed opportunity for Cory Booker (who had a dust-up with Biden recently over race issues) and Amy Klobuchar, who presumably is marketing herself as acceptable to Midwestern voters. If one of them had said, “We can’t nominate Biden and here’s why…,” it’s all we’d be talking about right now. This omission just seemed to reinforce that the first-night lineup was truly a junior varsity squad whose members are more likely to be named assistant secretary of the Interior by President Biden than become president themselves.

Elizabeth Warren. Really?

Take her answer on guns, which even liberals can’t have been happy with. She must get that question dozens of times every day, and to look that befuddled by it and have nothing to offer but a research project seemed awfully thin for a candidate who claims to have all the policy answers. She entered the debate hall the clear leader of that stage, and she couldn’t even own a room full of people rooting for her. She has a plan for everything except for how to win a debate among, frankly, lesser rivals.

Mitch McConnell.

As a Kentuckian, I was eager to hear the answer to moderator Chuck Todd’s question about how the candidates would “deal with Mitch McConnell.” And I was pleased to see that most of them didn’t seem to have a clue. Tim Ryan, who was out of his depth most of the night, came closest to a coherent answer — be a working-class party — but there’s no room for his low-wattage candidacy in this field. Warren flubbed this question almost as badly as she flubbed guns. Every mention of McConnell as a bane to Democrats inures to the Senate majority leader’s benefit in Kentucky, by the way.

Was Julián Castro trying to win the most “woke” award?

Shoehorning in a promise to federally fund abortions for transgendered females was truly a remarkable feat by the former Housing and Urban Development secretary. I am not going to litigate the biology of this, but I am sure there was a blue-collar type or two thinking: “I am wondering how to afford college for my kid and this guy is paying for transgender folks’ abortions?” This sort of identity politics pandering backfired on Democrats in 2016 and could be even worse this time around. Do liberals think that Castro’s positioning — along with his plan to reduce border security even further — plays well in the Pennsylvania, Wisconsin or Michigan countryside? He had some nice moments, but any candidate tacking this far left is pushing onto dangerous ground if you Democrats plan to win in 2020.

Can someone please explain Beto O’Rourke’s appeal?

The erstwhile hand-waver from Texas has been a total flop as a presidential candidate, a trend that continued at the debate. Now that the media have decided he’s no longer worthy of their protection, he’s melting down faster than an ice cream cone in the seventh at Dodger Stadium. His performance will live forever in internet memes of a bewildered Booker watching O’Rourke speak rudimentary Spanish. O’Rourke’s mentioning his daughter made me wonder what she thinks when he disappears for months at a time to find himself. It’s doubtful this Irishman was smiling the morning after.

Um, the economy?

Do you people not understand that your rhetoric on the economy is disconnected from the economic realities felt by most Americans? We have more job openings than people looking for work. Wages are up. The Trump tax cuts helped more individuals than corporations, despite false statements to the contrary. Yet Democrats persist in describing America as a Third World country in which widespread unemployment has gripped the countryside. Nothing could be further from the truth, and swing voters know it.

John Delaney and Bill de DeBlasio were there for comic relief, right?

These guys. I did derive some unexpected pleasure from watching the moderators tell Delaney to be quiet. I can’t believe that the Democratic National Committee found stage spots for them — and for Marianne Williamson on Night 2 —but not for Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana, an actual qualified human who could compete for crucial middle American votes.

The big question.

Pollsters tell us the most important issue in the Democratic primary is who can beat President Trump. Most Democratic voters say that’s who they want to back. But I didn’t hear any of Wednesday’s candidates make a compelling case on that issue. Maybe we’ll get more presidential timbre on Night 2.

And in case you’re wondering how this Republican sums up the evening: Warren, Booker and Castro live to fight another day. Beto’s done. And we won’t have to endure the others much longer, either.

It takes a special kind of person to screw up an office that shouldn’t exist and has no real duties, but Kentucky Lt. Gov. Jenean Hampton found a way — by appointing people to work in her office that treated their at-will positions like personal possessions, a bad look for supposed small government conservatives.

According to a statement released by Blake Brickman, chief of staff to Gov. Matt Bevin, he fired Hampton’s deputy chief of staff, Adrienne Southworth, for “repeatedly advocating that the governor commute the sentence of an individual who is serving a 25-year sentence for raping his own stepdaughter,” and for lobbying state legislators for a bill that “provides more leniency for convicted sex offenders who violate their parole.""

Brickman clearly made a good decision. If Southworth wants to lobby for rapists, she can do that on her own time and not that of Kentucky taxpayers.

Check out:The firing of Lt. Gov. Hampton's aide has sparked a GOP civil war in Kentucky. Here's how

Earlier this year, Brickman fired Southworth’s boss, Steve Knipper, for violating a Bevin directive that state employees should resign their jobs if they were simultaneously running for public office, a good government idea to eliminate the appearance of campaigning on the taxpayers’ dime.

Two Bevin appointees abided — one from each party. Knipper refused, and his termination by Brickman was justified and commendable.

Hampton was supposedly Bevin’s last choice for a running mate in 2015 and has performed about as well as you’d expect in this useless office.

Bevin clearly lost confidence in Hampton, as evidenced by his choosing a new running mate for reelection. Now that she and her operation are working against the governor’s agenda— both in policy and politics — she should resign.

Down the hall, the Office of Kentucky Secretary of State has been destroyed by Alison Grimes. Journalists with ProPublica, working with the Lexington Herald-Leader, found that Grimes abused her authority by snooping through the voting records of “state employees, job applicants and even potential political rivals.”

You may want to read:Bevin's 'partisan hack' chief of staff overstepped in firing my aide, Jenean Hampton says

She gave a six-figure, no-bid cybersecurity contract to a firm run by a campaign donor, despite the company having “never tackled such a challenge.” And she leaves office “facing a revolt by some staff as well as a loss of trust from many of the county clerks who administer elections.”

And all that was before last week’s bombshell dropped by federal prosecutors who are after her father, former Democratic Party Chairman Jerry Lundergan.

In the runup to his trial for breaking campaign finance laws to help his daughter’s unsuccessful 2014 U.S. Senate race against Mitch McConnell, prosecutors say they have uncovered evidence that Lundergan “funneled corporate contributions… in her 2011 and 2015 races for Kentucky secretary of state…” according to the Herald-Leader. It is illegal for Kentucky campaigns to accept corporate contributions.

Grimes ran for statewide office in 2011, 2014 and 2015. The feds say her dad put hundreds of thousands of dollars of illegal money into the three races, and they have a cooperating witness who was involved in the scheme to prove it.

Of particular interest is whether Grimes used illegal money to win reelection in 2015, a race she won by two points and roughly 22,000 votes.

If the feds are right about the large sums Jerry Lundergan spent, his money may have absolutely changed the race’s outcome. Grimes officially reported spending just over $800,000 to beat her Republican opponent, the aforementioned Knipper, who mustered just $44,000.

Grimes is hyper-partisan. Vindictive. Insufferably incompetent. And is the most corrupt constitutional officeholder since State Treasurer “Honest” Dick Tate fled the capitol in 1888 with $100,000 worth of gold and silver coins.

Grimes has refused to comment on her campaigns’ alleged misdeeds, instead tweeting lame attacks against McConnell. She laughably waved off the ProPublica/Herald-Leader stories as sexist, even though they were written by a talented female journalist named Jessica Huseman.

But also:Jenean Hampton's aide was investigating Gov. Bevin's authority before she was fired

With a statewide election looming in November — and an independent counsel appointed by Attorney General Andy Beshear still investigating potential misconduct — Grimes should resign, allowing Bevin to appoint an untainted secretary of state who isn’t woefully compromised.

If she refuses to step down, Bevin should be prepared to call the legislature into session for the purpose of impeachment, especially if Grimes were to be indicted.

But don’t hold your breath that either Hampton or Grimes will do right by their parties and the people of Kentucky by exiting stage left. Both have proven that they are only loyal to themselves and their cronies, not the people they serve.

The Woke Liberal sits at home, wearing a “You can’t handle the Ruth” T-shirt while sipping an organic, fair trade latte from a “Notorious RBG” mug.

Suddenly, the latte spews forth, a comical, movie-like spit saved for the truly shocking moments. The Woke Liberal just couldn’t believe the news article that popped up on the Mac:

“Justice (Brett) Kavanaugh made history by bringing on board an all-female law clerk crew. Thanks to his selections, the Court has this Term, for the first time ever, more women than men serving as law clerks,"" Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said in a speech last week.

How can this be true?

Worldview shattered, he glances out the window, then down at his sandals, and then back at the screen. He carefully sits his mug on a dog-eared and highlighted copy of the Mueller report, the document that was supposed to bring down the president but is now just a thick coaster. He wistfully glances out again, staring at the #Resist sticker on his Subaru’s bumper.

Doubts begin to seep in.

Maybe, he thought, angry mobs aren’t the best arbiters of information in this world of ours.

The liberal dials a cousin — Obama’s Pajama Boy — to get a second opinion. He doesn’t answer. Even Pajama Boy got a job and moved out of his parents’ basement in this economy.

More from Scott Jennings:Democrats lie like the devil, and the media lets them get away with it

The Woke Liberal, worried and alone with his thoughts, quietly ruminates on the world …

What a dreary day. Well, even if RBG is loving on Kavanaugh (blech!) and Mueller failed to uncover the real evidence about Russian collusion (the truth is still out there!), we can impeach Trump, anyway. He deserves it! And we won the House thanks to the $5 I sent Beto last year, just to achieve this moment of truth.

I think I’ll flip on MSNBC for reassurance and hopefully Rachel Maddow’s dramatic reading of the Emoluments Clause. Oh good, there’s our hero Nancy Pelosi holding a press conference. She’ll get that bastard! This is why I tweeted so much last fall, helping my member of Congress get 87%. What say you, madame speaker? Oh, I hope she does one of those sarcastic claps like at the State of the Union.

“Do you know that most people think impeachment means you’re out of office? They think, if you get impeached, you’re gone. And that is completely not true. And I may have thought that myself 50 years ago.”

Nancy, what are you doing? Why won’t you impeach Trump?

This is ridiculous. These old Democrats just don’t get it. We need new leadership, like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. I wonder what she’s doing today? Let’s check her Twitter feed. Maybe she’s smacking around Mitch McConnell again. That time she marched over to the office he wasn’t in really hurt him in that backwater he represents with that damn racist song.

What the hell? Why is AOC tweeting about working with Ted Cruz? The literal Devil, and she’s co-sponsoring his bills? I hate lobbyists, too, but not enough to make the Zodiac Killer look good.

What. Is. Happening?

Might as well check in on the presidential campaign, I guess. The best way to get rid of the old, white patriarchy that ruined this country is to elect a new president.

CNN has a new poll of the Iowa caucus right here. How can anyone stand to live in Iowa, by the way? Vegetables shouldn’t come from anything larger than a two-acre farm. About time someone like AOC stood up to those global warming cows.

Stay focused. Trust the polls. What? The leading candidates are two white men with a combined age of 153? Are we seriously going to nominate someone older than Trump? When will people learn that old white men have no idea how to manage an economy that works for all of us? Everyone knows Trump is lying about the unemployment rate. No way it’s just 3.6%.

…

The phone buzzes.

The Woke Liberal snaps out of his fog, glancing at the screen. It’s his friend, Denise, texting an important bulletin.

“Get down here! Alyssa Milano just tweeted about that hillbilly Sarah Sanders having dinner in our town and we need to protest her ASAP!”

He shakes off his doubts and springs into action, snagging the ready-made “Not My President” sign he keeps by the door for such occasions. He drops a gluten-free cat treat into Meow Mao’s bowl.

Surely, tomorrow will bring better news.

This past Saturday, my sons and I did our annual work in Zachary Taylor National Cemetery, joining hundreds of other Boy Scouts and Cub Scouts from around Louisville to place American flags in front of more than 14,000 graves. The Scouts, their parents and troop leaders take great pride in washing over the green field in an annual exercise that always astonishes for just how quickly the work gets done. The cemetery looked beautiful on one of those precious few perfect spring mornings that Kentucky produces as she transitions from cold winters to the swampy summer.

This year’s ceremony coincided with a book landing on my desk called ""Sacred Duty: A Soldier’s Tour at Arlington National Cemetery."" The author is Tom Cotton, U.S. senator for the state of Arkansas and a former platoon leader of the U.S. Army’s Third Infantry Regiment at Arlington, otherwise known as the Old Guard. The book — a tribute to the oldest active-duty regiment in the U.S. military, dating back to 1784 — was a perfect companion for reflecting on the American heroes who defend our freedom this Memorial Day.

Cotton served in the Arlington regiment for 16 months in 2007 and 2008, between tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan. He opens his book discussing Flags In, which takes place the Thursday before Memorial Day at Arlington and is the only day of the year that every soldier in the unit operates in a mission together. Every grave gets a flag — a massive deployment of red, white and blue to honor the soldiers who defended those colors with their very lives. In about four hours, the Old Guard places 245,000 flags in the cemetery.

Read this:Flags4Vets Memorial Day Vigil honors fallen military at Waterfront Park

This book is decidedly nonpolitical, offering an inside look at one of the most fascinating regiments in the U.S military through the reverent eyes of someone who wore the uniform. Cotton writes about how soldiers and visitors to Arlington treat one another on the grounds, sharing only the common bond of honoring those who make America the greatest nation this Earth has ever known.

The most visible members of the Old Guard are those who carry the flag-draped remains of their fallen comrades off the planes at Dover Air Force Base, those who conduct funeral ceremonies at Arlington, and those who guard the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, “the most highly visible guard post in the United States.” Cotton dives deep on all three, and the most engrossing information comes in his behind-the-scenes look at what it takes to do those jobs. You meet several Old Guard soldiers along the way, learning how meticulous they are in training and preparation to leave a perfect impression for everyone who visits Arlington.

The Tomb of the Unknown platoon is the most unique duty inside the Old Guard, and Cotton explains how private life at the Tomb “differs in key ways from that of most of the Army,” including operating on a 26-hour day. The Tomb is always guarded, and the quarters under the amphitheater are “always opened and manned.”

No matter what Mother Nature throws their way, the Tomb soldiers perform with precision. That was evident last week when a massive storm hit the Washington, D.C., area causing, according to the Department of Defense, trees “as old as the cemetery itself” to break at the trunk and crash to the ground.

“But America’s regiment endured,” the Pentagon tweeted. Some of the Old Guard refused to stop planting flags until they were ordered to stand down. And at the Tomb of the Unknown, “One of the most extraordinary displays of discipline and dedication to duty ever to be witnessed at Arlington National was taking place.

“With only a few watching from cover, a Tomb Sentinel approached the Unknowns with U.S. flags in hand. As thunder shook the ground and rains washed down, the Tomb Sentinel pierced through the elements with breath-taking precision. He knelt and placed the flags in honor of the Unknowns. Humans have their limits, but the U.S. Army Old Guard has yet to meet theirs.”

If you read Cotton’s book, you’ll understand the dedication each Old Guard soldier possesses to brave elements like that and to give their fallen brothers and sisters — and their families — the final honors they deserve.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is right: We are in the midst of a “constitutional crisis.” It has nothing to do with President Donald Trump’s jousting with Congress over subpoenas, however; the crisis is fully one of the Democrats’ making as they —unfortunately aided by special counsel Robert Mueller — continue to disregard the pillars of justice and fairness that have underpinned America since its founding.

House Democrats may soon hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress for failing to turn over an unredacted version of the Mueller report. The redactions largely consist of grand jury material, which the law prohibits Barr from revealing because of rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.

To appease the Democrats, Barr made an even more transparent version of his document available in a secure room at the Department of Justice that House members can view, but no Democrat — including Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler — has bothered to look at it.

Democrats plan to pursue a criminal contempt citation against Barr for failing to break the laws passed by Congress. I’d call it a kangaroo court, but I’m certain actual kangaroos are smarter than this.

Background:Pelosi says America in a 'constitutional crisis' over Trump stonewalling

Even worse, Democrats have again signaled that they intend to disregard the presumption of innocence for their political enemies. As Democrats bang the “obstruction of justice” drum stemming from Mueller’s defective write-up on the issue, Special White House counsel Emmett Flood made clear in a letter to the attorney general that Mueller has gone far outside the lane of what federal prosecutors are supposed to do:

“…'conclusively determining that no criminal conduct occurred’ was not the (Special Counsel’s) assigned task, because making conclusive determinations of innocence is never the task of the federal prosecutor.

“What prosecutors are supposed to do is complete an investigation and then either ask the grand jury to return an indictment or decline to charge the case. … Prosecutors simply are not in the business of establishing innocence any more than they are in the business of ‘exonerating’ investigated persons.”

Flood continues, quite correctly: “In the American justice system, innocence is presumed; there is never any need for prosecutors to ‘conclusively determine’ it. Nor is there any place for such a determination. Our country would be a very different (and very dangerous) place if prosecutors applied the (special counsel’s) standard and citizens were obliged to prove ‘conclusively ... that no criminal conduct occurred.’”

But since Mueller foolishly opened the door to disregard the presumption of innocence, shifting the burden of proof from the government to the accused, Democrats are shamefully running right through it because they just can’t stand Donald J. Trump.

We should have seen it coming. Last fall, the presumption of innocence was obliterated as Democrats demanded that any and all allegations against Brett Kavanaugh be believed, even as accusations against him crumbled. Democratic Hawaii Sen. Mazie Hirono forgot to hide the ball when asked about Kavanaugh’s claim of innocence:

""I put his denial in the context of everything that I know about him…” Hirono terrifyingly said. Translation: Your politics determines your justice.

It is hard to take Democrats seriously about Trump defying the norms of the presidency when they are actively assaulting our justice system, hypocritically refusing to accept election results (see: Georgia), trying to eliminate the Electoral College and pack the Supreme Court.

Add that to Democratic attempts to obtain Trump’s tax returns (which serves no legitimate government oversight purpose) and Cory Booker’s plan to use the IRS to investigate the National Rifle Association, a Trump ally, and you can see the kind of a justice-less world Democrats are plotting should they win the White House.

Jennings:Democrats lie like the devil, and the media lets them get away with it

I’m old enough to remember when the IRS was forced to express its “sincere apology” for aggressively harassing conservative political groups during Barack Obama’s tenure; now, Democratic presidential candidates are openly promising tax punishment for their enemies, as freshman House Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez publicly makes lists of the sorts of Republicans and rich people on whom she intends to raise taxes.

Democratic attempts to weaponize the justice system and tax bureaucracy recalls the story of Johnnie Mac Walters, who served as IRS commissioner under President Richard Nixon. When handed a list of “enemies” to be harassed, Walters famously refused the order. One wonders whether the next Democratic president will have more people like Ocasio-Cortez or Walters in their administration. Unfortunately, I think we know the answer. And it should scare the hell out of us.

You want to talk about lying in politics? Fine. Let’s talk about it.

Democrats lie all the time.

The Republican tax cuts didn’t cut taxes. We have “direct evidence” of Trump-Russian collusion. You can keep your doctor. It’s easier to get a Glock than a library book. Mitt Romney murdered a lady. I did not have sexual relations with that woman.

Democrats lie all the time, aided by a media complex that laps it up and uncritically regurgitates it. Former Vice President Joe Biden launched his presidential campaign by saying Democrats are waging “a battle for the soul of this nation.” How can his party win that argument when its own character is stained by lie after shameless lie?

Perhaps the most egregious policy canard floated by Democrats during Donald Trump’s presidency has to do with the Republican tax cut.

According to an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, just 17% of Americans believed their taxes went down. What’s the truth? Let’s ask The New York Times, which — after printing lie after lie regarding the tax cut — finally reported in April: “If you’re an American taxpayer, you probably got a tax cut last year. And there’s a good chance you don’t believe it.”

Gee whiz, if only there were an industry with the resources and responsibility to have told people the truth about it all this time. Better late than never, I guess.

The Times continues: “To a large degree, the gap between perception and reality on the tax cuts appears to flow from a sustained — and misleading — effort by liberal opponents of the law to brand it as a broad middle-class tax increase.”

The unnecessary qualifier “appears” notwithstanding, the Times spoke of the devil and he did appear: Democrats lied, the media helped them, and people bought it. When Trump lies, we suffer endless analysis about whether the Republic will survive. When Democrats lie, we get nothing until the narrative is baked beyond repair.

Mueller report:Takeaways on Trump, Russian interference and what Democrats can do now

Instead of fighting this “sustained and misleading effort” while it was ongoing, the media instead focused its efforts on Russia collusion (another lie that went belly up) while allowing the tax deception to be amplified through unchallenged quotes and columns promising mass deaths and “an endless global recession.”

In his opening campaign speech, Biden himself piled on the tax dishonesty: “There’s a $2 trillion tax cut last year. Did you feel it? Did you get anything from it? Of course not …All of it went to folks at the top and corporations.” The Washington Post’s fact checker gave him “four Pinocchios” for what it called a “whopper” from a man who has never been known for “turning a phrase with precision.” Biden is building his economic argument on one big fat lie.

Democrats lie all the time about stuff that matters; they just don’t pay the same price as Donald Trump for their untruthfulness. About two-thirds of Americans consider Trump dishonest, according to a recent survey, including a quarter of his own party. When it comes to paying for mendaciousness, however, the media has failed to spread the tab evenly around the ideological dinner table. Has Adam Schiff, for instance, paid any price at all for lying about Russia collusion? His media appearances haven’t abated since his embarrassing exposure as a fraud.

More from Scott Jennings:Democrats and media enablers will try anything to frame Donald Trump

This nation doesn’t need an ethics lecture from a Democratic Party that lies more than a no-legged dog. Lord have mercy, but has Biden forgotten that Democrats — led by his old boss — passed Obamacare on the back of a cock-and-bull story so egregious that it was given the “Lie of the Year” award? President Barack Obama lied repeatedly to the American people, yet Democrats celebrate his “scandal free” administration. If Trump’s lying is a scandal, folks, we need to revisit Obama’s tenure, stat.

Some Democrats mindlessly chant “character matters” with nary a hint of self-reflection. But there’s no character in a party that tells you your taxes went up when they went down, or that glibly tossed Brett Kavanaugh’s reputation out of the car window with Michael Avenatti behind the wheel.

Hope springs eternal that honesty will find a place in Washington, but Democrats won’t find the high ground no matter how often Biden breathlessly lies into a television camera. Listen to how effortlessly Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez — the true heart and soul of the Democratic party — explains away her own fabrications:

“I think that there’s a lot of people more concerned about being precisely, factually, and semantically correct than about being morally right,” she told Anderson Cooper.

Thou shalt not bear false witness, unless thou considers thouself moral, then... knock yourself out.

When Democrats cease their “sustained and misleading effort” to destroy the Trump presidency, we can talk about whether character matters. Until then, Biden and the lot of them can pound sand.

(CNN) —

The partisan warfare over the Mueller report will rage, but one thing cannot be denied: Former President Barack Obama looks just plain bad. On his watch, the Russians meddled in our democracy while his administration did nothing about it.

courtesy of Scott Jennings Scott Jennings

The Mueller report flatly states that Russia began interfering in American democracy in 2014. Over the next couple of years, the effort blossomed into a robust attempt to interfere in our 2016 presidential election. The Obama administration knew this was going on and yet did nothing. In 2016, Obama’s National Security Adviser Susan Rice told her staff to “stand down” and “knock it off” as they drew up plans to “strike back” against the Russians, according to an account from Michael Isikoff and David Corn in their book “Russian Roulette: The Inside Story of Putin’s War on America and the Election of Donald Trump”.

Why did Obama go soft on Russia? My opinion is that it was because he was singularly focused on the nuclear deal with Iran. Obama wanted Putin in the deal, and to stand up to him on election interference would have, in Obama’s estimation, upset that negotiation. This turned out to be a disastrous policy decision.

Obama’s supporters claim he did stand up to Russia by deploying sanctions after the election to punish them for their actions. But, Obama, according to the Washington Post, “approved a modest package… with economic sanctions so narrowly targeted that even those who helped design them describe their impact as largely symbolic.” In other words, a toothless response to a serious incursion.

But don’t just take my word for it that Obama failed. Congressman Adam Schiff, who disgraced himself in this process by claiming collusion when Mueller found that none exists, once said that “the Obama administration should have done a lot more.” The Washington Post reported that a senior Obama administration official said they “sort of choked” in failing to stop the Russian government’s brazen activities. And Obama’s ambassador to Russia, Michael McFaul, said, “The punishment did not fit the crime” about the weak sanctions rolled out after the 2016 election.

A legitimate question Republicans are asking is whether the potential “collusion” narrative was invented to cover up the Obama administration’s failures. Two years have been spent fomenting the idea that Russia only interfered because it had a willing, colluding partner: Trump. Now that Mueller has popped that balloon, we must ask why this collusion narrative was invented in the first place.

Given Obama’s record on Russia, one operating theory is that his people needed a smokescreen to obscure just how wrong they were. They’ve blamed Trump. They’ve even blamed Mitch McConnell, in some twisted attempt to deflect blame to another branch of government. Joe Biden once claimed McConnell refused to sign a letter condemning the Russians during the 2016 election. But McConnell’s office counters that the White House asked him to sign a letter urging state electors to accept federal help in securing local elections – and he did. You can read it here.

I guess if I had failed to stop Russia from marching into Crimea, making a mess in Syria, and hacking our democracy I’d be looking to blame someone else, too.

But the Mueller report makes it clear that the Russian interference failure was Obama’s alone. He was the commander-in-chief when all of this happened. In 2010, he and Eric Holder, his Attorney General, declined to prosecute Julian Assange, who then went on to help Russia hack the Democratic National Committee’s emails in 2016. He arguably chose to prioritize his relationship with Putin vis-à-vis Iran over pushing back against Russian election interference that had been going on for at least two years.

If you consider Russian election interference a crisis for our democracy, then you cannot read the Mueller report, adding it to the available public evidence, and conclude anything other than Barack Obama spectacularly failed America. Subsequent investigations of this matter should explore how and why Obama’s White House failed, and whether they invented the collusion narrative to cover up those failures.",1,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/19/opinions/mueller-report-obama-jennings/index.html
182,Jennings,Scott,news,"The Mueller report will not change political opinions of President Donald Trump. Democrats will continue to hate the president and Republicans will continue to think Trump got a raw deal because two years of his presidency were inhibited by an investigation that turned up no collusion. Special counsel Robert Mueller will get plaudits for uncovering the depths of the Russian meddling but will have to answer questions about why he didn’t move to compel Trump to testify.

Ultimately, most Americans will conclude that the best way to sort this out is through an election. Trump faces the voters in 2020 and they will have all of this information to consider as they make their decision. Whether Democrats impatient for an early end to the Trump presidency force impeachment remains to be seen.

There will be legal analysis ad nauseum about obstruction, but here are five political takeaways that jumped out to me:

1.The extent of the Obama administration’s failure on Russia is breathtaking. The Mueller report flatly states that Russian interference efforts began in 2014, continued in 2015 and blossomed into a full-blown effort to meddle in the 2016 presidential election. The report found no evidence that the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia on election meddling, but substantial confirmation that the previous commander-in-chief failed to stop a hostile foreign power from invading our democracy. Why? Obama’s top priority was getting Russia into the Iranian nuclear deal, which explains why his administration turned a blind eye toward Russian electoral interference. Russian meddling is a mess of Obama’s making, and Trump should order immediate steps to use the Mueller report as a roadmap for stopping them in the future. When you consider that Obama failed to prosecute Julian Assange after his 2010 attack on America, and that he then went on to help Russia meddle in the 2016 election, Obama just looks horrible on this entire ordeal.

Mueller report: Attorney General Barr jumped the gun in clearing Trump of obstruction

President Trump should declassify all information on the Russia investigation

2. Democrats have two options — impeach the president or win an election. With their hopes dashed that Mueller would kick in the White House door and frog march the president to jail, Democratic remedies for getting rid of Trump are purely political: impeach the president for obstruction of justice, or work as hard as possible to win the next election. The House Democratic leadership was having trouble tamping down impeachment talk before, and it won’t get any easier now given the relentless focus on the obstruction section of the report. The bloodthirsty among them will grow even thirstier and calls for impeachment are likely to increase. Can Speaker Nancy Pelosi stop them? I have my doubts that she can herd her impeachment cats away from their hyper-partisan impulses.

Further, Democrats must think hard about their future investigatory paths and how it affects their collective credibility in 2020. There will be skepticism among the voting public for any Democratic investigation in the future because their promises of collusion turned out to be false.

3. Mueller must speak. Attorney General William Barr said he had no objection to the special counsel appearing before Congress, and he should do so. It would be a shame, however, if most of his time is focused on Trump and not on helping the federal government prevent Russia election interference in the future. He has done a terrific job uncovering the depth of the interference, including indicting the Russians responsible. Given that they are unlikely to ever see the inside of a U.S. courtroom, Mueller’s legacy should be to create the framework for inoculation against future Russian shenanigans.

4. Congressman Adam Schiff really hurt Democrats by raising the bar on collusion. For two years, Schiff and other Democrats in Congress repeatedly claimed there was evidence of collusion. Time and again, Schiff said he had “direct” evidence of Russian collusion and, since Barr’s initial summary letter, has yet to back down. In fact, Schiff has doubled down on his claims, going even further out on a limb that Mueller sawed off today. Politically, Schiff blew up a balloon for the Democrats that Mueller popped. Loudly.

Keeping quiet or at least making more measured statements would have kept the egg of the collective face of the Democratic Party. Schiff failed as a Democrat and as a leader on the House Intelligence Committee. He should step down as Chairman immediately, as he clearly was more interested in politically damaging Trump than getting to the truth. Democrats would be better served as a party if he resigned from Congress and went away altogether.

5. Bottom line for Trump — no collusion. The report flatly states, just as Barr said it would, that “the evidence we obtained did not establish that the president was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference.” This has been the central question of the Trump presidency, and Mueller has closed the door on what would have been treason. The president is within his rights to attack the Democrats and media who have promised their partisan audiences something that just didn’t happen. I expect little movement in the president’s approval ratings in the aftermath of this report, and unless Democrats move on impeachment this report will be a distant memory come the fall of 2020, when he faces reelection.

Sometimes I wonder how Barack Obama feels about the fact that the person most likely to be the Democratic nominee for president in 2020 has the same position on Obamacare as Donald Trump.

Sen. Bernie Sanders, the crankiest old man in this race, is full steam ahead on his plan to repeal Obamacare and replace it with “Medicare for All.” Last week, Sanders said: “Our current health care system is failing when 80% of Americans worry about affording and accessing health care. We need Medicare for all now.”

Other than the Medicare part, he sounds just like every Republican I know! And Sanders has convinced a fair number of his competitors for the Democratic nomination to follow suit.

President Obama used to stir Americans with his powerful calls for national unity. It looks like he has, after all these years, finally forged agreement among leaders in both parties that his health care law made things worse and should be replaced. Bipartisanship blooms in Washington.

Opinion:Don't believe the lies about single-payer health care

This will make for interesting conversations in the Democratic primary debates. With Sanders railing against Obamacare — and getting amens from across the stage — the task of defending it falls to Joe Biden, who the Associated Press reports is “finalizing the framework for a White House campaign that would cast him as an extension of Barack Obama’s presidency and political movement.”

Former Vice President Biden, the AP says, is betting that Democratic voters are “eager to return to the style and substance of that era.” That’s a risky bet in a party that can’t seem to flee fast enough from Obama’s signature accomplishment.

Hillary Clinton barely survived a Democratic primary pursuing Obama’s third term, and then lost a general election on the same question. And that was before folks had a couple more years to digest their rising insurance premiums and deductibles, often so high as to make their private plans useless. Many Obamacare plan deductibles top $7,000 for a single person, with family policies clocking in well above that.

Voters in both parties know they were duped by Obama’s health care promises. Private insurance customers saw their premiums and deductibles jump to pay for someone else’s health care, but not their own. The smartest thing Sanders could do is emphasize that deductibles go away under his plan. He’ll probably want to de-emphasize the wait times, however. Sanders loves the Canadian single-payer model where 3% of the population is waiting for some sort of medical care. Need to see a specialist like an orthopedic surgeon? The average wait was 24 weeks in urban areas, and 39 weeks in rural.

Jennings: Democrats and media enablers will try anything to frame Donald Trump

Health care isn’t the only part of Obama’s legacy getting a fresh look these days. The indictment of Julian Assange for his role in leaking U.S. military secrets has renewed interest in how he got away with attacking America for so long. The answer is simple — Obama’s Department of Justice, led by Eric Holder, declined to prosecute him in 2010 after Assange and his traitorous handmaiden, Chelsea Manning, leaked documents that put in danger thousands of American soldiers, diplomats and their foreign allies. Wikileaks and Assange attacked America; Obama and Holder did nothing.

Obama’s people coddled Assange and his helper, leaving Wikileaks in place to assist Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election. If you are a Democrat who believes Trump’s presidency is illegitimate because of Russian interference, ask yourself how things could’ve been different if the Obama Administration had seriously pursued Assange after 2010.

Not only did Holder fail, but Obama outrageously commuted Manning’s 35-year prison sentence as he left office. When the traitor formerly known as Bradford Manning wanted a sex-change operation, the U.S. government paid for it. After the new Chelsea Manning was convicted of betraying the United States, the commander in chief inexplicably offered clemency. And now Manning again sits in a jail cell for his loyalty to Assange, refusing to testify against him. The Manning saga was one of the darkest hours of the Obama presidency.

Russia. Wikileaks. Assange. Health care. The upcoming Democratic debate over Obama’s legacy ought to be had, as it is looking worse and worse by the day. Certainly, Republicans don’t agree with the prevailing socialist prescriptions for these failures, but at least some awareness is now emerging that for all of President Obama’s character and wonderful oratory skills, he left behind some real policy stinkers which many in his own party now realize changed America for the worse.

Although we remain far away from the November 2020 election, three days in March 2019 will have a tremendous impact on the outcome.

Several uncomfortable truths were revealed last week for Democrats, whose party has been overcome with conspiracy theorists, con artists, and full-blown socialists.

This week revealed that Democrats and their media enablers will align with virtually any bad actor to frame President Donald Trump, his appointees and his supporters.

Sunday, March 24

After two years of speculation (and the creation of an alternative, fictional universe for millions of Rachel Maddow’s viewers), we finally heard from Attorney General William Barr that Special Counsel Robert Mueller “did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.”

That’s a direct quote from Mueller’s report, not Barr’s interpretation.

Democrats had whipped themselves into a frenzy over the Russian collusion conspiracy theory but now face a reality in which many of their leaders and presidential candidates were exposed as frauds.

If Mueller couldn’t find it, partisan hacks like Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell certainly haven’t, either. The investigation also concluded with Trump and his inner circle facing no charges of obstruction of justice.

In the wake of this news, Democrats have devolved into a collection of conspiracy theorists whose worldview hinges on the belief that Barr, who has been friends with Mueller for 30 years, wrote a letter lying about what is actually in his buddy’s report.

Rand Paul:Mueller probe was a 'colossal waste of money and time'

For Trump, the cloud is lifted. Mueller’s full report may contain information that embarrasses the president and some of his lieutenants, but make no mistake — the end of this investigation with no legal damage to Trump enhanced his chances for re-election.

Monday, March 25

Michael Avenatti, Trump’s tormentor for most of the last two years, was arrested for extortion, fraud and embezzlement. So much happens every week in the Trump era that it’s easy to forget what used to captivate our attention.

Avenatti and his client Stormy Daniels dominated cable news for months, filling the gaps between stories about Russian collusion by guaranteeing that “Mr. Trump will not serve out his term.”

Senate Democrats bought into Avenatti’s outlandish claims about Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, exalting and elevating a modern day snake oil salesman.

Democrats and the media were all aboard Avenatti’s crazy train for two years, turning him into a “liberal folk here” with over 300 TV appearances, according to Rebecca Ruiz of the New York Times. Aligning with this charlatan badly wounded Democrats’ credibility, making it harder to prosecute their case against Trump.

Tuesday, March 26

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell put the “Green New Deal” on his chamber’s floor, drawing great attention to the heart and soul of the Democratic Party – Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (or AOC, as her admirers call her).

McConnell’s move was genius for two reasons. First, it highlighted that AOC is, in fact, running her party. After her plan received zero votes, AOC tweeted that she instructed Senate Democrats to vote “present” instead of yes. Most of them, people with decades of political experience, obeyed the orders of a freshman socialist congresswoman from the Bronx.

Second, the resolution exposed the fundamental lack of seriousness in an AOC-run party. After claiming the world would end in 12 years because of climate change, she assailed McConnell for giving her plan a vote. If “people are dying,” as AOC said, why was she angry to have her plan called for a vote?

Green New Deal:What is it and what does it mean for climate change?

The attention McConnell brought on the Green New Deal further framed next year’s choice — a good economy versus the unhinged socialists and their $93 trillion plan to ban cows, airplanes and capitalism.

Midwestern voters turned against Democrats in 2016 at least in part because President Barack Obama moved the country too far left too fast. But what Obama did will seem like a kiddie ride compared to the Tilt-a-Hurl that AOC and her socialist Democrats are planning for America’s economy and culture.

And on top of all the politics, Tuesday brought news that a Chicago prosecutor dropped charges against #MAGA hate crime hoaxer Jussie Smollett, which reminded Americans of two things — that Democratic-run towns like Chicago are corrupt, and that the media butchered this story from beginning to end.

These sorts of cultural flashpoints stick in Republican craws as lingering reminders that the media will amplify any negative claim about Trump voters, and that the liberal and famous get a different set of rules than the rest of us.

Opinion contributor

Attorney General William Barr has delivered a summary of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s findings, and it could not have turned out better for Donald Trump. Here are my principle takeaways:

1. This is an unequivocal win for the country

That the President of the United States was exonerated of treason — collusion with a hostile foreign power to win an election — should make every American happy.

Unfortunately, Democrats had taken it as an article of faith that Mueller would end their nightmare and frog march President Trump out of the White House in handcuffs. Not only did that dream shatter, but Mueller fully absolved Trump.

On the issue of obstruction, Mueller, finding it too complicated to draw a conclusion, allowed Attorney General Barr to make the call. He did, and Trump is clear of that, too. Our nation will be spared of what would have been certain impeachment had Mueller and Barr found otherwise.

While some Democrats probably still want to go down that road, Mueller’s report makes it highly inadvisable.

Mueller report:Here's what we know and still don't know (and may never know)

2. Everyday Democrats ought to be furious with their party leaders

There’s a scene near the end of the Wizard of Oz in which the curtain is pulled back and everyone realizes there is no wizard, just a manic Kansan frantically pulling levers to intimidate people and create the illusion of a wizard.

That’s what the Democrats did for the last two years, and now Mueller has pulled back the curtain to reveal the true hoax. Democrats now must choose to accept the outcome of this investigation or simply put the curtain back in place and keep pretending we all didn’t see what we just saw. Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain, Rep. Adam Schiff will proclaim!

I understand that many Democrats are disillusioned in the wake of this report, but focus your anger on the real culprits — Schiff, Eric Swalwell and the other Democratic members of Congress who took you for a ride. Without those clowns, you wouldn’t have become so emotionally invested in the idea that Trump’s presidency was illegitimate due to Russian collusion.

Honestly, I have sympathy for rank-and-file Democrats who are demoralized today, as their entire party leadership, aided and abetted by a liberal media establishment, fed them a steady diet of bologna that just didn’t pan out. I’d be angry, too.

They put their trust in a group of snake oil salesman and wound up ripped off. As an electoral matter, voters should turn away from a Democratic Party that just tore the country apart on a total lie.

3. Americans should demand action to prevent future interference

Now that this investigation is behind us, we need a plan to stop Russia and other hostile foreign powers from interfering again.

Let’s face it — President Barack Obama’s administration failed us in 2016, and we must learn from their mistakes, as the electoral interference happened on his watch. Hopefully, Mueller’s full report will give us a road map to safeguarding our democracy in the future.

Mueller report analysis:With Mueller report in, nothing's over. But for Trump, everything has changed

4. Trump deserves the benefit of the doubt for the next two years

He was robbed of that because collusion mania set in immediately, never allowing his administration to function under the usual sunshine instead of clouds. His decisions have been deemed illegitimate by many Democrats who couldn’t accept an election outcome and needed to salve their emotional wounds by inventing this Russian collusion story.

Further, the 2018 election was run with the overlay of what is now a proven falsehood — that voters had to rebalance the political landscape to make up for Trump colluding with Russia to win in 2016. The entire freshman Democratic class in the U.S. House is there, at least in part, because of a bill of goods sold to the American people that whipped Democratic turnout into a frenzy.

5. Hooray for government functioning properly

Robert Mueller is a great American who deserves our thanks for a job well done. I didn’t agree with Trump’s attacks on Mueller, and the special counsel weathered that storm and completed his task by the book. No leaks, no interference and no funny business here, just a comprehensive look that found the president was not guilty of treason, as the Democrats claimed.

Surely, we can all celebrate the fact that our government and its underlying institutions held fast — this investigation was legal, conducted properly and produced outcomes according to all of our laws and regulations.

The information was not weaponized at any time during the investigation, and the final conclusions have been transmitted properly to the Congress. I agree that the full report should be made public, but that innocent people who were interviewed should not be dragged through the mud for the amusement of Democrats who must satisfy their bloodthirstiness with someone other than Trump himself.

Even as we mourn, we are at each other’s throats.

The horrific New Zealand mosque killings brought people worldwide to tears, as we collectively contemplated another act of terrorism committed against people of faith. In recent years, Christians, Jews and Muslims have all been the victims of dreadful acts of violence.

It was encouraging to see faithful people the world over join in solidarity with New Zealand. In gatherings large and small, people joined to pray, love each other and send a message that mankind wholeheartedly rejects terrorism.

But even in mourning, we found ways to continue to divide ourselves. Chelsea Clinton, daughter of President Bill and Hillary Clinton, showed up at a public vigil on Friday night to mourn the victims, and she was confronted by a young women who berated and blamed Clinton for the massacre.

Christchurch shootings:Hate spreads quickly in the digital age

“This right here is the result of a massacre stoked by people like you and the words that you put into the world. And I want you to know that and I want you to feel that deeply — 49 people died because of the rhetoric you put out there,” the young women screamed as her friends snapped in approval.

Wait, what?

She blamed Chelsea Clinton for a shooting in New Zealand? Clinton’s sin came a couple of weeks ago when she joined the public fray over the anti-Semitic statements of Minnesota Congresswoman Ilhan Omar. Clinton, offended by Omar’s comments, tweeted: “We should expect all elected officials, regardless of party, and all public figures to not traffic in anti-Semitism.”

To follow the logic train — Chelsea Clinton criticized the anti-Semitic comments of a Muslim congresswoman, a maniac kills 50 Muslims in New Zealand, and, in the eyes of this mourner, the murders are Chelsea Clinton’s fault.

This isn’t a play, so we can’t take an intermission for you to recover from this breathtaking stupidity. So we’ll just go ahead and introduce Act II — the doubling down on it by a supposed journalist.

“Chelsea Clinton is an enormously powerful and influential person and it's OK for a grieving college student to yell at her,” tweeted Ashlea Feinberg, whose website describes her as a Senior Reporter at the Huffington Post.

Christchurch shooting:In the face of the New Zealand massacre, we must hold on to hope

Are the “powerful and influential” doomed to walk the earth as punching bags for whatever emotion we are feeling in the moment? In our era of wokeness, the answer is yes. Normally, this manifests itself in the form of attacking Donald Trump…

Cue Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, who couldn’t help himself.

“The public discourse from the president ... is a factor in some of these actions,"" Blumenthal said, before linking the New Zealand shooting to Trump’s border security national emergency.

Of course, this is nothing new for Trump. The Washington Post ran a piece in 2018 headlined: “Yes, you can blame President Trump for Hurricane Florence.” Weather, shootings in other countries…sure, blame Donald J. Trump. Why not? It’s easier than thinking hard about a topic for more than five seconds, I guess. He’s certainly not right about everything, but he’s not always to blame, either.

But this is a new experience for someone like Chelsea Clinton, who messed up by breaking the fringe left authoritarian mob’s rules.

By criticizing Omar, she did something that woke liberals just can’t allow — teaming up with Republicans to criticize the hate speech of a young (check), female (check), Somali (check), Muslim (check), liberal (check), Democrat (check).

Check out:Like Trump, Fox News' Tucker Carlson is a moral monster and loved for it

Omar checks so many woke boxes that she wears a veritable suit of armor when it comes to public criticism. To her supporters, everything she does and says — no matter how hateful or idiotic — is infallible and anyone who speaks up against her is, well, responsible for murder.

Omar might want to tend to her politics back home, though, as Jewish and Muslim leaders in Minnesota have had it with her inflammatory rhetoric, according to a CNN report.

Even as we mourn, our dumb national politics get the better of us. Had Clinton not expressed an opinion about Omar, her attendance at the NYU vigil would have come and gone without notice. Instead, because she ran afoul of the left-wing thought police, her attempt to show solidarity with the world’s Muslim community was met with outrage.

These evil acts of terrorism are terrible. We cannot confront the grief that follows these acts of terrorism without contemplating the divisions in our politics, which prevents unity in a world that sorely needs it.

190,Jennings,Scott,pressdemocrat,"Jennings: Why Republicans will never quit Trump

Why do Republicans stick with Donald Trump? It's a question I'm asked again and again by Democrats, “Never Trumpers” and journalists.

The answer is simple: attitude and gratitude.

For years, Republican voters wanted someone - anyone - to come along and do two things: stick it to the Clintons and punch back against the media-Democratic Party alliance that fires on every Republican brave enough to stick a head out of the foxhole.

If you attended any GOP fundraiser or grass-roots event between 2000 and 2016 - and I went to hundreds - you heard this sentiment over and over. And over. And over.

For Republicans, it seemed like those awful Clintons got to play by a different set of rules. And they always seemed so smug about it. Many tried and failed to oppose them. The first Bush and Bob Dole, decent men and dedicated public servants, were steamrolled by the Clintons in 1990s.

Sure, we had George W. Bush after Clinton was termed out, and Barack Obama knocked Hillary down a peg in 2008. But she still wound up secretary of state while Bill traveled the world, racking up speaking fees and tributes that would embarrass Croesus. Damn those Clintons.

For finally bringing them to heel, alone, the president has earned the forever gratitude of virtually every Republican. The rest hardly matters. Jared's security clearance? National emergency? Stormy Daniels? Please.

Like the high school quarterback who took his team to the state championship, Trump will never buy a Diet Coke in the proverbial Republican saloon again. And the barkeep will hang Robert Mueller's report in the back of a urinal.

Republicans waited a long time. They got angrier and angrier as a succession of honorable leaders - George W. Bush, Mitt Romney, John McCain - were portrayed by the media as stupid, feeble or criminal while Obama and the Clintons were treated with near-reverence.

Republicans waited through the Obama years, simmering with rage as the country lurched dramatically leftward and anti-Christian sentiments flourished. They seethed as traditional Christian values were mocked and barred from public policy decisions. If a baker doesn't want to make a cake for you, leave him the hell alone and find someone else.

The natural conclusion of this pent-up anger finally boiled over in 2016.

Enter Donald Trump, the only Republican candidate who understood the actual consumer demands of the Republican marketplace: Be strong enough, bold enough, crazy enough and ruthless enough to beat the elitist media and Hillary Clinton, who is slipperier and meaner than a wet panther.

Policy? GOP voters assumed he'd basically govern like a conservative. But who had the nerve to absolutely and unapologetically take on the tormentors? Who had the guts to, oh, I don't know, put all of Bill Clinton's female accusers in the front row during a debate? At least Trump owned his playboy lifestyle, unlike the hypocrite Clinton. Embarrassing and tough to defend? Sure. Deal breaker? No way.

And when he achieved the presidency, Trump delivered. His campaign had sent the message Republicans wanted to hear - I take no crap. Everyone on this primary ballot will show their belly, he said in effect; I will show them my fists.

Trump isn't a politician, but he alone in a crowded primary field realized how much Republican politics had changed. Darrell Hammond, the best Trump actor “Saturday Night Live” ever cast, summed it up best: the president is a “genius empath.”

Unencumbered by the pablum that traps most politicians, Trump is a perfect mirror when he takes the rally stage. The attendees see themselves in him; they don't talk or think like politicians, either. And though their lives don't permit them to attack those they find aggravating, they can live vicariously through a president who does it for them. This is especially true for rural folks, looked down upon as hicks and rubes by the coastal elites for a very long time. Bless your hearts, we do cling to our guns and religion because they are a deeply meaningful part of our heritage.

Is Trump a perfect representative of the disrespected rural Republican, who goes to church on Sunday and worries about what cavalier, liberal attitudes toward life and marriage mean for the future of their country? No, of course not.

But elections are about choices, and Trump will get the same benefit of the doubt from evangelicals in 2020. He's a sinner, they'll tell themselves, but at least he respects our pastors, doesn't make fun of our beliefs and fights for the babies who can't defend themselves against Ralph Northam and Andrew Cuomo. We didn't hire a barbarian to sing soprano in the choir; we hired him to beat back the savages.",1,http://www.pressdemocrat.com/opinion/9391141-181/jennings-why-republicans-will-never

Es una pregunta que me hacen una y otra vez los demócratas, los “anti-Trump” y los periodistas. Pero la respuesta es simple: actitud y gratitud.

Durante años, los votantes republicanos querían que alguien -cualquiera- llegara e hiciera dos cosas: enfrente a los Clinton, y contraataque la alianza del partido Demócrata con los medios de comunicación, que embiste contra todos los republicanos lo suficientemente valientes como para sacar la cabeza de la madriguera.

Quienes asistieron a un evento de recaudación de fondos o reunión popular del partido republicano (GOP) entre 2000 y 2016 -y yo asistí a cientos de ellos-, escucharon este sentir una y otra vez. Y otra, y otra más.

Anuncio

Para los republicanos, parecía que esos horribles Clinton jugaban con reglas diferentes a las del resto de nosotros, y además, siempre lucían tan engreídos al respecto. Muchos habían intentado oponerse a ellos, pero fracasaron. El primer Bush y Bob Dole, hombres decentes y dedicados servidores públicos, fueron arrollados por los Clinton en los años 1990.

Está bien, se que tuvimos a George W. Bush luego de que Clinton terminara su mandato, y Obama logró derribar a Hillary en 2008. Pero ella aún así fue secretaria de Estado mientras Bill viajaba por el mundo, acumulando honorarios de oratoria y tributos de fundaciones que avergonzarían al propio Creso. Malditos sean esos Clinton.

Sólo por hacer mención, el presidente se ha ganado la gratitud eterna de prácticamente todos los republicanos. El resto apenas importa. ¿La autorización de seguridad de Jared? ¿Emergencia nacional? ¿Stormy Daniels? Por favor.

Al igual que un mariscal de campo de preparatoria que lleva a su equipo al campeonato estatal, Trump nunca tendrá la necesidad de pagar por una Diet Coke en la famosa taberna republicana y el camarero colgará el famoso informe de Robert Mueller en la parte posterior de un urinario.

Anuncio

Los republicanos esperaron mucho tiempo. Se enojaban cada vez más, mientras una sucesión de líderes honorables -pensemos en George W. Bush, John McCain, Mitt Romney- eran retratados por los medios de comunicación como estúpidos, débiles o criminales, mientras que Obama y los Clinton eran tratados casi con reverencia.

Los republicanos esperaron durante la presidencia de Obama, hirviendo de rabia mientras el país se tambaleaba dramáticamente hacia la izquierda y los sentimientos anticristianos florecían. Hervían mientras los valores cristianos tradicionales eran burlados y quedaban excluidos de las decisiones de políticas públicas. Si un panadero no quiere hacerte el pastel, déjalo en paz y busca a alguien más.

El resultado natural de esta ira contenida finalmente se desbordó en 2016.

Aquí es cuando llega Donald Trump, el único candidato republicano que entendió las demandas reales de los consumidores en el mercado republicano: ser lo suficientemente fuerte, lo suficientemente audaz, estar lo suficientemente loco y ser implacable como para vencer a los medios elitistas y a Hillary Clinton, que es más escurridiza y más mezquina que una pantera mojada.

Anuncio

¿Y en la política? Los votantes del partido republicano asumieron que, básicamente, él gobernaría como un conservador. Pero, ¿quién se atrevía a enfrentarse cabalmente y sin disculpas a todos los tormentos? ¿Quién tenía las agallas para, no sé, poner a todas las acusadoras de Bill Clinton en la primera fila durante un debate? Al menos Trump reconocía su estilo de vida de playboy, a diferencia del hipócrita de Clinton. ¿Vergonzoso y difícil de defender? Por supuesto. ¿Factor decisivo? De ninguna manera.

Y cuando logró la presidencia, Trump cumplió. Su campaña había enviado el mensaje que los republicanos querían escuchar: no soporto las tonterías de nadie. Todos en esta votación primaria mostrarán sumisión, dijo en efecto; yo les mostraré mi fuerza.

Trump no es un político, pero tan sólo en una primaria llena de gente se dio cuenta de cuánto había cambiado la política republicana. Darrell Hammond, el mejor actor que representó a Trump en “Saturday Night Live”, lo resumió mejor: el presidente es un “genio empático”.

Libre de culpas por el palabrerío que enreda a la mayoría de los políticos, Trump es un espejo perfecto cuando sube al escenario en sus actos políticos. Los asistentes se ven reflejados en él: ellos tampoco hablan ni piensan como un político. Y aunque sus vidas no les permiten atacar a quienes encuentran agravantes, pueden vivir indirectamente a través de un presidente que lo hace por ellos. Esto es especialmente cierto en el caso de la gente de las zonas rurales, que las elites de la costa consideraron como pueblerinos y rústicos durante mucho tiempo. ¡Claro que sí! Nos aferramos a nuestras armas y a la religión porque son una parte muy significativa de nuestra herencia.

Anuncio

¿Es Trump un representante perfecto de los republicanos rurales insultados, que van a la iglesia el domingo y se preocupan por las actitudes desenfadadas y liberales hacia la vida y el matrimonio para el futuro de su país? No, claro que no.

Pero las elecciones tienen que ver con elegir, y Trump obtendrá el mismo beneficio de la duda de parte de los evangélicos en 2020. Es un pecador, se dirán a sí mismos, pero al menos respeta a nuestros pastores, no se burla de nuestras creencias y lucha por los bebés que no pueden defenderse a sí mismos de Ralph Northam y Andrew Cuomo. No contratamos a un bárbaro para cantar como un soprano en el coro; lo contratamos para vencer a los salvajes.

La actitud de Trump en el cargo ha sido exactamente lo que anticipó durante su campaña. Y sus enemigos -esos medios que azotan a Trump día y noche-, tienen falta de confianza que limitan su alcance y su capacidad para abolir el apoyo principal de Trump: cuando casi el 60% de los estadounidenses piensan que los medios “no entienden a la gente como ellos”, según el Pew Research Center, ¿cómo se supone que los reporteros y comentaristas deben convencerlos de que el Trumpismo está destruyendo el país? Como cualquiera que sabe cómo funciona la mercadotecnia, Trump conoce a sus competidores mejor que ellos mismos.

En cuanto a la política, Trump básicamente ha gobernado como se espera que lo haga un presidente del partido republicano. Recortó los impuestos, dio marcha atrás con el régimen regulatorio de Obama y nombró a numerosos jueces jóvenes y conservadores para que se unan a dos fenomenales elecciones para el Tribunal Supremo. Y los sondeos muestran que los votantes del GOP apoyan a Trump para detener la inmigración ilegal más que al Congreso, que ahora lucha por explicar su oposición a la declaración del muro de Trump, en lugares como Carolina del Norte.

Anuncio

Pero no es la política la que impulsa el poder de permanencia de Trump. Después de todo, hacer cosas básicamente republicanas es lo que se supone que debe hacer. No, el ingrediente secreto es la liberación continua de una actitud que los republicanos anhelaron durante años.

El índice de aprobación de Trump entre los republicanos, de cerca del 90% en la última encuesta de NBC News / Wall Street Journal, es incuestionable. Él tiene el control total de su partido, y eso no cambiará. Así que, dejemos esa cuestión.

Trump no tiene asegurada la reelección, por supuesto. Cualquier informe certero de las elecciones de mitad de mandato de 2018 muestra los desafíos que enfrenta en áreas suburbanas (“para las madres que practican yoga y sus esposos”, como me dijo un encuestador en octubre pasado). Mueller, además, podría activar una bomba que no conocemos. Pero la actitud y la gratitud, junto con las ventajas naturales del mandato, nunca permitirán que se vaya al fondo.

Trump ganó, en parte, porque grandes franjas del país pensaban que Barack Obama nos había llevado demasiado hacia la izquierda. Los demócratas que avanzan hacia un socialismo pleno en 2020 podrían darle a Trump una plataforma para ganar de nuevo; ‘No soy perfecto, pero estas personas nos harán llevar un Libro Rojo, llenos de los tuits de Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) antes de que nos demos cuenta’.

Policy? GOP voters assumed he’d basically govern like a conservative. But who had the nerve to absolutely and unapologetically take on the tormentors? Who had the guts to, oh, I don’t know, put all of Bill Clinton’s female accusers in the front row during a debate? At least Trump owned his playboy lifestyle, unlike the hypocrite Clinton. Embarrassing and tough to defend? Sure. Deal breaker? No way.

And when he achieved the presidency, Trump delivered. His campaign had sent the message Republicans wanted to hear — I take crap from no one. Everyone on this primary ballot will show their belly, he said in effect; I will show them my fists.

Trump isn’t a politician but he alone in a crowded primary field realized how much Republican politics had changed. Darrell Hammond, the best Trump actor “Saturday Night Live” ever cast, summed it up best: the president is a “genius empath.”

Unencumbered by the pablum that traps most politicians, Trump is a perfect mirror when he takes the rally stage. The attendees see themselves in him; they don’t talk or think like politicians, either. And though their lives don’t permit them to attack those they find aggravating, they can live vicariously through a president who does it for them. This is especially true for rural folks, looked down upon as hicks and rubes by the coastal elites for a very long time. Bless your hearts, we do cling to our guns and religion because they are a deeply meaningful part of our heritage.

Is Trump a perfect representative of the disrespected rural Republican, who goes to church on Sunday and worries about what cavalier, liberal attitudes toward life and marriage mean for the future of their country? No, of course not.

But elections are about choices, and Trump will get the same benefit of the doubt from evangelicals in 2020. He’s a sinner, they’ll tell themselves, but at least he respects our pastors, doesn’t make fun of our beliefs and fights for the babies who can’t defend themselves against Ralph Northam and Andrew Cuomo. We didn’t hire a barbarian to sing soprano in the choir; we hired him to beat back the savages.

Trump’s attitude in office has been exactly what he previewed during the campaign. And his enemies — the media types who flog Trump day and night — have trust deficits that cap their reach and ability to dent Trump’s core support: When nearly 60% of Americans think the media does “not understand people like them,” according to the Pew Research Center, how are news reporters and commentators supposed to convince Americans that Trumpism is destroying the country? Like any marketing virtuoso, Trump knows his competitors better than they know themselves.

As to policy, Trump has basically governed the way you’d expect a GOP president to govern. He cut taxes, rolled back Obama’s regulatory regime and appointed bushels of young conservative judges to go with two rock-star Supreme Court picks. And polling shows GOP voters stand with Trump on stemming illegal immigration more than the congressional handwringers, who are now scrambling to explain their opposition to Trump’s wall declaration in places like North Carolina.

But it isn’t policy that drives Trump’s staying power. After all, doing basic Republican stuff is what he is supposed to do. No, the secret sauce is Trump’s continued deliverance of an attitude for which Republicans thirsted for years.

Enter the Fray: First takes on the news of the minute »

Trump’s approval rating among Republicans, near 90% in the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey, is unquestioned. He is in full control of his party, and that will not change. So stop asking.

Trump isn’t a lock for reelection, of course. Any fair accounting of the 2018 midterm shows the challenges he faces in suburban areas (“yoga moms and their husbands,” as one pollster put it to me last October). And Mueller could always produce a bombshell we don’t know about. But attitude and gratitude, along with the natural advantages of incumbency, will never allow the bottom to fall out.

Trump won in part because huge swaths of the country thought Barack Obama had taken us too far to the left, too fast. Democrats racing toward full-blown socialism in 2020 could give Trump a platform to essentially run the same race again — I’m not perfect but these folks will have us carrying Little Red Books full of AOC’s tweets before we know it.

Buckle up. 2020 promises a close race, and one that Trump is fully capable of winning.

President Donald Trump made a wise choice in tapping Kentucky’s Kelly Craft as his new nominee for U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. She has big shoes to fill by following former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, but Craft is more than capable of representing America on the world stage. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who recommended Craft to Trump, noted that Haley “had zero” foreign policy experience before becoming U.N. ambassador and that she “did a fine job” nonetheless.

In fact, this is Craft’s third diplomatic post and her second stint at the U.N., after President George W. Bush named her a public delegate to the U.N. General Assembly in 2007. I was involved in Craft’s appointment during my White House tenure, and she earned a reputation as being well-prepared and a tireless public servant.

While serving in New York last time, Craft dealt with American efforts to combat malaria and AIDS on the African continent, a portfolio that remains a jewel in President Bush’s foreign policy achievements. For those who strongly believe in the value of American engagement in the world, Craft’s speech about President Bush’s work to relieve human suffering is fondly recalled:

“Our commitment will not falter, and we stand ready to work with our partners to meet these global challenges and realize Africa’s promise,” Craft said to the U.N. Indeed, President Bush’s efforts saved millions of lives.

Background:Trump nominates Kentuckian Kelly Knight Craft to be UN Ambassador

Craft’s most recent posting in Ottawa as the American ambassador has been anything but sleepy, and she had a key role in renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement. Reuters reported that Craft “was seen as a tough negotiator in a new U.S. trade deal with Canada and Mexico and … established decent working relationships with both Republicans and Democrats in Congress …”

Frank McKenna, former Canadian ambassador to the U.S., told the Lexington Herald-Leader that Craft “really proved herself over some tough times.” He added: “In many ways, being ambassador to Canada under President Trump is (a) good training ground for the U.N.”

Several Kentuckians have achieved high diplomatic office, including at least three ambassadors to the Court of St. James (Great Britain). Louisville’s Matthew Barzun, after serving as ambassador to Sweden, went to London during the Obama years, as did William Farish, owner of Lane’s End thoroughbred farm in Versailles, during Bush 43’s first term. In 1933, Franklin Roosevelt sent Robert Worth Bingham to represent America in what is arguably the most important single-nation ambassadorship for any president.

In the mid-20th century, former Kentucky Sen. John Sherman Cooper was pressed into diplomatic service on four occasions by presidents of both parties — delegate to the United Nations (Truman, 1949-51); ambassador to India and Nepal (Eisenhower, 1955-56); ambassador to East Germany (Ford, 1974-76); and a return engagement as delegate to the United Nations (Reagan, 1981). Bush 43, John F. Kennedy, Jimmy Carter and Abraham Lincoln tapped other Kentuckians for diplomatic posts as well.

Scott Jennings:No. Trump hasn't unleashed an army of racist, MAGA hat monsters

But Craft’s new job means she will surpass them all. Her rural roots — she grew up in Glasgow, Kentucky — make her a perfect choice for Trump, whose presidency is rooted in places like Barren County, where voters rejected politics as usual in 2016. Her nomination marks another successful recommendation from McConnell, whose yeomen’s work on shepherding presidential appointments will be remembered as one of the most successful aspects of the Trump-McConnell era.

Criticisms lobbed at Craft by her detractors — the folks who can’t stand it when Trump nominates a qualified woman or person of color to a key post — will drain like water off a duck’s back. I’ve never been around Craft when she wasn’t smiling, pleasant and deadly serious about whatever job she had at the time. She’s equal parts happy and warrior when it comes to her conservative values.

Before heading to Canada, Craft had become Kentucky’s preeminent Republican fundraiser, the person every candidate wanted to lead their efforts in the Bluegrass. Now, she is the state’s best-known diplomat since Henry Clay served as secretary of state under President John Quincy Adams.

Scott Jennings:Ocasio-Cortez, Tlaib are honest Dems, and the party can't stand it

Out for a run over the weekend, the multitasking Craft called to chat for a few minutes. She’s excited and ready for what she knows will be her greatest challenge, and ever mindful of her roots.

“I couldn’t be prouder to represent Kentucky and all of America on behalf of President Donald Trump, if confirmed by the United States Senate,” she told me. “And I’m grateful for the folks praying and pulling for me back home.”

Let’s be honest with each other for a moment.

There’s a cabal of people in this country fully invested in driving The Narrative instead of The Truth. The Cabal is powerful, made up of those who wield outsized influence on what Americans know about our nation’s public affairs.

You know it, and I know it. The Narrative is simple:

President Donald Trump is a hypocrite and a liar. Everything he says and does is without precedent and has sinister motive. Anyone who supports Trump is complicit in racism and in allowing Russia to control the United States.

Trump has unleashed an army of misogynist, racist, red-hat wearing monsters who terrorize people for skin color, gender and sexual preference. Trump’s policies are built on lies and hurt many who support him and everyone who doesn’t. American democracy will cease to exist should Trump win re-election.

Also:Number of hate groups hits 20-year high amid rise in white supremacy, report finds

Check out:Nick Sandmann's legal team files $250M lawsuit against Washington Post

The Cabal will do virtually anything to keep The Narrative afloat. It reported erroneously that Trump threw a bust of Martin Luther King Jr. out of the Oval Office. With a straight face, it told you that a federal judge and future Supreme Court justice essentially participated in a high school sex cult.

It vilified — in error and without investigation — a mild-mannered teenager for wearing a hat while visiting the Lincoln Memorial. It pretends that members of the Trump #Resistance simply didn’t say about infanticide what the cameras clearly recorded, and that anti-Semitism in its ranks isn’t really anti-Semitism.

The Narrative is an elaborate stage production featuring clever sleight of hand. The actors portraying Victim and Perpetrator always feature the same characteristics. Desperation for The Narrative to become reality eliminates critical thinking from the minds of otherwise smart people.

Scott Jennings:Ocasio-Cortez, Tlaib are honest Dems, and the party can't stand it

The latest example of this phenomenon came as Chicago police pulled the plug on actor Jussie Smollett’s claim of being beaten in the middle of the night by two men who shouted racist and homophobic slurs while wearing “Make America Great Again” hats. Smollett’s story was shaky from the beginning, but virtually every mainstream media outlet and leading liberal voice weaponized the incident into The Narrative’s latest cause célèbre.

A “modern day lynching,” Sens. Kamala Harris and Cory Booker called it.

""This attack was not 'possibly' homophobic. It was a racist and homophobic attack,” tweeted Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a master of driving The Narrative instead of The Truth about her own upbringing.

Sen. Bernie Sanders said it was “a horrific instance of the surging hostility toward minorities around the country.”

Joe Gerth:I have zero experience with a handgun. But Kentucky says I can carry a concealed weapon

The Cabal is a bad take factory, but it never exhibits shame or guilt.

The Cabal never waits, racing to cement The Narrative no matter how fantastical the details. I helped Covington Catholic high school student Nick Sandmann distribute the literal truth of what happened to him and his classmates at the Lincoln Memorial, even as The Cabal raged and advocated that Nick be punched in the face.

Sandmann and his classmates, via video evidence and an investigative report, were exonerated, but The Cabal refuses to punish the actual instigators for spewing hate and dissembling about what really happened. Instead, The Cabal searches for Orwell’s face crimes while calling for hat bans.

The Narrative demands that certain people must always be believed, and that certain others must always be guilty. The Guilty must pay with their reputations and livelihoods, no exceptions. The Cabal refuses to take responsibility for its mistakes and never pumps the brakes on these stories, despite crash after crash. Of course, never admitting a mistake means never having to reflect on the destruction of your own credibility.

Opinion:Louisville budget cuts would threaten well-being of families

Neither American political tribe is without sin. Trump, like most presidents, has told some absolute whoppers, and some of his supporters have done dumb things. But that is no excuse for a cabal of the powerful to create a narrative that destroys lives and reputations in the name of achieving a political outcome. The Cabal accuses Trump of creating an “alternate reality” for his supporters. But what do you call the proliferation of narrative over truth?

Brett Kavanaugh is not a sex maniac. There isn’t a racist bone in Nick Sandmann’s body. A smaller refund, Sen. Harris, does not mean taxes went up. MAGA hat gangs aren’t terrorizing American streets.

Mitt Romney, a Republican, warned us about Russia as Barack Obama and Joe Biden laughed in his face. There is no evidence, Elizabeth Warren, that the Georgia governor’s race was stolen from Democrats. Other presidents have declared national emergencies and yes, Democrats supported border walls before they became “immoral” and “racist.”

But don’t tell The Cabal. It may come for you next.

196,Jennings,Scott,news,"President Donald Trump delivered a mostly optimistic State of the Union address that signaled his desire to cooperate with Democrats in Congress on a variety of issues. His message was what you’d hope from a president heading into a re-election — pivoting in areas where he knows he’s weak and must improve to win. If this was the beginning of Trump’s presidential campaign, he’s clearly setting up a contrast where he appears interested in solutions and compromise, while Democrats appear sullen, intransigent and veering too far left on economic policies and cultural issues such as abortion.

A speech for women. Many passages were aimed at a demographic with which Trump has struggled — female voters. His approval rating among women was just 32 percent in the latest CNN poll, something Trump must address if he hopes to win re-election. His point on women filling 58 percent of new jobs created in the past year was a smart attempt to tie his best issue — the economy — to one of his weak spots. His announcement of a “governmentwide initiative focused on economic empowerment for women in developing countries” will play well with people who want him to uphold the Republican Party’s traditional position of spreading American values in the world.

Shutdown is no time for celebratory State of the Union. No time is. Let's scrap it.

Northam should be remembered for advocating the slaughtering of deformed babies

Return to independent roots. Much of the early part of the speech cast Trump as separate from both parties. He said the nation needed solutions to “problems neglected by leaders of both parties over many decades.” He argued that his agenda is not owned by one party or the other, an attempt at outreach to independent voters who swung against him in 2018. The comment that “victory is not winning for our party, victory is winning for our country” was part of his attempt to set up the Democrats as partisan actors, more interested in ending his presidency than in finding solutions to problems that everyday people face.

Story continues

Abortion politics returns. Democrats have overreached on abortion as of late, and Trump wisely took advantage of it. The new late-term abortion law passed in New York and Gov. Ralph Northam’s gruesome comments in Virginia have reopened a front in the culture wars that will work for Trump if Democratic presidential candidates follow their fringe abortion activists down this grotesque rabbit hole. Trump’s base is strongly pro-life and is heartened by his continued support of their issue.

Democrats as obstructionists. While Trump’s approval rating remains in the low 40s, Congress is in much worse shape. A strategy to run against obstructionist Democrats and paint them as roadblocks to solutions could be a way for Trump to explain why he still has more work to do and deserves four more years. Trump laid out several bipartisan achievements in the last Congress (farm bill, criminal justice reform, opioid legislation) to show America that work across the aisle can be done if both sides are willing.

Socialism the new boogeyman. No matter who wins the Democratic primary for president, Trump set the predicate — his opponent, whoever it is, will be an adherent of socialist policies and is therefore unfit to lead. Democrats will wrestle with this as young stars like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and known commodities like Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren dominate news cycles in Congress and the campaign to come. This is a reason why incumbent presidents are hard to unseat — they have the ability to define their opponents (think Barack Obama vs. Mitt Romney 2012) before they can define themselves.

Immigration is still Trump’s animating issue. The president spent a large chunk of time on immigration and the looming government funding deadline. He was smart to show that he has come down from a concrete wall to a see-through steel barrier to compromise with Democrats, but he probably should have left the caravan talk out of the final draft. The president’s winning hand on this issue is a willingness to compromise without giving up on barriers, a focus on safety and a plan to stop the drugs flowing over our southern border. Democrats don’t want to give the president a win, but they would be unwise to stand against any new barriers on the southern border.

Trump’s bread and butter: the good economy. The president’s best issue remains the nation’s strong economy, and he was smart to spend a fair amount of time on it. The latest CNN poll showed 48 percent of voters approve of the GOP tax cut, versus just 40 percent who disapprove. Democrats don’t want to admit it, but working families are about to file tax returns and see just how much they saved. Trump was smart to include it and to talk about policies that have led to higher wages and strong job growth. Trump wants to run a “peace and prosperity” campaign, and the strong economy has him well on his way.

Trump the Dove returns. The president is listening to the isolationist wing of the Republican Party more than ever, as he talks about bringing troops home and not fighting “endless wars.” Whether these policies make America safer is yet to be seen, but a sizable chunk of Americans agree that open-ended troop deployments, especially in the Middle East, are an expensive quagmire we can’t afford.

North Korea Summit, part 2. The president is clearly proud of his relationship building with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, as he announced the location of their next meeting. Whether Kim actually denuclearizes is far from assured, but Trump deserves credit for trying a new approach where other presidents have failed.

Except for the quiet sobbing of a grieving mother, silence filled a dark hospital room in the middle of the night. Holding her daughter, whose spirit had slipped quietly into heaven before her body emerged into this world, the mother wept until her tear ducts ran dry.

There is no more desperate feeling than that of a parent holding a dead child. You would do anything. You would pay anything.

But at that moment there is nothing to do but pray. And cry.

Those memories flooded back to me last week as I watched Democrats in Virginia calmly describe their ghoulish plans to murder babies as they were being delivered, and after. State Delegate Kathy Tran (D) testified in favor of her legislation allowing abortions up to the moment of birth:

""I mean, through the third trimester,"" Tran said. ""The third trimester goes up to 40 weeks.""

""Okay, but to the end of the third trimester?"" Majority Leader Todd Gilbert (R) asked her.

""Yup, I don't think we have a limit in the bill,"" Tran replied.

""Where it's obvious that a woman is about to give birth, she has physical signs that she's about to give birth, would that still be a point at which she could request an abortion if she was so certified?"" Gilbert asked. ""She's dilating,” he added.

""My bill would allow that, yes,"" Tran said, as calmly as any grocery store butcher goes about their business.

The Tran testimony shocked me, but not as much as what happened next. Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) took it a step further by advocating for abortion after delivery.

“…If a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen. The infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that's what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother. So I think this was really blown out of proportion,” Northam said during a radio interview. Don’t worry — if we miss on the first try we’ll certainly get them on the second, Dr. Mengele.

The governor of Virginia — a pediatrician, by the way — advocates murdering children after delivery and he thinks everyone else is blowing it out of proportion. During his campaign, Northam supported “high quality, affordable health care for all Americans.” I don’t usually think of killing a live human post-birth as “health care,” but I’m not angling to direct the next ""Faces of Death"" movie the way Northam apparently is.

Northam gave a specific reason for committing this sort of murder — “severe deformities.” Everyone should watch his interview and demand answers from every Democratic candidate they meet. Do you believe in slaughtering children post-birth because of deformities? It’s a simple yes or no question. Don’t let them off the hook in Iowa, New Hampshire, or your state capitol.

This all happened a few days after the New York legislature passed and Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) signed legislation allowing abortions up to 40 weeks. Activists whooped loudly in the state Senate chamber as Democrats passed their bill, and more cheered as Cuomo signed it at a pep rally fit for the Grim Reaper.

“This evening is sweet,” Cuomo exclaimed before enraptured liberal supporters, “because we won!” Cuomo even ordered the spire atop One World Trade Center to be lit pink to celebrate. A place built to remember the thousands of innocent lives lost on 9/11 became a monument to the slaughter of thousands of innocent babies.

Disgusting.

I can’t imagine what lies in the heart of someone who cheers for more abortions. I can’t imagine feeling “sweet” over authorizing doctors (and even non-doctors, in the case of New York’s law) to terminate babies over deformities.

Our little girl had deformities. I can assure you that no one held a pep rally when she died.

But there was cheering — sweet, sweet cheering — this week for a 2017 speech made by a man named Frank Stephens. His congressional testimony recirculated on social media at a time when our nation needs a reminder that all life is precious.

“I am a man with Down syndrome, and my life is worth living,” Stephens said. “Politicians change laws; I want to change hearts.” Stephens added: “Is there really no place for us in the world?”

History will remember Northam as the disgraced Democrat who wore blackface, maybe a Ku Klux Klan robe, and nearly moonwalked at a press conference to explain why. I’ll remember Ralph for calmly calling for infanticide — exposing the darkest part of the American Left’s radical abortion agenda — before the Universe delivered his much-deserved comeuppance.

A media outlet blew another Trump story, and the industry’s trust crisis deepened.

Buzzfeed reporters Jason Leopold and Anthony Cormier reported on Thursday night that “President Donald Trump directed his longtime attorney Michael Cohen to lie to Congress… according to two federal law enforcement officials involved in an investigation of the matter.”

The sources were anonymous. The evidence of what would be a presidential felony was described generically but not specifically. Cormier admitted to CNN early Friday morning that he had not personally seen the “emails, text messages, and a cache of other documents” the story claimed as corroborating evidence.

Democrats pounced.

One of the first to call for impeachment was Louisville Congressman John Yarmuth, the budget committee chairman, who tweeted: “If true, which it appears to be, the @BuzzFeedNews report that Trump suborned perjury is an impeachable offense, and the House should begin the process.”

Opinion:Knee-jerk reaction also embarrassing about Covington Catholic incident

Yarmuth’s willingness to trigger a constitutional crisis over an anonymously sourced report mere hours after it landed showed a lack of seriousness and judgment from the newly minted House Democratic majority’s high command.

Yarmuth should have waited, as Buzzfeed’s story was beginning to crumble. Cormier’s admission on CNN was followed by a contravening statement from reporting partner Leopold on MSNBC that he had, in fact, seen the documents.

Leopold’s contradiction was problematic because of his “checkered past” of presenting stories “riddled with inaccuracies and misrepresentations.” He infamously reported in 2006 that Karl Rove’s “indictment is imminent” using anonymous sources. Rove was never indicted, of course, and another log was tossed on a credibility bonfire Leopold set years earlier when he plagiarized and “got all the facts wrong” on stories he wrote about Enron.

By Friday afternoon, Buzzfeed was asking everyone to trust Leopold and his anonymous sources again, this time on a story that would almost certainly lead to the president’s impeachment.

Then Robert Mueller got involved.

The Special Counsel investigating Trump is worshiped by Democrats and media types the way the Ewoks genuflect before C-3PO. The Acela corridor’s deity flew round the room Friday night when his office issued a rare beatific statement:

""BuzzFeed's description of specific statements to the Special Counsel's Office, and characterization of documents and testimony obtained by this office, regarding Michael Cohen's Congressional testimony are not accurate,"" so sayeth the statement from on high.

Buzzfeed stood by its story and reporters while the rest of the media realized what had happened.

“I just think this is a bad day for us... it reinforces every bad stereotype about the news media,” said CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin.

“One person familiar with Mr. Cohen’s testimony to the special counsel’s prosecutors said that Mr. Cohen did not state that the president had pressured him to lie to Congress,” read a passage in The New York Times.

“Inside the Justice Department, the statement was viewed as a huge step, and one that would have been taken only if the special counsel’s office viewed the story as almost entirely incorrect. The special counsel’s office seemed to be disputing every aspect of the story that addressed comments or evidence given to its investigators,” according to The Washington Post, prompting the National Journal’s Josh Kraushaar to tweet: “BuzzFeed’s hole gets deeper.”

Column:Yarmuth: McConnell has ceded all power to Trump in government shutdown

On Sunday, Buzzfeed’s editor-in-chief Ben Smith and Cormier appeared on CNN to answer questions about their reporting process. Leopold was absent; Smith said he was “out reporting.” In a particularly credibility draining moment, Cormier said “I can’t really get into the details” when asked by host Brian Stelter to explain the contradicting statements between the two reporters.

Oof.

Lost in Friday’s shuffle came new reporting and data from the Pew Research Center that “A majority of Americans believe the news media do not understand people like them…” Huge majorities of Republicans and independents agreed with that statement, while just forty percent of Democrats did. This follows other Pew data showing majorities of Democrats and Republicans believe the news media “favors one side over the other.” A whopping sixty-eight percent of Americans think news organizations “try to cover up their mistakes” instead of just admitting them.

I don’t like it when President Trump calls the media the enemy of the people, and I don’t want a never-ending war between Republicans, independents, and journalists that erodes a fundamental underpinning of our democracy – the need for a free and trusted press. However, episodes like the Buzzfeed debacle hasten this erosion, particularly among non-liberal Americans, who ask with good reason: Why do media mistakes always seem to flow in one direction?

Finally, after all these years, there’s an honest Democrat in Washington, D.C. Two of them, actually, who live up to Cicero’s admonition: “If we are not ashamed to think it, we should not be ashamed to say it.”

Freshmen Congressmen Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York spoiled House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s big week by simply telling the truth about their party’s plans for Trump and taxes. Democratic leaders, desperate to hide what’s inside, grimaced, but the truth of what drives Democrats emerged nonetheless.

The truth has a funny way of doing that.

Let’s start with Ocasio-Cortez, a 29-year old liberal phenom who unceremoniously dumped a member of her party’s old guard in a primary before winning a New York City seat in November. She told the truth about her plans for raising taxes:

See also:2019 political predictions: Donald Trump will be impeached

“You look at our tax rates back in the ’60s, and when you have a progressive tax-rate system … sometimes you see tax rates as high as 60 percent or 70 percent,” she told Anderson Cooper on 60 Minutes Sunday night. Her idea is to massively raise taxes to pay for a “Green New Deal” to completely eliminate the use of fossil fuels in 12 years. Cortez compared her idea to Lincoln’s signing the Emancipation Proclamation.

“Yeah, if that’s what radical means, call me a radical,” Ocasio-Cortez said.

That’s a new deal I can live with – a Democrat who unapologetically tells you how liberal they are and fully acknowledges the fringe nature of their platform. If Democrats want to run a campaign for massive tax increases ahead of 2020’s elections, preach on.

Rep. Tlaib’s moment of honesty came as she rallied a crowd of supporters Thursday night, recounting a conversation she had with her 13-year-old son about her plans for public service.

“When your son looks at you and says, ‘Momma look, you won, bullies don’t win,’ and I said ‘Baby they don’t,’ because we’re going to go in there and we’re gonna impeach the motherf----er,” Tlaib screeched into the microphone, as her enraptured fans lost their minds in applause and euphoria.

Read this:Here's how Kentucky families benefit from McConnell's clout in D.C.

I was probably the lone Republican to support Tlaib’s speech. Not because I think Democrats should impeach the president, but because I support honesty in politics. And when a brave soul like Ms. Tlaib rises to articulate precisely what motivates her base, I say Amen!

Consider the facts: nearly 80 percent of Democrats told exit pollsters following the midterm they wanted impeachment proceedings immediately, and over 6.5 million Democrats have signed a petition to impeach Trump. If you see a Democrat talking telling you that their party isn’t bloodthirsty for impeachment, that this is all some fictional distraction conjured by Republicans, they are straight up lying to you.

Old guard House Democrats like Elijah Cummings immediately distanced themselves from Tlaib’s comments because they know her position is politically damaging. Their feigning distaste for what Tlaib said, though, is one of the biggest cons in American politics: a vast majority of Democrats desperately want to impeach Trump, and yet Democratic party leaders are willing to lie about it.

For her part, Ocasio-Cortez took up for Tlaib. “I got your back @RashidaTlaib - the Bronx and Detroit ride together,” Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. Something tells me there’s already a war room set up in Pelosi’s office to track and respond to these two truth tellers.

The energy on the American left is behind higher taxes and impeachment, and now Speaker Pelosi must decide whether to embrace where her party really wants to go, or risk internal turbulence from her progressive flank. This sets up an interesting dynamic for Democratic leaders who clearly know that following these radical freshmen Democrats into the fever swamps of the American left will be hyper-damaging in the 2020 election.

Exacerbating all of this is the onset of the Democratic presidential primary. I’d wager large sums that a high percentage of people who ventured out to see Elizabeth Warren in Iowa over the weekend have signed that petition for impeachment and would gladly applaud any and all tax increases put in front of them.

If Pelosi was hoping for her partisans to calm down following a record midterm turnout, she’s going to be disappointed. Warren and other presidential aspirants will be drawing big crowds that drive huge media coverage, and they are going to be carrying messages that sound more like Ocasio-Cortez and Tlaib than some establishment party leader in Washington, D.C.

Making predictions in a political universe with Donald Trump at the center is like walking into a casino expecting to emerge with your wallet intact — the house always wins, and you feel dumber for having played.

So here are five shots at not taking my own advice to ring in the New Year!

Democrats will impeach Donald Trump

She knows better, but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will fail at holding back the bloodthirsty partisans in her conference. Exacerbated by a fast-starting presidential primary featuring candidates desperate to please liberal crowds and donors, Pelosi will succumb to the pressure to impeach despite the enormous risk of 2020 backlash. No matter what Robert Mueller’s report says — be it thin gruel or thick evidence — Democrats will find something in it to combine with existing campaign finance matters to pass Articles of Impeachment. Democrats may also append something they find in the myriad investigations they now plot as the incoming House majority.

From Ricky Jones:2019 predictions: Blacks forced to carry ID passes in public

Read this:John Yarmuth questions Mitch McConnell's stance on ending shutdown

Unless there is truly a bombshell in Mueller’s report that links directly to Trump, the Senate will not convict the president. The process of investigations and impeachment will, however, yield something for which Democrats have clamored for years — a public look at the president’s tax returns.

Three lanes will open in the Democratic presidential primary

I expect Beto O’Rourke, the former Texas congressman turned progressive heartthrob, to be leading the Democratic primary by year’s end. He’ll be leading the progressive lane, a younger model that makes obsolete the candidacies of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.

In a middle lane, Joe Biden will ride a message of electability through most of the year, although that argument will eventually falter as polls show several Democrats competitive or ahead of Trump. Uncle Joe will be marginally competitive come Iowa, but I don’t expect the Democrats to nominate a candidate in 2020 who received a delegate for their nomination in 1984(!). The other candidate touting a message of Midwestern competitiveness, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, runs an effective campaign for vice president.

A third lane will open as Democrats remember that they despise white males (especially old white males), and that they just had success with women and minority candidates in 2018. Kristen Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Julian Castro and Amy Klobuchar will fight it out in this bucket, with Harris and Gillibrand emerging as top contenders. Booker, a clown, never catches on. Neither does Castro.

Related:Rand Paul takes aim at Mitt Romney for anti-Trump op-ed

Other candidates will make interesting cameos — South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, for instance — as the primary gets nastier and more extreme. The worse it gets, the more the unthinkable comes into focus for Democrats—Trump has a good chance of being re-elected because of a fractured left.

Trump will achieve a trade deal with China

As market turbulence continues to worry the president and his re-election apparatus, Mr. Trump speeds up his deal-making with China and closes on a new trade arrangement. While they miss the March 2 deadline, a deal by midsummer bolsters the market and settles the nerves of Republican voters (especially seniors) who dislike Trump’s style but appreciate robust 401(k) and 529 accounts.

North Korea will disappoint Trump

Try as he might, President Trump cannot get the North Koreans to focus on denuclearization in 2020. While Trump deserves enormous credit for ratcheting down tensions on the Korean Peninsula, Kim Jong Un lies his way through 2019, even as he achieves a second meeting with the president of the United States. This relationship turns sour by year’s end, as Democrats running for president hammer Trump for being naive. The president, enraged that his efforts have not borne more fruit on the doorstep of a re-election campaign with “peace and prosperity” at its core, punishes Pyongyang with sanctions and hawkish rhetoric. Despite lack of progress, Trump is not faulted by the American people for trying something new to solve a problem that has vexed presidents of both parties.

Trump gets a third Supreme Court Justice

A surprise vacancy on the nation’s highest court gives Trump a third pick. Democrats lose their minds as Republicans —with 53 senators instead of 51 this time around — easily confirm what history will judge as the most conservative of Trump’s three first-term picks.

Read more:Yes, Trump cheats and pays off women, but that won't get him impeached

Elsewhere on the judicial front, Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell churn out a huge number of judicial confirmations in 2019. With a divided Congress unable to produce substantive policy results, Republicans turn the personnel knobs and confirm judge after judge as Chuck Schumer seethes on the sidelines.

Honorable mention predictions

Democrats begin to push for national compulsory voting; Trump gets a fourth Supreme Court justice; a major tech executive is indicted for lying to Congress; Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton both (reluctantly) resist the urge to run for president; President Trump ends the year with a different chief of staff than he has today.

It is impossible to be a columnist in the Trump era.

I’ll give you a window into my schedule: I write for this space on Sunday, make final edits and submit on Monday, watch it go up online Tuesday, and then see it in print Wednesday. A day or two after that it sometimes populates in USA TODAY Network newspapers around the country.

From the time I hit send on the email, I wonder: How many monumental political events will we live through? And how many of them will render my column obsolete?

So I try to write things that will stand up for at least a few days. This past week brought us the president’s decision to pull out of Syria, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis’ resignation, a stock market free fall, and a partial government shutdown. It brought us a farm bill and criminal justice reform, along with a host of other radar blips that would have been bigger deals in any other presidency.

Read this:Yes, Trump cheats and pays off women, but that won't get him impeached

As usual, the avalanche of events — all with Trump at the center — created hysteria in Washington. But did they matter in middle America, where the nonnews junkies spent last week making final holiday preparations and trying to sit as far away from Uncle Roger as possible at Christmas dinner?

The quantity of Trump-era events is preventing analysts from determining the quality of any of them. And by quality, I mean — will they really matter in a few days? How about in November 2020? Every pundit’s New Year’s resolution should be to do a better job of looking at breaking news alerts through a longer-term prism. This is a good week to start.



Contrary to the amount of coverage it will get, the government shutdown won’t matter much during next year’s presidential election. At best, it will become a bullet point on page nine of some Democratic National Committee talking points document. Besides, some people sent Trump to Washington to break glass. Shutdowns aren’t the end of the world.



Mattis’ resignation is a big deal because he’s respected around the world, one of the most qualified people to ever hold the job and can be trusted to act with honor. However, it was the correct decision to resign if Mattis felt he could not execute the commander-in-chief’s policy priorities. Many Americans can’t name a single cabinet member, and this departure will fade from memory if Trump nominates someone qualified, capable and confirmable to replace a bona fide American hero. Every president is entitled to cabinet officers willing to carry out the White House’s agenda.

See also:How can Trump be re-elected president? By talking about the economy

The jury is still out on the president’s decision to pull troops from Syria, which, among other disagreements, caused Mattis to step down. On the one hand, Trump is executing just as you’d expect an isolationist would, based on views stated during his campaign (views, by the way, that remain attractive to some Democrats). On the other hand, Trump is giving ISIS and Iran breathing room while abandoning pro-American Kurds who will probably be slaughtered by Turkey, Syria or ISIS, whichever gets to them first.

Trump’s decision will cost him allies, and therefore hurts his credibility at home and abroad. Israel is none too pleased, as removal of the American deterrent in Syria allows Iran to more easily supply Hezbollah. At home, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, a staunch ally of the president, is hopping mad about Trump’s abandoning Syria and Afghanistan, where terrorists plot to attack America. Trump needs Israel to make his Middle East peace plan fly, and he needs Graham and other GOP senators to stand by him as investigators launch broadsides in the new year.

Perhaps the most dangerous political development of the week was the stock market’s continued free fall, erasing nearly all gains for 2018 and panicking suburban, middle class voters who are watching their 401k’s and 529’s drop precipitously. These voters went with Trump in 2016, abandoned ship in 2018, and must be talked back into the boat in 2020. A healthy stock market and economy are ring buoys for college educated, center-right voters who don’t love Trump’s style but will tolerate it if they feel their futures are secure. Take that away and it will be hard to recover them.

Related:Trump could get the last laugh in the 2020 presidential election

A consequential week has concluded, and a new year begins. Let us all pray for the wisdom to calm down and think critically as we assess the deluge to come. And if space aliens land on Earth by the time you read this, I’m sure something more important will happen between then and when I next file.



Merry Christmas, and Happy New Year!

The sentencing memo filed last week by federal prosecutors against Michael Cohen, who for many years served as Donald Trump’s fixer, had Democrats and media types aflutter — would Trump soon be indicted for breaking campaign finance laws? Would Democrats impeach the president over this?

Prosecutors had previously forced Cohen to admit to making secret hush money payments to two women “in coordination with and at the direction of” Trump. The allegation is that Cohen and Trump ran afoul of campaign finance laws by breaking contribution limits and causing a corporation to make an illegal contribution to conceal a federal candidate’s extramarital affairs from voters.

Incoming House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler said on CNN that if Trump is proven to have directed the payments, it would constitute “impeachable offenses.” Soon-to-be House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said on CBS that Trump will ""face the real prospect of jail time.” Leading Democrats want to impeach and jail their chief political antagonist, and yet it's Republicans who are constantly accused of running a banana republic. But I digress.

Read this:How Donald Trump's explanation of his role with Michael Cohen and the hush money payments has changed

The amount in play here is minuscule. One woman received $130,000 and the other $150,000, or about 0.07 percent of all the money Trump spent to win ($398 million). By comparison, Trump’s campaign spent at least $3.2 million on “Make America Great Again” hats.

There are two ways to handle campaign finance issues — via criminal indictment, a la the Cohen/Trump case, or by administrative fine. The latter is what you get at the Federal Election Commission, where the supposed line dividing the two paths is whether a campaign knowingly crossed lines or just made paperwork mistakes.

Case in point: the FEC hit Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign with “one of the largest penalties in the agency’s history” when it levied a $375,000 fine for failing “to disclose the identities of donors responsible for $2 million in contributions” and misreporting “the dates of $85 million in other contributions.” The Obama people “kept $1.3 million in contributions that were above the legal maximum allowed for a federal campaign, failing to return them within the 60 days required by law. The campaign kept almost $874,000 of those donations until the FEC discovered they were unlawful,” according to The Washington Post.

Doing a quick bit of math here, the Obama campaign made mistakes with about $87.3 million, or about 311 times the amount Trump and Cohen were dealing with. Obama supporters say these were paperwork mistakes (oh, to have paperwork this lucrative!) while Trump’s antagonists argue his alleged sins are far more sinister.

But let’s accept for a moment that some people want to literally jail a presidential candidate for spending $280,000 to hide decade-old sex. The prosecutors’ theory — that Cohen and Trump made the payments to influence the outcome of an election — could easily be defeated by Trump in court.

You may like:Max Boot, Scott Jennings go after each other on Don Lemon CNN panel

First, the idea that Trump was trying to conceal from the world that he cheats on his wives is laughable; his infidelity is part and parcel to the “playboy businessman” image Trump carefully cultivated for decades! Do prosecutors honestly believe that one single voter was unaware of Trump’s promiscuity?

They would have to explain to a jury that if voters could have heard from just two more women about their sex with Trump, the outcome of the election would have been different. For goodness sake, Trump once engineered a cover story in The New York Post headlined “The Best Sex I Ever Had,” purportedly words spoken by Marla Maples!

Second, it is highly likely that Trump has been paying women he’s slept with (and other people for other reasons) for years as part of non-disclosure agreements. His lawyers will argue that the payments are routine business expenses for a man who has a lot of sex and pays for a lot of silence, whether he’s running for office or not.

Finally, what do you want to bet Trump’s actual motivation for making the payments had more to do with keeping Melania Trump from finding out more than any voter? Trump surely has a prenuptial agreement that gets much worse for him if he’s unfaithful. Plus, Trump admitted after the election he thought he was going to lose, which caused him to rent a smaller ballroom for his election night party. Trump’s lawyers will argue that their client thought his candidacy to be a lost cause, but not his marriage.

Which brings me back to Congressman Nadler. If you want to impeach the president, go for it. But don’t insult the Constitution’s demand for high crimes and misdemeanors with this campaign finance flimflam.

President Donald Trump’s statement siding with Saudi Arabia on the issue of murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi sent shockwaves through American media and Washington, D.C., raising questions about America’s commitment to holding accountable regimes that commit human-rights atrocities.

The president’s statement — which he personally dictated, according to news accounts — was perhaps the best window yet into Mr. Trump’s transactional worldview. A businessman, who promised to operate government like a business, used business deals to justify his position. On this, there should be no shock. To be sure, many Americans voted for precisely this kind of thinking in which economic realism trumps abstract idealism.

But a different communications route was available to the president that would have preserved his desire to stand with the House of Saud and its Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman while acknowledging the broader geopolitical equities in the region.

Related:Rand Paul rips Donald Trump over refusal to punish Saudi Arabia

Speaking in a public conversation with this columnist at the University of Louisville’s McConnell Center on Nov. 16, I asked Israeli Ambassador to the United States Ron Dermer how his government could trust the Saudi regime following its blatant, ham-handed lying about Khashoggi’s killing. Dermer made three points that President Trump should have borrowed to justify our government’s position.

First, Mr. Dermer said that the United States must communicate that actions like this “cannot happen with impunity.” The president’s statement fell short of such condemnation, as Mr. Trump again cast doubt on his own government’s intelligence community in its assessment that the crown prince “personally ordered” Khashoggi’s murder. While there is probably not enough time in the lame-duck session of Congress for a free-standing sanctions bill, the legislative branch can pick up the ball in January and send a clear, bipartisan message (the way it has done on Russian sanctions) that murdering journalists won’t be tolerated by the American people.

Second, Mr. Dermer said the United States “must be careful” not to “undermine” its relationship with Saudi Arabia over this incident, as horrific as it was. Dermer said that could lead to a destabilization of the Middle East, which has implications for ongoing efforts to contain the evil regime in Iran. There are behind-the-scenes conversations among American, Saudi and Israeli officials about the forthcoming peace plan from Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and how the three allies will work together to combat Iran’s influence and bring peace to the Middle East.

More:Trump tweets on a ‘mean & nasty world,’ unsafe judges, and, yes, Thanksgiving

Finally, Mr. Dermer said he still believes Crown Prince Mohammed can be a force for modernizing Saudi Arabia and praised his statements on Iran, in which he likened Iran’s supreme leader to Hitler.

Ambassador Dermer’s three-part statement is a reasonable position for the American government: human-rights atrocities won’t be tolerated, but we must accept the world as it is and do everything possible to circumvent the Iranian regime and bring peace to the Middle East. Handling Saudi Arabia this way would have helped Mr. Trump avoid the appearance of placing a price tag on Mr. Khashoggi’s life and would not have signaled to the world’s dictators that America will look the other way if you buy enough airplanes or pump enough oil.

The disappointment felt by American journalists over Mr. Trump’s words exceeds that of the average American, to whom Mr. Khashoggi was not a household name. And the outrage exhibited by the American left rings hollow when you consider its deafening silence as President Barack Obama dithered while Syrian dictator Bashar Assad murdered thousands of women and children with chemical weapons.

Those who are outraged today over the killing of one man — and it is outrage-worthy — should ask themselves if they felt that same emotion when Obama failed to enforce his Syrian red line. And if they did not, perhaps they should admit their anger with Mr. Trump is driven as much by their hatred for him generally as their views on America’s moral leadership.

While it is not typically advisable to put all your eggs in one basket, Mr. Trump has done just that with the Saudis as he works to contain Iran and make deals that benefit American workers and consumers. The trouble with the Middle East is that there aren’t too many baskets in which to put eggs, and the president has chosen the most willing partner — imperfect as the Saudis are — to help America achieve its larger objectives.

Let us pray the Saudis don’t let the president down, and that turning a blind eye to Mr. Khashoggi’s murder is ultimately worth the price.

The Courier-Journal Opinion

I wrote before the midterm that President Donald Trump has a better than 50 percent chance of being re-elected in 2020. Since the results of the 2018 election rolled in, several people have asked if I feel the same way given the Democratic gains in the suburbs and upper Midwest.

I continue to favor the president for re-election, but Trump must do what he clearly hates: Embrace the boring.

At a pre-election rally, Trump told West Virginians: ""They all say, 'Speak about the economy, speak about the economy.' … Well, we have the greatest economy in the history of our country. But sometimes it's not as exciting to talk about the economy.""

This was an unfortunate tactical mistake by the president, sending a message that he has other things on his mind than the personal financial well-being of millions of voters who came around to him before but have been bothered by his behavior in key moments, i.e. Charlottesville, Virginia.

The economy is not boring

The economy is decidedly not boring. In fact, it is rather exciting to think of a dynamic marketplace with more job openings than people looking for jobs. And many people in the suburbs — I speak from experience — moved out there because they find comfort in stability and routine. We wake up every day, drop our kids at school, go to work, rinse and repeat. We get crazy on the weekends by watching ""Mickey Mouse Clubhouse"" and The Weather Channel.

This is the American dream for many who supported Trump in 2016 and must be persuaded to do so again.

What Trump really finds boring is staying on message. He wants original programming every day instead of a repeating script about low unemployment, solid wage growth, strong gross domestic product, etc. How many presidents would kill for Trump's boredom? The only hiccup in his economic message was a volatile October stock market.

But this story is decidedly not tedious for the people who left the Republican Party and voted Democrat in the midterms. Suburban voters fled for bluer pastures, partly because the president prioritized something other than the economy as his closing argument. Slightly right-of-center voters will put up with bushels of drama if they believe the president is looking out for their jobs. But when Trump became distracted by a migrant caravan 2,000 or 3,000 miles away from Milwaukee, they wondered: ""Why am I tolerating this, again?""

The same is true for the blue-collar workers in the upper Midwest, where Democrats won Senate and gubernatorial races in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania (Ohio was a stubborn holdout for the Democrats, where the GOP held the governor’s mansion). A core reason Trump won those states in 2016 was a belief among the residents there that the political elite — embodied by Hillary Clinton's candidacy — had forgotten them. As they saw it, Clinton and the elites had lost touch with what it meant to build an economy that works for people in non-urban areas, too.

Trump needs yoga moms

The president — perhaps thirsting for a drink from the well that delivered him the GOP nomination — thought he needed to reinforce similar immigration messages to again galvanize his party. But Republicans of all stripes were already ginned up thanks to the fight over Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. To close the deal in the suburbs and Midwest, Trump needed to relentlessly sell the good economy that he and the Republicans have created, creating a personal connection for wavering voters. Trump needs yoga moms and their husbands to connect his policies to their swelling 401(k) retirement plans and 529 college plans as a salve to the more cringe-worthy moments of this presidency.

""Democrats produce mobs, Republicans produce jobs,"" the president said a few times in October, a perfect six-word slogan capturing the unhinged nature of the American left and the GOP-led economic revival. Fleeting as it was, this motto could have been embraced by any Republican anywhere. ""Sure,"" voters might have thought, ""I don't like Trump drama but my job is solid and these Democrats are ruining people's dinners, for goodness' sake.""

Fortunately for Trump, the 2020 Democratic primary is likely to produce a nominee more representative of the liberal mob than of suburban America. And when they make this mistake, Trump must spring the political trap of reminding suburban voters that while Democrats would rather swing from the Supreme Court's chandeliers, he is looking out for the jobs and futures of real people in real America.

Enjoy your victories, Mr. Trump. Learn the phrase ""peace and prosperity"" and say it often. A campaign like that may feel boring, but taking the oath of office a second time will more than make up for it.

But now I realize — we aren't reliving the 90s, but rather a rerun of Barack Obama's presidency.

The president is polarizing, but not historically unpopular. President Donald Trump's approval in the latest NBC News/Wall St. Journal poll (47 percent) was higher than Obama’s just before the 2010 midterm. In fact, Trump is in better shape than seven of the last 17 presidents at his first midterm, according to Aaron Blake of The Washington Post.

The mindless conspiracy theorists on the right hollering about Obama's origins and religious preferences have been replaced by the ridiculous outrage mobs of the left. There were Republicans who believed Obama was going to be removed from office over his birth certificate, just as there are Democrats who believe in their hearts that Robert Mueller will kick open the Oval Office door and frog march Trump from the White House in handcuffs.

It was weak-minded bologna then and now, fomented by people who can’t handle losing and who are frighteningly more interested in conspiracy theories than the outcomes produced by our democratic processes.

While Republicans may lose their House majority in the upcoming midterm (just as Obama’s Democrats did in 2010), the GOP seems on track to hold the Senate, leaving in place an electoral map like the one that propelled Trump to the presidency. Flyover country remains happy with Trump, while urban areas and the coasts are not.

Democrats keep failing by acting crazy

No matter the size of any new Democratic House majority, the conference will contain several new members who reflect the angry liberal mob, which seems to make up the Democratic Party's core. Nearly 80 percent of Democrats told CNN’s pollsters in September that Trump should be impeached, and more than six million people have signed a petition demanding it.

If presumptive House Speaker Nancy Pelosi travels that road (something her base will demand), it will be another log on a political overreach fire the Democrats stoke daily. Time and again, Democrats are handed issues with which they could truly damage Trump but fail by acting crazy. To middle America, Democrats seem like Chris Farley’s Tommy Boy trying to sell brake pads to alarmed auto parts store owners.

Tommy, of course, eventually pulled himself together and saved the family business. I am not sure the Democrats will, and their madness inures to Trump’s benefit.

I well remember how hard it was to beat an incumbent president in 2012. For four years, the Obama White House built a data and fundraising juggernaut while Mitt Romney, who struggled to put several opponents away in a GOP primary, was ""building a fighter jet while simultaneously taking off from an aircraft carrier,"" as the campaign's political director once told me.

The same thing is happening again. As Democrats brace for a battle royal, The Washington Post reports that Trump’s 2020 re-election campaign has ""raised at least $106 million"" and seems to be mastering the small-dollar donor game. Sound familiar?

Democrats are destined for a crowded and brutal affair, chock-full of arguments about ideological purity and self-defeating identity politics. In 2020, being white and/or male will be to the Democratic primary what being Mormon or ""establishment"" was to the Republicans in 2012.

What's an old white male like Biden to do?

Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation fight exposed the deep loathing liberal activists have for the ""old white men"" in our politics, which explains why Elizabeth Warren is fighting so hard to keep up the ""woman of color"" bit despite quite possibly being less Native American than the average American of European ancestry. What's an old white male like Joe Biden, ostensibly the party's front-runner, to do? He’ll make the same argument that Romney made — electability — at a time when his party is ""nominating a historic number of women and people of color for office,"" according to Time Magazine.

The Democratic primary will be messier than a toddler’s toy room before nap time, replete with the same meltdowns and drama, too. Can Biden's claims of Midwestern competitiveness trump the desire of liberal activists for youth and diversity?

At a dinner earlier this year among some experienced political hands, I posited, because of the internal struggles looming for the Democrats, that Trump had better than a 50 percent chance of being re-elected. The table erupted in laughter. My guffawing dinner companions might be right — a recession could hit, or, less likely, special counsel Robert Mueller could drop a bombshell. Either could sink the incumbent president.

But many Republicans couldn't fathom Obama being re-elected in 2012, either. And it's starting to feel like a rerun in which Trump gets the last laugh.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell might have Justice Brett Kavanaugh to thank for more pleasant meals.

On Friday, lunching with the Senate majority leader in Louisville, I watched several fried fish enthusiasts approach McConnell to gush over his leadership on Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court confirmation. Hearty handshakes and picture requests were as plentiful as the tartar sauce. One couple wanted McConnell to pose with their baby. Men and women, young and old — the demographic distribution was wide.

Not long ago McConnell was hounded as he ate in Louisville, with the angry liberal mob ruining his meals. But things are different now, even as both parties rush to claim political victory over the contentious Supreme Court battle.

Famed Democratic strategist James Carville said on CNN that Kavanaugh ""is worth a lot more alive than dead,"" arguing that ""in terms of political optimization, I think today's result is probably as good as you could hope for."" Democrats say the political reckoning will come among women, as they point to a large gender gap in national surveys.

But I saw with my own eyes what Republican strategists see in battleground Senate polling: post-Kavanaugh, Republicans are finally ""galvanized."" Said one retired school teacher to the Courier Journal attending President Donald Trump’s weekend rally in Richmond, Kentucky: ""A lot of Republicans had slacked off — (Kavanaugh) brought them back. It certainly energized me.""

Dems will likely lose in Tenn., Nev., Ariz. and Texas

Democrats once thought their blue wave might crash onshore in reliably red Texas and Tennessee, but polling shows Beto O’Rourke and Phil Bredesen stranded like rowboats on a sandbar. It’s a wonder that anyone in the Lonestar State can get a good night’s sleep given the loud and perpetual flushing sound of starstruck liberal donors depositing $61 million in a Texas-sized toilet in their vain attempt to topple Ted Cruz. Democrats, always looking for a messiah, chose poorly in Beto, a skateboarding goofball who once fled a DUI crash scene.

As for Bredesen, his volunteers and independent benefactors are quitting left and right since he announced that he would have supported Kavanaugh. Ah, the plight of a supposed moderate Democrat trying to simultaneously please a conservative electorate and his party’s liberal base. As the Good Book tells us, it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for Bredesen to get back in the good graces of the angry mob. Republicans expect Marsha Blackburn to shake off Bredesen, leaving Taylor Swift, who endorsed the Democrat just before the bottom fell out, to cry teardrops on her guitar.

More:Trump and Republicans have put America in crisis. 'Mob' and 'socialism' won't erase that.

In North Dakota, incumbent Democrat Heidi Heitkamp, a liberal posing as a moderate in a state that voted for Trump by 36 points, is watching Republican Kevin Cramer pull away. The jig is up for Heitkamp after voting against Trump’s tax cut and siding with the angry mob on Kavanaugh. And the same may be true for Democratic incumbents in Missouri and Montana, where rural conservatives are hopping mad about Senate Democrats’ hysterical overreaching and blockade against all things Trump.

Democrats are also scrambling in Nevada and Arizona, must-win states if they hope to gain control. Nevada is the only tilt featuring a Republican incumbent defending a seat in Hillary Clinton territory, but resilient Dean Heller has a slight lead following his vote for Kavanaugh. The Arizona race is a dead heat, but old soundbites of Democrat Kyrsten Sinema saying she wanted to work with “anarchists, socialists, communists” and “didn’t care” if Americans joined the Taliban have her on defense with three weeks to go. Sinema may go down as the Christine ""I am not a witch"" O'Donnell of this cycle.

McConnell will likely keep control

There’s a decent chance that McConnell will have an even larger majority when the midterm dust settles. With a conference of 51, he’s beholden to two moderates — Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. With 52 votes or more, however, McConnell can lose them both and watch Vice President Mike Pence break ties when necessary. If another Supreme Court vacancy occurs during Trump’s first term, Republicans would have the flexibility to nominate the most conservative, pro-life choice they can find. If you think the mob is angry now…just wait.

While the Senate races look good for Republicans, their fortunes in the House remain bleak. The most likely outcome is that Democrats win a majority thanks largely to GOP retirements and much more favorable political geography, although a wide range of outcomes remain possible. It appears, for now, that the Senate is from Mars and the House is from Venus. But then again, three weeks is an eternity in politics.

Guest Columnist

On the Senate floor, where no one can interrupt you and commercial breaks aren’t a thing, Sen. Susan Collins stood alone. And she stood tall.

The Maine Republican’s floor speech announcing her vote for Brett Kavanaugh systematically dismantled every Democratic attack on the new Supreme Court justice and made a convincing case in favor of President Donald Trump’s highly qualified nominee.

Collins capped a team effort by the Republican Party to confirm Kavanaugh, one that united all wings, branches, genres and flavors of Republicans. There’s no better litmus test than this confirmation to figure out who remains a Republican and who doesn’t.

If you see a commentator claiming to be a “Republican” or “conservative” strategist supporting the liberal mob on this one, understand that they don’t represent conservatives or the Republican Party any longer. More than any other issue in the Trump era, Kavanaugh will be remembered as the “whose side are you on?” moment.

Interestingly, it was the so-called moderate or establishment wing of the GOP that manned the front lines. Collins, oft derided as a RINO (Republican In Name Only) by the conservative inquisitors at your local Tea Party meeting, delivered the felling stroke against the furious Democratic campaign.

Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a favorite conservative target for being pro-immigration reform, rallied the party faithful in his rousing committee speech (Democrat Cory Booker of New Jersey claimed a Spartacus moment, or close to it, but Graham actually pulled it off).

Chuck Grassley, whom some conservatives wanted to dethrone as Judiciary Committee chairman in 2016, managed the process beautifully despite the unprecedented circus thrust upon his committee by Democrats Dianne Feinstein, Booker, Kamala Harris and Mazie Hirono.

More:Brett Kavanaugh show will help Republicans in November

Even former President George W. Bush offered an assist, lobbing in calls to Collins and other Senate Republicans to reassure them about Kavanaugh. Truly, the entire band was back together.

And then there’s “Cocaine Mitch” McConnell, so dubbed by a losing Senate candidate McConnell opposed in West Virginia. The nickname has stuck and “Cocaine Mitch” memes are ubiquitous across conservative social media.

McConnell’s steely leadership in a Senate that stands on a razor’s edge has erased any possibility that a Republican could ever again credibly challenge his conservative bona fides. McConnell has simultaneously fought the dumbest elements of the Tea Party and the Democratic Party for going on eight years; at this moment, he has bested them both.

Last November, President Trump’s dethroned strategist Steve Bannon told The New York Times, “I have an objective that Mitch McConnell will not be majority leader, and I believe will be done before this time next year.”

Eleven months later, McConnell stands triumphantly atop a pile of Trump victories, while Bannon lives in exile and the #MAGA crowd genuflects in front of its president’s cleverest executioner. A Trumpworld operative who tried to destroy McConnell admitted to Axios that the Senate majority leader is “a straight-up gangster.”

It would be an interesting result of this Kavanaugh business if the Republican Party decided to stop tearing itself apart, with the #MAGA crowd and the #NeverTrumpers ripping each other over style and tactics. Trump himself has a solid approval rating among the party faithful, and the Kavanaugh battle shows what conservatives can accomplish when they put their energy into fighting the liberal mob instead of into purging each other.

Even though the mob was beaten back this time, it will return more rageful and bloodthirsty than ever. Democrats revealed a scary vision for the future wherein the presumption of innocence means nothing and judgments will be rendered “in the context” of a person’s politics, as Hirono put it to Jake Tapper on CNN.

Liberal thought leader Markos Moulitsas issued an impeachment threat on Friday: “We're not done with Kavanaugh, not by a long-shot. Like Trump, he'll rue the day he gave up his sweet, safe gig, and let greed for power take him down.” Democrats will make Trump and Kavanaugh an impeachment double feature should they win the House.

Michael Avenatti, whom I believe is the 2020 Democratic front-runner for president, is making his court-packing plan (adding two seats to the Supreme Court to dilute the influence of Trump’s picks) a litmus test position for his party’s presidential primary.

In other words, Democrats may plunge the nation into any number of constitutional crises to satisfy a liberal base that has never accepted that elections have consequences. Their Trump-era overreaches have been muted because they are the minority party in Congress. Put them in charge, however, and there’s nothing stopping liberal Democrats from using their power to destroy any American that stands between them and their political goals.

Winston Churchill once said, “Nothing in life is so exhilarating as to be shot at without result.” The narrowly won 50-48 Kavanaugh fight has injected energy and camaraderie into a GOP suffering from complacency and internal discord. Rejuvenated conservatives have been reminded about what’s at stake, and to what depraved depths the liberal mob will sink to win.

Rejuvenated conservatives have been reminded about what’s at stake, and to what depraved depths the liberal mob will sink to win.

Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation has brought to the fore some truly dangerous arguments.

Democrat Maria Cardona, a friend and frequent TV sparring partner of mine, exclaimed on CNN: “This isn’t a moment for due process!” She followed the thinking of Benjamin Wittes, editor-in-chief of Lawfare, who wrote: “…even if [Kavanaugh] truly believes himself innocent, even if he is innocent — the better part of valor is to get out now.”

I cannot imagine a more dangerous sentiment than this, in which an American citizen is commanded to publicly admit guilt when he has sworn under oath he is innocent. To cross that Rubicon would put us on a mindlessly anarchical path in which the presumption of innocence is jettisoned to satisfy the political passions of an angry mob.

That is not to say that Dr. Christine Blasey Ford was not compelling, nor does it diminish the pain of sexual assault survivors. But, for lack of a better term, we must find a way to walk and chew gum at the same time, respecting victims while holding fast to the concepts of law and justice that set America apart from the world. And we should not be forced to believe the two are mutually exclusive.

A confirmation hearing is not a court of law, as Kavanaugh’s detractors remind us constantly. But neither is it a job interview. This confirmation is simultaneously an exploration of the character of a human being and of the larger issues that define the character of American justice. To call this a job interview in a world where people change jobs as often as they change the oil in their car diminishes the seriousness of the debate.

Already, there are calls on the left for Kavanaugh’s impeachment, whether he is confirmed or not. Democrats, who demanded the FBI look further into Kavanaugh, were predictably trashing the investigation a day after Republicans gave in. We are dangerously close to a moment in which a significant number of Americans simply stop accepting outcomes produced by our democratic processes.

When you couple that with the idea that a citizen who believes himself to be innocent must submit to the passions of an angry mob, supposedly for the good of a movement, anarchy is not far behind.

More from Jennings:Unhinged liberals or GOP progress? Midterm message is clear

Defending the British soldiers accused of murder after the Boston Massacre, John Adams opened with an impassioned plea for the presumption of innocence:

“But when innocence itself, is brought to the bar and condemned, especially to die, the subject will exclaim, it is immaterial to me, whether I behave well or ill; for virtue itself, is no security. And if such a sentiment as this, should take place in the mind of the subject, there would be an end to all security what so ever.”

Why should anyone follow any laws if there is no guarantee that being innocent is an acceptable defense when you stand accused of breaking them? Kavanaugh, it seems, is to be damned if he did, and damned if he did not.

Many Americans — women included — are fearful of where this thinking takes us. An old friend texted me, “As a mother of a son … that a false accusation against an otherwise seemingly good person can ruin his life … scares the crap out of me. While I wouldn’t say that all over Facebook … there has to be some number of women who identify more as mothers in fear for their sons than as feminist women. If I feel this way — a lifelong Republican who didn’t vote for Trump — I have to think a lot of other people silently feel this way, too.”

She fears a government too weak to protect her son from a false or unproven accusation, and a mob that would punish her for speaking this notion freely. Angry mobs cannot rule America. Voting to confirm Kavanaugh is not an endorsement of sexual assault, as some argue, any more than John Adams was endorsing British oppression in his defense of the Redcoats.

It takes courage for victims to come forward. It also takes courage to stand athwart an angry mob, especially one armed with the supportive megaphone of our largest media outlets. But there is no virtue in tearing down American traditions of law and justice for the political aim of preserving Roe v. Wade, which is, if you listen carefully, what this fight is truly about. The mob should try winning an election to achieve its political objectives.

Kavanaugh deserves the benefit of the doubt until actual evidence emerges that he is guilty of anything, and he should be confirmed posthaste.

If they will lie about the curtains, why should I believe them on the anonymous op-ed?

That was the first thought I had last week when The New York Times published a “news” story on the curtains hanging in the residence of the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.

“Nikki Haley’s View of New York is Priceless. Her Curtains? $52,701,” the original headline blared. The story, which featured a huge picture of Trump’s UN ambassador, gave readers the impression that Haley herself had misspent taxpayer money on extravagant drapes.

Buried in the story was an important paragraph indicating the curtains were purchased in 2016, during the Obama administration. Haley, back then, was still governor of South Carolina.

It was the sort of clickbait rocket fuel on which liberal social media runs. Ready to believe anything negative about the Trump administration, his most ardent opponents, who sustain themselves on daily outrage, sent the story soaring for hours.

Read this:McConnell slams Democrats for '11th hour' leak of Kavanaugh allegation

Conservatives instantly recognized the egregious cheap shot and began tweeting about it, along with some journalists from other outlets. The New York Times, several hours later, was forced to walk back the story and change the headline:

“The article should not have focused on Ms. Haley, nor should a picture of her have been used. The article and headline have now been edited to reflect those concerns, and the picture has been removed.”

That’s a long walk. And it made me wonder how something so erroneous could have cleared a supposedly unbiased journalist and presumably a couple of layers of supposedly unbiased editors. The mistake was instantly recognizable and did a tremendous disservice to the other journalists working at The New York Times who now must live with reporter Gardiner Harris’ mistake.

Which brings me back to the anonymous op-ed published by the Times several days ago, purportedly from a “senior” Trump administration official who slammed the president and claimed to be part of a resistance inside the administration subverting Trump’s agenda.

See also:Unhinged liberals or GOP progress? Republicans' midterm message is clear

If we can’t trust the nation’s newspaper of record on something trivial like curtains, why should we trust them on the anonymously written opinion piece? How “senior” is this person, exactly? When the op-ed first ran I thought that there is no possible way the Times would print something like this unless the author were truly in close proximity to the Oval Office. But now … color me skeptical.

The New York Times has long been a piñata for conservative politicians who hold it up as the gold standard of liberal bias. Voices like mine on the right plead for understanding— there are two sides of the house! The news side and the opinion side are separate! Don’t get them mixed up! I recognize that my cries fall on doubting conservative ears, but I persist because democracy demands a credible, trusted free press.

But now, in the wake of the curtains fiasco, my confidence is shaken. Judgment is the issue. Since none was exercised on the journalism side of the house, why should we assume it is any better on the opinion side?

It pains me to write this. As a former journalist-turned-conservative operative and commentator, I’m constantly pleading with fellow Republicans to give the media a chance to regain the trust it has lost over the last several years. Most journalists are honest, hardworking souls earnestly trying to deliver information that informs our citizenry.

You may like:The tyranny of mistrust divides our country, but it can be defeated

But then this curtains story comes along and I realize we still have a long way to go. Last week was a tremendous setback for those who long for reconciliation and understanding between conservatives and the American media establishment.

The Times journalist exhibited terrible judgment, but he is not fully to blame. There is clearly a bubble culture in which no one who reviewed the story during its journey from notepad to publication looks at the world through conservative eyes. I agree with former George W. Bush White House Press Secretary Ari Fleisher, who tweeted: “Newsrooms would benefit if they thought more like America.”

If media people want conservatives to trust them, whether on their journalism process or on unusual items like the publication of the anonymous op-ed, they must commit to more ideologically diverse eyeballs in their buildings. I don’t begrudge any media person for holding personal political views, but bad products invariably emerge when a single point of view exists unquestioned. The New York Times should consider hiring a conservative ombudsman to offer perspective on pieces like the curtains story.

Rebuilding trust among Americans and their news media is vital. We are at rock bottom, with nowhere to go but up.

In 2016, Americans, tired of the gridlock produced by divided government, unified control of the Congress and executive branch under the Republican Party.

Their demand was simple: produce results and move this country forward. Now, with the midterm elections looming, Senate Republicans are preparing a September closing argument that they have delivered on the demand for progress.

If the Republican leadership plan holds, several big-ticket items and presidential nominees will clear the Senate before the end of the month, serving as a powerful message to voters that government is functioning well despite the chaos narrative being spun by the left.

Democrats haven’t laid a glove on Brett Kavanaugh since President Donald Trump announced him and they have wasted millions of liberal donor dollars in their fruitless campaign. Confirmation hearings are underway, and unless something pops up we don’t know about, Kavanaugh, as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell promised, will sit on the Supreme Court when it reconvenes in October.

Kavanaugh’s ascendancy serves as a capstone to what has been Trump’s most successful operation: remaking the federal judiciary. Conservatives are snickering at the beating Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer is taking from liberal activists for cutting a deal with McConnell last week to clear 15 of Trump’s lower court judges. McConnell’s decision to cancel the August recess paid off in spades for the president’s agenda.

Republicans must finish this vital legislation before Sept. 30, or farm policy reverts to a bill passed in 1949. A version passed both chambers and a conference committee was appointed to work out the differences.

The principal sticking point is whether to impose strict work requirements to the food stamp program. Trump supports the requirements included in the House version, but a test vote on the issue garnered just 30 votes in the Senate earlier this year. This won’t pass the upper chamber and Republicans would be unwise to derail their closing argument over this fight.

With several big rural states holding Senate races this fall, Republicans should pass the farm bill now and deal with the work requirements later. As one Senate Republican told me, there are four key reasons for Trump to sign the farm bill before the midterm: Missouri, Indiana, Montana and North Dakota. Farmers were a big part of the president’s winning coalition in 2016; it would be unwise to abandon them on the farm bill so close to the next election.

More:Republicans can, must keep control in midterms

More:Can Nancy Pelosi still lead the Democrats?

The opioid addiction epidemic continues to destroy families and communities across the nation, and Congress appears poised to pass a package of bills designed to enhance treatment options and help get people back to work.

Senate Republicans have signed off on the legislation and are waiting for Democrats to do the same. Passage of this bill would send a powerful signal of responsiveness by the Republican Party to a problem that is having micro and macro negative impacts on the U.S.

This is not a done deal, but GOP leaders are hoping to pass several appropriations bills accounting for nearly 90 percent of the money needed to fund the federal government. This kind of progress hasn’t happened for a long time and would avoid a huge omnibus at the end of the year, which the president hates (and voters don’t like, either). The possible sticking point is whether the president will hold up the deal over funding for his border wall, but some reports indicate he understands the political risk of shutting down the government so close to an election.

Only 20 of the past 100 years have featured full Republican control of the federal government, and the GOP is preparing a powerful closing argument of functionality and good policy to voters who are evaluating whether to give them another two years.

By moving so broadly in September, Senate Republicans are sending a message that they are more interested in results than political point scoring, which matches the mood of most voters. Combine that with 4 percent unemployment and a robust job market, and voters may disregard the chaos narrative peddled by Democratic candidates. This is no time to fight over the wall or food stamp work requirements, as Trump and Senate Republicans need to create a narrative of smooth running government before Congress leaves town to campaign.

The fall Republican message is clear — conservative results versus unhinged liberal rhetoric. Let’s see if the party can deliver and make it stick.

John Brennan does not need a security clearance to crap on the president of the United States.

President Donald Trump, after weeks of consideration and encouragement from U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, finally pulled the plug on the former CIA director’s clearance last week, knocking Omarosa Manigault-Newman out of the news and provoking another predictable media meltdown.

Former intelligence officials ostensibly maintain their clearances should the current administration need to consult with them about ongoing national security matters. This is usually a good idea, but of course most of them don’t leave office and become vitriolic, hyper-partisan leaders of the #TheResistance.

I doubt Brennan was consulted very often by Trump’s people. How could they get him on the phone when he spends most of his time in front of television cameras or formulating tweets, calling Donald Trump everything but a good milk cow?

“When the full extent of your venality, moral turpitude, and political corruption becomes known, you will take your rightful place as a disgraced demagogue in the dustbin of history … you will not destroy America ... America will triumph over you,” Brennan once tweeted at the president. All Brennan needs is a sandwich board, a megaphone and a bus ticket to Berkeley, for goodness sakes.

Brennan’s defenders immediately claimed that his free speech rights had been infringed upon. Laurence Tribe called it a “violation” of the First Amendment and even argued that Trump should be impeached over it! For someone who supposedly just had a piece of constitutional duct tape put over his mouth, Brennan sure didn’t seem encumbered by it. He had an op-ed published in the New York Times on Aug. 16, the day after Trump defrocked him, and appeared on NBC’s Meet the Press on Sunday to reiterate to host Chuck Todd that Trump is “treasonous.”

The “silencing” of Mr. Brennan is deafening. At this rate he’ll be starring in a Broadway show by Labor Day called “Speak No Evil.”

More from Jennings:Everyone you oppose isn't Hitler. So stop using the Nazi slur in politics.

There are reasons why the president should’ve left Brennan alone, chief among them that this sort of knuckle-rapping signaled concern about what Brennan has to say. But the president often punches down at his detractors, so Brennan got the same treatment as Omarosa and author Michael Wolf. The merits of this strategy are debatable, as critics beneath the president who should be left to joust with surrogates become richer and more famous thanks to Trump’s engagement.

Now, Brennan’s criticism will find more venues than it did before, as the president increased his value on the anti-Trump pundit/book/speaking engagement circuit. The economy for anti-Trump content is good — just ask political consultant Rick Wilson, whose recent book is a New York Times bestseller — and Brennan will no doubt monetize this feud.

As is his right to do so. He may speak freely, and conservatives should defend that right. But Brennan does not have a right to a security clearance, nor is he immune from the consequences of free speech. In this case, becoming a political pundit who routinely slams the president resulted in the short-term embarrassment of being stripped of a clearance he was not using anyway.

Unexplored in this flap is whether Brennan was any good as CIA director. For all the griping he does about Trump and Russia, it was on his and President Barack Obama’s watch, after all, that Putin meddled in our election.

And, since the issue of non-disclosure agreements is in the news, let’s not forget that Brennan tried to use them to silence two CIA operatives who survived the Benghazi attack, and then lied about it in a letter to Congress. Stephen Hayes pieced together this ugly episode for The Weekly Standard back in 2013, and Brennan’s defenders should have revisited it before dying on this hill. Brennan had the survivors served with “legally unnecessary” NDAs while they were attending a memorial service for their fallen comrades. Despicable.

If you agree with Brennan’s criticism of the president, weep not for this man and stop making the dumb free speech argument on his behalf. Brennan’s First Amendment rights are intact, he has prominent and respected military and intelligence community leaders rushing to his defense, and he stands to make a mint over this dust-up.

Brennan was free to crap on the president before he lost his clearance and will keep on keeping on, I’m sure. His role in #TheResistance is not diminished; rather, Brennan has been martyred and, as Obi-Wan Kenobi once opined, will become more powerful after being struck down by the left’s personal Darth Vader.

We have to cool it with the Nazi crap.

I was on television the other night and everybody was up in arms about Donald Trump Jr. calling Democrats ""Nazis.""

""You see the Nazi platform in the early 1930s and what was actually put out there ... and you look at it compared to like the DNC platform of today, and you're saying, man, those things are awfully similar, to a point where it's actually scary,"" Trump Jr. said.

This commentary set off a round of media and liberal outrage, another familiar cycle wherein the left melts down over some Trump family comment. Then the fact checkers swooped in on cue with the predictable but unnecessary assurance that today’s American Democrats are not yesterday’s German Nazis.

This is the pathetic state of American political discourse.

Read this:Trump's press secretary to speak at Kentucky GOP dinner

But there we were, in the middle of another 24-hour circus, replaced almost as soon as it came by President Donald Trump’s own weekend tweets regarding the now infamous meeting in Trump Tower between his son and the Russians peddling complaints about adoption and information about Hillary Clinton.

But I’m still on the Nazis, because for eight years of the George W. Bush administration the term was casually tossed around by the American left as though it were a paper airplane in a middle school study hall.

In 2004, Moveon.org posted anti-Bush campaign ads morphing the 43rd president’s face into Adolph Hitler’s. The ads were condemned by The Simon Wiesenthal Center, the Anti-Defamation League and the American Jewish Congress.

George Soros, the billionaire and liberal political operations financier, wrote a book in which he accused the Bush administration of Nazi-like propaganda tactics. Congressman Keith Ellison of Minnesota, the first Muslim to serve in Congress and one of the chamber’s most liberal Democrats, spoke to an atheist group and compared “Bush to Adolf Hitler … hinting that he might have been responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks.” Ellison is deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee.

I recall during my service in the Bush administration seeing regular images of anti-war protestors marching around with Nazi imagery depicting Bush as a modern-day Hitler.

This is what Democrats do – they compare Republicans to Nazis. Barry Goldwater. Ronald Reagan. Bush. And now Donald Trump, who is called a Nazi so often you can set a Glashütte-made watch by it.

They say his rallies remind them of Hitler’s. They accuse of him of propaganda tactics that would make Hitler's propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels green with envy. They say he uses “dehumanizing” language, just like the Nazis dehumanized the Jews.

And it goes on and on and on. But just because Democrats flippantly (and incorrectly) call Republican presidents Nazis doesn’t make it right to respond in kind, as it further normalizes a brand that should never be remembered as anything but abnormally evil.

Trump himself has thrown around the Nazi slur, notably, as president-elect, questioning whether we are “living in Nazi Germany” as he raged over intelligence community leaks “about his campaign’s purported ties to Russia.” Not a banner day in presidential rhetoric to compare your own democratic republic to the Third Reich.

Which brings me back to Trump Jr. It was wrong for him to compare the American Democrats to Nazis. It is wrong for the Democrats to do it to Trump and Bush.

If you are a liberal about to glue a fake Hitler mustache to your upper lip before heading down to the protest march du jour, please stop.

If you are a Republican who wants to attack Democratic policies, ditch the Nazi cliché for something real, like the actual turn toward socialism as embodied by Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

If you are the president, and you see Nazis marching around America, appropriating your name while doing so, repudiate them without hesitation. They don’t deserve your rhetorical deference.

Even as our partisan conflagration rages, its time both parties ditch the lazy and historically improper tactic of branding our political opponents as Nazis. It cheapens the word, as the tag should remain one of the most reviled brands in history. No matter your politics, resist the urge and make smarter arguments.

To call an American political actor a Nazi devalues the millions of lives lost at the hands of the brutal Nazi regime. Their memories are more important than your winning a 24-hour news cycle, or posting some dumb picture of yourself on social media thinking you’ve done anything other than make American politics worse in the process.

A week from this Saturday, Kentucky’s politicos and their supporters will converge at Fancy Farm, Kentucky, home of St. Jerome’s Catholic Parish and its famous political stump speaking event.

With no statewide races on the 2018 ballot, the 2019 gubernatorial race looms large. Will Gov. Matt Bevin seek re-election? How many Democrats will challenge Attorney General Andy Beshear in the primary? Here’s a preview of the most important players:

Matt Bevin (R) – It is no secret that the governor dislikes Fancy Farm despite having formidable public speaking skills. He has yet to commit, although people close to him say he’s edging toward a re-election campaign nonetheless. Whether he appears or not, I predict Bevin runs for re-election and wins.

While Bevin has faced turbulence over his pension reform comments, the underlying political dynamics have undeniably shifted in his favor since 2015. Democrats have fallen under 50 percent in voter registration, even as the Democratic Party spins a yarn of supposedly greater enthusiasm. Republicans gained a supermajority in the state house in 2016, and President Donald Trump remains popular.

Bevin’s biggest asset — one he should tout from the stage — is Kentucky’s economy. We rely on governors to wrangle economic development opportunities and Bevin has delivered in spades. With the unemployment rate hovering around 4 percent and thousands of workers finding jobs each month, Bevin can run a positive campaign on promises made and kept.

In 2011, Gov. Steve Beshear, a Democrat, was re-elected despite an unemployment rate of 9.1 percent and a White House occupied by a terribly unpopular Democratic president. Bevin has the opposite conditions and is unlikely to face a serious primary. A trip to Fancy Farm would give Bevin a chance to argue that, on his watch, Kentucky has indeed become the best version of itself.

Andy Beshear (D) – Kentucky’s attorney general is the first Democrat to launch a gubernatorial campaign, and he hopes to amass early donor and organizational support sufficient to ward off primary opponents. Beshear must find a stronger voice at Fancy Farm, something he lacked in his announcement speech. Beshear must show his bloodthirsty base that he can land the punches necessary to beat a tough incumbent.

A condition of Democratic primaries these days is that you must run hard left to win. Beshear, a former corporate lawyer who knows better than to buy into the socialism garbage popular in his party, would rather not fall into this trap. But with liberals Alison Grimes and Attica Scott possibly lurking on his left, perceived moderates Ben Chandler and Rocky Adkins on his right, and slick chameleon Adam Edelen jumping from flank to flank, Beshear could find himself in a complicated game of multi-dimensional chess

I expect Kentucky teachers and liberal activists to turn out in force for this year’s picnic. If they appear to be supporting Beshear, other Democrats could be dissuaded. Can Andy rally the troops, or are they looking for someone angrier and more liberal?

Mitch McConnell (R) – He’s not up until 2020, but the Senate majority leader has already launched a re-election campaign with a staffer and digital advertising. He should focus on two things: his stewardship of the Trump agenda and the socialists following him around Louisville. McConnell’s hecklers buoy his re-election chances with every insult and threat.

Some pundits — trying to cause trouble for both men — chatter about Bevin challenging McConnell in 2020, recalling memories of 1938 when Alben Barkley, the last Senate majority leader from Kentucky, faced a primary from upstart Gov. Happy Chandler. With the support of a popular president, the powerful Barkley easily dispatched the pesky and ambitious Chandler, who had designs on the presidency himself.

McConnell would surely enjoy Trump’s support in a primary against any opponent. Just as Barkley shepherded Roosevelt’s New Deal through Congress, McConnell has moved Trump’s tax cuts, regulatory reforms, military spending and judges through a closely divided Senate. History has tethered these unlikely partners on policy and politics, something McConnell should plug in his speech.

Alison Grimes (D) – Best wishes to the term-limited secretary of state, who recently announced that she is having a baby in December. Grimes has several options ahead of her in 2019 and 2020, and would be formidable in any Democratic primary for governor, attorney general or U.S. Senate. As a parent who has taken her kids to Fancy Farm, Grimes will soon know the joy of plying one with barbecue and carnival games that benefit the church!

Ryan Quarles (R) – The popular agriculture commissioner will serve as emcee of this year’s stump speaking. He is running for re-election in 2019 and his elevation to emcee tracks perfectly with his ascension as one of the GOP’s brightest stars.

245,Jennings,Scott,leoweekly,"Should Mitch McConnell be confronted in public? Conservative writer Scott Jennings and LEO Executive Editor Aaron Yarmuth take opposite sides. Read Jennings’ opinion below, and click here for Yarmuth’s take.

Watching liberal activists hound Mitch McConnell with smartphones and megaphones at local restaurants, screaming about abolishing ICE, I couldn’t help but think: I never knew it would be so easy to reelect Mitch in 2020.

Videos of these encounters have rocketed around the world and serve as a reminder to conservative voters that, “Oh yeah, Mitch McConnell is one of us.”

We tend to define our politicians these days not by what they do, but by their attitude and their enemies. And McConnell couldn’t have a better enemy than the abolish ICE socialists, who, in addition to harassing him, have taken up residence in downtown Louisville because a feckless mayor won’t kick them off the sidewalk.

The more publicity they get, the more Republicans voters are reminded why they voted for Donald Trump in 2016…and why they must keep his party in power in the years ahead. Some Republicans may not love everything about Trump, but they see the abolish ICE people and say: “There’s no way in hell I am turning the country over to them.”

What troubles me about these public confrontations is that it feels like the American Left has given up on elections as the method by which we resolve our political differences. The Left, impatient to express anger over Trump’s behavior and Republican policy choices, now resorts to harassment that will hurt their cause when people head to the ballot box over the next two federal elections.

I appeared on CNN the other night in my role as a Political Contributor to the network to debate two very fine people — Kirsten Powers, a wonderful writer and human being, and Nada Bakos, a thoughtful former CIA analyst — on the occasion of Trump’s visit to the NATO meetings in Europe. The conversation turned toward accusations that Trump was exhibiting authoritarian behavior and whether American democracy was being damaged.

Ms. Bakos had tweeted: “The republic is burning and we are all bystanders. (This is not hyperbole).” I replied that I thought it was alarmist to say that America is crumbling, given that we haven’t had one election since Trump became the president. Relative to the history of the Republic, Trump’s presidency is a mere blip.

I pointed out that we have a 242-year history of durable American democratic process whereby we resolve our political differences through voting (with the notable exception of the Civil War), and that we can vote out Trump’s party and him personally in the next three years — or keep them in power — depending on how voters feel about the job he’s doing.

I was taken aback at what Ms. Bakos said next, that we cannot “wholly rely upon voting as like a stalwart against all of this erosion.” I shudder at the alternative.

The magic of the Founding Fathers and their system of government is that we can change it all every two years if we feel like it. I just don’t understand how you can throw out 240 years of American democracy after one half of one term of one presidency.

What has become clear is that the American Left — because of their TDS (Trump Derangement Syndrome) — no longer believes in civility or voting as critical pieces of our democracy. I have no problem with people protesting politicians and speaking out, but I do have a problem when public servants like McConnell and White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders are chased from eateries.

Are we so angry about politics that we must ruin one another’s dinner over it?

The American Left is so dissatisfied with Republican democracy that it has turned to harassing conservatives in public places in hopes, I guess, of convincing them to give up their professions. Impatience with an electoral system in which leftists don’t always win is ruining the Democratic Party.

The Left, it seems, thinks if enough conservatives are made uncomfortable they will no longer participate in politics, making it much easier for Democrats to win elections. But the opposite will be true — harassing McConnell, Sanders or anyone else will cause conservatives to double down on their principles and fight even harder. These protests reinvigorate conservatives, reminding them anew that their country should not be run by the socialist, open borders crowd.

These dinner disrupters aren’t hurting McConnell — they are helping him. While I hate to see him chased around The Highlands by a bunch of loons, I can’t imagine a more effective advertisement for his reelection. McConnell gets it, which is why he held a press conference last week stating that he “will not be intimidated by these socialists who apparently prefer open borders.” McConnell even name-dropped Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren, tagging them all with the abolish ICE crowd to further nationalize and mainstream this attack on the Democratic Party.

There is something to be said for basic human civility. Calling someone a “turtle head” and shouting “we know where you live, bitch!” may make a protester feel good in the moment, but I can assure you the guy who said those things helped McConnell as much or more than any phone banking volunteer ever will. Thanks dude!

Even as the American Left gives up on voting as the means to enact change, we’ll nonetheless have an election in November and then again in 2020. If Democrats continue to be defined by the abolish ICE socialists, Trump is going to win 40 plus states, and McConnell will be U.S. senator until January 2027.

If you are mad about politics now, wait until November 2020 when you hear the crowd chanting: “Stick with Mitch! Stick with Mitch” on Election night and ask yourself: “Was chasing Mitch McConnell down the street with my smartphone held aloft worth it?” •

Our Founding Fathers resolved that without freedom Americans could not enjoy life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. To secure it, they fought a war to break free from the bonds of tyranny.

It isn’t a faraway tyrant that oppresses us today. Rather, we are in the grip of a new kind of tyranny – that of mistrust. This tyrant sits on a throne in our minds and is just as cruel as King George was during the time of the Founders. The tyranny of mistrust has divided us against ourselves, shoving aside the notion of common purpose. We cannot afford to hate each other, yet that is precisely what today’s tyranny demands.

This new tyranny makes us paranoid. It turns ordinary political discussions into full-blown arguments with friends we’ve known for years. It breeds hysteria, addicting people to perpetual outrage.

It clouds our minds and erases our memories. It causes us to believe that ordinary occurrences, like Supreme Court vacancies, are the end of the world. It gives us amnesia – we can’t remember or accept that perhaps the problems on which we rail existed before the politicians we hate came to power. It makes us believe that all problems are caused by or must be solved by Washington, when the real answers may lie within our own households and communities.

More from Scott Jennings:Mitch McConnell's tenure worth a spot in history books

This tyranny brings out the worst in us, hardening hearts in the face of tragedy. When five journalists were gunned down in Maryland, kind sentiments uttered in their memory were met with mocking and misplaced blame from the darkest corners of American tribalism.

This regime nurtures worrisome racial and class tensions. Black citizens live in fear of the people to whom we imbue the awesome responsibility of enforcing our laws, while other citizens wonder how federal agents can hold such a dim view of the president’s supporters. Equal justice cannot exist when those meting it out harbor such biases.

We are abandoning the democratic values that have traditionally bound us together. For some, accosting public servants has replaced voting as the preferred method for expressing displeasure with the government. Others entrusted with powerful communications platforms wistfully wonder about the benefits of dictatorships, their impatience with democracy on stunningly mindless display.

A man once told me “instant coffee ruined the world.” He was right, and today our desire for immediate political gratification slams headlong into the pace at which our democratic institutions operate.

From this columnist:Lack of sportsmanship by adults at games sets bad example

But there’s a reason they move like molasses, and there’s a reason to embrace our historically durable process instead of letting political frustration manifest itself in hateful ways. Running people out of restaurants and putting up “you aren’t welcome” billboards only strengthens today’s tyranny and polarizes us further.

We’ve broken free from tyranny before, and we must do it again. Optimism in our economic future is on the rise, and we have more jobs than people to fill them. Truly, ours is a land of tremendous opportunity. For our children, the possibilities are limitless so long as we do not squander their American inheritance. We can turn this optimism into a fortress against today’s tyranny, if we can pull ourselves together.

We must collectively find the will to trust the outcomes produced by our institutions, and the institutions themselves must acknowledge their own mistakes. Rebuilding trust is a two-way street.

Finally, declaring our independence from this homegrown tyranny means walking in someone else’s shoes. Our Founders mutually pledged to each other “our Lives, our Fortunes, and our Sacred Honor,” even as they squabbled over policy and politics. Today, we simply must pledge our mutual trust, as Americans, to our neighbors, coworkers, and passersby. The Founders hung together in their divinely inspired endeavor, and so should we.

From January:Scott Jennings to take part as spring fellow at Harvard Kennedy School

The tyranny of mistrust relies on hard hearts, paranoia and faithlessness. Defeat it by embracing one another on good days and bad. Be good-natured and rejoice that we have the luxury of spending hours arguing politics with each other on social media platforms, instead of spending those hours fetching water for our families.

Debate each other vigorously even as we fight alongside each other in the battle against modern tyranny, but end those debates with a handshake instead of a shaking fist. Believe that political opponents have our nation’s best interests at heart, that journalists earnestly seek the truth, and that public servants go to work for the right reasons. Accept that some will fail, because they are human, but believe that most will not.

Today, we remember those who took the leap of faith 242 years ago. Will we discover their spirit anew by declaring war on the tyranny of mistrust?

For the sake of our Republic, pray the answer is yes.

Phil Niekro confounded the best hitters in baseball for 24 Major League seasons using a knuckleball that Yankee outfielder Bobby Murcer said was “like trying to eat Jell-O with chopsticks.” Only three hurlers pitched more innings than the durable Niekro, and just nine players appeared in more seasons.

After a long day on the Senate floor, Kentucky’s political version of Niekro — Mitch McConnell — unwinds by catching the last few innings of his beloved Washington Nationals. McConnell, who on June 12 became thelongest-serving Republican Senate leader in American history, knows that experience, patience and strategy make a difference in both baseball and politics, two great American past times he has loved since childhood.

A fan favorite, Niekro’s style fueled his longevity and made him one of the winningest pitchers in history. Similarly, McConnell brings Republicans a certain joy when he stymies Democrats with his frustratingly dispassionate style. Heckling liberal bleacher bums, ever enraged by McConnell’s wry grin, never bother the wily veteran.

More Jennings: Carl Nett is a 'dumbass' for making Twitter threat against Yarmuth

“I have grudging respect for his success,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), who watches McConnell throw unhittable procedural pitches on the Senate floor.

McConnell is a throwback, a veteran workhorse laboring in an era of show ponies who flame out before accomplishing much of anything. While some senators throw hard for the cameras, they care not whether their pitches are strategically placed. That’s not McConnell, who wins more than he loses by making Democrats flail as Chuck Schumer did during January’s government shutdown.

When McConnell became Republican leader, the Tea Party hadn’t materialized, Donald Trump was a registered Democrat, and populism wasn’t exactly a household word. While much has changed about our politics and culture in the last 11 years, McConnell is the same pitcher he always was: a fierce competitor whose only mission is to win.

Taking over as minority leader in the wake of what President George W. Bush called “a thumpin’ ” in the 2006 midterm, McConnell stifled much of President Barack Obama’s agenda, galvanizing his team against the American left’s worst ideas while paving the way for 2016’s rightward swing. McConnell will long be remembered for holding open the Supreme Court Seat of Antonin Scalia, who died during Obama’s waning days in office.

McConnell describes the last year and a half of unified Republican control under President Trump as “the most productive period for center-right governance” since he went to Washington in 1985. And McConnell is the man most responsible for enacting the president’s agenda – tax cuts, regulatory relief, drilling in ANWR, and increased military spending, etc.

More Jennings:Democrats look like they're squandering big chance in Congress

As McConnell’s late colleague Jim Bunning knew, even Hall of Famers sometime have tough starts. McConnell kept his team in the Obamacare repeal and replace game last summer but ultimately came up one vote short, when John McCain blew the save. You can’t win 'em all, although McConnell split the series by eventually eliminating Obamacare’s individual mandate in the tax reform law.

But there’s no doubt the GOP has much to show for making McConnell the ace of their Senate rotation. They filled the Scalia seat with conservative Neil Gorsuch, along with a record number of circuit court vacancies that McConnell created during the Obama years. We’ll be talking about McConnell’s raft of young judges three decades from now the way baseball people still talk about Niekro’s fluttering knuckler, last thrown in 1987.

Kentucky — which would ordinarily lack the influence of places like California, New York and Texas — punches above its federal weight because of McConnell’s leadership position. When Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont stuck it to tiny Berea College using procedural trickery in December’s tax reform bill, McConnell righted the wrong by striking out Sanders’ provision in February’s budget deal.

In 2017, as 22,000 retired coal miners faced the elimination of their health benefits, McConnell was the stopper they needed. “This is a tremendous victory, and Sen. McConnell played a decisive role in making sure it happened,” said union boss Steve Earle, who has spent much of his adult life trying to chase McConnell from the Senate. (Interestingly, Niekro’s father learned the knuckleball from a coal miner and passed it on to his sons Phil and Joe, also a successful Major Leaguer, in the backyard.)

Also:Jennings to talk tribalism, party system as spring fellow at Harvard

McConnell keeps hitters guessing by throwing occasional curveballs. For instance, he has become a surprising champion for legalizing industrial hemp after a career spent fighting drug abuse. McConnell once said “put me down in favor of boring” when it comes to politics, but his hemp hop is anything but.

The legendary Pete Rose said hitting against Niekro was “a miserable way to make a living.” One imagines that Schumer and Harry Reid, the two Democrats who faced McConnell’s pitching on a regular basis, feel the same way about the cunning righthander from Louisville.

You can find Niekro’s plaque in Cooperstown, alongside legends like Tom Seaver, Bob Gibson, Nolan Ryan and Cy Young. Now, in a virtual Senate Hall of Fame where the legacies of Mike Mansfield, Lyndon Johnson, Howard Baker, Alben Barkley and Bob Dole are forever remembered, you’ll find one more name etched in the history books: Kentucky’s Mitch McConnell.

McConnell kept his team in the Obamacare repeal and replace game last summer but ultimately came up one vote short, when John McCain blew the save. You can’t win 'em all, although McConnell split the series by eventually eliminating Obamacare’s individual mandate in the tax reform law.

But there’s no doubt the GOP has much to show for making McConnell the ace of their Senate rotation. They filled the Scalia seat with conservative Neil Gorsuch, along with a record number of circuit court vacancies that McConnell created during the Obama years. We’ll be talking about McConnell’s raft of young judges three decades from now the way baseball people still talk about Niekro’s fluttering knuckler, last thrown in 1987.

Kentucky — which would ordinarily lack the influence of places like California, New York and Texas — punches above its federal weight because of McConnell’s leadership position. When Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont stuck it to tiny Berea College using procedural trickery in December’s tax reform bill, McConnell righted the wrong by striking out Sanders’ provision in February’s budget deal.

In 2017, as 22,000 retired coal miners faced the elimination of their health benefits, McConnell was the stopper they needed. “This is a tremendous victory, and Sen. McConnell played a decisive role in making sure it happened,” said union boss Steve Earle, who has spent much of his adult life trying to chase McConnell from the Senate. (Interestingly, Niekro’s father learned the knuckleball from a coal miner and passed it on to his sons Phil and Joe, also a successful Major Leaguer, in the backyard.)

McConnell keeps hitters guessing by throwing occasional curveballs. For instance, he has become a surprising champion for legalizing industrial hemp after a career spent fighting drug abuse. McConnell once said “put me down in favor of boring” when it comes to politics, but his hemp hop is anything but.

The legendary Pete Rose said hitting against Niekro was “a miserable way to make a living.” One imagines that Schumer and Harry Reid, the two Democrats who faced McConnell’s pitching on a regular basis, feel the same way about the cunning righthander from Louisville.

You can find Niekro’s plaque in Cooperstown, alongside legends like Tom Seaver, Bob Gibson, Nolan Ryan and Cy Young. Now, in a virtual Senate Hall of Fame where the legacies of Mike Mansfield, Lyndon Johnson, Howard Baker, Alben Barkley and Bob Dole are forever remembered, you’ll find one more name etched in the history books: Kentucky’s Mitch McConnell.

I went to a White Sox vs. Orioles baseball game recently and left appalled by the lack of sportsmanship. The players acted appropriately, but a team manager exhibited shocking behavior.

In the second inning, the Orioles’ manager jumped from his dugout to berate the umpires, convincing them to throw a White Sox player out of the game. The player in question was good — it was a definite advantage to have him tossed — but he probably wasn’t ready for that kind of major league treatment.

He is, after all, just 9 years old.

I am assistant coach of my son’s team. We play in Lyndon, where the people in charge generally do a nice job of making every youngster — no matter their skill level — feel included. The rosters have more than nine players. Every kid bats, even as they all rotate on and off the field for defense.

The goal is to give every kid a chance to play in this recreational league.

More from Scott Jennings:Here's how Republicans, Democrats and the media were blindsided by the Trump revolt

One of our players had a soccer game before baseball. We knew he would be late, so when his first turn at bat came we took an out and moved through the lineup. He arrived shortly after and took his spot at shortstop in the next half inning.

That’s when the adults running the other team rushed the field, demanding his expulsion. The teenage umpires understandingly wilted, thrust into a confrontation they never anticipated when signing up for some easy summer cash.

The shortstop in question — whose mother moved heaven and earth to get him from soccer to baseball, out of one uniform and into another — hung his head and trudged off the field. The opposing manager smirked and exited, believing he’d just pulled off a coup worthy of recognition in Cooperstown’s archives.

His message: win at all costs, even if it means demanding that a 9-year-old kid be barred from a baseball diamond. I was outraged by the lack of sportsmanship and his poor example, as were many other parents.

More from Scott Jennings:A Kentuckian remembers First Lady Barbara Bush

To make sure I wasn’t looking at this all wrong, I consulted John O’Sullivan, founder of “Changing the Game Project,” an organization dedicated to improving the atmosphere in youth sports. John is a prolific speaker and author, and a former serious athlete himself.

“This is an example of everything that is wrong in youth sports. A game amongst 9-year olds is supposed to be about children competing against other children, not adults competing against other adults through their children. There is no chance that 20 years from now any of those kids remembers the score of that game. They will remember adults acting like children, and the embarrassment that one boy felt that day will stick with him a long time. Any adult who thinks this is about being competitive knows nothing about competing, and even less about why children show up to play,” O’Sullivan tells me.

The poor child, I am told, was indeed embarrassed and barely slept that night.

You may like:Our civil discourse is on life support. Time to join the (loyal) opposition

Child psychologist and author Janet Sasson Edgette tells me the “sad part” is that parents almost never stop the bad behavior when the game ends.

“More often, they spend the ride home bad-mouthing the refs or the umpires or coaches or the poor kid who comes to the game late,” Edgette said.

I usually write about politics, but many of our thorniest political issues are directly related to our cultural breakdown. And culture starts at home, where parents pass on their ethics — for good or ill — to their children.

All parents fall short from time to time. We snap when we should have taken a deep breath. We look at our phones when we should be looking at our kids. We say and do things in front of young eyes and ears we wish we could take back.

Trouble comes when our failings morph from isolated lapses into a full-blown lifestyle. The lessons we pass on are certain to manifest themselves in ways that damage our culture years down the road.

If you find yourself conspiring with other adults to have a mere child thrown off a baseball diamond, take a deep breath and re-evaluate your life. You weren’t put on this earth to block a kid from having fun at sports, nor to instill a snide ruthlessness in the next generation.

The Orioles’ ploy failed, by the way. The White Sox racked up hit after hit, motivated by their buddy’s plight.

Sometimes when the adults screw up, the kids manage to get it just right.

Obama on McCain: We are all in his debt

(CNN) —

A great many Republicans have had their differences with Arizona Sen. John McCain over the years, and some of President Donald Trump’s biggest supporters are using the occasion of the release of the senator’s memoir to bash McCain in the sunset of his career and life.

courtesy of Scott Jennings Scott Jennings

They take to Twitter to bash a guy who suffered torture for his country, lived a life of public service and consequence, and has the audacity to express his political opinions and preferences on who eulogizes him.

You don’t have to love John McCain to know this is wrong and, as Jonah Goldberg put it, “grotesque.”

It is true that those of us who supported George W. Bush over McCain in the 2000 GOP primary found his attacks against Bush to be whiny and irritating. McCain’s position and vitriolic statements on campaign finance “reform” were grating, especially when you consider that his legislation did the opposite of reforming the system. It drove money out of the hands of candidates and parties, and into the shadows of outside groups.

McCain’s legacy on campaign finance, well-meaning as it may have been, is a broken system that he helped to drive fully off the rails.

But he has been a loyal American and Republican all his life. He barnstormed the country for Bush in 2000 and 2004. I saw him on the campaign trail for Mitt Romney in 2012. He took on the mantle of Republican nominee for President in 2008, trying desperately to hold the White House for a party whose President was suffering from low approval ratings.

Despite his ditching the GOP on a handful of issues (most recently Obamacare repeal), McCain has mostly been a solid citizen in the Senate. He has opposed wasteful spending (a Republican staple), and even now, serving under a President he clearly despises, votes for the Trump agenda 83% of the time, according to 538’s “Trump Tracker.” That’s a better “Trump Score” than Susan Collins, Mike Lee and Rand Paul, and nearly 22 points more than the tracker would expect based on the 2016 outcome in Arizona.

Another 538 article pointed out that McCain stuck with the GOP on party-line votes 87% of the time, just below the average of 91% for all Republicans. He has a lifetime voting score from the American Conservative Union of nearly 81% over 35 years of service.

McCain has been a maverick at times, but he will long be remembered as a mostly loyal and conservative Republican who sometimes had differences of opinion and style with other leaders in his party. He was never afraid to fight people in his own party, or in the other one.

But it is McCain’s attacks on Trump, including those in his new book “The Restless Wave: Good Times, Just Causes, Great Fights, and Other Appreciations,” that have some Trump supporters criticizing a man who is dying of brain cancer. They don’t like it that McCain reportedly doesn’t want Trump attending his funeral, while former Presidents Bush and Barack Obama will deliver eulogies.

What do you expect? McCain and Trump don’t like each other, and I don’t know too many people who want people they don’t like at their funeral.

Trump assailed McCain during the 2012 primary (“I like people who weren’t captured,” Trump said of McCain). McCain turned around and voted against Obamacare repeal in 2017 despite urging from Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, delivering the bill-crushing vote with a theatrical middle-of-the-night thumbs-down.

Despite their political differences, McCain got along with Bush and Obama, and it makes sense for them to eulogize a genuine American war hero who dedicated his entire life to public service.

In 2000, McCain ran as the anti-establishment insurgent, trying to upend the Bush apple cart.

But today, at the sunset of McCain’s life and career, it is another group of insurgents, Trump and his supporters, who cast McCain as an unreliable relic, out of touch with the people of Arizona and the Republican Party. They hate his views on immigration and his detestation of Trump’s behavior and style.

In some ways, Trump pulled off what McCain was trying to do back in 2000. McCain called it the “Straight Talk Express,” pulling no punches and offering unprecedented press access. He didn’t win but forever absorbed the brand of “maverick” in the process.

Trump did the same thing. He ran against the establishment and was the most press accessible candidate in 2016. McCain was, tactically, ahead of his time, while Trump got the timing just right.

McCain will be remembered as a war hero, American patriot and public servant who was conservative but unafraid to buck his party from time to time. He will be remembered for clashing with Trump and suffering for it politically among members of his own party.

He will be remembered for picking Sarah Palin and later regretting it. He will be remembered for making the campaign finance system worse while trying to make it better. He will be remembered for being entangled in the Keating Five ethics scandal.

He will be remembered for being tortured, and then leading the opposition to certain interrogation tactics during the Global War on Terror.

But no matter how you remember him or what you think of him, John McCain has earned the right to speak his mind and to have anyone at his funeral he wants. Feel free to disagree with McCain, but lay off the vitriolic, tribal attacks.

He suffered mightily for your right to do so.",1,https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/07/opinions/john-mccain-donald-trump-jennings/index.html

Guest columnist

Salena Zito was 57 years old, jobless, and weeks from losing her health care. She noticed a “help wanted” sign at the French bakery next door, so she walked over to apply.

“I knew I was never leaving Pittsburgh,” Zito says. “This is where my family is.”

The date was Nov. 9, 2016. Zito, a journalist, had been covering the 2016 presidential campaign as a freelance reporter, often filing four or more stories per day. She had lost her full-time job at the Pittsburgh daily in September and then scrambled for two months laboring for numerous outlets.

But the day after the election, her freelance reporting jobs ended, Zito stared into an abyss familiar to thousands of Americans left behind by a changing economy.

“My industry had died. My usefulness had died. Nobody wanted me anymore. My next course was to get multiple jobs to make half what I used to. In that moment, I knew why many of Trump’s voters had gone to the polls,” Zito says.

Before she lived their plight, Zito, something of a midwestern political seismologist, had picked up the tremors of an earthquake that would shake American politics. She first noticed vibrations during the Iowa caucus (which Donald Trump narrowly lost) and then again in Pennsylvania’s primary, where Trump crushed his opponents. By the summer of 2016 — “before Wikileaks, before the emails” — Zito believed that Trump would be the next president.

She filed a story on July 2 about how Trump could win Pennsylvania and therefore the presidency. Zito thought the race for the White House might already be over and that nobody knew it but her.

“I took a lot of crap for that column,” Zito deadpans.

Fast forward to September. Zito loses her full-time reporting job and lands an interview with Donald Trump the next day.

“I had nowhere to publish it,” she says, recalling the major daily papers that turned her down. “Finally, The Atlantic took it. They paid me $300.”

The headline? ""Take Trump Seriously, Not Literally.""

A year and a half after Trump shocked the world, Zito, now fully employed, has collaborated with veteran Republican political consultant Brad Todd on ""The Great Revolt,"" a book that explores what comes next from this new coalition of voters, unmoored from political parties and mistrustful of elites and institutions.

More from Scott Jennings:Democrats look like they're squandering big chance to make gains in Congress

Zito and Todd, who hails from a factory town in rural Tennessee, drove 27,000 miles to interview more than 300 voters in 10 counties that moved from President Barack Obama’s column in 2012 to Trump’s. Todd’s consulting firm surveyed 2,000 swing-state Trump voters to back up their interviews with high quality polling data.

Reading the words of the farmers, gun-toting women, former union bosses and others who found their way to Trump, you get the feeling that Zito’s and Todd’s blue-collar, flyover country roots opened doors and hearts that might have remained closed to some big city reporters. The revealing conversations peel back the layers of a complicated American onion, where the heart of our newfound populist movement is a rejection of “bigness.” Government, corporations, media, and multinational trade agreements — rejecting these big institutions, Zito and Todd argue, is the hallmark of this “wrecking ball” coalition in which localism trumps globalism.

“Both parties and the media got blindsided by the populist revolt against the political balance that had been in place since the New Deal. Since then, the NFL and other corporations made the same mistake. Our goal was to examine who is making this shift happen and spark conversation on which institutions they blindside next,” Todd says.

“These voters believe they’ve been misrepresented, made fun of, and disrespected,” Zito adds.

Todd argues the fusion of populism and conservatism is here to stay, and the resulting coalition compromise means “the end of (Paul) Ryanism, the dispassionate green eyeshade brand of conservatism that values zeroes on government spreadsheets aside from their non-monetary impacts… (Republicans) have to focus our cuts to government on values and not just on budget-balancing.”

Will Trump’s coalition help Republicans defy history and carry the midterm? Todd predicts a split decision “that reflects the divide we saw in 2016, where Democrats have a great chance in the House and Republicans should gain seats in the Senate in Trump states.”

Scott Jennings:Is the White House political shop ready for the midterms?

As for 2020, Zito sees a better than 50 percent chance Trump is reelected, and Todd thinks the Democrats “will nominate someone far left of Hillary and of Obama … their best shot to win is with a red stater like (Montana Governor) Steve Bullock, but I’d bet money you get someone like (California Sen.) Kamala Harris or crazier.”

Zito pegs Congressman Tim Ryan, who represents Youngstown, Ohio, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, as outsiders to watch.

“If Democrats go with an establishment candidate, including Joe Biden, they will not win,” she says.

As for Zito’s baking career, it never took off. Before she could turn in her application, CNN called and offered her a position as an on-air contributor. In the weeks following the 2016 election she was hired by the New York Post and Washington Examiner newspapers, and then landed a show on SiriusXM radio.

She remembers the CNN call like it was yesterday.

“I sat down on the curb between the bakery and my house and cried. I was so overwhelmed by the moment. I didn’t think I’d be able to do the job that I love. I’m a great baker, but I had never made anything French.”

Many political pundits wouldn’t know their Ashtabula from a hole in the ground; Zito and Todd surely do and have given us something useful. If you desire a meatier dish from smart writers more comfortable at a local diner than a fru fru Washington, D.C., restaurant, ""The Great Revolt"" is for you.

For the Courier Journal

This story has been updated to reflect Robin Bush's age when she died.

There’s no name that elicits more respect and adoration in the Republican Party than that of Barbara Bush.

She’s a revered figure, a model of class and toughness. Though she never ran for office herself, she was unafraid of the fray and always willing to tell her husband, children, and other Republicans exactly what she thought. But that never meant being petty or tribal. Her manners were impeccable, and she showed America’s politicians how to be opinionated and sharp without being offensive.

I asked a Republican woman, a friend of mine, what Mrs. Bush meant to her.

The Latest:Barbara Bush, former first lady and matriarch of Bush family, dies at 92

“She helped little girls know it was OK to speak up about issues and even to disagree with the men in their life. The way she handled those moments was to be strong but respectful,” she said. “No one pushed Barbara around.”

She was a rock for a husband who lived one of the most consequential lives in American history, and who suffered through a losing re-election campaign for president. Barbara supported George H.W. Bush when he was up and down, serving as the foundation of a strong, close-knit family.

“I married the first man I ever kissed. When I tell this to my children, they just about throw up,” she once said.

Her lifelong commitment never wavered. Married in 1945, George and Barbara were together longer than any presidential couple in history.

Barbara was a melancholy mother of two young boys who lost their sister, Robin, to leukemia at age 3. The only one old enough to understand at the time was George W., then age 7, and the episode forged a lifelong bond between a grieving mother and her son, the future president.

The Washington Post’s 1999 exploration of this episode said: “As the gloom began to lift from the Bushes' three-bedroom frame house on West Ohio Street, it was their ebullient cutup of a son who, despite his own pain, helped drive it away – joking, playing, working hard to make his mother smile again. Time helped salve Barbara Bush's pain, but so did ‘Georgie.’""

The former president said about his parents: “I adored my father. And my mother … she tended to be the enforcer … I inherited a lot of her feistiness. When I was campaigning for governor, I would tell people … I have my Daddy’s eyes and my Mother’s mouth.”

Sitting next to him for that interview with Oprah, she shot back: “You should be so lucky.”

Her true feelings for 43, though, were less than complicated: “We went through some tough very times, too, and he was my hero. Still is,” she told Fox News. They carried each other’s burdens, the way mothers and sons are supposed to.

Barbara Bush:In her own words, from political prognostication to 'rhymes with rich'

Altogether, she had six children – two who went into politics, three who didn’t, and one little girl who has belonged to the angels since 1953. She raised her family right.

While First Lady she gave a remarkable speech at Wellesley College in 1990 in the face of protesting students who believed Mrs. Bush “did not represent the type of career woman the college seeks to educate.” Nonetheless, her speech contained passages that help explain the central position she held in the Bush family:

“But whatever the era, whatever the times, one thing will never change: Fathers and mothers, if you have children -- they must come first. You must read to your children, hug your children, and you must love your children. Your success as a family ... our success as a society depends not on what happens in the White House, but on what happens inside your house,” she said.

Barbara Bush::Lesser-known facts about former first lady

The world would do well to heed her advice today, and to remember the guidance she gave the college graduates about how to manage their time:

“At the end of your life, you will never regret not having passed one more test, not winning one more verdict or not closing one more deal. You will regret time not spent with a husband, a child, a friend, or a parent,” she said.

Her razor-sharp wit never waned and will never be forgotten. She told the Smith College magazine this spring, in fact, “I'm not sure God will recognize me; I have so many new body parts!""

Oh, He will recognize her. And if He doesn’t, I’m sure a signature zinger leveled at St. Peter as she crosses the Pearly Gates will remind Him that He never made another human being like Barbara Bush.

You must support my likely opponent!"" he said, chuckling.

""No sir, I'm a Republican and I am for you,"" I said.

""A Republican from Dawson Springs? Now I've seen it all,"" he said, bemused and probably wondering if I was full of it.

It was 1995. I was 17 years old, a high school kid decamped to Northern Kentucky University for a summer leadership program. And that's the first time I met Mitch McConnell, who was there to visit his daughter. McConnell would soon face my fellow Dawsonian Steve Beshear in his 1996 U.S. Senate race.

Just over a year later, I found myself stuffing envelopes in McConnell's campaign headquarters. He sent me a personal note of thanks after his successful campaign, which I still have. In 2002, I served as McConnell's political director during his romp over Lois Weinberg. Six years after that I was on the road again as senior adviser to his 2008 campaign against Bruce Lunsford, a difficult slog during a volatile time for our nation.

This time I am on the outside, advising a ""Super PAC"" that supports McConnell but unable to talk to him for almost two years because of anti-coordination rules that govern communications between campaigns and independent expenditure groups.

I have observed this campaign as closely as anyone, which includes watching McConnell's opponent say outrageously dishonest things that make people question her character. Most candidates don't stare into a camera and blatantly lie the way Alison Grimes has about McConnell and his wife, former U.S. Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao. Usually they leave it to a narrator, but Grimes carries the deceitful freight herself, claiming that McConnell and Chao take bribes from a ""New York anti-coal billionaire."" It's an unserious allegation that reeks of desperation, rivaled in its cravenness only by Grimes' claims that McConnell somehow became rich because of actions taken as a U.S. senator.

The truth? McConnell's wife inherited a considerable sum when her mother died. Perhaps Grimes feels self-conscious that her own wealthy lifestyle was financed on the backs of her father's minimum wage workers, some of whom, according to CNN, make $2.13 per hour (the legal minimum wage for tip-earning restaurant workers). After all, Grimes was the lawyer for the low-wage business.

I can't tell if Grimes is more Ron Burgundy, haplessly reading bogus lines from a teleprompter (""…anything you put on that prompter, Burgundy will read!""), or Hillary Clinton, who once laughably claimed to have personally evaded sniper fire on a trip to Bosnia (she later admitted to ""misspeaking"" about the incident). No wonder Grimes' own image has gone underwater.

Either way, the unusual amount of dishonesty from Grimes suggests a person lacking confidence in her own arguments for election, devoid of the experience to know when campaign handlers are asking her to go too far. This sort of mendacity, for which the Washington Post's fact checker said Grimes ought to be ""ashamed of herself,""will forever leave a bad taste in the mouths of voters.

Millions of dollars have been spent on policy arguments in this election (an expensive debate in which groups I advise have been big players). But Grimes' detestable personal attacks have really made the race about character.

Of course, McConnell frequently faces down this sort of hate, be it in the form of debunked attacks from House Speaker Greg Stumbo and union thugs about his military service, or stupid, racist comments about Chao's ethnicity made by political operatives with close ties to Grimes.

McConnell endures and rises above it all. That's why I support him for reelection, and why I always have. His only goal is to serve the public and the state he loves. His mission is to give Kentucky a meaningful seat at the table when public policy is formed in Washington, D.C.

No amount of dishonesty, hate or vitriol has ever deterred McConnell. He believes the Republican Party and its conservative values give people a better chance to make the most of the American Dream, and he relentlessly fights for those values. A recent Gallup poll shows more Kentuckians share McConnell's political views, as this state now has more people who identify with the GOP than the Democratic Party for the first time in history.

McConnell is candid. You know where he stands even if you don't always agree with him. While Grimes revels in evasion, McConnell abhors it, preferring to be a blunt truth teller in a political world teeming with bologna. The only thing McConnell evades is the mind-numbing pablum destroying our political discourse.

True, he did not meet with this paper's editorial board this year (he has met them many times before, usually to no avail), but, unlike Grimes, his job requires him to take public positions every day. There's no mystery where McConnell stands on issues.

By reelecting McConnell, Kentucky can give itself an advantage not had since Alben Barkley served as Senate majority leader, and can truly push back against the disastrous policies of the Obama Administration.

Former U.S. Attorney and liberal activist Preet Bharara caught my eye with a tweet last week: “What if Jeff Bezos bought Twitter with the change in his pocket and shut Trump's account?”

His wish to censor a political opponent (in this case a U.S. president who fired him) was but the latest example of the state of America’s civil discourse.

It is on life support.

Preet’s tweet followed a January onslaught from liberal activists who demanded Twitter block the president’s access. Thankfully, Twitter didn’t cave to the mob, and Preet’s deepest wish — that Republicans he hates be banned from the public square — will go unfulfilled for at least a little while longer.

These troubling tantrums are the latest warning signs that we have forgotten how to be loyal in opposition to one another. Calling for your opponent’s silence is disloyal — to them, and to America’s founding ideals.

Our nation isn’t designed for one group to speak and others to be silenced. Our system demands that we speak to one another, to push and to pull each other, to balance each other. The American experiment requires civil discourse as the fuel for its democratic engine.

Sadly, there are those who wish to replace that fuel with something else, something corrosive. Winning arguments went out the window a long time ago. Now political actors seek to win space. To occupy territory. All of it. No opponent can be allowed to even peer into the public square, lest he be rhetorically stoned.

This is mob rule, where wild-eyed feeding frenzies destroy the marketplace of ideas and the bloodthirsty are never satisfied.

We live in a dangerous age. Will we continue down this dark path, where the spirits of Jefferson and Madison and Hamilton dare not haunt? Or will we jerk the wheel toward free speech, civil discourse and the idea that we are all in this together?

Failure to course correct means our enemies — our real enemies — win. We are divided against ourselves, convinced the most lethal adversary lives in a rural town. Or urban. Or has a college degree. Or goes to church. Or doesn’t.

These are not our enemies. This is our family, our American cousins, connected by generations who spilled blood to preserve a nation where the first right is the right to speak.

The real enemies are out there. Outside. Putin. Radical Islam. Communists. Authoritarians who seek a world without free speech. They laugh when we divide and silence one another because it means they are winning.

We cannot let them win. We gain nothing if we silence each other; only the world loses if America’s sacred torch of freedom, guaranteed here for over 200 years, goes out.

Where are we going? Straight to hell if we cannot learn to love and respect one another. As Americans. As free people. If all we ever share is a responsibility to water the tree of liberty, that must be enough to keep us loyal to one another. If I am banished, or if you are, then we miss our shift and the tree withers and dies.

The time has come for us to unite. Who will show leadership? It cannot just be one man or woman. Or one writer, pundit or politician.

This dangerous age requires leadership from every American. Those with and without powerful megaphones. We are frightfully close to the brink of an unrecognizable America, where paralyzing rancor and division become the rule, not the exception. I choose to believe our institutions and people are stronger than anyone fever or mob, but we must find a way through this tired morass where every news cycle brings a new outrage, a new mob and a reboot of what came before.

Neither side is off the hook. We all do it, and we all must stop.

What will you do to foster civil discourse? Will you engage your neighbor and love him as a fellow American? Will you show loyalty to those you oppose politically because they are part of your American family?

Our enemies fear a united American front. Only we — the people — can strike that fear. Speak freely and embrace the speech of others. Wish not for our government’s failure, but for its success no matter who is in charge.

Don’t become part of the mob. Fight it, fiercely, and show loyalty to free speech and to each other. There is no other way for us to improve our national condition.

President Donald Trump’s dramatic announcement that he will meet North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un has stirred mixed feelings among conservatives who have previously expressed skepticism about engaging the murderous regime.

Rep. Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, summed up the fear and hope ahead of the meeting: “Remember, North Korean regimes have repeatedly used talks and empty promises to extract concessions and buy time. North Korea uses this to advance its nuclear and missile programs. We’ve got to break this cycle.”

The Trump administration says it has extracted two promises in exchange for talks: no missile tests before the summit, and a commitment to denuclearization.

North Korea has not conducted a missile test since Nov. 28, although it has irritated the United State by sending supplies to Syria that “could be used in the production of chemical weapons” and testing a reactor that could be used to produce nuclear weapons.

More columns from Scott Jennings

►School shootings should lead to soul searching across the nation about guns

►Democrats look like they're squandering chance to make gains in Congress

►Kentucky’s acting speaker followed path of hard work, disappointments

These new revelations about North Korean activity beyond its frequent missile tests, which once riled President Trump so that he warned North Korea it would face “fire and fury like the world has never seen,” raise the specter that Kim has no intention of denuclearizing or of being a better world actor. Recall that in 2005, under the leadership of Kim’s father, North Korea promised denuclearization but later reneged.

But this time may be different because of Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign, which has clearly put the economic squeeze on Kim. Since Trump took over, the United States has “leveled some of its most significant and far-reaching sanctions … and has also succeeded in pressuring China to further isolate the regime,” according to CNN.

“The trucks coming from China have gone to almost none and it’s going to have a negative effect on North Korea’s economy in the coming months and years if the sanctions continue,” CNN’s Will Ripley said.

President Trump deserves enormous credit for ratcheting up sanctions and rallying the international community. How can you blame him for wanting to try something different by engaging in direct talks? After all, the last quarter century of U.S. policy delivered nothing but a North Korea with nuclear weapons. Perhaps it is time for a new approach, something Trump promised during his campaign.

There is risk in what the president is doing. Certainly, Kim may simply be stalling while he puts the finishing touches on his nuclear arsenal. He may also believe, now that he has nuclear weapons, the civilized world doesn’t have the fortitude to attack. On his way out the door, Trump’s now-excommunicated strategist Steve Bannon told a reporter that there was no “military solution” to this problem, a remark surely heard in Pyongyang.

Bannon’s statement was a stunning strategic error and he was fired just three days later. The Trump administration must clearly communicate that we are ready, willing and able to attack if necessary.

It is vital for Kim to understand that there only two roads out of this summit: denuclearize, cease human rights abuses and become part of the international community; or face military and economic devastation at the hands of a fully committed international coalition.

For now, conservatives — even the most hawkish — should give President Trump credit for trying to break the logjam. How many nights in the last year did we wonder whether nuclear war was imminent? Too many, and thanks to the Trump administration’s efforts the tension seems to be reduced, at least for now.

But we should not be Pollyanna. Now that they have nuclear weapons, something the North Koreans have desired since the 1950s, will Kim really give them up so easily? In their eyes, achieving nuclear status means nothing short of regime survival. Of course, with sanctions drying up supplies to an already starving nation, Trump may have changed the definition of “survival.”

Trump’s critics have derided the inexperienced commander-in-chief for making a rash decision to meet, but they forget that Kim has never met another world leader and hasn’t been out of his country since taking over in 2011. True, the meeting provides Kim a status he has long craved, but his negotiating position been severely weakened by Trump’s sanctions.

Best case scenario – Trump shows the same resolve and fortitude in person that he has shown from afar, and Kim leaves understanding that the passive posture of previous American presidents has given way to a tougher commander-in-chief who absolutely will not allow nuclear weapons to be aimed at the United States by an unstable dictator.

Ours is an era in which the dam can break quickly. Information rockets around the world almost as fast as events unfold.

Motivated people, armed with information dissemination tools the likes of which the world has never seen, can cause rapid change in public opinion.

Ask the high school kids from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School who have become celebrities with a cause in the wake of the tragic shooting that claimed 17 of their classmates and teachers. Their cause, broadly, is for the nation’s adults to protect them from murderous rampages.

Heretofore, the adults have failed them. New polling from CNN indicates higher support for gun control than any time since 1993. But what kind is difficult to foresee in a nation whose voters fiercely protect — as they should — their constitutional right to keep and bear arms.

Read this:Kentucky legislator: No regrets about my call for gun regulation after Parkland shooting

More:Marshall County sheriff: I am 'appalled' by conduct of deputy in Florida school shooting

Several of the mass shootings feature a common thread – human error. Last year, the man who shot up the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, should have never been able to purchase a gun. He had been discharged from the Air Force, which has admitted that it “did not relay the killer's court martial conviction for domestic assault to civilian law enforcement that could have prevented him purchasing the firearms used in the shooting.”

Adult human error led to 26 shooting deaths.

As for Parkland’s tragedy, former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer observed: “Were there any adults who didn’t fail? The FBI failed. Local police failed. The security officer failed. The people who set up the video feed failed. Seventeen lives never should have been lost.”

Ari is right. And this past weekend, Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel disgraced the victims further with his appearance on CNN, glibly resorting to an old saying better left for arguing sports or politics than for passing off any responsibility whatsoever for 17 dead kids. Sheriff Israel rubbed salt in a community’s wound that won’t heal for a long, long time. He ought to resign for his personal and departmental failures.

But what are the answers? President Donald Trump seems to have settled on arming teachers as the solution, arguing that concealing weapons with perhaps 20 percent of teachers would allow them to ""immediately fire back if a savage sicko came to a school with bad intentions.”

The president is answering the wrong question. Are we trying to win gun battles in school hallways, or to prevent school shootings from occurring in the first place?

More from Scott Jennings:Democrats look like they're squandering big chance to make gains in Congress

The latter is what we really want. Anyone not trained for chaotic live-fire situations, like police officers and military members, would likely fail if plunged unexpectedly into a gun battle. I spoke to James Gagliano, who has over 25 years’ experience as an FBI agent. He agrees that arming teachers isn’t the right cure for protecting schools, and pointed out that in high-stress situations, even well-trained New York City Police Department officers once landed just 17 percent of their shots.

But the dam is breaking, and people want answers. Past reactions to mass shootings produced proposals that would not have stopped the events in question so they fell by the wayside. That’s the political part gun control advocates miss – Americans don’t want overreaching agendas, but rather common-sense solutions (i.e. the bipartisan bill signed by President George W. Bush after Virginia Tech).

This time around, four responsive ideas should pass as we debate the larger, philosophical issues of hardening schools and correcting our culture:

Ban bump stocks. This is an easy decision in the wake of the Las Vegas shooting, where the shooter used this loophole device on his semiautomatic weapon to kill 58 concert goers. Standardize the purchase age.Federal law requires a person to be 21 to purchase a handgun, but several states allow rifles like the AR-15 to be purchased at 18. If the law had said 21 across the board, the Florida shooter wouldn’t have obtained his weapon in a legal purchase. Improve background checks. Congress ought to move on Sen. John Cornyn’s bill to dramatically improve the haphazard system we use to check gun purchasers. No background check system will stop every killer, but there’s no reason not to do this. Adequately fund and strengthen mental health programming. Under federal law, people involuntarily committed for mental illness cannot buy guns. But the Florida shooter, who received some sort of mental health treatment, never entered the system. Stronger criteria for landing mental health patients on the “no buy” registry seems responsible.

These solutions wouldn’t cost one Republican member of Congress their seat come November and they in no way erode the Second Amendment. Best of all, they signal to our kids that they can trust us with their safety.

And, while we are at it, let’s have a national conversation about our culture and about a lost generation of young men who think nothing of throwing away their own life and the lives of others in violent rampages. No law or politician can cure a culture; this requires human intervention in our homes and communities.

The dam is breaking. Let’s not drown because of inaction.

Based on recent polling and misguided Democratic messaging, Republicans have seen an uptick in their political fortunes ahead of the 2018 midterm. Are the Democrats squandering what should be a banner year for the party out of power?

History tells us Democrats should win a huge number of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives this fall. Since the Civil War, Presidents have lost an average of 32 House seats and two Senate seats, with only two midterms (1934 and 2002) bucking the tide.

Democrats must net 24 seats in November to take the majority, and until recently conditions indicated an all-but-certain “blue wave.” But then something happened – Democrats began squandering their golden opportunity, just as they did in 2016.

It started with their messaging debacle over the tax cut, when Democratic leaders predicted everything from mass death to the end times if the Republicans prevailed. The GOP marshaled the votes and President Trump signed the tax cut into law.

More from this columnist:Opinion: Democrats' George W. Bush nostalgia smacks of political opportunism | Scott Jennings

Instead of the apocalypse, though, Americans got something else – money in their pockets. Over three million Americans received bonuses, and 90 percent of workers will see greater take-home pay as employers withhold smaller amounts from paychecks beginning this month.

Local news clips bear out worker glee. ""I have heard time and again that the middle class is getting crumbs, but I'll take it!"" Wayne Love, a managed care worker, told the Associated Press. He’s getting $200 more per month in his paycheck and regurgitated the descriptor Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi will come to regret: “crumbs.” Pelosi, unpopular as ever, will feature mightily in GOP advertising.

An accountant who deals with payroll systems tells me her phone is ringing off the hook with employees asking when their tax cut kicks in. Democrats told middle-class workers they would see a tax increase, and now look like fools for flat-out lying. Many of these workers live in suburban America, where Democrats must make gains with moderate and center-right voters.

More about Scott Jennings:Scott Jennings to talk tribalism, party system as spring fellow at Harvard Kennedy School

Democrats blew their credibility in the tax fight, weakening whatever anti-Trump arguments they make this fall. While they often claim the President is a liar, what do you call someone who promises you a new law will create ""The Walking Dead"" outside your window but in fact added some extra coin (real, not Bit) to your paycheck?

Not one Democrat voted for the tax cut, which makes for clean GOP messaging. The ads write themselves, and there is enough Pelosi footage from this meltdown to choke a horse.

Democrats will say this is irrelevant, that they have enthusiasm on their side. And there is no doubt that partisan Democrats are energized to vote. But the latest Washington Post/ABC News poll from mid-January, showing a generous 14-point Democratic advantage, offered this warning:

“The wide Democratic advantage in congressional vote preference comes entirely in districts the party already holds, raising questions about the extent of its possible gains in November.”

Translation – Democrats are replicating 2016 conditions by running up the score in blue (mostly urban) areas while failing to make inroads in Republican-controlled districts. If you are but moderately proficient in math you can see how this could prevent Democrats from taking the House.

But it gets worse:

“In Democratic districts independents favor the Democrat; in Republican districts, independents split evenly, 45-46 percent. Partisans on both sides, by contrast, stick nearly unanimously with their party.”

Democrats must win the independent voters in districts held by Republicans, which they are not presently doing. The poll shows that “at least some of the energy” exhibited by Democratic voters will “end up boosting incumbents” instead of beating Republicans. Hillary voters, madder than hornets but basically confined to the largest counties in America, can do nothing to flip GOP-held House seats everywhere else.

This survey was taken before Trump’s well-received State of the Union, before Democrats stupidly shut down the government over DACA, and before Friday’s economic news showing robust job growth and rising wages. More recent polling shows a shrinking generic ballot and an uptick in President Trump’s job approval rating.

Democrats point to wins in Virginia and Alabama as proof that people are chomping at the bit to send Trump a message, and argue that the president is still unpopular even if slightly improved. It is still early in the cycle, but a pall has settled over a broke Democratic National Committee where surely they are reaching for the Pepto-Bismol wondering: “Have we seen this movie before?”

268,Jennings,Scott,expansion,"Nota del editor: Scott Jennings es colaborador de CNN y fue asistente especial de George W. Bush en la presidencia de Estados Unidos. Es socio de la agencia RunSwitch Public Relations de Kentucky, EE. UU. Síguelo en Twitter como @ScottJenningsKY. Las opiniones expresadas en esta columna son exclusivas de su autor.

(CNN) — Cuando veo a la gente tratar de negar o de redimir al presidente de Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, por sus supuestos comentarios en una reunión bipartidista en el Despacho Oval para tratar la reforma inmigratoria, no puedo evitar pensar en si eso tiene importancia . Usualmente llamas a los bomberos cuando ves humo, no días después de que tu casa se incendió.

Este intento de arreglar las cosas parece una forma particularmente boba de tratar de dejar esto atrás. Está claro que Trump dijo algo como lo que se ha reportado. Esta distinción no hace ninguna diferencia y el que sus aliados sigan tratando de discutirlo lo perjudica aún más.

Los comentarios de Trump fueron viles y afectan a los intereses de los estadounidenses tanto dentro como fuera del país, particularmente en el continente africano, en donde son demasiado importantes como para que el presidente manifieste dichas opiniones. Trump sabe bien que tenemos soldados librando la guerra contra el terrorismo en varios países africanos y que estamos peleando con el gobierno chino por la influencia económica en la región (batalla que, de acuerdo con algunas personas, estamos perdiendo tras años de logros iniciados por George W. Bush y que Obama trató de mantener).

OPINIÓN: La advertencia seria que Obama le hizo a Trump

Insultar a África le resta valor al tiempo, a la energía y a los recursos que el gobierno estadounidense ha destinado para salvar millones de vidas y para crear un continente amigable para sus intereses. De igual forma, Trump es la única persona que puede convencer a las bases republicanas de aceptar cualquier compromiso que surja respecto a la reforma inmigratoria y al programa de Acción Diferida para los Llegados en la Infancia (DACA, por sus siglas en inglés).

Publicidad

Trump dijo estas cosas horribles en la segunda reunión bipartidista sobre la reforma inmigratoria que se llevó a cabo en la Casa Blanca a lo largo de una semana. La primera vez, lo hizo muy bien. ""Espero que lleguemos a una solución para la DACA"", dijo Trump en esa reunión cuando llamó a los negociadores del Congreso a aprobar ""una propuesta de amor"".

Claro que los detractores de Trump señalan que sus comentarios groseros y los tuits en los que afirma que los demócratas no quieren llegar a un acuerdo sobre la DACA son prueba de que la Casa Blanca está tratando de poner fin a las negociaciones. Desde que se dio a conocer la noticia de sus comentarios, los noticieros de televisión por cable han transmitido horas y horas de demócratas (y algunos republicanos y conservadores) diciendo que Trump es racista.

El domingo 14 de enero, María Cardona, una estratega demócrata, dijo a Ana Cabrera de CNN que Trump es racista, xenófobo y fanático, opinión que repitió en un artículo para el sitio web The Hill. Agregó que los demócratas tendrán que darle la vuelta a Trump y manifestó que confía en que los demócratas ""tendrán éxito pese a él, no gracias a él"" en la negociación de un acuerdo relativo a la DACA.

OPINIÓN: ¿Deben los demócratas negociar con Trump el muro fronterizo?

Si los comentarios de Cardona representan lo que piensan en su partido, ¿parece que los demócratas quieren negociar con Trump de buena fe? Podrías entender que cualquiera (incluido Trump) llegaría a la conclusión de que los demócratas en realidad no quieren un acuerdo si hubiera visto esa discusión en el panel de CNN.

Hasta el domingo por la noche, el mensaje de los analistas demócratas fue que Trump es racista y que deberíamos implementar leyes sin él. Igualmente contraproducentes son las maniobras como la de los diputados demócratas Jerrold Nadler y Cedric Richmond, quienes se comprometieron a presentar una propuesta de ley para censurar a Trump por sus comentarios.

Este argumento sería absurdo y contraproducente en cualquier negociación legislativa. A esos detractores les recomendaría que piensen en lo que el senador por Kentucky, Rand Paul, dijo en el programa Meet the Press este fin de semana: ""No puedes llegar a un acuerdo inmigratorio si todo el mundo anda llamando racista al presidente "". Tiene razón. Sin importar qué pienses de tu compañero de negociaciones, decir que alguien es racista es una de las mejores formas de frenar en seco las pláticas. Sin importar si crees que es racista o no, ¿vale la pena acabar con el acuerdo para los dreamers en aras de ser grandilocuente al usar esta palabra?

Lee: ""DACA está probablemente muerto"", dice Trump

La verdad es que casi todo el mundo quiere que haya un acuerdo sobre la DACA porque es lo correcto. En una encuesta que CNN llevó a cabo en diciembre se determinó que el 83% de los estadounidenses quiere que los dreamers se queden, incluido el 67% de los republicanos. Estos dreamers merecen certidumbre jurídica después de vivir en el limbo por muchos años a causa de un decreto dudoso que firmó Barack Obama. Trump no creó este decreto, pero ahora es parte del equipo que lo arreglará.

Esperemos que esta semana se imponga la cordura. A los senadores Tom Cotton y David Perdue les pido que dejen de teorizar sobre lo que Trump dijo. A los legisladores y a los analistas demócratas les pido que le bajen a la indignación y que sean más constructivos. Su intento por decir la palabra ""racista"" lo más posible en televisión tal vez les sirva para ganar puntos, pero está creando una atmósfera política tóxica.

Al presidente Trump le pido que siga organizando reuniones bipartidistas para llegar a una solución. Está a punto de resolver uno de los problemas más complicados de la política estadounidense: la reforma inmigratoria. Un triunfo que incluya una solución para los dreamers, el incremento de la seguridad fronteriza y la reforma a algunas de las partes más inoperantes de nuestro sistema inmigratorio será un legado del que no se arrepentirá. Mientras está en eso, por favor consulte con el general Kelly y con el secretario Mattis cuál es la importancia geopolítica de lo que estamos haciendo en África.

Necesitamos que Trump sea parte de la solución, que esté comprometido y listo para promover una solución legislativa para los dreamers. Que la gente esté enloqueciendo en televisión esta semana reduce las probabilidades de que eso pase.

Nov. 4, 2014 was a great night for some Republicans. But not for all.

Nationally, the GOP achieved its largest congressional majority since 1929. U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell realized his dream of becoming majority leader after thrashing Alison Grimes and guiding Senate Republicans to a net gain of nine seats.

But for David Osborne, that night remains a bad memory. The affable state representative from Prospect, who wakes up on a horse farm in Oldham County most mornings, had spent the previous year driving around Kentucky, recruiting and counseling candidates, aiming to wrest control of the Kentucky House. Osborne had never worked as hard at politics as he did in 2014, even serving as finance chairman of the Republican Party of Kentucky.

Despite his work, Republicans flopped. Democrats started and ended the cycle with a 54-seat majority.

“It was deflating. We had no idea why we didn’t win. We did everything right, raised money and hired pros like never before. Yet we failed,” Osborne recalled.

Not satisfied with losing, Osborne ran for a leadership position among House Republicans following the election. Many thought that Osborne, because of his hard work, was a lock for minority caucus chairman. The initial vote was a tie, and the next run through saw Osborne lose by one vote. Reeling from a second political gut punch, Osborne thought briefly about walking away.

“I did think about it, but not for long. I knew we had to keep going because Kentucky needs what the Republican Party has to offer in terms of responsible and conservative governing ideals. This state was on a course toward insolvency and I knew in my heart Republicans would eventually have to fix it,” Osborne said. He again worked overtime to elect a Republican majority in 2016, and this time the voters handed the GOP a monstrous win – 64 seats out of 100.

Osborne was not planning another run for leadership but reconsidered after Republicans won, deciding to seek the speaker pro tempore slot. This time his colleagues rewarded his work.

“I felt like I could bring something to a young, inexperienced majority trying to build it all from scratch. I thought because I had a few trips around the track under my belt I could play the mature, behind-the-scenes counselor while [former Speaker] Jeff Hoover and [Majority Leader] Jonathan Shell ran the show out front,” Osborne chuckled. “Every time I make a plan in politics something else happens, though.”

And that “something else” came in late 2017, when Hoover and three other House Republicans were revealed to have signed a private settlement with a former female legislative staffer. Hoover was sidelined and eventually resigned as speaker. Osborne, second-in-command according to the Kentucky Constitution, calmly took control, ordering an independent investigation while holding his fractured caucus together amidst the scandal and shocking suicide of Rep. Dan Johnson.

Lori Osborne, the new speaker’s wife of 21 years come Feb. 1, marveled at her husband’s handling of the bizarre circumstances.

“He’s very calm, thoughtful and deliberate. The adage of ‘measure twice, cut once’ is like his operating principle,” Lori Osborne said. “I believe that many of David’s best qualities have actually been intensified as the pressure increased. My dad once called him a ‘sterling’ individual, and I couldn’t have said it better. The power of that word really sticks with me when I think of David.”

For Kentucky’s new-if-unlikely speaker (the humble Osborne frequently reminds people that he’s the “acting” speaker), holding everyone together is key.

“I am determined not to let internal issues stop progress. Despite everything, caucus unity is good. Some personal relationships are strained but our people are united by policy and the overwhelming desire to deliver on our mandate to lead,” Osborne said. “People need to understand the severity of the pension crisis and the difficult nature of the coming budget. These problems were left to us, but we have to solve them.”

While the first two weeks of the General Assembly have seen little floor action beyond rules fights in the House, Osborne says that’s about to change.

“We’ve had bills moving through committee, and we have never stopped working for consensus on the pension problem. In the next few days I expect forward motion on Marsy’s Law, the budget, a pension bill and more,” Osborne said. “We have not stopped doing the people’s business, and on my watch, we never will.”

Someone you’ve probably never heard of has been in the news lately.

Bill Stepien, director of the White House Office of Political Affairs, finds himself and his operation under attack in the wake of Republican losses in Virginia and Alabama, and a series of polls showing Democrats with a wide generic ballot advantage ahead of the 2018 midterm elections. Media reports put Stepien arguing with Corey Lewandowski , President Trump’s former campaign manager, in the hallway outside the Oval Office after an airing of grievances in front of the president.

As they are wont to do, anonymous sources have savaged Stepien’s office, questioning whether it has the stature to help the president stave off a Democratic wave. Don’t mistake a low profile for a lack of skill. Stepien is a smart political operator, fully capable of synthesizing data and making solid recommendations to Chief of Staff John Kelly and Trump (as he did when he advised Trump to distance himself from Roy Moore in Alabama). The nattering nabobs, jealous types always, are likely people who want to be on the inside but aren’t.

If someone warns that Republicans will lose the midterms because they don’t think the White House political office is hefty enough, disregard their commentary. Anyone with actual knowledge of how this works would never say something so amateurish.

Because of the name of the office, many people believe that the Office of Political Affairs run campaigns. It does not. Stepien’s job is an official, taxpayer-funded slot designed to serve the president and his agenda, and facilitate the president’s role as titular head of his party. While Stepien’s outfit keeps close tabs on campaigns, the information collected is used to advise the president on how the political environment is impacting the Trump agenda, and to decide how Trump can best help.

We faced a similarly challenging dynamic in 2006 when I worked in Political Affairs for the George W. Bush White House. Our president had a low job approval, Democrats were motivated after losing a presidential election they thought they were going to win, Congress was unpopular, and the generic ballot stunk.

I hope this midterm ends better for Trump than it did for Bush 43, who saw Republican majorities wiped out in both chambers. The ensuing investigatory and policy paralysis was painful, a ridiculous circus inflicted upon a Republican president by unhinged, bloodthirsty liberal hacks. No matter what they say, Democratic congressional leaders won’t be able to stop their rank-and-file members from impeaching Trump if they take over the House.

I’d put both congressional chambers in the tossup column regarding control, with the Senate slightly more secure for Republicans than the House. This ought to scare the bejesus out of the president’s top advisers, as a loss in either chamber would grind the Trump presidency to a halt.

The White House political staff is already meeting with candidates and coordinating activities with the relevant political committees. And Stepien, who served on the Trump campaign, knows all too well the power of Trump’s digital assets that can be brought to bear. Expect that to be a major part of Trumpworld’s midterm engagement for candidates who support the president’s agenda.

There’s no sugarcoating it, Republicans are in for a rough election cycle. But the White House political director is prepared to play the hand he’s been dealt. The hand-wringers ought to give Stepien the chance to see it through.

Trump has reportedly said he wants to actively campaign in the midterm, but the cold political reality is that public engagement won’t be helpful in some places.

The president, facing similar numbers, should hit the fundraising circuit hard. While not as thrilling as a big rally, a photo line and speech to 500 donors can make an enormous difference. The average winning congressional campaign spends between $1.5 million and $2 million; a presidential fundraiser can wipe out a huge chunk of that budget in one night.

(CNN) —

Republicans are euphoric.

After years of talking about tax reform on the campaign trail, a bill that cuts taxes, simplifies the code, and primes the American economy for more growth has passed the House and the Senate and is on its way to the White House for President Donald Trump’s signature.

courtesy of Scott Jennings Scott Jennings

This achievement was years in the making for House Speaker Paul Ryan, solidifying his place in history as a policy wonk with the political skills to see through something as complicated as changing the US tax code. He found enough common ground for what is often a fractured group of his party members to deliver a win on what is perhaps the last unifying issue for Republicans of all stripes: the idea that taxes should be lower.

As for Mitch McConnell, he erased the Steve Bannon-fueled narrative that the majority Republican conference isn’t delivering for President Trump. Thanks to McConnell, Trump can claim victory on taxes and health care, as this bill achieves what some are calling a “stealth repeal” of Obamacare through the elimination of the individual mandate.

Given all the work McConnell has done on judges (12 circuits, one Supreme Court) and rolling back regulations, the Senate majority leader from Kentucky is playing Michelangelo to Trump’s Pope Julius II. The Sistine Chapel took a while, but when it was done — wow! Trump repaid the favor on Twitter, announcing he could not have had “a better or more talented partner” than McConnell. Steve Bannon is somewhere shaking his fist at a cloud, no doubt.

Some political observers point to public opposition to this tax plan as evidence that Republicans didn’t “win” anything at all. They are wrong. The Democrats lied more about this plan than the average person does on their online dating profile, locking arms and agreeing to spew falsehoods no matter how many were debunked.

But public opinion is based largely on polling, and polls can be deceiving, something Democrats know well. They also know, as Ryan pointed out, that paychecks are going up come February when they see the difference in withholdings.

Democrats have made fools of themselves with their unhinged talking points. Nancy Pelosi railed against the tax plan as “the worst bill in the history of the United States Congress.” Has she not heard of the Sedition Act of 1798, or the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850? She even called this tax bill “Armageddon.”

Former Clinton and Obama administration official Larry Summers took the derangement further, claiming that roughly 10,000 people will die each year because of this tax reform. Rep. John Yarmuth of Louisville tweeted that the bill is an “insult to our democracy.” Wouldn’t the real insult be for the party who won the last election to ignore its campaign promises?

Watching the Democrats talk in cursive, warning of the End Times, should tell us what we need to know about their ability to credibly weaponize taxes for the midterms. I used to think Democrats would fall back on the same old tired class warfare bologna, but seeing their new rhetorical arsenal makes me almost pity them as they try to rekindle any sort of relationship with middle America.",1,http://www.cnn.com/2017/12/20/opinions/long-awaited-tax-victory-for-gop-jennings-opinion/index.html

In the wee hours of July 28, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell took to the Senate floor after a long and disappointing day.

“I regret that our efforts were not enough,” McConnell said following the Senate’s failure to repeal and replace Obamacare. “It’s time to move on.”

Never one to navel gaze, McConnell was already plotting his next move – winning on tax reform, a pillar of the Republican campaign that swept the GOP to full control in Washington. McConnell isn’t a golfer, but he followed a rule that separates hackers from the pros – banish the last shot from your mind and prepare to hit the next one solid.

By Friday morning, the Obamacare repeal failure a distant memory, McConnell stood confidently in the fairway about to stick a pure six-iron into one of the toughest greens in Washington.

“We have the votes,” McConnell messaged me at 10:25 a.m.

More:Federal tax bills will hurt Louisville families, city's neighborhoods | Greg Fischer

Thursday’s tax reform tee shot hadn’t gone as planned, a procedural wrinkle briefly roiling the situation. But McConnell creatively scrambled, preserved the birdie chance, and tapped in the putt early Saturday morning. The veteran Kentucky lawmaker all but ensured that an actual golfer at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue will sign a piece of signature legislation by Christmas Day.

Not only did McConnell notch wins for Trump on corporate and middle-class tax cuts, but he erased a big part of Obamacare by repealing the individual mandate, considered a tax by the Supreme Court. Republicans wanted Obamacare gutted and that’s exactly what McConnell delivered.

While it seemed improbable a few weeks ago, congressional Republicans will end 2017 with an impressive roster of accomplishments. And Democrats are left with empty, outlandish rhetoric proving just how far left their party has lurched. Not one Democratic senator – even from deep red states – voted for a tax bill in which the middle class received the largest cut. Instead, they followed Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren down a dark, dishonest and liberal path that most of the country won’t accept.

After eight years of tepid growth under Barack Obama (he’s the only president never to have a full year of 3 percent growth), the economy is growing faster under Republican leadership and primed for more. The stock market jumped over 24,000 for the first time this week, the 4.1 percent unemployment rate is a 17-year low and growth has topped 3 percent for three straight quarters despite a series of hurricanes.

Trump correctly argues that his presidency has renewed confidence and enthusiasm in the American marketplace. Trump and McConnell have rolled back Obama’s anti-business regulations; saved the Supreme Court for a generation by confirming Neil Gorsuch; remade the lower courts at a blistering pace (nine circuit judges confirmed and three more coming this month, McConnell tells me); and delivered a 20 percent corporate tax rate that makes America competitive with the rest of the world.

McConnell has helped Trump build an economic policy firewall against any turbulence that may come from Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation. No matter what happens (dark clouds are forming), McConnell and Trump’s pro-growth policy show should keep consumer confidence humming.

“We were clearly underperforming, and you have to ask the question, why? It was a combination of over-regulation and a lousy tax code,” McConnell said.

The political challenge for Republicans is to connect voters’ increasingly good vibes on the economy to Trump’s leadership. Unfortunately for the president, his job approval in Gallup’s tracking fell to 33 percent on Friday, his lowest number yet, although his RealClearPolitics average is nearly 40 percent.

To bring Trump’s job approval into alignment with a cracking economy, Republicans should focus specifically and relentlessly on their policy wins during the 2018 midterm campaign and hope the president becomes disciplined enough to join them. McConnell, who conservative commentator Hugh Hewitt calls the “most competent and accomplished” Senate majority leader of his lifetime, has delivered the content for such a push.

“It was pretty clear during this debate we have a very different view of what America ought to look like. Our Democratic friends are quite content with slow growth and little opportunity to improve your condition. We think we need to jumpstart the economy and provide more jobs and more opportunity for the American people,” McConnell said, framing up the debate.

And that’s enough to make any conservative yell, “You the man!” the next time McConnell ascends the legislative tee box.

The Courier Journal Opinion

A convergence of electoral results, polling and unsettling allegations against a Republican Senate candidate should have conservatives worried about their party’s future. Nothing short of Democratic control of Congress and the success of Donald Trump’s presidency is at stake.

In Alabama, an accused pedophile is the Republican Party’s nominee for a U.S. Senate election on Dec. 12. Roy Moore's campaign was rocked last week by credible, well-sourced reporting that he sexually molested a 14-year-old girl in 1979 — and rocked again Monday by Beverly Young Nelson, who accused him at a press conference of trying to force her to have sex when she was 16.

Trump and other national GOP leaders preferred Sen. Luther Strange over Moore. But Moore, unfortunately, won the primary to replace Jeff Sessions and presidential intervention is required to save the Republican Party from one of two bad outcomes: Moore wins, plunging the Senate GOP into immediate turmoil; or Moore loses, reducing the Senate GOP to a one-vote majority after giving away a reliable seat.

More:Roy Moore scandal: Senate victory would be toxic for religious right

President Trump should intervene with the following plan: demand the Alabama Republican Party withdraw Moore’s name as a candidate, which it almost certainly would do if ordered by the White House; dispatch a still-popular Sessions to run a write-in candidacy; and campaign for and hope Sessions wins.

In that scenario, if a disqualified Moore receives the most votes, the election is voided and a new one is scheduled. It’s a no-lose plan for Trump, plus he can then choose a new attorney general that he doesn’t hate so much.

Trump has no relationship with Moore; he spoke to him for the first time on Sept. 27. There are no guarantees that Moore supports Trump’s agenda. Win or lose, Moore has already wrought horrible damage to the Republican — and therefore Trump’s — brand. Trump tosses people under the bus all the time for far less; ask Ed Gillespie, who found himself beneath the wheels minutes after losing the Virginia gubernatorial race last Tuesday.

Moore is embarrassing Trump, and the president should rid himself of this brand anvil. There are over 1 million Republicans in Alabama, and virtually any of them could be elected to the U.S. Senate. Can’t we pick one who isn’t accused of pedophilia, or of creepily hanging out at “high school football games and the mall” to pick up high school girls while in his 30s?

Snap polling conducted in the wake of the allegations show the race tied. Some pundits have suggested that Moore might yet recover his previous lead, as Alabamans would rather stick it to the establishment than trust The Washington Post.

But salvaging Moore’s candidacy doesn’t make it right, and President Trump can lead the Republican Party down a better path by using his political influence to prod the Alabama GOP to a good decision. It wasn’t that long ago that a Republican president (George W. Bush) forced a Senate majority leader (Trent Lott) out of his leadership position for making a dumb, insensitive remark at a 100-year-old man’s birthday party – a good template for today’s far worse situation.

Some have argued a presidential intervention would be hypocritical, as Trump himself has faced allegations of crude sexual behavior. But Trump was never accused of pedophilia, for goodness sakes. The Moore revelation drew comparisons to Trump’s Access Hollywood tape but, beyond their emerging in close proximity to a general election, the moments are quite dissimilar.

Licentiousness isn’t the same as pedophilia. If fear of hypocrisy is enough to paralyze a president (or any politician, for that matter), our entire political leadership might as well go into a soundproof bunker, never to be heard from again.

For Trump supporters reflexively jumping to Moore’s defense, please stop making stupid arguments. You are hurting the president.

These conditions no more disqualify Ms. Corfman from telling her story than do they a New York City businessman from ascending to the Oval Office.

Republican midterm prospects and Trump’s own re-election viability hang in the balance. Reuters released a survey this week showing, among other things, that 85 percent of Trump voters would do so again. Trump cannot afford to lose 15 percent of his 2016 take and expect to be re-elected.

After what happened in the Virginia suburbs last week, where a turnout surge propelled Democrats to a sweeping victory (albeit, as Kyle Kondik points out, among an electorate “hostile” to Trump), Republicans should think hard about what failing to shun Moore would signal to women and college-educated whites. Gillespie was certainly running uphill in a blue state, but exacerbating the GOP’s problems with suburban voters by dying on Moore’s Hill would be galactically stupid. It’s not worth it and puts GOP congressional majorities in danger. Only Hillary Clinton’s flawed candidacy saved the GOP from women voters in 2016, and she’s not running again.

While Democrats still have much to prove if they wish to turn today’s political atmospherics into a 2018 wave, Republicans may transform a tornado watch into a full-blown warning if they stick with candidates like Roy Moore. Trump can put a stop to it right now by zigging when everyone thinks he’s going to zag.

It’s never the wrong day to do the right thing.

I had a good chuckle this week watching Democrats and left-leaning media types fawning over former President George W. Bush.

Our 43rd commander-in-chief gave a serious speech about the state of American politics, rebuking a national ""discourse degraded by casual cruelty."" He warned that “bigotry seems emboldened,” a feeling many Americans have had since the neo-Nazi/white supremacy march in Charlottesville, Virginia.

President Bush said many things, all of them decent and civil. He was the same “W” as always, humble in demeanor and sincere in what he had to say. Some political orators give us soaring rhetoric but lack the underlying conviction that lets you know their words come from the heart. This has never been a problem for George W. Bush. He means everything he says and you know it, and he always makes those who served in his campaigns and administration proud.

Because Bush’s speech was immediately interpreted as a presidential censure of the current Oval Office occupant, Democratic pundits heaped praise upon Bush. Although Bush never mentioned President Donald Trump, the narrative set up immediately – Bush had warned the nation forcefully about “Trumpism” and its impact on our national unity.

If you were an alien who landed on planet Earth this week, you might get the impression that Bush’s presidency was transformative in its appeal to both parties, his views so widely respected that in the not-so-distant past the United States had undergone some sort of Golden Era of Politics. From 2000-2008, everyone agreed to be nice to each other because of the goodness and decency of a humble Texan.

As we know, however, nothing could be further from the truth.

Bush’s presidency began with an election dispute settled by the Supreme Court. His legitimacy was never truly accepted by Democrats, who later called him everything but a good milk cow. Some wanted to impeach him. They called him racist. They screamed “blood for oil,” which sounds even dumber now than it did then (and it sounded pretty dumb then, let me tell you).

Many wanted to throw Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney and anyone who worked for them in the jailhouse for war crimes and other made up stuff. Most defaulted to calling Bush “stupid” because, well, that’s what liberal elites think of people with a Texas accent.

The rhetoric of the American left during Bush 43’s term was hateful, devoid of connectivity to actual events. It degraded our politics as much as anything Trump tweets today.

The George W. Bush speaking to us last week in New York was consistent in disposition, policy and politics. He wants a United States engaged in the world, compassionate to those who seek her sanctuary and vigilant against foreign actors who wish us harm. Same old 43.

This newfound Bush nostalgia smacks not of legitimate respect but of political opportunism, the latest harbinger of the rising tribalism plaguing American politics. How shallow must your political beliefs be if you are willing to tout the words of a man you used to think was a stupid racist war criminal who should be in jail?

The left’s praise for old guard Republicans wasn’t confined to Bush. Arizona Sen. John McCain gave a similar speech in which he mocked “half-baked, spurious nationalism cooked up by people who would rather find scapegoats than solve problems.” Former Vice President Joe Biden even introduced him at the event!

Today, because he assails Trump’s worldview and occasionally votes against Trump’s agenda, McCain is a hero to the left. In 2008, while seeking the presidency, he was just a feeble old man who couldn’t even use e-mail, according to the Obama campaign.

Even Mitt Romney, the GOP’s 2012 nominee, earned praise from House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi last week. At an event hosted by the Los Angeles Times, she said: “Wouldn't it be nice if [Romney] were president of the United States?""

Pelosi, of course, worked hard to portray Romney as a dangerous Republican who hates women and minorities. The Democrats of 2012 called Romney a murderer and cast him as “extreme” on women’s health care because he was – gasp – pro-life. Oh, they even fabricated an attack claiming that Romney – the straightest arrow to ever run for president – cheated on his taxes.

But today, horrified by Trump, people like Pelosi want Romney in the White House? Spare me.

The flippancy with which Democrats treat their political rhetoric is astounding. Yesterday’s war criminals, invalids, tax cheats and murderers are today’s indispensable statesmen, not because of their principles and decency but because Democrats lost an election and still can’t figure out why.

Democrats have spoken of every Republican presidential contender since Bush the same as they speak of Trump, and now they are surprised that Republicans nominated and propelled someone like Trump to the presidency? Life imitates art, and you get what you deserve.

Cry wolf long enough and no one believes you when the wolf comes.

But don’t hold your breath waiting for them to own or understand it. People as lost and empty as today’s Democrats wouldn’t know shame or regret if Trump Tower landed on their head.

Story highlights Scott Jennings: The emergence of two new fronts in Trump's war on the Republican establishment endangers his ability to deliver on his campaign promises Trump needs Corker more than Corker needs him, Jennings writes

(CNN) —

The emergence of two new fronts in President Donald Trump’s war on the Republican establishment endangers his ability to deliver on his campaign promises.

Last weekend may prove to have been a pivotal moment in the Trump presidency. It might determine whether he succeeds in enacting his agenda – or if his presidency will simply be a series of reactions to weather emergencies and world crises.

Trump’s Twitter feud with Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker laid bare frustrations felt on both sides of the insider/outsider dynamic churning in Washington. For the Trump outsiders, the President’s tweets underscored their frustration with a lack of progress on health care and tax reform. For Washington’s GOP establishment insiders, Corker’s comments highlighted their exasperation with Trump – who they believe is sabotaging his own agenda and threatening national security.

Trump needs Corker more than Corker needs Trump, especially now that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman has announced his retirement. In fact, Trump needs all Senate Republicans (minus two) to enact tax reform, which was already on life support before the social media slap fight.

Add Corker to the list of Senate Republicans with whom the President seems at war. Susan Collins of Maine, John McCain of Arizona, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina beat him to it. Throw in Rand Paul of Kentucky who, though he appears to have a personal relationship with the President, “… really doesn’t help us on anything,” according to one senior administration official.

That makes six of 52 Senate Republicans whose relationship with the President (or disdain for his agenda) has endangered the GOP’s ability to keep its campaign promises.

Meanwhile, the President’s former top strategist – Steve Bannon – is now conducting his own “full assault on the Republican establishment,” according to NBC reporter Kristin Welker. He’s recruiting primary opponents for Republican incumbents, including those in six states: Arizona, Nevada, Nebraska, Utah, Wyoming, and Mississippi.

The six GOP incumbents who find themselves under pressure from Bannon must be wondering what they did to fall out of favor; this group has an average “Trump Score” voting record of 93.5%, according to Nate Silver’s tracking. They are voting the way Trump wants but will now face primary opponents who will argue they are insufficiently loyal to the President. All six of them voted for Trump’s Obamacare repeal legislation and are most likely solid votes on his tax reform plan, too.

Only Ted Cruz is getting a pass from Bannon, according to reports, which is curious since he actually votes with Trump less frequently than Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.

That’s 12 of 52 Republicans who find themselves in Trump World’s crosshairs in one way or another. And that doesn’t even count McConnell, who has voted with the President 96% of the time, led the charge on filling a Supreme Court vacancy, tried mightily to repeal Obamacare, and is now working feverishly to cobble together the votes on tax reform.

The President attacked McConnell this summer and apparently holds him responsible for the times when McCain, Collins, and others on Trump’s naughty list didn’t go along with his program. I suspect the President’s relationship with these wayward senators has more to do with their voting records than their relationships with McConnell.

These people are supposed to be one big happy Republican family, although some are distant cousins who have clearly never met and are now forced to sit next to each other at Thanksgiving dinner. To succeed in passing an agenda, this family must pull itself together sooner rather than later. Trump’s war on Corker and Bannon’s war on the establishment complicate matters even further.

Meanwhile, the average Republican voter, who cast a vote for sweeping change in 2016, must be thinking: “What the hell is going on here?”",1,http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/09/opinions/trump-war-with-gop-establishment-opinion-jennings/index.html

Grassroots Republicans have no idea how close the GOP is to another profoundly disappointing policy collapse in Washington: failing to enact tax reform. Once again, the Republican Party finds its ability to fulfill a longstanding campaign promise in the hands of three senators: Rand Paul of Kentucky, John McCain of Arizona and Susan Collins of Maine.

All three have, heretofore, been flies in President Trump’s ointment. Will they do it again on taxes?

The Republican tax reform plan is pro-worker and pro-growth. Before it can move, however, the Senate must take another vote that unlocks the door: passing a budget resolution. If all three flies descend and vote no on the budget, tax reform dies with it.

On Friday, Senate Budget Committee Chairman Mike Enzi of Wyoming released the GOP’s budget blueprint, which reduces federal spending by $5.1 trillion, provides a surplus of $197 billion over 10 years, and protects Social Security. As reported by Politico, passing the budget “sets up the special power of budget reconciliation GOP leaders can use to advance tax reform with just a 50-vote threshold in the Senate.”

In other words, Republicans can cut everyone’s taxes even if no Democrats want to.

If this were a baseball game, the budget vote is the set-up relief pitcher that needs to get the team through the eighth inning to make way for tax reform, the closer. And, as baseball fans know, the set-up man can sometimes blow it before the closer ever gets a chance. This is the predicament Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell finds himself in yet again — corralling 50 of 52 Republicans so Vice President Pence can break the tie.

Manager McConnell’s bullpen has been shaky this season, to say the least; there are rumblings that the same senators who tanked the most recent Obamacare repeal effort are not yet on board with the tax reform budget.

Paul has quizzically opposed or outright attacked Trump’s agenda on several fronts. In January, he voted against the budget resolution to repeal Obamacare, on which Trump and virtually every Republican campaigned. Paul and Trump have since clashed bitterly over Obamacare repeal policy and tactics.

Paul called the commander in chief’s decision to fire cruise missiles into Syria “inappropriate,” unconstitutional and not in our “national interest.” He voted against Trump’s debt ceiling deal that quickly moved billions in recovery money to victims of Hurricane Harvey. Paul even opposed the president’s nominees to lead our nation’s intelligence services.

While McConnell (who votes with Trump 96 percent of the time) toils to enact the Trump agenda, Paul (whose “Trump Score” is 87 percent), McCain (83 percent), and Collins (80 percent) have become real and present dangers to Trump’s ability to deliver on his promises.

It is easy to see why McCain and Collins are defecting. The Arizona warhorse has long cultivated and savored his reputation as a maverick (Bush 43 loyalists still smart over his opposition to W’s tax cuts in 2001 and 2003), and Trump has repeatedly insulted him. Collins, who has voted with Trump less than any Senate Republican, is the most liberal member of her conference and mulling a gubernatorial run back home. She’s predictably unreliable.

For Paul, a libertarian-conservative who has long advocated for simpler tax laws and lower rates, opposing the tax reform budget resolution would be truly dumbfounding. Trump is overwhelmingly popular in the Bluegrass State, where he scored 62.5 percent in the general election and even won the state’s primary caucus, a contest devised by Paul himself.

While Arizona and Maine were narrow wins for Trump and Clinton, respectively, Kentucky wasn’t close, and its voters expect their federal delegation to help the president succeed.

Even the usually recalcitrant House Freedom Caucus “has told leadership it will vote for the budget, even though they hardly love it, because they want to get moving on tax cuts,” according to reporting by Axios. For once, the so-called establishment and its tormentors are aligned on a mission critical issue. Paul should join them, even if the Senate budget isn’t exactly the way he would have written it.

There are good reasons to reform the tax code, not in the least of which is drastically simplifying a 10-million-word productivity-killing monstrosity. It costs the American economy 8.9 billion compliance man-hours and $400 billion annually, and restrains American businesses large and small from investing in workers and new jobs.

Reducing the corporate tax rate — now the highest in the developed world — will infuse money into small businesses, allowing them to pay higher wages. As policy analyst Adam Michel from the Heritage Foundation wrote: “Most of the recent economic research shows that workers actually pay a majority of the corporate income tax in the form of lower wages … U.S. labor bears more than 70 percent of the corporate income tax.”

A vote against the budget is, quite simply, a vote to stop Trump from achieving a longstanding Republican objective favored by 89 percent of Americans, per the latest Harvard-Harris poll. The political consequences of failure will come for the Republican congressional majority in the 2018 midterm and for Trump in 2020 before they come for Paul, who doesn’t appear on the ballot again until 2022.

But come they will, for all Republicans in Washington, if the flies continue to buzz around the president’s head.

On Friday, Senate Budget Committee Chairman Mike Enzi of Wyoming released the GOP’s budget blueprint, which reduces federal spending by $5.1 trillion, provides a surplus of $197 billion over 10 years, and protects Social Security. As reported by Politico, passing the budget “sets up the special power of budget reconciliation GOP leaders can use to advance tax reform with just a 50-vote threshold in the Senate.”

In other words, Republicans can cut everyone’s taxes even if no Democrats want to.

If this were a baseball game, the budget vote is the set-up relief pitcher that needs to get the team through the eighth inning to make way for tax reform, the closer. And, as baseball fans know, the set-up man can sometimes blow it before the closer ever gets a chance. This is the predicament Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell finds himself in yet again — corralling 50 of 52 Republicans so Vice President Pence can break the tie.

Manager McConnell’s bullpen has been shaky this season, to say the least; there are rumblings that the same senators who tanked the most recent Obamacare repeal effort are not yet on board with the tax reform budget.

Paul has quizzically opposed or outright attacked Trump’s agenda on several fronts. In January, he voted against the budget resolution to repeal Obamacare, on which Trump and virtually every Republican campaigned. Paul and Trump have since clashed bitterly over Obamacare repeal policy and tactics.

Paul called the commander in chief’s decision to fire cruise missiles into Syria “inappropriate,” unconstitutional and not in our “national interest.” He voted against Trump’s debt ceiling deal that quickly moved billions in recovery money to victims of Hurricane Harvey. Paul even opposed the president’s nominees to lead our nation’s intelligence services.

While McConnell (who votes with Trump 96% of the time) toils to enact the Trump agenda, Paul (whose “Trump Score” is 87%), McCain (83%), and Collins (80%) have become real and present dangers to Trump’s ability to deliver on his promises.

It is easy to see why McCain and Collins are defecting. The Arizona warhorse has long cultivated and savored his reputation as a maverick (Bush 43 loyalists still smart over his opposition to W’s tax cuts in 2001 and 2003), and Trump has repeatedly insulted him. Collins, who has voted with Trump less than any Senate Republican, is the most liberal member of her conference and mulling a gubernatorial run back home. She’s predictably unreliable.

For Paul, a libertarian-conservative who has long advocated for simpler tax laws and lower rates, opposing the tax reform budget resolution would be truly dumbfounding. Trump is overwhelmingly popular in the Bluegrass State, where he scored 62.5% in the general election and even won the state’s primary caucus, a contest devised by Paul himself.

While Arizona and Maine were narrow wins for Trump and Clinton, respectively, Kentucky wasn’t close, and its voters expect their federal delegation to help the president succeed.

Even the usually recalcitrant House Freedom Caucus “has told leadership it will vote for the budget, even though they hardly love it, because they want to get moving on tax cuts,” according to reporting by Axios. For once, the so-called establishment and its tormentors are aligned on a mission critical issue. Paul should join them, even if the Senate budget isn’t exactly the way he would have written it.

There are good reasons to reform the tax code, not in the least of which is drastically simplifying a 10-million-word productivity-killing monstrosity. It costs the American economy 8.9 billion compliance man-hours and $400 billion annually, and restrains American businesses large and small from investing in workers and new jobs.

Reducing the corporate tax rate — now the highest in the developed world — will infuse money into small businesses, allowing them to pay higher wages. As policy analyst Adam Michel from the Heritage Foundation wrote: “Most of the recent economic research shows that workers actually pay a majority of the corporate income tax in the form of lower wages … U.S. labor bears more than 70% of the corporate income tax.”

A vote against the budget is, quite simply, a vote to stop Trump from achieving a longstanding Republican objective favored by 89% of Americans, per the latest Harvard-Harris poll. The political consequences of failure will come for the Republican congressional majority in the 2018 midterm and for President Trump in 2020 before they come for Paul, who doesn’t appear on the ballot again until 2022.

But come they will, for all Republicans in Washington, if the flies continue to buzz around the president’s head.

Grassroots Republicans have no idea how close the GOP is to another profoundly disappointing policy collapse in Washington: failing to enact tax reform. Once again, the Republican Party finds its ability to fulfill a longstanding campaign promise in the hands of three senators: Rand Paul of Kentucky, John McCain of Arizona and Susan Collins of Maine.

All three have, heretofore, been flies in Trump’s ointment. Will they do it again on taxes?

The Republican tax reform plan is pro-worker and pro-growth. Before it can move, however, the Senate must take another vote that unlocks the door: passing a budget resolution. If all three flies descend and vote no on the budget, tax reform dies with it.

On Friday, Senate Budget Committee Chairman Mike Enzi of Wyoming released the GOP’s budget blueprint, which reduces federal spending by $5.1 trillion, provides a surplus of $197 billion over 10 years, and protects Social Security. As reported by Politico, passing the budget “sets up the special power of budget reconciliation GOP leaders can use to advance tax reform with just a 50-vote threshold in the Senate.”

In other words, Republicans can cut everyone’s taxes even if no Democrats want to.

Story highlights Scott Jennings: Democrats need to stop taking President Trump's bait for the sake of their party Polls show that most Americans agreed with him about NFL players kneeling during the National Anthem

Editor’s Note: Scott Jennings is a CNN contributor and former special assistant to President George W. Bush. He is a partner at RunSwitch Public Relations in Louisville, Kentucky. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.

(CNN) —

We’ve got enough data and anecdotes now to make an early call on whether President Donald Trump’s fight over NFL players kneeling during the National Anthem was a political winner for him. With a small and probably irrelevant caveat, it was.

Two national surveys with rigorous methodologies show Americans are opposed to kneeling during the National Anthem:

– A Fox News poll found 55% of Americans saying kneeling is inappropriate.

– The most recent CNN/SSRS poll of adults found 49% saying the players are doing the wrong thing, versus 43% who say they are doing the right thing. Almost one-quarter of American adults said they planned to personally boycott NFL games, broadcasts and products because of the protests.

Inside the CNN poll, Trump got what he wanted: More Republicans (87%) and Independents (48%) sided with him than not. Heck, even 21% of Democrats are with him on the NFL issue. Even 24% of people who disapprove of the job he’s doing overall see this issue his way.

(A bevy of other surveys of varying methodologies have also found clear majorities agreeing with Trump).

Anecdotally, anger over the protests continues to bubble. DirecTV, the satellite television provider with the Sunday Ticket NFL package, is offering refunds to fans offended by the protests. According to The Wall Street Journal: “A substantial number of cancellations risks further damage as the league tries to rebound in ratings. Viewership fell last year and continues to do so this year.”

The caveat on all of this is that the surveys also show people largely disagreeing with Trump’s call for kneeling players to be fired. But for Trump, that’s irrelevant. He wasn’t laying out an official policy pronouncement as much as he was channeling the gut-level feelings of the average voter eating breakfast at the Hardee’s in Dayton.

And don’t forget – a sizable portion of the American electorate would oppose any Donald Trump suggestion, whether he’s talking football or fried potatoes.

Calling for the players to be fired reminds me of Trump’s calls to “lock her up” during the 2016 presidential campaign. I’m sure some people thought he might actually jail Hillary Clinton should he win the election, but most folks saw the chant for what it was: hyperbole designed simply to channel public sentiment.

He wants his most liberal enemies in politics and media to take the bait on these cultural war asides, and they usually (and stupidly) oblige.

These battles illustrate why the Democratic Party has “lost favor among voters in rural and small-town America,” as legendary journalist Dan Balz reported last year. People don’t take kindly to not standing for the National Anthem in all the places Trump and the Republicans need to win in 2018 and 2020. Trump couldn’t care less if people in urban areas, where Republicans have no hope of competing anyway, are upset with his strident, colorfully communicated views.

Like a political magician with an endless bag of predictable-yet-entertaining tricks, Trump turned Democrats into the urban elite, anti-working man party in 2016.

In 2017, he has turned them into the anti-American flag party.

If Democrats don’t stop taking the bait on these things, for his next trick, Trump might just make them disappear in 2018 and 2020.",1,http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/29/opinions/trump-winner-in-nfl-fight-jennings-opinion/index.html

If you are upset about President Donald Trump’s position on NFL players who kneel during the national anthem – an opinion he colorfully expressed in a speech in Alabama and in a series of follow-up tweets – take a deep breath and listen.

There’s good reason to believe that public opinion is on his side.

Understanding this doesn’t mean that you are wrong or that your feelings are not valid; it just means that the President has again found a winning cultural issue with which to solidify his standing in Middle America.

Last September, Reuters conducted a survey in the wake of Colin Kaepernick’s “taking a knee” for the national anthem and found that, although a majority said he had a constitutionally protected right to protest, 72% of Americans thought his display was “unpatriotic,” and 61% disagreed with him doing it.

And that was a survey among all Americans. For President Trump, that survey last year may well have offered a clue. And the loud “boos” ringing in several NFL stadiums across the country this weekend lead me to believe it was one he read accurately – that many actual football fans lean toward the President’s feelings.

Another clue? As CNNMoney reports, Alejandro Villanueva’s jersey “just became the hottest buy in the NFL,” outselling all others. Who is Villanueva? The only Pittsburgh Steeler this weekend to emerge from the locker room and stand for the national anthem.

Players have a right to protest – clearly – and most conservatives I know don’t begrudge any American’s right to express a view under the First Amendment.

Speech, truly, is free, and every American is welcome to speak his or her mind.

What we are not free from, however, is the consequences of our speech. I don’t like people kneeling during the national anthem, but I respect their right to do it (even though it is likely to negatively impact the NFL, as it pits the league against many sports fans with opposing views).

A survey conducted this August by The Washington Post and UMASS Lowell found “the most common reason that fans reported for a decrease in interest in the NFL in recent years was not concussions or violence, but political issues. Of those who identified that reason, 17% pointed to protests during the national anthem by players such as Colin Kaepernick.”

I suspect these acts of free speech will negatively affect a league that some commentators have said is already in “decline.” As columnist Larry Stone wrote in the Seattle Times, “the NFL has major issues that seem to be converging at once to form a cesspool of negativity.”

I don’t like the idea of kneeling for political protest during the national anthem because it interrupts an important ritual that is uniquely American; we participate together in the anthem– at NFL stadiums, at Little League baseball games, at high school graduations and at any number of civic gatherings, no matter our geography. That ritual reminds us that we are all, as Americans, in this together.

It’s not surprising that a clear majority of Americans – according to the Reuters polling – have expressed a negative, visceral reaction to multimillionaire athletes disrespecting a patriotic national ritual in honor of the country that has given them the opportunity to make a living beyond the wildest dreams of 99.9% of the world’s inhabitants.

President Trump gets this: he has a gut-level instinct for cultural issues that cause mass liberal freak-out when he brings them up. Many people in Middle America agree with him on this issue, and this liberal elite freak-out makes it an even more effective tactic.

Such overreactions play right into Trump’s hands, further reinforcing to the Trump Tribe that they are right to be in full revolt against a nation whose culture dramatically lurched to the left during the Obama years. This is a key reason Democrats lost control of the politics of the Rust Belt in 2016.

Trump has routinely exploited this for political benefit.

The idea of respecting our national anthem, flag, and country’s patriotic traditions is baked into Americans’ civic education: they may believe people have a right to do otherwise, but they don’t have to like it when they see it. Many Americans – particularly those away from the media capitals of the east and west coasts – are basically right where Trump is on this issue, even if some are uncomfortable with the President’s colorful and strident language.

To be sure, race relations and tension between police and minority populations – the issues that had Kaepernick and others taking a knee – are among the most worrisome cultural problems we face in American society. They didn’t begin on President Trump’s watch; in fact, a CNN/ORC poll taken in the last months of Barack Obama’s presidency showed that most Americans believed racial tensions had already worsened during his tenure.

It is up to all of us to work together to ease these tensions and reduce the fear and violence that exists in too many American cities.

I suspect these protests – originally intended to draw attention to these problems – have now taken on a life well beyond that intention and could potentially have the opposite effect originally intended by Kaepernick.",1,http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/25/opinions/what-trumps-gut-knows-about-the-nfl-controversy-jennings/index.html

Story highlights Scott Jennings: Trump is making the right choices for the federal judiciary after the Obama-era made it too left-leaning Democrats' criticism of the President's conservative court nominees shows that they are out of touch with citizens who take their faith seriously, he writes

Editor’s Note: Scott Jennings is a CNN contributor and former special assistant to President George W. Bush. He is a partner at RunSwitch Public Relations in Louisville, Kentucky. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.

(CNN) —

Sitting atop the Frazier History Museum in downtown Louisville on Monday morning was the who’s who of Kentucky’s legal community, all gathered to witness the investiture of John Kenneth Bush, President Donald Trump’s latest appointee to the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

Overlooking the banks of the Ohio River, 6h Circuit Chief Judge R. Guy Cole, Jr. pointed out that the limited number of cases taken by the Supreme Court each year makes appointments to the circuit court – the level just below the high court – among the most important any president makes.

courtesy of Scott Jennings Scott Jennings

On that score, President Trump has hit home run after home run by appointing conservative lawyers to the various circuit court vacancies. In Bush, he found a highly qualified, Harvard-educated lawyer dedicated to the US Constitution and the nation’s founding principles (he even named his dogs after Founding Fathers). During his confirmation, liberals expressed outraged that Bush had once written that America’s two “greatest tragedies” were “slavery and abortion.” Imagine that – a pro-life, Republican president nominated a pro-life judge.

A few weeks before Bush was nominated, the 6th Circuit received from Trump another Kentuckian, Amul Thapar, previously appointed federal district judge by President George W. Bush. My advice: take Thapar in the first round of your fantasy future Supreme Court Justice draft. You won’t regret it. Thapar is a rock solid conservative judge whose name is on the lips of every Federalist Society member in Washington. He’s close to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and well-thought of by key White House lawyers.

Trump is driving liberals nuts with his circuit court nominations. Notre Dame law professor Amy Barrett, nominated by Trump for the 7th Circuit, was pilloried in a committee hearing by California Sen. Dianne Feinstein for being – gasp – a Catholic. Feinstein has come under criticism (including from the presidents of both Notre Dame and Princeton) since she had a melt down over Barrett’s faith, further exposing just how out-of-touch today’s Democratic Party is with Americans who still take their faith seriously.

I suspect Feinstein was just as worried about Barrett’s age and resume as she was her Catholicism. Barrett is in her mid 40s and counts a clerkship with the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia among her past jobs. She’s a strong conservative who will fill an important seat for a very long time. The same can be said of Michigan Supreme Court Justice Joan Larsen, who Trump nominated to yet another vacancy in the 6th Circuit.

Young, Scalia-trained additions to the federal bench have Democrats pulling their hair out.

President Trump has made 14 nominations for current or future circuit court vacancies, with three already confirmed (Kevin Newsom of Alabama, another strong conservative, was confirmed last month). Trump is outpacing President Barack Obama in circuit court confirmations and overall judicial nominations at this point in their presidencies. Sources in the White House tell me to expect more waves of conservative judicial nominations this fall.

While Trump faces trials and tribulations on other policy matters, he’s absolutely nailing his judicial appointments. Obama appointed about 40% of the federal judiciary by the time he left office, while Bush 43 appointed just over one-third of it. Obama’s appointees were, in many cases, extremely liberal, ideologically driven people who dragged their circuits drastically to the left. Presidents have enormous impact on the judiciary, especially if their party controls the Senate for some part of their term.

If President Trump’s first year in office is any indication, conservatives should be very happy with this reshaping of the federal bench, particularly at the appellate level. Undoing the damage done to the appellate courts by Obama is a key reason why Trump must do everything he can to maintain Republican control of the US Senate in the 2018 midterm election.

If Feinstein’s reaction to Barrett is any indication, Democrats would love nothing more than to shut down the Trump Train’s drop-offs at the federal courthouse.",1,http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/16/opinions/democrats-trump-circuit-court-nominees-opinion-jennings/index.html

It’s really amazing how far the political ball can bounce in a short period of time.

On Aug.22, President Donald Trump forcefully declared to his supporters at a rally in Arizona: “If we have to close down our government, we’re building that wall!” His legions roared, recalling the euphoria of Trump’s 2016 campaign rallies.

A scant 16 days later, President Trump found himself in the Oval Office taking a debt ceiling deal from Chuck Schumer that included no concessions on the wall, and serving as a stenographer for Nancy Pelosi, who wrote the president’s tweet reassuring ""Dreamers"" (children in the United States with parents who came illegally) they would not be deported under the president’s DACA decision.

As philosopher Clark Griswold once said, “If I woke up tomorrow with my head sewn to the carpet, I wouldn't be more surprised than I am right now.”

I was driving my son to a baseball game this weekend and wound up behind a pickup truck featuring a “Fire Nancy Pelosi” bumper sticker. It was a bit faded, leftover from years of successful Republican House campaigns that made Pelosi the villain. I have no doubt the driver voted for Trump last November; I wondered how he felt about the turn of events in Washington.

The reality is he may not care all that much. The latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found 98 percent of Trump primary voters approve of his job as president.

Why do people who for years bought into a political narrative that the so-called Republican establishment in Washington wasn’t conservative enough (too willing to give up on principles when pushed by Democrats) now fully and completely place their trust in a man whose happiest moment as president was generated by watching liberal media outlets fawn over his acquiescence to Schumer and Pelosi?

Because for them, the Trump presidency is not about fulfilling lifelong dreams of enacting conservative policy ideas (sorry Freedom Caucus). It’s about dragging our politically correct culture back from the left and generating movement. Any movement will do, so long as we banish the stagnation that has plagued Washington.

They’ve been watching the same show for years and are damn tired of it, ready to change the channel to just about anything else. And Trump is giving us a show unlike anything we’ve seen before, with enough twists and turns to satisfy a viewing public bored with stale characters and the same old plot lines.

After the president’s Charlottesville communications debacle, he has been on something of a winning streak. Trump’s hurricane response has drawn praise and his deal with Schumer and Pelosi, to take the glass half full view, cleared up some legislative space for Congress to hammer out tax reform. Trump’s decision on DACA, while causing some Republicans to squirm, was the right call and will hopefully bring certainty codified in U.S. law to people who deserve a sturdier legal status than Barack Obama’s constitutionally flimsy executive order. Trump picked the best of some bad options in a situation not of his making.

For conservatives who fear a new world order in which Trump governs the country like a maverick with Schumer and Pelosi serving as his Iceman and Goose, there’s no need to worry. The deal he cut last week – while irritating to some elements of the GOP – was simply the fastest way to deliver an initial tranche of recovery money to hurricane-ravaged Texas.

More:The lizard brain endangers democracy | Ben Carter

And it salved the ego of a president who, as one senior administration official put it, “just wanted to do something popular.” Tired of suffering one bad news cycle after another, Trump, like the agonized rich man desperate for but a single drop of water on his tongue, desperately wanted a few days of winning in the eyes of the media.

When the rubber hits the road on the president’s policy priorities – chiefly tax reform – the Democrats who supported this deal won’t touch Trump with a 10-foot poll.

Ultimately, for Trump to keep up the momentum of the last two weeks, he’ll need Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell, the Freedom Caucus and the rest of the Republican Party to support the deep tax cuts he desperately (and correctly) desires.

While the president feels good about his recent press, there is reason to worry about his political future. He needs to bolster — not badmouth — the Republican-led Congress facing re-election next year. If Trump’s immovable base takes its cues from their leader and sits out the midterm, it may lead to the terrible outcome of Democratic control. A president’s first midterm is historically bad enough, and there is growing concern that a wave of Republican retirements is coming in tough-to-hold districts.

If the Democrats take over, the president’s happy memories with Schumer and Pelosi will be long forgotten, replaced with subpoenas and Articles of Impeachment faster than you can say “hashtag resistance.” What awaits him under a Congress controlled by his frenemies Schumer and Pelosi will feel like getting sucked into the 10th level of hell.

And that’s a show in which no Republican president wants a starring role.

In today’s housing market, some realtors describe homes as “move-in ready.” Buyers find the paint, floors, windows and perhaps even some furniture in pristine condition.

Kentucky Republicans today are coming into a move-in ready political house, a previously shabby structure painstakingly renovated by a thoughtful former occupant. It hasn’t always been this nice, the old owner can assure you, but became that way after years of hard work.

But how many of us ever go below ground and check out the foundation when buying a home, especially if the living space is so immaculate?

Very few.

Bob Gable was honored on Thursday night as “the foundation of the modern day Republican Party” during a tribute dinner in Frankfort thrown by the Franklin County Republican Women’s Club.

►Lost generations, many with nothing to lose, threaten America

Gable’s long and storied career in politics has produced a roster of mentees who have gone on to prestigious careers.

“I would never have become chairman of the Republican National Committee without Bob,” Mike Duncan, of Inez, told a crowd of 100 Republicans gathered for the event.

Duncan, who as a youngster worked as Gable’s driver, credited him with laying “the foundation for the enduring two-party system in Kentucky through his financial management, grassroots programs and emphasis on electing members of the General Assembly.”

Working for a party suffering a crisis of confidence after Watergate, Gable himself ran for governor in 1975, memorably ringing a “truth bell” during a television appearance against eventual winner Julian Carroll. Gable brought the truth bell with him to last Thursday's dinner, ringing it several times from the podium to close the night.

But Gable’s attempts at public office are not his legacy; rather, it is his relentless focus and success in convincing others to run.

“So many of our current House members got their first phone call about running for office from Bob,” Kentucky House Speaker Jeff Hoover said. “When I was sworn in as Speaker I thought of Bob, who never wavered in his commitment to seeing a majority of Republicans elected to the state House.”

Gable, now 83, served as chairman of the Republican Party of Kentucky from 1986 through 1993, and in various other volunteer positions since. When he came to lead the party, it had one statewide official — Mitch McConnell, elected U.S. senator in 1984.

“During the dark times, Bob was always there, single-handedly keeping the doors open for business,” McConnell said.

According to Duncan, “the party had a net worth of $300 when Bob took over.” Hoover recalled the GOP had 36 out of 138 members of the General Assembly. But Gable steadily built the party’s finances and recruited talented operatives to serve in key positions.

One of them was Terry Carmack, a Western Kentucky native who found himself unemployed and considering exiting politics after President George H. W. Bush lost reelection in 1992. Carmack was to become chairman Gable’s executive director.

“We had no prospects of a Speaker or a Senate President. We had not elected a Republican governor since 1967. Somehow Bob convinced me that, despite the political realities, we could make progress for our party and therefore our state,” Carmack said. “He had a clear vision.”

That vision included Gable, an engineer by training, constructing a mathematical formula called ORVS — the Optimum Republican Voting Score. Gable’s formula saw past dismal voter registration numbers to find opportunities in legislative districts that would otherwise be overlooked.

“Gable is the unsung hero of the House Republican majority,” said former Kentucky GOP Chair Ellen Williams, herself a former party staffer under Gable. “If Mitch McConnell is the architect of the modern-day Kentucky GOP, he built that house on a foundation laid by Bob Gable.”

More:Corrosive tribalism has taken root | Scott Jennings

Williams and Cathy Bell, the longtime treasurer of the Republican Party of Kentucky, said Gable’s creation in 1989 of a fundraising vehicle called “the legislative trust,” which enhanced the party’s ability to bank resources for candidates for the General Assembly, might be Gable’s most enduring legacy.

Gable considers Stearns, Kentucky, in McCreary County, his hometown. He was a coal operator there for many years before moving to Frankfort in 1968 to become commissioner of state parks for Gov. Louie Nunn. Jim Host, who served as master of ceremonies for the tribute, noted that he and Gable are the last two surviving cabinet officers for Nunn, sworn in as governor 50 years ago come December.

Gable told me his favorite campaigns were actually run in Tennessee, where he helped his friend Howard Baker become U.S. senator (and later majority leader). Gable moved to Knoxville on a couple of occasions to help Baker, who also served as chief of staff to President Ronald Reagan.

The always classy and good-natured Gable laughed along with a who’s who of Kentucky Republicans who told humorous political war stories throughout the evening. Emotion overtook him late when the University of Kentucky’s AcoUstiKats sang “Eternal Father Strong to Save,” the hymn of the U.S. Navy (of which Gable is a veteran). Gable sang along, teared up, and finally snapped a firm salute during the troupe’s rousing rendition of “Anchors Away.”

The Republican Party of Kentucky is long removed from the “dark days” of Democratic supremacy, approaching registration parity while dominating offices in Frankfort and Washington. Indeed, any Kentucky Republican running these days enters a political house that is move-in ready.

If they take the time to check out the foundation of their political home, they’ll find a name etched in the cornerstone: Bob Gable.

There’s something bugging me about the Charlottesville white supremacists: why weren’t these guys wearing masks?

Thousands of people with views repugnant to most of us felt no compunction about marching through the Virginia countryside, spewing hatefulness and flashing Nazi salutes like the enraptured crowds you see on a History Channel documentary.

How did they come to believe that starring in this evil public drama was of personal benefit? Either they believe they will face no consequences in their daily lives for being identified as a white supremacist, or they feel they have nothing to lose.

I tend to believe the latter explains most (but not all) of them. While some of the white supremacists may have careers and families, my guess is that most are lost souls – no stable job, no spouse, no children, and no better future on the horizon.

Some, of course, are true believers. A white supremacist leader interviewed by Vice News for a documentary was remorseless after the fact: “I think that a lot more people are going to die before we’re done here, frankly.”

Simply chilling.

At least one marcher had a job and lost it. Cole White, a hot dog restaurant worker from Berkley, California, resigned after being confronted about his attendance by his employer. Not to denigrate working at a hot dog stand, but his career prospects clearly weren’t enough to cause White to obscure his face while marching around with neo-Nazis.

My guess is that most rallygoers are part of “a lost generation of men, enraged and adrift,” as described by Derek Thompson in The Atlantic. His excellent piece titled,“What Are Young Non-Working Men Doing?” (written last summer) perhaps found a partial answer in Charlottesville.

More from Jennings:Make Jefferson Davis site a memorial to Civil War, not the man

Thompson’s piece is startling, reporting that young men without college degrees are dropping out of the labor force at a higher rate than any other group, and that “nine percent of Americans between 20 and 24 are neither in school, work, or training.”

Other research finds young males increasingly living with their parents, finding happiness playing video games but nowhere else. They are not building skills, careers, families, or lives. They simply exist, achieving, owning, and producing nothing.

Layer on top the simultaneous explosion in opioid addiction and the forecast for so many young lives dims further.

From Ricky Jones:'I write about race because...We are not your slaves!'

“In Appalachia, there was definitely a pill culture that overtook the whole region,” said Van Ingram, who directs Kentucky's Office of Drug Control Policy, to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. “We’ve lost a generation, really, to this disease.”

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a study in March finding “the sharpest increase in heroin use and addiction was among young, white men with lower education and income levels.” The study said that “men ages 25 to 44 accounted for the highest heroin-related death rate (13.2 per 100,000) in 2015 — a 22 percent rise from the previous year,” according to a write-up in The Washington Post.

Finding a way out of the wilderness for a lost generation of young American males is one of the most consequential public policy challenges of our time. Not all of them are addicted to opioids, and not all of them are white supremacists. But enough carry one or both conditions to create fear about what these guys will be like as they grow older.

As Thompson writes in The Atlantic, shiftlessness “cuts them off from the same things that provide meaning in middle age, according to psychological and longitudinal studies — a career, a family, and a sense of accomplishment. The problem is that these 20-year-olds will eventually be 30-year-olds and 40-year-olds, and although young men who don’t go to college might appear happy now, those same satisfaction studies suggest that they will be much less happy in their 30s and 40s — less likely to get married, and more likely to be in poverty.”

Like so many societal problems there is no easy or short-term solution. U.S. Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska says we have a problem of “perpetual adolescence” in his new book ""The Vanishing American Adult.""

In Sasse’s reckoning, “we live at the richest time in the richest nation in all of human history, and so our kids have largely been insulated from necessity.” We have made it too easy for this lost generation to do nothing, to fail to grow up and take personal responsibility for what it means to be an American citizen.

But for the whole of American culture, the consequences are enormous. Lack of participation in our labor pool stifles growth. Failure to create strong families disintegrates communities. Addiction to opioids will kill hundreds of thousands over the next decade. The hateful ideology of white supremacy breeds violence in places like Charlottesville, where three poor souls lost their lives.

I don’t know to what extent these “lost” groups overlap on the American Venn diagram, but we have far too many young people falling into a dangerous pool of non-participation in societal norms. If our political leaders fail to recognize and act on this unholy convergence, America will never again be the same.

Story highlights Scott Jennings: Politicians wanting to stall policymaking until Trump improves But grinding policymaking to a halt fails to hold Trump accountable, he says

Editor’s Note: Scott Jennings is a CNN contributor and former special assistant to President George W. Bush. He is a partner at RunSwitch Public Relations in Louisville, Kentucky. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.

(CNN) —

I am no fan of President Donald Trump’s reaction to the Charlottesville violence, which left one woman dead and many others injured. I said so Saturday on CNN and then again Tuesday night, after he unraveled Monday’s wonderfully crafted statement in his press conference and reverted to his earlier misbegotten remarks.

But I am extremely concerned by the overreactions to his admittedly head-spinning response.

The first popular overreaction has come from some #neverTrump Republicans and goes something like this: “There’s no tax cut, no road project, no (regulatory) relief worth enacting to justify being silent while Trump’s actions emboldens hate, divides USA.”

That tweet, from my fellow CNN contributor (and veteran Republican strategist) John Weaver, echoes the sentiment of many anti-Trump liberals I’ve seen holding forth on TV. Essentially, the argument is that because Trump mishandled his response to Charlottesville (“shredding” decency, Weaver said) the Republican Party should hold him accountable by ceasing to pursue any and all core conservative objectives that make up the heart of the GOP policy agenda.

How does grinding policymaking to a halt hold Trump accountable? The public already hates Washington, in large part because of the glacial pace of policy progress. Bringing it to a dead stop would make it worse.

Fulfilling core policy promises is more important than ever if you care about political parties being built on ideas instead of personality cults. Republican congressional leaders cannot allow any one person, even a president, to derail a policy agenda that the nation’s voters clearly chose. Regardless of the President’s Charlottesville response, congressional Republicans have a mandate to act after sweeping to full control of Washington last November.

Republicans must forcefully remind the President that the GOP is the party of Lincoln, Grant, Eisenhower and Reagan – men who freed the slaves, preserved and rebuilt the Union, led the world against Nazi oppression and wholeheartedly rejected racists who sought political quarter in the Republican Party.

And they were presidents who, as Grant put it, sought “the greatest good for the greatest number of citizens.” Today, that means forging ahead with our policy agenda while carrying Lincoln’s admonition firmly in our hearts: malice toward none and charity for all.

The Charlottesville coverage has also given rise to an idea that White House staffers and Cabinet secretaries must now resign in disgust. Writing an op-ed in The Washington Post, Lawrence Summers – a former Harvard president, economic adviser to President Barack Obama and treasury secretary for President Bill Clinton, said: “Those surrounding Trump would best to demonstrate to him the need to reset or resign by … withdrawing their cooperation and no longer lending their legitimacy to his disastrous presidency.”

In Summers’ estimation, the moral failure of Trump’s Charlottesville response would prompt him – were he currently serving in the White House – to resign, and should prompt others to do so now. The “dam will break,” Summers says, when the first official quits.

Mass resignation among high-ranking advisers and Senate-confirmed officials would be an enormously destabilizing event, plunging stock markets and signaling to the rest of the world that the US government is unstaffed and incapable at the highest levels. Is that in our national interest? I don’t think so.

While I would not quibble if an individual adviser or Cabinet secretary resigned because he or she could no longer pursue a specific policy agenda, that should be done independently and not as part of some surreptitiously organized administrative coup d’état.

As former White House chief of staff Andy Card once told me, “The time to resign from your White House position is when you no longer stand in awe of walking through these doors every day.” That’s a good standard, and I presume Mr. Summers was still awed by his responsibility to public service when he first heard of President Clinton’s moral shortcomings and chose to stick it out.

High officials take an oath when sworn in as White House commissioned officers or Senate-confirmed cabinet officials, not to an individual president but rather to our country and its Constitution.

If you dislike the occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, our Constitution sets forth a remedy for you – vote against him in the next election. Organizing mass resignations or demanding that Congress shut down all policymaking is not the American way.

By all means take your arguments to the people in the next campaign, but leave the Aaron Sorkin-ish political fantasies for the next Hollywood thriller.",1,http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/18/opinions/republicans-cant-let-trumps-charlottesville-response-derail-their-policy-agenda-jennings/index.html

Author’s note: I wrote this in the summer of 2015, in the aftermath of the horrific church shooting in Charlestown, South Carolina. During a prayer service, a white supremacist named Dylann Roof killed nine people. I do not believe in tearing down monuments, but I wonder whether their purpose and placement should be reconsidered as our nation struggles with racial tensions. It published July 7, 2015.

Our nation is engaged in a great history lesson, prompted by a savage act of violence that claimed the lives of nine African-Americans in South Carolina.

America is not a country filled with bystanders. From the wreckage of tragedy, we tend not to gawk but rather to act, compelled to make heartbreak mean something, to show the violence that their actions caused the opposite of what they intended.

The shooter wanted to spark a race war. In reality, he sparked a war on racism.

In South Carolina, the legislature overwhelmingly voted to open debate on removing the Confederate battle flag from the statehouse grounds, which they almost certainly will do this summer.

People in other states, equally horrified by the shooting, wish to stand up to the shooter’s worldview. In Frankfort, it is likely that the statue of Confederate President Jefferson Davis, a Kentuckian by birth, will be removed from the state capitol and sent to a museum.

I’m not a believer in forgetting history, but rather in using it to inform our future. Davis should come out of the state capitol rotunda because we want the schoolchildren passing through to look up at those statues and be inspired to do something great. Romanticizing the Confederacy — a condition that has plagued this state for far too long — is not something we wish to engender.

Professor James Loewen recently wrote in The Washington Post that “90,000 Kentuckians (fought) for the United States, while 35,000 fought for the Confederate States. Nevertheless, according to historian Thomas Clark, the state now has 72 Confederate monuments and only two Union ones.”

Kentucky’s Republican leadership — with a responsibility to uphold the legacy of the party of Lincoln — has led the way in calling for us to remove Davis from the rotunda. We have more to do because the state capital isn’t the only place where kids look up in wonder.

What to do about the Jefferson Davis Historic Site in Fairview, Kentucky, is an open question. Drive along U.S. Highway 68 in Todd County and you can’t miss the 351-foot obelisk and surrounding park marking the birthplace of Davis. The Commonwealth pays to maintain the park and staff the museum.

As a kid growing up in Western Kentucky, I drove past that obelisk many times. I don’t recall stopping, but I certainly knew it was a memorial to Jefferson Davis. The only other obelisk with which I was familiar was the one in Washington D.C. honoring our first president.

You can see how we might be giving school kids the wrong impression in Fairview.

I spent a recent Saturday in Springfield, Illinois, taking my 6-year-old son to see the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Museum. This year is the museum’s 10th anniversary, truly a magnificent walk through of Lincoln’s life and greatness. From the recreation of the storied Kentucky log cabin to that fateful night at Ford’s Theatre, the museum brings to life the greatest Kentuckian for every kid who visits.

My son is hooked. He was already a bit of a Lincoln buff before, able to recount details of Lincoln’s assassination and subsequent manhunt for John Wilkes Booth. In fact, he refused to have his picture taken with the sneering Booth figure that leans against the White House facade in the museum, forever icily staring at the Lincoln family which greets your entrance.

The museum display that struck my son most was the depiction of a slave auction showing a family being torn apart, adults led away in shackles and a child crying in horror. It made no sense to him that human beings could own each other.

As scary as it might have been, the scene gave us a chance to talk about why Lincoln is remembered as our greatest president. I hope our conversation serves as a foundation of understanding for him about Kentucky’s role in preserving the Union, and the governing ideal that all men are created equal.

As we explored Lincoln’s life together, I thought about the Davis monument I remembered seeing as a kid. And as we approached Lincoln’s tomb in Oak Ridge Cemetery, I looked up at the obelisk that sits atop the memorial, feeling proud to be a Kentuckians and a Republican.

Kentucky produced Lincoln and Davis and is home to the “tallest, poured in place concrete obelisk in the world,” according to the Kentucky state park website. It currently honors the lesser of the two men, but that should change.

As it did on the removal of the Davis statue, Kentucky’s Republican leadership should consider leading a movement to change the Davis memorial into one that comprehensively honors Kentucky’s unique role in the Civil War. We should repurpose this obelisk as the Kentucky Civil War Memorial and Museum, offering an educational tourist attraction where our Civil War history can be told in full.

This is a taxpayer funded monument. When kids ask parents why we have a 351-foot obelisk in the Western Kentucky countryside we should be able to talk about more than just Jefferson Davis, whose ideals represent our past, not our future.

I haven’t written much about polling this year. It used to be one of my favorite topics, but so much political news happens daily that I’ve wondered whether it is possible to field a poll right now (typically takes three to four nights) and have relevant data by the time you are done. But several polls caught my eye recently, so what the heck, let’s dive in!

• President Donald Trump’s approval rating is down a bit, but the bottom has not dropped out. Surveys show Trump has dropped since February and March when he was nearly even among those who approved versus disapproved. Today, the president has high 30’s approval among all adults, and somewhere between 41 and 44 percent approval among possible voters. He’s no worse off than where Bill Clinton found himself in 1993 about this time.

• Republicans are hanging with Trump, although warning signs have emerged. Trump won 90 percent of Republicans on Election Day, but for most of the campaign, he scored in the low 80’s among GOP poll respondents. As it was in 2016, Republicans have returned to the low 80’s in approving of Trump’s job performance, but that was before the Obamacare repeal plan went down. I’ve predicted an unhappy GOP base will arise if Republicans fail to keep their repeal-and-replace promise, but will they blame the president, the congress or both? Congressional Republicans stand on thinner ice than Trump.

Absent a serious escalation in the Russia investigation or a botching of some future crisis, I expect Republicans to largely stick with Trump because they support his agenda. One frame for last week — absent the noise — is that a Republican president announced a major jobs injection for the Midwest, described a serious crackdown on violent gangs and ended with the news that economic growth rapidly accelerated in the second quarter.

An NBC News poll showed that in counties that flipped from Obama 2012 to Trump 2016, or that surged more than 20 points from Romney 2012 to Trump 2016, voters approved of Trump’s handling of the economy by 51-40 percent margin (compared to 44-48 nationally). While Trump’s job approval in the “surge” counties (+16) is less than his margin of victory (+36), Trump country generally remains supportive.

• Democrats remain lost in the wilderness among Heartland voters. Writing for the National Journal, sharp analyst Josh Kraushaar laid it out: “But even after six months of shambolic Republican governance, Democrats are still viewed as an unacceptable alternative to many persuadable voters in middle America.” That analysis came from a new poll of “working-class white voters in pivotal districts that Democrats are targeting in the midterms…Republicans held a 10-point lead on the generic ballot (43-33 percent) among these blue-collar voters.”

If Trump is doing so poorly, why can’t Democrats capitalize outside their core urban strongholds? Simple – they remain far outside the mainstream on cultural issues and don’t seem to have better ideas on the economy.

Trump continues to put Democrats on defense on what many Trump country voters regard as common sense matters. Trump’s speech to the police officers last week stirred up controversy because of his comments on being rough with gang suspects, but I suspect the White House was just fine with liberals melting down while voters in middle America were thinking “damn straight.” We can debate whether Trump’s comments inflamed tensions between police officers and the citizenry—among the most worrisome civil problems in America today—but the politics of it works just fine in non-urban America.

The same can be said for his tweets communicating a ban on transgendered troops in the military, which set off a firestorm across cable news channels where even conservative commentators like me said the rollout should have been better handled.

Later that day, while cable television continued to focus on the ban, Trump announced 13,000 new manufacturing jobs in Wisconsin. Trump is a master of stoking two conversations in America and making them work to his advantage. While the political elite slammed Trump on claims of discrimination and poor government administration, conservative-leaning middle America was thinking: “That’s probably the right idea, and look at that new factory!”

The first six months of the Trump administration have produced some good economic news, spurred in part by a serious rollback of the Obama-era regulatory regime, even as the rest of his agenda remains derailed or yet to come. His poll standing will improve before the end of the year if he scores a major legislative accomplishment (tax reform?) and/or deftly handles a foreign policy crisis, such as reining in the increasingly intransigent despot in North Korea.

Ultimately, Democrats cannot rely on winning the midterms on the back of a low-polling Trump, as a majority of voters (51 percent) in the July ABC News-Washington Post poll said Trump is not a factor in their vote. The same survey found Republican voters were more motivated to vote than their Democratic counterparts.

While a president’s first midterm historically produces political pain for the party in power, I still favor Republicans to hold their congressional majority even if they lose a few seats.

319,Jennings,Scott,leoweekly,"There I stood, hunched over a fax machine in the back room of a warehouse in Jeffersontown in 2000. This press release needed sending to every newspaper in the Commonwealth before their printing deadlines!

I faxed. And faxed. And faxed. Our fax machine didn’t have broadcast capability, so each release was sent manually.

One.

At.

A.

Time.

And there are more newspapers in Kentucky than you know. (While this was a year 2000 campaign, that fax machine may have been used by Mitch McConnell to beat Harvey Sloan in 1990.)

Sometimes I laugh about this massive time suck, a memory from serving as political director and de facto press secretary for the Bush/Cheney presidential campaign in Kentucky in 2000. Sometimes I cry, because in subsequent campaigns we just emailed releases with the click of a mouse.

(I’ll pause here for the younger readers to Google “fax machine” and read the Wikipedia entry.)

Lost in the memories of all that button pushing, though, is why it was so important to get our message to the newspapers, large and small. Back in those days, if the news media didn’t carry your statement, your campaign didn’t have much of a way to get it to the voters outside of television and radio ads.

This relationship between campaigns and news outlets existed for decades, and it remained the same for politicians who won and then had to deliver messages from their official office. No matter where they went, they faced a news-media filter that would determine how and when the voting public saw their arguments.

These days, this relationship is shattered.

Politicians — at least the Republicans — no longer fully rely on media outlets to deliver their message. They can go straight to the voters through social media at any time of day, the old newspaper deadlines be damned. Second, the media is in the crapper when it comes to the public trusting what they report, diminishing their utility.

Why use them if people don’t believe them?

These conditions have created a tension beyond what has normally existed between politicians and the news outlets responsible for covering them. Sure, politicians (especially presidents) have always strongly disliked their assigned reporters, but it has never been like this before.

There is an open war between politicians and media, and a strong argument could be made that the politicians — to the delight of conservatives who have long detected institutionalized liberal bias among reporters — are winning.

‘Jujitsu the media’

Consider the following polling data from the Pew Research Center — 85 percent of Republicans are soured on the national news media, and 46 percent of Democrats don’t like it, either (versus 44 percent who do, meaning the media is underwater with both parties). James Freeman, writing for The Wall Street Journal, asked the question the other day: “Have Consumers Decided Most News Is Fake News?”

Enter Donald Trump, the president of the United States, and Matt Bevin, his herald, the governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, who won the year before Trump. Both employ media strategies on the forefront of this war — and both are succeeding.

Advertisement

Gov. Bevin’s war with The Louisville Courier-Journal (for which I write an opinion column once-every-three-weeks) has largely worked to his benefit. For any Republican who was unsure of Bevin when he took on Kentucky’s political establishment in 2015 and won, his feuding with The Courier-Journal is a consistent validator that he is one of us. If you attended a GOP Lincoln Day Dinner in Kentucky anytime in the last 25 years, you undoubtedly heard people talking about “what can be done about The Courier-Journal,” viewed for years as the bane of Republican existence. Bevin has finally answered the question — ignore and go around them.

Tack on Bevin’s aggressive use of Twitter and Facebook to talk to his supporters and their networks, and you have a Republican politician who will be remembered as an early adopter of an offensive strategy designed to jujitsu the media into something useful, as opposed to what it usually is for Republicans — something between a nuisance and a bought-and-paid-for bullhorn for the local Democratic Party.

Aiding Bevin is that his enemy has dwindling troops. The Frankfort press corps was once robust in people and resources; these days, media outlets invest in fewer reporters, making them outgunned against a relentless governor and his staff.

Part of Bevin’s strategy is to simply ignore outlets and reporters he considers hostile. In his view, dealing with them never yields a better outcome so why bother? This is a ruthlessly efficient assessment, one that a businessman would make before a politician. We can debate the ethics of it but not the logic.

The snubbed reporters (I use that term loosely for some of the most vociferous whiners) have taken to social media to complain about being ignored, which delights Bevin and his supporters. Bevin has decided he’s not going to take abuse from what he sees as snarky, arrogant bullies, and his people love it.

The media outlets feuding with Bevin are, for the first time in their existence, also fighting to be the most relevant information delivery devices for Kentucky’s information consumers. Bevin has realized he doesn’t need them to achieve his policy objectives and win reelection. I am not sure the media organizations have yet come to this realization.

Today’s information consumers demand a conversation with elected officials, a big reason social media has become a preferred medium for politicians (see: Bevin’s Facebook Live events). We live in a two-way communications world now, but traditional media remains one way. They tell you stuff, but people don’t think they listen.

Trump is swimming in a much bigger pond.

Media strategy alters candidate pool

The media outlets with which he quarrels are better resourced than Bevin’s, and they are not so easily ignored or vanquished. They have traditions of access far beyond what the Frankfort press corps had, although some of them (i.e. White House press briefings) are crumbling.

What Trump has, and what Bevin (and all politicians) wants, is a social media following that goes far beyond people who like politics. Trump’s use of the social media army collected through years of being a reality television star makes it a certainty that more celebrities will run for president. People are already pining for Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, star of squared circles and silver screens, to run in 2020 (Twitter following @The Rock: 11.5 million). Musician Kid Rock made news last week teasing a possible run for the U.S. Senate in Michigan.

We live in an era where potential candidates will be judged by what they offer in popular culture appeal as much as their views on taxes and national security. This development will lead to more inexperienced elected officials, which has its pros and cons.

(Cautionary note: presidential elections have in many cases been an overreaction to the immediate past presidency. The cool internationalist Barack Obama was a reaction to the unworldly George W. Bush; the moral and dignified Bush 43 was a reaction to the debauched Bill Clinton; the smooth and firm Ronald Reagan was a reaction to the feckless Jimmy Carter; the swaggering and confident Trump was a reaction to the weak and dithering Obama; etc.)

Media faces two-front war

Trump is betting that his ability to speak directly to his base is a better use of time than courting a news media he views as hellbent on destroying his presidency. Same as Bevin with The Courier-Journal, Trump has decided there is no use in wasting time convincing The Washington Post and The New York Times that he is a good guy who deserves the benefit of the doubt. So he bypasses them through social media and the conservative Fox News channel, a Trump asset without a Kentucky-level analogue (I’ll bet you dollars to doughnuts, though, that Trump pays more attention to the intrepid Maggie Haberman at The New York Times than does Bevin to Tom Loftus at The Courier-Journal).

Time will tell if the news media can win its battle against Bevin and Trump, or with a free market that gives people more direct access to information than they’ve ever had. And for the two chief executives, they will get their report cards soon enough. Bevin looks to be in solid shape for reelection in 2019, while Trump has work to do on a dropping job approval (although Republicans are hanging in there with him, according to the latest polling). While the national news media has degraded Trump’s standing with relentless coverage of the Russia issue, Kentucky’s media outlets haven’t yet landed a glove on Bevin.

Media organizations must accept they are in a two-front war and regain trust among consumers. Bevin and Trump have written a template for other Republicans to follow at multiple levels. Expect their strategies to be replicated in future campaigns and administrations, especially if trust in the news media continues to dwindle.

Oh, why don’t Democrats do this, you ask? They can’t. They depend on the traditional news media to do their dirty work, trashing their Republican counterparts. Turning on the press now — treating them the way Republicans do — would be like cutting off your nose to spite your face. Whether they like it or not, Democrats are owned lock, stock, and barrel by a news media that fewer and fewer people trust with each passing day. •

I haven’t stopped scratching my head over this — why wasn’t Bill Maher fired?

Maher, the liberal host of HBO’s “Real Time,” did something that would, on the spot, get anyone else fired in 99.99 percent of American job sites. He nonchalantly, stupidly and outrageously used the “N-word” during a live broadcast while interviewing Nebraska Senator Ben Sasse about the up-and-comer’s new book.

Maher said during the interview, “I’ve got to get to Nebraska more.”

Sasse replied, “You’re welcome. We’d love to have you work in the fields with us.”

And then Maher hit Sasse with the unthinkable: “Work in the fields? Senator, I’m a house nigger.”

There is virtually no place in America where that flies as appropriate workplace banter, whether that place employs comedians and television commentators or not. The way the term so casually rolled off Maher’s tongue indicates an unsettling familiarity with the phrase. Simply calling it a “joke,” as Maher did seconds later over a groaning audience, doesn’t absolve him.

Many people took to the virtual streets demanding Maher’s ouster. The website ThinkProgress, a news hub for younger liberals, recounted all of Maher’s racially insensitive remarks over the years, calling him a “public racist for a long time.”

But Maher’s dismissal never came. He issued an apology and HBO delivered a statement calling Maher’s word choice “inexcusable.”

But Maher was excused, one week later finding himself back on the air completely unpunished. Did the HBO public relations department not Google “inexcusable” before hitting send on that statement? What happened was literally the opposite of inexcusable. During his comeback show, Maher couldn’t maintain the appearance of humility for even one hour, becoming “visibly frustrated” as rapper Ice Cube dressed him down.

Sadly, Maher is not the only member of a protected class of liberal elites permitted to make racially insensitive remarks without consequence. Former Vice President Joe Biden oncecalled Jews “shylocks” and referred to the late Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore as “the wisest man in the Orient,” a term many people of Asian descent find offensive.

Those utterances happened in the same week! Biden, of course, was given a pass by his party and is now possibly exploring a 2020 presidential run.

Former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, is in the club, too. Following the 2008 presidential election, “journalists Mark Halperin and John Heilemann…quote Reid as saying privately that Obama, as a black candidate, could be successful thanks, in part, to his ‘light-skinned’ appearance and speaking patterns ‘with no Negro dialect, unless he wanted to have one.’""

Reid later apologized but held onto his leadership position and senate seat, because ¯\_(ツ)_/¯, as the kids say nowadays.

Reid made out better than fellow Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Mississippi, whose leadership position did not survive a toast he gave at former South Carolina Sen. Strom Thurmond’s 100th birthday party. At the 2002 feting of Thurmond, Lott said the United States “wouldn't have had all these problems over all these years” had Thurmond won the presidency in 1948, an election in which Thurmond ran on a segregationist platform. Despite a vigorous apology tour, Lott was forced out of the majority leader’s suite.

Lott’s toast at an elderly man’s birthday party was far less eyebrow-raising than what Reid would say about the nation’s first black president a few years later, but the Bush 43 White House and several prominent Republicans quickly abandoned Lott, sealing his fate.

And that was the difference. In Lott’s case, the Republican Party leadership decided he had to go. For Reid, the Democratic Party yawned the way it later would for Biden. The liberal elites, all too eager to paint Republicans as racists when it suits their politics, look the other way when it comes to their own.

Which brings me back to Maher. Why wasn’t he fired again? There are a few possible explanations. His show appears on a network that depends on paid subscribers instead of corporate advertisers, affording a layer of protection not enjoyed by hosts on broadcast networks or basic cable (ask Bill O’Reilly, formerly of Fox News, about those dynamics).

Without advertisers pressuring HBO to pull the show, the network need only worry about people canceling subscriptions. But let’s face it: that isn’t going to happen. Many liberals, no matter how outraged they claim to be, would rather keep watching Game of Thrones than send a message about Maher.

The more likely explanation is that the American liberal elite—particularly the older generation—has decided Maher is too important to the so-called “resistance” to banish him. Maher’s unique ability to carve up conservative politicians, in their minds, far outweighs the racist comments he makes.

Basically, members of the liberal elite really love forwarding YouTube clips of Maher to each other when he dumps on President Trump, so he gets a pass.

This nation continues to struggle with racial issues. Income inequality and educational disparities plague African-American communities all over the United States. But we have made progress as a society on stamping out casually verbalized racism, relegating the hurtful and hateful “N-word” to taboo status. The failure to punish Maher’s throwback stupidity is a setback, a prime opportunity to send a message of racial tolerance, unfortunately, sacrificed in the name of snarky liberal extremism.

321,Jennings,Scott,realclearpolitics,"For the last couple of years, I’ve had the honor of spending the Saturday morning of Memorial Day weekend at Zachary Taylor National Cemetery. My son, Everett, the Cub Scout, joins hundreds of other Scouts who, in a matter of minutes, sweep across the sacred field placing fourteen thousand American flags on the graves of resting heroes. It is a testament to how quickly things happen when people join in common purpose.

And that is the story of America, a nation founded by people of common purpose who didn’t always agree with each other but who understood one important thing – they were all in it together. As Benjamin Franklin put it just before signing the Declaration of Independence: ""We must, indeed, all hang together, or most assuredly we shall all hang separately.""

For Franklin and cohorts, failure to set aside regional or tribal differences would have resulted in death. And while today we face less dire consequences, the debilitating political fracture costing us our common purpose indeed threatens our national prospects. We appear to have forgotten that we, as Americans, are all in this together, a nation succumbing to an epidemic of mistrust.

We are all collectively charged with keeping alive the tree of liberty, so that each subsequent generation may enjoy its fruits. We are all collectively charged with honoring our Constitution and protecting the vibrancy of a culture where people are free to speak their minds and elect governments that reflect our national will.

That attitude seems far removed from the political unraveling witnessed each night on our television screens. The choke-slamming of a reporter by a congressional candidate in Montana (and the disgusting rush by some to justify it) was but the latest example of politics stretching us to the psychological breaking point. Frankly, it surprises me that there aren’t more Greg Gianforte-style snaps, especially in off-the-beaten-path campaigns that suddenly become the object of crushing money and media. Who expects to be dropped into a $20 million pressure cooker when they file their candidate papers in Montana?

This does not excuse his behavior nor his campaign’s laughable explanation of it. Far from it. But as we seek to understand where we are as a democracy it is important to explore the context in which Gianforte snapped, because it is the same political environment that led college liberals to riot and rampage in Berkeley and Middlebury.

These dramatic and unfortunate ""snappenings"" aren’t confined to one ideology. People are unraveling across the political spectrum.

That is not to say our nation cannot handle vigorous debate, the ridiculous creation of sanitized “safe spaces” on college campuses notwithstanding. America has always enjoyed and benefited from robust political discourse, raucous campaigns and a love of fighting each other to the rhetorical death. But when the final words have landed and the votes tallied, we have, heretofore, come together as Americans to respect the outcome. And we have usually, and collectively, harbored more respect than contempt for people who mustered the courage to thrust themselves into “the arena,” as President Teddy Roosevelt called it, even if they hold views different from our own.

The comradery of being Americans has long outweighed our personal disdain for a political opponent’s views. Have we lost this uniquely American trait? Is our politics “beyond broken,” as “Meet the Press"" host Chuck Todd tweeted?

It may be that collapsing trust in the institutions that create the boundaries of our democracy is breaking our politics, especially the declining trust we have in the media to tell us the truth. It is true that most members of the mainstream media live in an urban bubble, making it hard for them to understand non-urban America.

Conservatives, who tend to live in non-urban areas outside those bubbles, mistrust the media because they, with good reason, see evidence of an institutional bias against the candidates they prefer.

These groups, urban and rural, but Americans all, don’t understand each other and no longer trust each other. A corrosive tribalism has taken root. General James Mattis, now Secretary of Defense, was asked by The New Yorker “what worried him most in his new position.” His answer was haunting:

“The lack of political unity in America. The lack of a fundamental friendliness. It seems like an awful lot of people in America and around the world feel spiritually and personally alienated, whether it be from organized religion or from local community school districts or from their governments…If you lose any sense of being part of something bigger, then why should you care about your fellow man?”

The mothers, fathers, daughters, and sons who put up the Memorial Day flags reminded me that we are all in this together, just as the soldiers under the gravestones were as they waged our nation’s battles.

We should honor their sacrifice by remembering that no matter how personally enraged we are by politics, we are all in this together. We aren’t supposed to be a collection of tribes destined to mistrust, hate, or ignore each other. We are one tribe — an American tribe — fully capable of embracing debate and differences within while showing unified strength to the rest of the world.

323,Jennings,Scott,realclearpolitics,"The term “fake news” is here to stay. Popularized by President Trump, he uses it as a shield against news organizations he feels are being dishonest or overly critical.

Last week, Trump tweeted: “The Fake News media is officially out of control. They will do or say anything in order to get attention - never been a time like this!” And his re-election campaign is running television ads touting Trump’s record but arguing that “you wouldn’t know it from watching the news” as a huge “FAKE NEWS” graphic overlays the screen.

Jeff Mason, the president of the White House Correspondents' Association, had answered the president’s charges when he told his organization’s annual dinner last month, “We are not 'fake news.’ We are not failing news organizations. And we are not the enemy of the American people.”

The president and the press may be at war over this issue, but what does it mean to the average American? Is it possible for an everyday news consumer to conclude, even without the president’s prodding, that at least some news is fake?

Not only is it possible, it is clearly happening. Consider a recent case involving Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. (Disclaimer: While this won’t earn me any back slaps at the next meeting of the conservative establishment, I believe most journalists are honest people, working hard under difficult circumstances to present fair stories. And I am a fan of the Lexington Herald-Leader and most of its reporters, including those who work for parent company McClatchy. Over the years, the Herald-Leader has produced valuable journalism even as its editorial page skews dramatically to the left.) On April 25, a reporter named Curtis Tate of McClatchy published an article in the Herald-Leader with this opening: “Retired coal miners wearing camouflage shirts were an unmistakable, recurring sight Tuesday on Capitol Hill. Yet to Kentucky's senators, they may as well have blended in with the woodwork.”

The article was about 22,000 retired union miners and their spouses lobbying Congress for a permanent extension of health benefits, which had been temporarily extended in December. The piece left readers with the unmistakable impression that McConnell, the senior senator from a coal state, was ignoring constituents on the verge of losing their health coverage. There is no way to read the article and conclude anything else. Liberal sports and news commentator Matt Jones (well-known in the Bluegrass) took the story the way Tate intended, tweeting: “I am pretty tired of Mitch McConnell claiming he is ‘pro-coal’ and continuing to ignore KY coal miners' healthcare.”

Fast-forward six days to May 1. The congressional spending deal was done and the same newspaper—using reporter Bill Estep—published a story with this headline: “Unions praise McConnell for deal to fix health benefits of retired miners.”

You could forgive the average reader of the Herald-Leader for doing a double take, since the paper had told them less than a week prior that McConnell was ignoring the miners.

Who was right? The evidence strongly supports Estep. In December of last year, Cecil Roberts, president of the United Mine Workers of America, wrote an opinion piece for the Herald-Leader that included the following:

“I want to thank those who were responsible for this, including Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell … and I commend him for wanting to do more than just this four-month extension.”

Roberts held a press conference on April 26 at which he continued to praise McConnell:

“I want to do something … most people think I would never say. … I want to thank Majority Leader McConnell. … I am man enough to say that we appreciate the willingness to allow this legislation to move forward and be considered.” For years, the UMWA has worked to unseat the longtime lawmaker, spending heavily in vain from its coffers.

And on April 28, the UMWA’s official Twitter account tweeted at Tate and me (I had questioned Tate about this matter): “We did not feel ignored. [McConnell’s] staff met with us while he was on the floor.”

The evidence overwhelmingly indicates Estep had it right and Tate had it wrong. If one report was real, then the other was … fake. This episode animates a recent Morning Consult polling statistic: Just 29 percent of Americans trust the political news media to tell the truth.

Gallup, which has been tracking Americans’ trust in mass media since 1972, found in September of 2016 that “Americans' trust and confidence in the mass media ‘to report the news fully, accurately and fairly’ has dropped to its lowest level in Gallup polling history, with 32 percent saying they have a great deal or fair amount of trust in the media. This is down eight percentage points from last year.”

The results were even more stark when you look at them through a partisan lens. Gallup reported that “Republicans who say they have trust in the media has plummeted to 14 percent from 32 percent a year ago … easily the lowest confidence among Republicans in 20 years.”



For Tate’s part, he showed no remorse when presented with overwhelming, narrative-busting evidence. He even blocked me on Twitter when the UMWA weighed in. Remarkably, Tate was listed as a “contributor” to the Estep report, meaning he was forced to help write something that completely contradicted his prior work.

This happens at the national level, too: Reporters have frequently written things about Trump (i.e. the Martin Luther King bust incident and the New England Patriots photo debacle) that later required correction.

Trump is right – some “news” is, in fact, fake. And each new incident confirms and makes worse the aforementioned polling.

It is extremely dangerous for Americans to have such a low opinion of the news media. Trust will be slow to return if these kinds of incidents continue, causing average news consumers to wonder – did this really happen or not?",1,http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2017/05/09/fake_news_war_comes_to_kentucky_133832.html

If the 2016 election was arejection of incrementalism as asserted in this space last year, then Republicans should fear what will happen to their governing trifecta should they fail to repeal and replace Obamacare.

Failure is not an option in dealing with theKobayashi Maru brought on by Obamacare. Republicans must get this right not just because of their campaign promises, but because of the underlying fiscal problems Obamacare has wrought on the budgets of working families and state governments.

More:Here are the highlights of the House Republican changes on Thursday to Obamacare

Year after year since Obamacare’s implementation, consumers have seen massive increases in their monthly premiums (as high as 47 percent in Kentucky this year) anddeductibles. For individuals buying insurance through exchanges, average deductibles - what people pay out of pocket before insurance kicks in - are more than $6,000, while family plans carry deductibles of $12,393 under Obamacare’s bronze plans.

I know a young woman who recently had a baby. She and her employer share the cost of her health insurance. The baby is in good health but spent a precautionary couple of days in the neo-natal intensive care unit. Amazingly, her total bill for giving birth and the hospital stay wound up, nearly to the dollar, what her family’s deductible is for the year. What a coincidence.

When you add what she and her employer pay for “insurance” to what she paid out-of-pocket, she might have as well have had no insurance at all. She counts as someone with “coverage,” although that word for her meant nothing.

There are stories like this all over the country. These people vote, and they helped deliver full control of government to a political party that promised to do something about it. Failing them would be a political catastrophe.

More:Trump brings health care debate back to Kentucky

Many state governments are desperate for relief too. Obamacare dramatically expanded the number of people eligible for free health insurance under the Medicaid program, and, unsurprisingly, people signed up for it. It is amazing to watch Liberals celebrate the success of signing up so many people for something that is free and results in a government fine if you don’t. By that logic, why aren’t we celebrating the massively popular federal income tax filing program?

Kentucky’s chief executive, Gov. Matt Bevin,has estimated the Commonwealth will need $1.2 billion it does not have to pay for its Medicaid expansion over the next five years. Bevin, who is wrestling with other budgetary pressures such as Kentucky’sfailing public pension system, has said the Medicaid expansion is “unaffordable and harmful, threatening to eat up the state’s budget and undermine Kentucky’s ability to provide care for the poorest residents.”

More:Medicaid changes could affect diabetes care

Fortunately, the process to replace Obamacare with something that works is clear of the U.S. House of Representatives, where the GOP’s first attempt died in the clutches of the House Freedom Caucus. President Donald Trump’s leadership in Health Care 2.0 helped save the deal as he plucked off members one by one, gaining support from both moderates and conservatives.

Now there is work to be done in the Senate where the next deal will be brokered by Kentucky’s Sen. Mitch McConnell, the“indispensable dealmaker” who frequently solves Washington’s seemingly intractable conundrums.The Washington Post recently presented a picture of the budding relationship between Trump and McConnell, the majority leader, andPoliticoreports that Trump is prepared to “let McConnell do his thing on health care,” a more patient approach than the president took with House Republicans. This is wise strategy from President Trump, who is learning to operate in Washington faster than the political press gives him credit.

McConnell, who has promised to rip out Obamacare “root and branch,” has committed to giving this issueall the time required to get it right. The Senate will need to build a plan that allows states flexibility with Medicaid, something Gov. Bevinhas already requested in the form of a waiver from the federal government.

And it must respond to situations like theIowa patient whose care is costing one million dollars per month, personally accounting for 10 percent of what figures to be a 40 percent rate increase for all Iowa policyholders this year. This situation brings to life a staggering statistic:five percent of Americans spend 50 percent of all health care dollars, while about 50 percent of Americans spend virtually nothing.

Many Americans are paying more for insurance, rarely use it, and when they do the deductibles are so high it is meaningless. This is not politically sustainable, nor is it fair. The Republican plan to put the sickest Americans intohigh-risk pools will protect healthier insurance customers from these kinds of situations, as long as the pools are properly funded.

Republicans should ignore the mainstream media narrative that repealing Obamacare is going to cost them the House of Representatives in 2018, as recent polling reveals “that Republicans could be in better shape than conventional wisdom” suggests in the 25 most endangered GOP-held congressional districts, according to theWashington Examiner.

As one GOP spokesman said, ""Only in Washington could doing what you repeatedly promised be considered a bad idea.”

325,Jennings,Scott,realclearpolitics,"On Saturday President Trump will rally a huge crowd in Pennsylvania to mark his 100th day in office. The last 14 percent or so of his first 100 days was spent dealing with the interminable analysis of said period.

Trump’s communicators have gamely issued a list of accomplishments to deal with the media’s obsession, even as the president himself has Tweeted (correctly) that judging a presidency after 100 days is “ridiculous.” The White House staff has no choice but to play the dumb game, forced to waste valuable man hours dealing with this coverage instead of running the government.

(Trump’s 100-day rally is delicious revenge on the press; it comes on the same night as the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner, meaning some of the would-be revelers will have to work instead.)

But this back-and-forth over Trump’s 100 days made me wonder – why aren’t other government officials similarly judged? After all, we have a new Senate Democratic Leader in Chuck Schumer. What does his 100-day report card look like?

Come Saturday, Schumer will have actually been Democratic Leader for 117 days. He has much to show for it:

The confirmation of Neil Gorsuch will ripple throughout history. Schumer’s role in ensuring Neil Gorsuch as the replacement for the late Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court will be an enduring legacy. Schumer held most of his conference together in opposition to the nominee and delivered what proved to be a momentous legislative occurrence:

His decision to force a change to Senate rules was nothing less than inspired. By expanding on what The New York Times called a “precedent set by Democrats in 2013, when they had a Senate majority and used the nuclear option to eliminate some other types of filibusters,” Schumer has made it quite likely that President Trump’s next high court nominee will be even more conservative than Gorsuch, as that person, at the outset of the process, will need but a simple majority to earn confirmation. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley told a newspaper he expects another Supreme Court retirement “this summer.”

History will long remember Schumer for reshaping the Supreme Court for decades to come.

Exposing hypocrisy in the legislative branch. Schumer is always playing chess while others are playing checkers. Take as a prime example his decision to allow the Democratic conference to grandstand over the nomination of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos.

Schumer knew he could not prevent her confirmation to a Cabinet post that gets less attention than your average shoestring aglet. Nevertheless, he allowed Sens. Cory Booker and Elizabeth Warren, despite their previous support for school choice and vouchers, to hypocritically rail against DeVos on the Senate floor. Schumer’s work exposing legislative branch hypocrisy will hopefully dissuade future senators from embarrassing themselves the way Booker and Warren did.

It was a Machiavellian move, but one that was sorely needed. Bravo, Chuck.



Flipping the script on Democratic Party leadership. Schumer is no dummy when it comes to reading polls and he knows that being labeled a Democrat these days isn’t what it used to be. In fact, recent Gallup tracking of party identification found just 28 percent of Americans identify as Democrats, down 11 points since Barack Obama was elected president.

In a move that can only be described as savvy, Schumer, responding to this polling, has turned over representation of the party to Sen. Bernie Sanders, who by his own admission is not actually a Democrat. Sanders is traveling the country with national party chairman Tom Perez, holding rallies and doing media interviews in which they openly fight about what policies Democrats actually stand for. CNN charitably called the tour “bumpy.”

Schumer is nothing if not responsive. With 40 percent of registered voters in a recent Harvard-Harris poll saying the party has no leader, turning the thing over to people who aren’t actually Democrats is probably the right tactical move.

Revamped Democratic messaging machine. Following the 2016 presidential campaign, in which Democrats were shellacked in rural America, Schumer decided to rectify the problem by picking 72-year-old former Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear to provide the Democratic response to President Trump's speech to a joint session of Congress. Schumer, who definitely subscribes to the “all press is good press” theory of earned media, achieved the result he wanted.

""Not a lot of people of color sitting behind Steve Beshear,"" Tweeted Politico reporter John Bresnahan. “Not @KamalaHarris. Not @SenGillibrand. Not @JulianCastro. Not anyone who has a future in the actual #Dems party…amazing ineptitude…” Tweeted Louisville Courier-Journal reporter Philip Bailey, who was quoting MSNBC’s Steve Schmidt.

Not one to rest on his laurels, however, Schumer drew bipartisan attention for ordering members of his conference to pose for a picture next to a big sign that said: “Make American Sick Again.” Like Marty McFly’s ahead-of-its-time guitar solo in “Back to the Future,” Democrats ultimately weren’t quite ready for Schumer’s branding. As Congressman Beto O’Rourke of Texas said, “That sh-- doesn’t work.”

Even if Washington Democrats balked, their kids are going to love it someday.

Schumer has won awards for his new messaging tactics, twice earning the National Journal’s “Worst Day” trophy—once for crying, and once for holding a talkathon on the Senate floor opposite the college football national championship game. Ever the shrewd communicator, Schumer knows the best way to keep people from hating Democratic talking points is to use them when no one is watching.

While I am loath to admit it, Chuck Schumer has had a remarkable 117 days as the new Democratic leader of the U.S. Senate. Here’s to 11,117 more.",1,http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2017/04/28/the_first_117_days_of_chuck_schumer_133733.html

With President Trump’s 100th day in office coming at the end of April, media have already begun the timeless – and meaningless – process of dissecting how he is doing.

One hundred is an arbitrary deadline, born of our society’s enduring fascination with round numbers. Nonetheless, we persist in asking presidential candidates what their first 100 days would be like and then judging the winner at the same mark.

Our system of government gives the president enormous power to make things happen in his first 100 days (or in any 100-day period, for that matter). However, the chief executive’s ability to move swiftly runs smack into the big white glacier at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, where Congress is better judged in yearly increments.

Signing bills into law requires two branches of government; therefore, it isn’t exactly fair to blame the Trump Administration for a Republican-controlled Congress divided against itself. Though Trump lacks a signature legislative accomplishment in his first 100 days – ala Bush 43’s tax cut and Obama’s stimulus – it is not for lack of trying (see: Obamacare repeal).

Though not as sexy as repealing Obamacare, Trump has signed several meaningful pieces of legislation that thrilled different parts of his political base – a pro-life bill allowing states to strip money from Planned Parenthood; a bill repealing Obama-era anti-coal regulations; and a bill scrapping anti-gun rules signed by Obama.

These were core promises kept by Trump to conservative Republicans. And along the way, he nominated and saw confirmed Justice Neil Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court. You could do worse in a 100-day period. Heck, Trump has signed more than double the number of bills Obama did in his first 100 days.

But Trump has truly made his mark on foreign policy. He has forcefully reasserted American leadership on the world stage after an eight-year vacuum. He fulfilled a campaign pledge to “bomb the hell out of ISIS,”killing at least 94 of them using the “mother of all bombs.” He put Syria’s genocidal dictator, Bashar al-Assad, on notice by Tomahawking his air base after Assad viciously gassed his own people, including women and children. And Trump has dealt firmly with the lunatic despot Kim Jong Un by quite possibly “cyber-terminating” a North Korean missile test, according to plugged-in Washington D.C. news source Axios.

In the face of success on the international stage and some policy wins at home, the mainstream media is desperate to undermine a successful 100-day narrative for Trump. The press has settled on two storylines – flip-flops and White House staff infighting.

It is true that some of Trump’s decisions stand in contrast to statements he made during the campaign. But those who deride his “flip-flops” should remember that governing and campaigning are two different things and that Trump gets more policy latitude from voters because he has never held office before.

While campaigns focus on the promises of candidates, presidencies are more about reacting to circumstances than enacting plans in a static policy environment. Things change all the time, and a chief executive must be prepared to deal. Would we really want a president incapable of reacting to a rapidly changing world?

But in an attempt to split Trump from his political base, the press will continue to create stories about how his flip flops are costing him his most fervent supporters. And while you can always find a crank or two to quote in any article, the truth is that Trump’s base is as solid today as it was on Election Day.

Why? Because Donald Trump continues to have all the right enemies, and no flip-flops or stories of White House infighting are going to change that.

Trump’s base supporters are too busy living their lives to obsess over the outrage of the minute in Washington, D.C. They don’t follow 50 Beltway reporters on Twitter, hanging on their every snarky comment. They aren’t particularly concerned with which Trump advisors are up or down in the morning political tip sheets.

But they do follow politics closely enough to know that the press still hates Trump, as do the liberal political elites. As far as the average Trump supporter in Middle America is concerned, Trump must be doing just fine.

And to make matters better for Trump, his political opposition, the hapless Democrat Party, has taken their participation ribbon view of society to laughable lengths, celebrating their loss in a recent Kansas special election like they’d won the lottery. They continuously relitigate the sideshow issue of Trump’s tax returns (newsflash: this was settled by the Electoral College). And today’s battle whine? Mitch McConnell was mean to Elizabeth Warren in the hallway!

The policy news flying out Washington is head spinning, but Trump’s political enemies are the same old collection of media properties and out-of-touch liberals. That tells Trump’s core supporters all they need to know – that the antiestablishment president they sent to Washington is doing exactly what they asked him to do. In the first 100 days, Trump has turned Washington upside down, irritating all the right people along the way.

There aren’t enough Republicans in Washington to repeal Obamacare.

Think about that sentence. Following a stunning election that saw Republicans win the White House and both chambers of Congress, there simply aren’t enough of them to unravel a law that has driven up health insurance premiums dramatically (plans are going up as much as 47 percent in Kentucky), spiked deductibles to the point that having health coverage has become virtually meaningless for some policyholders, and threatens, in part, to push the federal debt to $30 trillion in about a decade.

All this and more notwithstanding, there aren’t enough Republicans in Washington to repeal Obamacare.

Friday’s policy debacle pulled back the curtain on a reality six years in the making – the U.S. House of Representatives now resembles a European-style parliamentary system in which no single party has enough members to govern outright.

There are at least three parties in the House – Democrats (193), led by Nancy Pelosi of California; traditional Republicans (201), led by Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin; and the Freedom Caucus (36), led by Mark Meadows of North Carolina. Presently, there are five vacancies meaning 216 votes are required to pass a law.

Even though Ryan won re-election as Speaker in January with all but one Republican supporting him, clearly neither he nor President Trump has control of the three dozen Freedom Caucus members who derailed the GOP’s Obamacare’s repeal-and-replace plan.

Despite winning the election under the Republican banner, Freedom Caucus members thought nothing of embarrassing a Republican president or of leaving in place a law universally despised by GOP voters. Repealing Obamacare was the single most important campaign promise made by the Republican Party for the last six years; failure to keep it could result in an “electoral bloodbath,” according to President Trump.

He’s not wrong — Republican voters will need to blame someone. GOP leaders will gamely attempt to blame Democrats, as President Trump has stated. But the blame lies with the Freedom Caucus. If not for their pledge to vote as a block, as reported by Politico, it is entirely plausible that Trump and Ryan could have convinced enough of them individually to pass the bill.

“Twenty-eight of the group's roughly three dozen members took the plunge” and agreed that they would vote together no matter what, according to the report. The Trump/Ryan plan was about 25 votes short, meaning the Freedom Caucus pledge to stick together — functioning as a third party in the House — defeated the bill.

Functionally, Freedom Caucus opposition to the Trump/Ryan plan was no different than Democrat Nancy Pelosi’s. While the Freedom Caucus entered a coalition with Republicans to elect Ryan the Speaker, it has now joined a coalition with Pelosi to stop the Republican Party from fulfilling a campaign promise.

What does this mean for the rest of Trump’s agenda?

For starters, his Legislative Affairs office must assume that plans for tax reform and infrastructure spending begin with no more than 201 votes (15 short of passage before vacancies are filled).

Where is Trump more likely to find additional votes? Among the emboldened Freedom Caucus, or perhaps the 12 Democrats who represent congressional districts won by Trump in 2016? Winning all 12 wouldn’t quite be enough, but it puts Trump a heck of a lot closer than he got on Friday. And with at least one Freedom Caucus member quitting the group over the health care fiasco, perhaps a few others can be had in future fights. While Democrats have little reason to work with Trump, the 12 who live in Trump districts may be as likely to sign on to a plan they helped shape as the Freedom Caucus members.

It might be wiser to negotiate with Democrats for the votes than with the Freedom Caucus, whose members proved they won’t take yes for an answer. President Trump must have felt like Lando Calrissian, the ""Star Wars"" character who, after making a deal with Darth Vader to keep the Empire out of his beloved Cloud City forever, eventually found Vader to be a less-than-trustworthy negotiating partner.

“I am altering the deal,” Vader intoned to an exasperated Calrissian in ""The Empire Strikes Back."" “Pray I don’t alter it any further.” Calrissian later grumbled: “This deal is getting worse all the time!”

Trump must now decide whether to strike back himself by recruiting and financially backing primary opponents for the Freedom Caucus members who stabbed him in the back. Many hail from rural areas where Trump remains quite popular, especially among GOP primary voters. One could imagine primary challengers pledging to stand with Trump instead of enabling Pelosi, as their opponent did. Trump, in fact, has already tweeted about it: “Democrats are smiling in D.C. that the Freedom Caucus, with the help of Club For Growth and Heritage, have saved Planned Parenthood & Ocare!”

Upending your life to run for Congress is no easy decision, but having presidential backing makes it much easier.

Lando Calrissian got his revenge by blowing up the second Death Star. Time will tell if Trump decides to annihilate the Freedom Caucus in similarly dramatic fashion.

Here’s a scenario: your political party has taken an electoral bath over the last three years and lost connectivity with non-urban voters, the people who stood with you for decades before abandoning ship over your unpopular policies and extremely liberal social views.

Your party leaders have two choices: do something constructive to rebuild and reconnect with voters, or devolve into tantrum-throwing children, hurling themselves kicking and screaming onto the floor of American political discourse.

This real-life scenario applies to Kentucky Democrats. They chose the latter, and they chose poorly.

The purpose of a political party is to win elections. In Anderson County, Kentucky, site of a recent liberal meltdown, the Democratic Party has been failing at this task. In 2014, U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell won 59 percent of the vote. In 2015, Gov. Matt Bevin won 55 percent. And in 2016, President Donald Trump won 62 percent while Sen. Rand Paul scored 57 percent.

In 2014, Republicans, for the first time in history, elected a majority on the Anderson County fiscal court, a County Judge-Executive, and a County Clerk. The GOP takeover of one of the Commonwealth’s old democratic strongholds is nearly complete.

On Feb. 21, Sen. McConnell headed to Lawrenceburg, the county seat, to speak to the monthly meeting of the local chamber of commerce, a collection of Anderson’s most engaged citizens. It is just the type of event that an active and engaged public servant like McConnell frequently attends.

This time was different. Several malcontents crashed the luncheon to protest and harangue McConnell. The Kentucky Democratic Party organized the fuming interlopers via social media.

This was to be a special day, as several students from the Anderson County school system were slated to attend. But the planned protest prompted school superintendent Sheila Mitchell to cancel the trip.

“I’m not certain what the children would be exposed to; what kind of language or accusations would be made. We wanted our children to have a positive, educational experience, but decided not to have them attend due to uncertainty,” Mitchell told The Anderson News.

Mitchell had good reason to worry, as the Kentucky Democratic Party’s foot soldiers aren’t the sort you want influencing your children. Here’s how the local paper reported it:

Disparaging remarks about Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s physical appearance and about his wife, Transportation Cabinet Secretary Elaine Chao, can be seen on a Facebook page hosted by the Kentucky Democratic Party calling for people to protest McConnell’s appearance here Tuesday.

The page includes a post from a person who claims his past actions would likely prevent him from getting into the event.

“Would love to attend. However, I’ve done everything short of threatening his life. He is such a vile and loathsome creature. I meditate on his demise by any means daily,” the man wrote.

A person replied, saying, “I’ll settle for him and wifey poo abdicating.”

That drew this response: “Well, I suppose that would be a little bit of satisfaction. I really would prefer him leaving earth altogether.”

The hateful bunch failed to throw the veteran politician off his game, however. McConnell took it all in stride, later remarking that protesting is as “American as apple pie.” Instead of allowing the demonstrators to ruin the children’s day, McConnell stopped at the school and met with the kids privately for an hour.

“It was very good,” superintendent Mitchell told the local paper afterward. “I was very impressed. He did a really good job speaking with the children. They asked him everything from coal and environmental issues … coal vs. natural gas, and if coal is still viable,” Mitchell said. “He responded to every question the children asked…”

McConnell brushes off these protesters because he knows exactly how their ridiculous act plays in the Anderson Counties of the world.

Breathlessly, some in the national political chattering class portray these protests as a liberal awakening that will lead to future electoral success. But which party gained ground in Anderson County the day McConnell visited? The GOP, whose standard bearer went out of his way to talk to the small business community and accommodate local school kids, or the Democrats, whose vulgarity and thinly-veiled death wishes disrupted an otherwise civil event?

If you are considering running for office as a Democrat in Kentucky in 2018, are you more or less likely to do so if it means defending the vulgar, profane, and unhinged? Signing up for that duty means fully owning a group of angry people who, after failing to elect Alison Grimes, Jack Conway, Jim Gray, and Hillary Clinton, have decided the best political strategy is to publicly wish for the death of those that beat them.

It will be hard to run a campaign hateful enough to satisfy this mob.

The protesters made demands of McConnell like “Do your job!” and “Listen to us!” Maybe the Kentucky Democratic Party should take that advice. One of their protesters, Rose Mudd Perkins of Georgetown, told a reporter: “I may start a new party. The Democrats have failed us. The national party and the state party.”

This is what rock bottom looks like. Ugly.

For a political party that preaches tolerance, tolerance, tolerance, Democrats lost connectivity with their principles over the last few weeks. The confirmation process of Betsy DeVos to become Secretary of Education proved they are anything but tolerant; rather, Democrats are shameless, hypocritical bullies intent on smearing anyone who dares disagree with their political masters at the teachers’ unions.

""I voted against the nomination of Betsy DeVos, a billionaire Republican donor, because she is the most incompetent Cabinet-level nominee I have ever seen,” said Democrat Senator Al Franken of Minnesota.

""[DeVos] is the least qualified nominee in a historically unqualified cabinet,” intoned Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer of New York.

“.@GOP proves it is not on the side of America's students & teachers,” tweeted Alison Grimes, Kentucky’s Secretary of State, before claiming in follow-up tweets that Republicans were committing “assault” on public education.

Can you feel the tolerance for opposing points of view oozing from these folks? No? Well, certainly you can feel the hypocrisy. Grimes is a product of Lexington Catholic High School, a private school that gave her a good enough education to send her on to Rhodes College in Memphis (private school), which gave her a good enough education to send her on to American University’s law school in Washington D.C. (private school).

Grimes impugned the character of various Republican senators in a series of follow-up tweets claiming that DeVos bought her confirmation through political donations. Shockingly, Grimes hasn’t gotten around to posting the contributions made by teachers’ unions to Democratic senators who voted against DeVos. (Grimes took thousands of dollars from teachers’ unions in her unsuccessful race against Senator Mitch McConnell in 2014).

For the anything-but-tolerant Democrats, DeVos committed the ultimate sin – she broke with obdurate teachers’ union bosses who demand that all children be trapped in public schools, even the failing ones. DeVos supports the concept of school choice, which allows parents to move their children out of failing public schools into alternatives that might offer a better education.

Independent research shows that school choice can deliver “highly statistically significant, educationally meaningful achievement gains” for students. Researchers Jay Greene, M. Danish Shakeel, and Kaitlin Anderson conducted a “meta-analysis of 19 ‘gold standard’ experimental evaluations of the test-score effects of private school choice programs, finding that ‘the clarity of the results from our statistical meta-analysis contrasts with the fog of dispute that often surrounds discussions of the effectiveness of private school choice.’”

In other words, school choice works.

But Democrats, ever quick to accuse Republicans of being anti-science on climate change, refuse to accept the science proving the value of school choice. Why? Because they are bought and paid for by teachers’ unions, which spent nearly $31 million on Democrat candidates in the 2016 cycle alone. In the 2014 cycle, the National Education Association, “the largest teachers union in the country,” spent more than $22 million on Democrat super PACs, according to the Washington Free Beacon. That’s more than the Koch Brothers spent on Super PAC’s during the same cycle.

Democrats who previously supported school choice were forced last week to use the Senate floor as an atonement chamber for their past transgressions. The most embarrassing abnegation came from Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, who pulled one of the most cynical moves in Senate history (no small feat) when he attacked DeVos for 45 minutes before voting against her.

This is the same Cory Booker who served with DeVos “on the board of Alliance for School Choice, which advocated using taxpayer dollars for charter, private and religious schools,” as reported by NJ.com. Back then Booker was Mayor of Newark, a town with failing public schools. Today, however, Booker needs teachers’ union money for his soon-to-be-launched presidential campaign.

To get it, the union bosses demanded a mea culpa in the form of a backstabbing and the brazen Booker gladly obliged. Booker once said of school choice opponents: “I cannot ever stand up and stand against a parent having options because I benefited from my parents having options. And when people tell me they’re against school choice, whether it’s the Opportunity Scholarship Act or charter schools, I look at them and say: ‘As soon as you’re telling me you’re willing to send your kid to a failing school in my city…then I’ll be with you.’”

His previous utterances notwithstanding, the craven Booker trampled DeVos’s good name. The unseemly episode makes you wonder who or what else Booker would sacrifice on the altar of presidential ambition.

Even Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is on the record supporting school vouchers, having once said: “Vouchers would relieve parents from the terrible choice of leaving their kids in lousy schools or bankrupting themselves.” She, too, voted against DeVos, another hypocritical log on the Democrat Party fire that has been burning since November.

A man named Barack Obama, who repeatedly called for increased civility in politics, said of last year’s election: “Tolerance is on the ballot.”

Little did we know how right the former president was.

Forget everything you’ve heard about a divided, polarized nation.

Forget the policy differences between Republicans and Democrats.

Forget the rancor of the political campaigns that produce our leaders.

Remember one thing — we live in the greatest nation the world has ever known. The peaceful transition of power witnessed last week portends the most valuable thing in politics — the promise of a new American presidency.

No other country holds within it the power to unleash the creativity of its people in the pursuit of improving the human condition. No other country has demonstrated, with some lapses, the commitment to human life and liberty the way the United States has since its founding.

And the security of no other nation is as important as that of the United States, the freedom of which stands as a functional and symbolic message to the world’s evildoers that they will not prevail.

President Trump is already making good on the promise of a new presidency. His inaugural address — derided as divisive by a mainstream media that still doesn’t get it — was a forceful call for national unity and patriotism, wrapped in the idea that a policy of America First is required after a period of globalization that benefited the world’s elites at the expense of America’s working people.

Some have criticized the way Trump has taken office. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer called Trump’s cabinet “a disaster,” and others have attacked Trump’s senior staff for one reason or another. Dozens of Democratic congressmen boycotted Trump’s inaugural, and one said Trump is not a “legitimate” president.

The mindlessly partisan criticism of Trump reminds us that some politicians remain conformists to the old politics that paralyzed our nation and led to November’s election results. Even Trump’s mention of serious American problems — shuttered factories, drugs, gangs — drew criticism from elites who couldn’t believe he had the audacity to inject realism into his address. Barack Obama spent eight years formulating soaring rhetoric that, while lacking realistic underpinnings, thrilled the Beltway elites. Trump’s audience, rather, is middle America, and they understand very clearly his inaugural message.

Like every president, some of Trump’s decisions will work out brilliantly and some will not. But for the critics who refuse to allow for the possibility of his success (shamefully rooting, therefore, against American success), they would do well to recall the words of John F. Kennedy, who said: “Conformity is the jailer of freedom and the enemy of growth.”

Trump is not conforming to old ways as he builds his government and formulates policy, but his supporters did not elect him to be a caretaker of the status quo. They expect an upending of the established order in Washington, D.C., a necessary political earthquake to get the attention of those who forgot the plight of working families. The people who pay their taxes and play by the rules wish not to be left behind any longer.

Those who root for the Trump administration’s failure have not learned the lesson of this election — that Americans are tired of being divided into niche special interest groups, pitted against one another and force-fed the idea that one person’s success must have come at the expense of another.

Indeed, this attitude will be wiped away by Trump and the Republican Congressional leadership. Redistribution of wealth is no longer the goal, but rather growth of the American economy that benefits all American workers.

Our national security demands a stronger economic condition. The threats we face will not abate because a new presidency has begun; in fact, it is likely we will face increased attacks from radical Islamic terrorists who wish to test the resolve of a new commander in chief.

As Trump faces these terrorist threats and wages war in all its modern forms against the enemies of freedom, his economic policies will ultimately strengthen our national security. Trump’s plans to change our taxation and regulatory regimes will unleash American growth and opportunity, which will in turn allow for the rebuilding of our military. If you value global stability, American military strength is non-negotiable.

It should be the fervent hope of all Americans — no matter your voting preference — that Trump fulfill the promise a new presidency holds. Our children’s future depends on his success, as does our national security.

I think of my oldest son, Everett, born just a couple of months after Obama took office in 2009. The Obama presidency took him through his first seven and a half years, and a Trump presidency could, if successful, carry him into high school. Like any parent, I wish for nothing more than for Everett to live in a safe place that provides him the freedom and opportunity to chase his dreams. I am sure Obama and Trump share that goal for their own children, and therein lies a fundamental tie that binds us all regardless of party.

Let us all pray for the new president, and the promise that lies over a new horizon.

The last major decision of President Barack Obama was to commute the sentence of a traitor whose most recent accomplishment since giving battlefield secrets to Osama bin Laden was undergoing a taxpayer-funded sex change transition. It was a fitting end to a failed presidency that leaves President-elect Donald Trump mess after mess to clean up on the world stage.

Let’s revisit the curious case of Chelsea Manning (born Bradley Edward Manning). He was court martialed in 2013, “three years after Manning was first detained in Iraq for suspicion of having leaked the video of a 2007 Apache helicopter attack that killed several Iraqi civilians. He was subsequently charged with the leak of 750,000 documents that were a mix of U.S. military battlefield reports from Iraq and Afghanistan and diplomatic cables,” according to ABC News.

This was no small leak — news outlets routinely describe Manning’s actions as the most “extensive” or “biggest” such breach of military secrets in American history. This person will forever be mentioned in the same breath as Benedict Arnold, John Walker, Robert Hanssen, Edward Snowden and Aldrich Ames.

Manning gave our military secrets to WikiLeaks, which published it for our enemies. Remember Osama bin Laden? The information Manning stole was found on the notorious terrorist’s computer during the raid that sent him to his everlasting reward, according to evidence submitted by the government during Manning’s trial.

Manning helped our enemies by leaking sensitive information to a foreign organization. Period. He was arrested, confessed, and subsequently sentenced to 35 years in a military prison. His actions put America at risk and endangered the lives of “foreigners in dangerous countries who were identified as having helped American troops or diplomats,” according to The New York Times.

Afghans, Syrians, and Iraqis — brave people who continue to live in treacherous places — were put in extreme danger by Manning. These people helped America with the understanding that their actions would be kept secret. Because of Manning, their lives and the lives of their families are forever in peril. In future battles, when our military is looking for allies among local populations, who will trust that America can keep their secrets or can guarantee their safety?

Somewhere along the way, his days of trying to destroy America safely behind him, Brad decided he was Chelsea and demanded the government pay for his conversion from man to woman. And we did, as taxpayers ponied up $50,000 for a traitor to receive everything from “counseling to hormone therapy, and…gender reassignment surgery”.

Fast forward to Tuesday, when Manning’s strange tale ended with Obama commuting his sentence over the objection of Defense Secretary Ash Carter. A “former intelligence official described being ‘shocked’ to learn of Obama’s decision, adding that the ‘entire intelligence community is deflated by this inexplicable use of executive power.’ The official said the move was ‘deeply hypocritical given Obama’s denunciation of WikiLeaks’ role in the hacking of the (Democratic National Committee),’” a CNN report said.

Obama cultivated a reputation as being critical of those who leak information, as Manning and Snowden did. But whatever anger Obama harbored for those who wish to harm America melted away when presented with the opportunity to strike one more blow for his extreme left-wing social ideology (a worldview which did Hillary Clinton no favors in non-urban areas during the election).

After eight years, Obama’s duties as commander in chief were less important to him than making the politically correct decision to deliver the traitor Manning a more comfortable life. Obama, tired of saluting those who serve, slapped them in the face on the way out the door.

Obama has repeatedly destroyed the morale of our troops and weakened American security. His reach for a foreign policy legacy led to the disastrous nuclear deal with Iran, which was sold by an arrogant staff that laughed about lying to reporters who “literally know nothing” as Obama national advisor Ben Rhodes said to The New York Times magazine. Obama has left our alliances with key allies in tatters, the final insult coming when the U.S. failed to stand up for Israel during a recent vote in the United Nations Security Council.

And, most obscenely, Obama stood idly by and watched the unfolding slaughter of innocent civilians in Syria’s Aleppo, a bloodbath that will stain his legacy the way the Rwandan Genocide stains Bill Clinton’s. Together, the last two Democratic presidents ineptly looked on as upwards of 1.5 million people were murdered.

If Obama felt one shred of shame, he would send his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize back with a note of apology to the people of Aleppo.

But hey, at least Chelsea Manning’s happy.

POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media

The necessity and urgency of American leadership and a foreign policy vision unclouded by the extreme liberal ideology demanded by Obama’s political base cannot be understated. Trump’s work is now more than just moving American foreign policy forward; he must dig out of the deep hole left him by the Obama administration.

America’s weakness invited the Russians to attempt to muck around in our election. It invited the Chinese to snatch our military equipment from the water. It makes our friends question America’s ability to know the difference between right and wrong, or to do anything about it.

But hey, at least Chelsea Manning’s happy.

“I thought we'd get to see forever, but forever's gone away. It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday.” – political philosophers Boys II Men, 1991.

With just over two weeks left in his term, President Barack Obama is signaling that he intends to do anything but go quietly once Donald Trump takes office, rejecting the example set by most every other president. Obama’s failure to emulate the class and deference shown him by George W. Bush — allowing his successor to lead without interference from the previous occupant — will not work to the Democratic Party’s advantage nor will it be good for our divided nation.

Indeed, it is hard to say goodbye when giving up high public office to someone in a different party. Just ask former Ky. Gov. Steve Beshear, who set up a political apparatus upon leaving office to undermine Gov. Matt Bevin, the Republican who stunned Democrats by defeating Jack Conway in 2015.

Instead of moving on, Beshear spent all of 2016 pressuring Frankfort politicians to defend his most unpopular policy – the implementation of Obamacare. Democratic legislative leaders, feeling compelled to follow their old leader, forced votes on legislation to codify Beshear’s Obamacare executive orders (bills, by the way, which had no chance of becoming law because of a Republican-controlled Senate).

It was a dumb strategy with disastrous consequences, as those votes played a central role in the overwhelmingly successful Republican campaign to take over the Kentucky House. In race after race, Democratic incumbents forced to walk the Obamacare plank months earlier by Beshear and House Speaker Greg Stumbo, faced a barrage of ads informing voters of their pro-Obamacare position.

You can draw a bright line from Beshear’s unprecedented decision to hang around to Democrats losing the state House. What if Beshear had simply accepted the results of the 2015 election, retiring quietly after voters rebuked his Obamacare move by choosing Bevin? Perhaps Stumbo and his caucus would have focused on other things, robbing the GOP of a winning argument.

Beshear never faced the voters after implementing Obamacare via executive fiat in 2013, but other Democrats did – Alison Grimes blown out by Mitch McConnell in 2014; Conway thumped by Bevin in 2015, and Stumbo robbed of his majority and personal seat in 2016. Three elections brought three straight electoral disasters for Beshear’s Kentucky Democratic Party, all related to his health policy decision.

Will the same thing happen to Obama’s Democratic National Committee? Obama has already presided over what Sam Stein, the senior politics editor of the Huffington Post, called “the destruction of the Democratic Party” since 2009, leaving them “in a much worse position.” On Obama’s watch, Republicans took over both houses of Congress, won a record number of state legislative chambers (67 of 98), and control 33 governorships. The liberal political news site Daily Kos admitted Republicans won more political power in 2016 than in any election since 1928.

Finally, a chance for conservatives to mean it when we say “Thanks, Obama!”

Beshear and Obama won two elections rather easily, and there is no disputing that both possess personal political skills beyond that of their opponents. But both also presided over electoral calamities in the years since their own reelections, birthing a reasonable conclusion that voters, however much they liked them personally, did not approve of their liberal policy tilt.

Obama has announced he’s going to live in Washington after leaving office and caused eye rolls when he said that he would have won a third term if permitted to run again. It’s Alexander Hamilton’s warning against presidential term limits come to life:

“Would it promote the peace of the community, or the stability of the government to have half a dozen men who had had credit enough to be raised to the seat of the supreme magistracy, wandering among the people like discontented ghosts, and sighing for a place which they were destined never more to possess?” Hamilton wrote in Federalist 72, expressing well-founded fears at a time when the average life expectancy was 36! Obama, just 55 years old, could be the nation’s Discontented Ghost-in-Chief for decades, haunting Trump and the next three presidents.

Beyond politics, the moral impact of Obama's refusal to recede cannot be understated as he’s leaving the nation more politically divided than when he took office, according to polling done by the Pew Research Center. Any post-presidential meddling would undermine Trump's efforts to unify a country sorely in need of healing.

Obama famously said before the 2014 midterm election: “I’m not on the ballot this fall…but make no mistake: These policies are on the ballot, every single one of them.” Voters overwhelmingly rejected those policies in two straight elections, turning huge swaths of voters—especially in non-urban areas—toward the Republican Party at every level of government.

But there is always more to lose, as the Frankfort Democrats can tell you after spending 2016 following a spent political force down the rabbit hole. Will Democrats in Washington make the same mistake? If they are smart, they will say goodbye to yesterday as soon as possible.

With 2016 ending, let’s remember those we lost this year: a liberal Supreme Court, the Clinton Era, and the Kentucky Democratic Party. Cue the violins…

McConnell Saves the Court and Ends the Clintons

The year’s most consequential news came on February 13 when Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell stunned the political world:

“The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., speaking swiftly following the passing of conservative giant Antonin Scalia.

McConnell’s country hardball stunned the White House. Chuck Schumer and Harry Reid wept and gnashed teeth. Liberal newspaper editorial boards across the country flipped out. And Barack Obama’s nomination of Merrick Garland fell flat, the political equivalent of ordering dry toast at a Michelin three-star restaurant.

Obama branded Garland a moderate jurist to scare purple-state Republican Senators into pressuring McConnell to cave. Liberal groups organized tens of people to protest McConnell’s office in Louisville, revealing weak grassroots support despite the predictably breathless news coverage. Obama desperately wanted Garland viewed as a consensus pick, but the only things you find in the middle of the road these days are yellow lines and dead squirrels. Garland never had a chance.

McConnell’s move will vibrate throughout American history as one of the shrewdest ever conceived by a Senate leader, not just because of its impact on the court but because it helped Donald Trump win the presidency. McConnell stiff-armed Obama in February and ended the Clinton-era in one fell swoop.

For months, Trump struggled to achieve enough support among his own party to win. But Trump ultimately captured 90 percent of Republicans per exit polls, as previously skeptical conservative and evangelical voters decided Scalia’s seat must be saved. Trump has McConnell to thank for delivering a motivating issue to millions of voters who ultimately couldn’t bear the thought of Hillary Clinton jerking the Supreme Court to the left.

McConnell’s Lamar Jackson-esque touchdown pass to Trump, thrown while deftly avoiding would-be Democratic tacklers, earns him this year’s conservative Heisman Trophy.

Kentucky Democrat Party Withers

Last November, Governor Matt Bevin stunned Democrats with his blowout victory over Jack Conway. This year, Democrats watched helplessly as Bevin led the General Assembly to pass much of his agenda in the spring, followed by watching Republicans attain super majorities in both chambers in November.

Just as they did in 2015, Democrats ran their campaigns as a referendum on Bevin’s conservative, reform-minded agenda. There was no education in the second kick of a mule, as Kentucky voters again rejected stale Democratic scare tactics by ousting House Speaker Greg Stumbo and his party’s foothold on relevancy. The shellackings administered to Kentucky Democrats in the last three elections will leave marks that won’t heal for quite some time.

McConnell and Bevin showed the power of Republican teamwork, as both played major roles in helping the GOP achieve Frankfort supremacy. Kentucky Republican Chairman Mac Brown and his staff deserve mountains of respect for spinning the candidates and policies cultivated by McConnell and Bevin into political gold in November.

Pundit Accountability

It is a great privilege to offer commentary in this space, and this year I thought I’d offer some accountability for my words:

My earliest prediction of a Trump victory came in May when I wrote that a perfect political storm would lead Americans to vote for Trump as a “necessary reset of America’s broken political culture.”

In September, I opined that Trump was following the same path as Bevin in 2015, riding a wave of similar political circumstances to a pollster-shocking win. In October, I wrote that a winning path for Trump could run through Michigan and Wisconsin, and called Maine’s second district as a source for a Trump electoral vote. I correctly predicted that Trump would flip Florida and Ohio, but missed on Colorado and Pennsylvania. During numerous appearances on Fox News, I stated that Trump could win if he achieved 90 percent support among Republicans; that’s exactly what he received.

During the GOP primary I was more bullish on Marco Rubio’s chances than I should have been but correctly predicted that Trump would win the nomination if the primary field remained fractured (it did). While I wrote that Trump had a strong chance to win the general election after he won the nomination, I was skeptical of his ability to do so during the primary.

On state matters, last November I projected that the GOP would finally take over the state house in 2016, something it had not controlled in nearly 100 years. I was right, but the margin of victory—64 seats out of 100!—was beyond my wildest expectations. Rest in peace, Kentucky Democrat Party. We knew ye all too well.

Thank you for reading the opinion page. I regard vibrant debate on politics and public policy as central to the health of our republic. To those who read this space, email and tweet at me, Merry Christmas, Happy New Year, and long live the First Amendment!

With the dust settling on the 2016 general election, here are a few observations on the big questions people are asking:

Does Trump’s losing the popular vote mean anything? Yes, it means the Democratic Party under President Barack Obama lost connectivity to non-urban voters, and that Hillary Clinton lacked the political skills to do anything about it.

The data tells the tale. Kyle Kondik of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics reports that Trump won 94 percent of Appalachian counties by a margin of 63 percent to 33 percent (nine points better than Mitt Romney’s 60 percent to 39 percent margin in 2012). Further, as Ron Brownstein at The Atlantic points out, while Clinton won 88 of the largest 100 counties in America, overall she won just 420 of the nation’s roughly 3100 counties (Bill Clinton carried about half in his elections).

It is impossible to understate the chasm that has formed between Democratic Party elites and non-urban American communities, something on display in Kentucky where Clinton won just two of 120 counties (Jefferson and Fayette).

Is the electorate more conservative than we thought? Yet to be determined, but America’s non-urban voters wholeheartedly rejected a liberal culture in which Democratic Party elites, when they aren’t promoting a society of government dependence, openly mock those who prefer traditional social values. The Democratic Party’s adherence to a liberal social agenda has impaired its ability to have a conversation with voters about economics in many parts of the country (see: the Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Ohio countryside). It is hard to talk to average Americans about jobs while simultaneously ordering them to take down the gender-specific signs on the bathroom at their kids’ school.

Is polling dead? Not necessarily, as the national polling average correctly predicted Hillary Clinton’s popular vote win. The practice of forecasting results, however, may be dead, as media-sponsored gurus and academics, wearing their cloaks and poring over bubbling cauldrons of data and faulty assumptions about the composition of the electorate, gave Democrats false hope that Clinton was a mortal lock to win The White House.

Only two states—Wisconsin and Ohio—showed election results outside the margin of error of their final polling averages. Other target states landed within their polling margins of error, per data tabulated by research firm Public Opinion Strategies. It does appear that for the third straight year media-sponsored pollsters had trouble picking up conservative undercurrents among rural populations, something we learned in Kentucky in 2014 and 2015 and previously discussed in this space.

What message did voters send by voting for one-party control? This is the most important question, and the answer is clear – voters rejected incrementalism, and they tore down barriers to serious change by ending the divided government of the last six years.

Divided government, a common condition in American history, has not always impeded bold action. President Ronald Reagan and Democratic House Speaker Tip O’Neil made deals on Social Security and taxes; President Bill Clinton and Congressional Republicans produced welfare reform.

But the last six years have felt like a ping ponggame played at the bottom of a swimming pool full of molasses. People want policy changes that will lead to more and better jobs, lower health care costs and a safer nation. Frustrated voters, sick of the excuse of blaming the other side for inaction, handed full control to the GOP, the Senate’s 60 vote filibuster rule notwithstanding.

Congressional Republicans and Donald Trump made a series of promises they must keep or there will be electoral hell to pay in 2018 and 2020. After two years of unified Republican control, serious progress must be made on repealing Obamacare and lowering health insurance costs, securing the border, reforming the tax code, rebuilding crumbling infrastructure, and confirming Constitutionally-minded judges. If Republicans do that, voters will be thrilled with their decision to flip the keys to the GOP. If not…well, think Darth Vader Force-choking inept Imperial officers, but worse.

The same is true for Republicans now in full control of Kentucky state government. The fall of Greg Stumbo as Speaker of the House (predicted in this space last November) and the rise of Republican supermajorities in both legislative chambers should immediately lead to long overdue policies that will catch Kentucky up to her neighbors. Passage of a right-to-work law, repeal of prevailing wage, allowance of charter schools, and comprehensive lawsuit (tort) reform are must-do items for Republicans in 2017.

To the newly elected Republicans now running the General Assembly, ignore the old Frankfort guard whispering in your ear about “taking it slow” on tort reform or anything else. Half-measures and watered down compromises with the liberals won’t do for the voters who elected you; plunge headlong into conservative, pro-growth reforms to unlock the endless possibility found within Kentucky’s resources and people.

They say good policy makes good politics. Republican leaders in Washington and Frankfort have a chance to make excellent politics in the years ahead so long as they heed the demands of frustrated voters who are tired of the policy treadmill and want their politicians to go for a brisk run outside.

344,Jennings,Scott,leoweekly,"One of the things I’ll remember most about the Obama years is the online advertisement featuring Pajama Boy, the flannel-clad man-child sipping hot cocoa while admonishing his fellow ne’er-do-well millennials to sign up for Obamacare.

I hadn’t thought about Pajama Boy for a long time, until late last week. That’s when I read the following account of a staffer (his name was reportedly Zach, which is just perfect) at the Democratic National Committee losing it on Chairwoman Donna Brazile:

“You are part of the problem,” he continued, blaming Brazile for clearing the path for Donald Trump’s victory by siding with Hillary Clinton early on. “You and your friends will die of old age, and I’m going to die from climate change. You and your friends let this happen, which is going to cut 40 years off my life expectancy.”

I laughed, imagining Pajama Boy Zach screeching at Brazile, cocoa sloshing as the butt flap of his flannels popped open during the hysterics. Is “death by climate change” not something Obamacare covers?

After hearing of Zach’s nervous breakdown, it dawned on me that some of you reading this might be worried about an America fully under Republican control.

Fear not, liberal handwringers. Things will be just fine! We conservatives managed to survive eight years of Dear Leader Barack Obama, and you, too, will survive under President Donald J. Trump.

For those concerned about the message Trump’s election sends to women, here’s a question: Were you as worried about putting Bill Clinton back in the West Wing as you are about Trump? If not, take a deep breath and reevaluate your fear. Neither major-party ticket was a paragon of virtue when it comes to treating women with the respect they deserve, and exit polls show women split in this election, about the same way they did in 2012.

And while Trump made some heated statements regarding various groups during the campaign, being the president of the United States and running for it are two different things. Already, we’ve seen Trump moderate his views on two key issues: Obamacare, and jailing Hillary Clinton. Trump, after just one meeting with Obama, said he wanted to keep parts of Obama’s signature health care law. And this weekend Trump called the Clintons “good people” and seemed to back off his strident campaign promise to appoint a special prosecutor to put Hillary in jail.

Winning has a soothing effect, even on the hot tempered.

What can you expect from a Trump administration? He ran on a few issues, and he’s going to want to implement them. I suspect there will be some legislative independence here and there from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan, but on such things as border security and pro-growth tax reform, all the GOP needed was an executive and legislative branch in alignment to get those things done. And now they have it.

We went through this in Kentucky in 2015. An outsider governor was elected after unexpectedly winning a GOP primary and vanquishing a miserable Democratic nominee, and there was concern about how he would govern. One year later, I don’t know a mainstream Kentucky Republican who is unhappy with Gov. Matt Bevin, and he has a terrific working relationship with the GOP legislative leadership. And I don’t know a liberal (save Greg Stumbo and the rest of the state House Democrats ousted from their seats on Election Day) who has experienced disruption in their life because a Republican governor has been in charge for the last year.

I expect the same for President Trump, at least in the near term. There is plenty of agenda where he overlaps with McConnell and Ryan, and the voters sent a clear message that the days of talking are over. Voters want action, which we haven’t seen much of in Washington since President Obama’s first two years when he passed his healthcare law and the trillion-dollar stimulus package. We can debate the wisdom of those two things (conservatives feel both were disastrous mistakes), but they were big actions undertaken by a government unified under one-party control.

This time around voters delivered full Republican control because they want another period where things — big ticket things — are happening instead of just being fantasized about in floor speeches and press releases. The burden is on the entire GOP — Trump and Congress — to deliver results in this unified government handed them by America’s working class and rural voters. We have endlessly discussed several problems for the last six years, and divided government proved too much of a roadblock for meaningful solutions. The voters tore down that impediment last Tuesday.

There is no mystery in what Republicans plan to do. They will cut taxes. They will use free market ideas to reduce healthcare costs and enhance access. They will reduce the regulatory burden on an American business community that has felt a federal boot on its throat for the last eight years.

None of these things will hurt you. You might even like them, if you are interested in getting a better job.

Beyond that, our nation’s founders, crafty as they were, designed a system of checks and balances that prevent any one government actor from sailing too far outside the navigational beacons laid down by James Madison. You can bet that McConnell and Ryan will keep things on track, checking the executive branch as necessary.

And if you need even more comforting, McConnell will have a 52-seat Republican majority in the Senate, a body that requires 60 votes to do most anything. The Senate offers a safety net inside of a safety net for minority viewpoints in our government.

Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote: “Sorrow looks back, worry looks around, faith looks up.”

There’s no need to look back on election results you cannot change, nor worry about elected officials you cannot stop from taking office.

But you can have faith in the goodness of America, and in the fidelity of her Constitutional system of government that protects minority viewpoints even when their parties have been banished to the electoral wilderness by unhappy voters. •

It is Nov. 9. You’ve collected the newspaper off your actual or digital front porch to find this headline staring back at you. You rub your eyes and blink hard.

Trump was right. The polls were rigged, a vain attempt by the liberal media to convince us that a Trump presidency wasn’t possible.

But America First voters refused to be cowed. Despite their candidate telling them their votes wouldn’t be counted fairly, they turned out anyway. In droves.

Hillary Clinton’s core supporters — minority voters and people under the age of 45 — decided the dishonest Democrat wasn’t worth it after all, staying home in Cleveland, Miami, Denver, Des Moines, and Las Vegas.

And for independent voters, Hillary’s last minute run-in with the feds proved to be the last straw.

Make no mistake: This race is close and roiled, thanks to FBI Director’s James Comey’s announcement that his investigation of a sex pervert may have uncovered Hillary Clinton stuff. (Let that sentence sink in for a second).

What if Trump wins? What would American politics look like in four years?

First, a policy realignment of the parties would drastically accelerate. Trump, having won the White House on a populist message, would force the GOP to further abandon its free-trade roots. Free market and national security conservatives will lack for a political home, as Trump has run against the view that American engagement in the world is a good thing.

In fact, whether Trump wins or loses, we may be in for a fracturing of the Republican Party as we’ve known since 1980. The factions could split along class and education — college-educated, white-collar workers head one direction, while blue-collar workers lacking a college degree go another. A tie that binds those two groups today — being a Christian — is straining under the choices presented in this election.

For the Democrats, losing with a candidate that its grassroots never liked all that much anyway would push the party further to the left and leave Bernie Sanders as an unquestioned, Yoda-like thought leader. A relatively young ex-president named Barack Obama and his popular wife, Michelle, would have to decide whether to run the Democratic Party or just walk away. Once out of office, will the hardcore leftists accept direction from a former president they like personally, but whose use of drones to kill America’s enemies made their blood run cold? Difficult to tell, the future is.

Second, America could be in for serious executive branch intervention in domestic affairs. Trump’s platform revolves to some degree around the concept of a powerful chief executive wading into issues facing American cities, schools and corporations.

Trump has promised to bring order to chaotic inner cities, which are policed at the local and state level, not by federal cops. Similarly, Trump promises federal intervention in inner-city schools. While it isn’t clear how Trump would do it, his rhetoric indicates he favors federal intervention in local policing and education, horrifying small government conservatives and likely leading to court battles. He has also spoken of a federal “deportation force” to round up illegal immigrants, a policy that would roil communities in many states.

Third, American corporations not in compliance with Trump’s directives would immediately have to gird against an all-out federal assault, if Trump remains true to his threats. Trump has repeatedly promised “boycotts, tariffs, taxes and other punishments” for companies who fail to accede to his will. Trump’s populist base would cheer this development while free market conservatives would wince.

Much of the taxation punishment Trump promises isn’t possible without congressional approval, but a Trump administration could move against the corporations on two fronts: through punishing executive-branch regulations and a Rose Garden-based public relations campaign in which the president tells Americans (or at least his political base) to stop patronizing corporations that make his naughty list.

A Republican-led White House hammering American companies for trying to turn a profit in the free market would turn the world, as we know it, upside down.

The cultural upheaval would be enormous, with major American brands (Ford, Nabisco, Amazon and Apple have been Trump targets) bringing their considerable advertising resources to bear against President Trump. This would come to a head in 2020, when Trump seeks reelection to the presidency as an independent candidate unwilling to be encumbered by any party or ideology. The failure of congressional Republicans including Paul Ryan to follow Trump’s orders was the last straw for a man unaccustomed to hearing the word “no.”

(An alternate path is that congressional Republicans fall in line with hopes of pressing the political advantage the Republican Party enjoys in midterm elections, especially in 2018 when Senate Democrats are defending 25 of 33 seats. I’m betting on more legislative independence no matter who wins, however.)

The Republican Party, without a standard-bearer, nominates Ryan for president. He looks to build a political base among college-educated whites, suburban moms, small-business owners and exercise nuts, reshaping the GOP around the idea that America must participate in the world’s affairs.

The Democrats nominate Michelle Obama, who argues that Trump has not punished American corporations enough. She strongly condemns his use of nuclear weapons against Tanzania, whose president insulted the quality of the towels during a stay at the Trump Hotel in Washington D.C. in June of 2018. Organic arugula farmers, left in the political wilderness over the past four years, cheer her ascendancy.

Asking Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to challenge his party’s nominee is a request for him to disregard the will of the Republican voters who nominated Donald Trump in the first place.

Who is McConnell — or House Speaker Paul Ryan, for that matter — to impose his will on a party whose voters spoke clearly while nominating Trump fair and square?

The concept of Trump being silently enabled by any individual Republican is pure poppycock. You can be upset about Trump’s nomination, but directing anger at McConnell for smartly spending the bulk of his time on holding a conservative Republican Senate majority is misguided.

Beyond that, McConnell, like 90% of GOP voters, has perhaps set aside worries about a Trump presidency because the alternative is worse. When will Democratic leaders openly challenge a dangerous Hillary Clinton, whose penchant for secrecy, incompetence in protecting national security information and affiliation with shady characters like Anthony Weiner have led more than half of likely voters to conclude that she broke the law?

As for McConnell’s supposed policy of obstructionism, any fair review shows a fully functioning Senate, an institution with restored purpose after being mothballed by outgoing Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid.

McConnell, majority leader of the silence of the GOP: Our view

On McConnell’s watch, senators have passed important bills dealing with transportation, opioid addiction and human trafficking, to name a few. The Senate is having its best year since 1990, with President Obama signing more than 30 of its bills into law.

Assertions that McConnell is silently enabling Trump or engaging in obstructionism just aren’t true. McConnell runs the Senate better than Reid, and he’s in line with 90% of Republicans on Trump. Neither deserves harsh judgment. No matter who wins the White House, McConnell would deliver far more legislative independence than New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, who looks to be Clinton’s lapdog in chief.

With one week to go in the 2016 election, a nation that has endured more plot twists than an M. Night Shyamalan movie prepares to render its verdict.

Both candidates are deeply flawed. It is fitting that in the campaign’s closing weeks the two biggest morale boosters came not because of something good a candidate did, but rather because of something bad that happened to the other guy (Trump’s leaked Billy Bush tape and Clinton’s latest dust-up with the FBI).

Basically, both teams have stopped cheering for touchdowns and are just hoping the other side breaks a collarbone.

Does this race to the bottom have a pathway to 270 for Republican nominee Donald Trump? His supporters have cheered narrowing national tracking polls in recent days, wherein Trump has pulled nearly even. Meanwhile, the Clinton campaign, with teeth clinched, believes early votes banked in North Carolina and Nevada have firewalled her victory from a last-minute collapse.

What is Trump’s path?

The road is narrow and may not include at least one state won by Mitt Romney in 2012. A daily analysis conducted on North Carolina’s early voting by The New York Times “Upshot” data team shows Clinton with a predicted win in the Tar Heel State of 49% to 43.3%, based on polling and information on who has already voted.

Taking those 15 electoral votes away makes an already tough map that much harder for Trump. Fooling around with Electoral College scenarios on the handy mapping tool at 270towin.com shows that without North Carolina, Trump needs Florida, Ohio, and something else. But what?

The first idea is Pennsylvania’s 20 electoral votes, even though no Republican has carried it since George H. W. Bush in 1988. The polls paint a tough picture for Trump, who trails Clinton by about six points. The Philadelphia suburbs are especially hostile, as James Hohmann at The Washington Post recently reported.

Without North Carolina or Pennsylvania, is there a map that gets Trump to 270? Follow me down this unlikely rabbit hole…

Let’s assume Trump flips Ohio and Florida, two states where he has shown polling strength. Let’s also assume he holds the rest of Romney’s coalition, putting Trump at 238. And let’s flip Nevada and Iowa, two blue states where Trump remains competitive (pro-Democratic early voting patterns in Nevada notwithstanding). 250.

The next two states are Colorado (9) and Wisconsin (10). Clinton has maintained polling leads in both, but late Democratic spending in the Badger State, combined with both tickets adding rallies to the schedule, indicate bipartisan agreement the race is tightening. Colorado is an uphill climb for Trump, but he has spent time and money there down the stretch despite apparent Democratic strength on early voting (done by mail).

That puts us at 269 votes for each ticket (a glorious political science scenario). Where does Trump find 270?

Welcome to Maine, where they apportion electoral votes not just based on who wins the state (likely Clinton), but also by who wins individual congressional districts. And in Maine’s second district, political veterans who have worked there tell me Trump is very competitive in the second most rural congressional district in the nation. (Did you know Kentucky’s fifth district, represented by Hal Rogers in Eastern Kentucky, is the most rural?). The final log comes from a heavily wooded piece of America.

Here’s a link to the map that gives Trump a 270-268 win in the Electoral College without North Carolina or Pennsylvania: http://www.270towin.com/maps/byYlw. You could trade Wisconsin for Michigan in that scenario and dispense with the need for Nevada. Interestingly, however, winning Michigan and losing Nevada throws us right back into a 269-269 tie, putting Maine’s 2nd district back in the spotlight.

This is a longshot scenario for Trump (he hasn’t led a single Wisconsin or Michigan poll), akin to pulling an inside straight flush draw on the river card at the World Series of Poker while eating a ham sandwich upside down. But given everything that has happened, would you be surprised? After all, Trump is running against a ridiculously bad opponent whose closing argument involves explaining how her emails wound up on the laptop of a pervert under FBI investigation for sexting with a teenager.

It may also be that Clinton is headed for victory, and there’s nothing James Comey can do about it, or that shy Trump voters are preparing an Election Day turnout avalanche. We’ll know soon enough.

A word about Kentucky

New polling indicates Trump is headed for a blowout win, while U.S. Senator Rand Paul maintains a steady lead.

Research firm Cygnal interviewed 811 likely voters October 26-28, capturing 70 percent of them on landlines and 30 percent on cell phones. The margin of error was +/- 3.44 percent, and the survey was not conducted for any campaign or political organization.

In the presidential race, Cygnal found Trump leading Clinton 56 percent to 32 percent, and Paul leading Democratic challenger Jim Gray 52 percent to 42 percent. The most eye-popping statistic – Clinton was winning just 50 percent of Democratic voters, a stunningly low number. Full poll results are available at www.RunSwitchPR.com.

What did we really learn about Donald Trump in Friday’s leaked tape revelations that we didn’t already know? He’s a vulgar, crude, braggadocious, desperate-to-impress playboy who tends to view most everything through a sexual lens.

Yet many Republicans acted Saturday and Sunday as though they were hearing this side of Trump for the first time.

Yes, the remarks, which indicated Trump may have engaged in unwanted sexual advances and felt able to do so because of his fame, went a bit further than we had heard previously in old interviews with Howard Stern. But a morally casual attitude that would make Donald “Boon” Schoenstein, the fictional character in the movie ""Animal House,"" proud to induct Trump into Delta Tau Chi has been part of the Republican nominee’s candidacy from day one.

Primary voting Republicans were well aware of this kind of language and delivered Trump the nomination anyway, which is why the new tape is unlikely to precipitously tank his poll numbers among his base. His attitude towards women had already been priced into his candidacy and had landed him in nearly a dead heat with Hillary Clinton (until he laid an egg at the first debate). He’s currently losing nationally and in most swing states, as the base he has cultivated isn’t enough to win a national election.

Trump has a formidable coalition of people who A) would vote for a boxing kangaroo before they voted for Clinton, and B) actually share his policy views, as crazy as that sounds to the Beltway elite. His people are substantial but not enough to bring him to a lead, only a tie at certain moments of this general election.

But even that Trump kept it close for so long speaks to just how horrific at politics Clinton really is. Her opponent has disrespected American prisoners of war, body-shamed a beauty queen, feuded with a Gold Star family, and tweeted at three o’clock in the morning about sex tapes. President Barack Obama has an approval rating in the mid-50’s, and she’s basically running for his third term.

And somehow Clinton’s supporters remained anxious until Friday night about her ability to win because she gave them good reason to be. The most charitable explanation for Hillary’s flailing against Trump is that our nation is simply desensitized to sex and vulgarity, a culture unable to be shocked by anything; more likely, she just sucks at running for office and would have lost to virtually any other Republican.

DEBATE PERFORMANCE

Both candidates had winning moments in Sunday’s debate and both left meat on the bone.

For Trump, he was able to move on faster from his self-proclaimed “locker room talk” than many thought possible. He said those things, after all, not in a locker room but while he was at work, a fact Clinton stunningly missed. While it would have been prudent to preemptively dismiss any future October surprises rather than litigate each new one as they arrive, Trump escaped the moment about as well as he could. He must now wonder if women are preparing to come forward and say that Trump did, in fact, kiss and grope them in unwanted interactions, a direct rebuttal to his statement to the contrary.

While Trump’s base was pleased with his performance, his flip remark about putting Clinton in “jail” should have chilled the spine of any conservative who was outraged by the Internal Revenue Service targeting of groups opposed to Obama’s agenda. We cannot have it both ways when it comes to executive branch revenge. It feels good to think of Clinton getting her comeuppance for being careless when entrusted with high office, but Republicans must resist the urge to even joke about using the presidency for political retribution.

For Clinton, her most effective moments came in the first few minutes as she explained the rationale for her candidacy and when she took the anti-Russia line on foreign policy. She came in with a small lead and the potential for a larger one, but failed to truly close the door on the possibility of a Trump presidency. Her failure to press Trump on his business losses as revealed by The New York Times was debate prep malpractice. We’ve heard the income tax arguments before, but the better hit would have been to call his business acumen into question as it is at the core of Trump’s candidacy.

Perhaps Clinton thinks she has already won and is now running what college basketball fans know as the “four corners offense.” Given how distrusted and disliked she is by most Americans it is risky for Clinton to rest on her laurels or on Trump’s deficiencies, although Monday polling from NBC News and The Wall Street Journal taken before Sunday’s debate indicated the race is moving away from Trump as people focus on their choices less than a month out.

The debate format made for a better discussion than round one, but the questions and questioners left something to be desired. How, in a debate hall mere minutes from Ferguson, did we not have a question on policing and race relations? Instead, we got the perfunctory “say something nice about your opponent” which yielded no useful information despite gracious answers from both candidates.

The race today is Hillary’s to lose, of which she is fully capable of successfully attempting. Even now, in the face of everything that has happened, she is trying to back in to The White House in the middle of the night, winning ugly because that is all her political talent will allow.

351,Jennings,Scott,realclearpolitics,"A Democrat — a dizzy, spent force after years on the political merry-go-round — who just can’t get over the hump.

A Republican every Democrat wanted to run against, victorious in a primary he wasn’t supposed to win, whose Teflon confounds opposition researchers.

A news media completely at odds with a Republican who delights in taunting the scribes who follow him. Their stories, disqualifying for any other candidate in any other year, have no impact.

Two candidates who people say could only beat the other, star-crossed opponents who truly need each other.

Voters telling pollsters one thing while keeping their hearts’ true contents a secret.

Wealthy Republican elites backing a Democrat, sure their party will be destroyed if the GOP nominee wins. A Democratic grassroots lethargically allowing their nominee to fail, unhappy with a status quo pick whose cautiousness fails to inspire.

If this sounds familiar to Kentucky voters, it should. In 2015, Republican Matt Bevin overcame the odds to win a primary he wasn’t supposed to and a general election most thought was a slam dunk for Democrat Jack Conway, who led in almost all public polling.

As Donald Trump pulls into a tie with Hillary Clinton nationally and in many swing states, the similarities between Kentucky’s gubernatorial contest and this presidential campaign pile up. Even with the differences you can’t help but wonder: have we seen this movie before?

Bevin and Trump – Two businessmen-turned-candidates running from outside the system upended a GOP primary to beat people with more experience. Both were savaged by reporters who delighted in pointing out inconsistent statements. Both faced onslaughts of “oppo dumps” (the practice of campaigns feeding negative research to reporters to generate bad news stories) dealing with their business records. Bevin and Trump have both shown an amazing ability to absorb political and media attacks that, in years gone by, would have gravely wounded a candidacy.

A key difference, however, is Bevin’s natural connection to the Christian conservatives who make up a significant block of the grassroots wing of the Republican Party. Bevin embodies pro-family Christian values, a powerful signal to volunteers and voters in a state that is culturally more conservative than the nation at large. Trump has struggled to communicate with Christians but may be saved by an opponent who is singularly loathed by values voters, and by swing states more secular than Kentucky.

Poll ceiling? – Like Conway, Clinton has led most surveys. The trouble for Clinton — a universally known politician — is that she’s stuck under 45 percent no matter how you slice it. Similarly, of the 15 public surveys taken in the gubernatorial contest, Conway led Bevin in 12 of them but eclipsed 45 percent just once. Conway’s polling average was a lowly 42.7 percent but he was widely viewed as the favorite because he typically led Bevin in major polls, albeit by small margins.

The pollsters got Conway very right – he wound up with 43.8 percent on Election Day (a 1.1 percent difference). However, they got Bevin very wrong as he won easily with 52.5 percent (his polling average was 39.5 percent, a whopping 13-point miss). Is Trump in for a similar secret, pollster-defying boost?

There are differences, of course. First, the quality and volume of presidential polling far surpasses what we saw in Kentucky. Second, the Electoral College throws a wrinkle into comparing the two (there is a very real chance Clinton could win the popular vote and lose the Electoral College, according to analyst David Wasserman). Third, turnout will be much higher this year (around 60 percent) than in Kentucky last year (about 30 percent). Fourth, minority voters in key areas are a far bigger problem for Trump than they were for Bevin.

Still, it is hard not to wonder if voters, processing a Democrat they know and don’t really like, are holding something back when the pollsters call.

Democratic spending edge for naught? –While the Republican Governor’s Association helped level the playing field for Bevin in 2015, Conway’s aggregate forces outspent Bevin’s by a significant margin. Despite the financial advantage (including a few donations from donors who typically back Republicans), Conway’s team never found a message that made him likable or revealed a good reason for his running. They resorted mostly to attack ads, never actually dealing with Conway’s own shortcoming as a candidate. His halting, tentative debate performances hurt more than they helped, and the negative ads bounced off Bevin like Florida State tacklers off University of Louisville quarterback Lamar Jackson.

The same thing is happening in 2016. Politico reported this week that “Hillary Clinton has invested seven times the amount of money on TV commercials” as Trump in key states. But, as the song says, money can’t buy her love. Despite the crushing advantage, Clinton has seen her lead evaporate nationally and in places like Ohio, Iowa, Nevada, and Florida.

Money is to politics what yeast is to bread, but a baker knows you have to feed the yeast with sugar to make it rise. Clinton’s handlers need to borrow a cup to avoid a result like the flat Conway loaf that emerged from Kentucky’s electoral oven last year. Otherwise, they may be looking at a similar result come Election Day.",1,http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2016/09/22/2016_dj_vu_all_over_again_131847.html

There are two kinds of people in the world – those who believe the rules apply to them, and those who don’t.

Most of us follow the rules. We pay our taxes. We drive the speed limit and use turn signals. We don’t engage in drunken vandalism at the age of 32 while representing our nation overseas at the Olympics. We use the standard email system that comes with our job, same as everybody else at the office.

We have all encountered someone who believes the rules don’t apply to them. The blowhard who constantly fibs and exaggerates, seemingly unaware that everyone believes him a liar. The neighbor who lives beyond their means, expressing exasperation when bankruptcy catches up. The secretary of state who can’t bring herself to say what we all know about her judgment. The swimmer whose lying eyes are visible even through mirrored goggles.

This summer has treated Americans to gross displays of public relations negligence by presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and Olympic swimmer Ryan Lochte, people with advisers capable of telling them the right thing to do but without the courage or common sense to do it.

They just don’t believe the rules apply to them.

Jennings | Meeting of the GOP Establishment

Clinton’s failure to come clean on her email practices, even after the FBI Director called her “extremely careless,” threatens her presidential ambitions. Clinton sits at 42 percent in the RealClear Politics four-way polling average, leading by four points but hardly in a position of strength among an electorate that views her as grossly dishonest.

To maintain this small lead over Donald Trump, who has taken a spectacular beating in the press since the Republican National Convention, Clinton’s apparatus has spent $115 million on television advertising against roughly $20 million for Trump’s. Hillary has lurched from Whitewater to whitewashing, an expensive proposition what with television advertising rates these days.

While the national polling shows Clinton slightly ahead, it also shows a nation desperate not to elect her.

A simple, “Man, I screwed up on the email thing. I am sorry and it will never happen again,” would have saved Clinton a lot of trouble. Instead, she does what the “no rules” types do, flailing for the next obfuscation.

Clinton claimed the FBI Director said she was “truthful” in her answers. That’s false, according to fact checkers. She laughably blamed it on former Secretary of State Colin Powell, who slammed her excuse. And she told a late night talk show host her emails are “boring.” Then why work so hard to hide what they might tell us about the Clinton Foundation, an increasing albatross for her campaign?

It is always another excuse with the Clintons but never an apology or promise to have better judgment. A possible president owes us more, unless they think the rules just don’t apply to them.

Clinton is smart enough to know better, but whatever sense of shame humans are born with skipped Clinton Town long ago. She’s winning because Democrats are overlooking her dishonesty; Clinton is getting 90 percent of her party while Trump is getting about 80 percent of Republicans. A comparable consolidation of the GOP base around Trump (something that remains possible) would make this a very close election.

Jennings | Memoir shows McConnell's human side

As for Lochte, the 32-year-old Olympic gold medalist who allegedly likes to urinate in public places, his gaucheness appears to stem from a life of never being told he is a complete tomfool. At some point for Lochte, perhaps when it became clear he would become rich and famous, people stopped telling him “Dude, no.”

Like Hillary, the behavior itself wasn’t enough for this “no rules” lifestyle adherent. The follow-on explanations, even as the story had clearly unraveled, earned Lochte a gold medal for prevarication.

“I want to apologize for…not being more careful and candid in how I described the events,” Lochte said in response to being caught lying about the embarrassing incident.

Careful and candid? This is not a guy who gets it. That statement, combined with ditching his swimming buddies by fleeing Brazil while they slept off their bender, turned someone who should be a national hero into a global punchline. Not one for humility, Lochte was spotted arm in arm in North Carolina with his Playboy Playmate girlfriend while at the same time his friends enjoyed the loving arms of Brazilian police as they were being dragged off an airplane.

Lochte finally delivered a bit better apology to NBC’s Matt Lauer, but looked like a seven-year-old boy forced by his mother (or PR team) to apologize for whacking his little brother with a stick. It was a sorry-not-sorry moment that came too late – his corporate sponsors couldn’t backstroke away fast enough. At least he abandoned the absurdly obnoxious hair dye for his close up with Lauer.

The summer gormlessness of Lochte and Clinton remind us that the rules do, in fact, apply to all of us. When you pretend they don’t it eventually catches up. The Clintons have always remained one step ahead of a reckoning with their behavior, but can they outrun the consequences of their actions once more this November?

We’ll see.

The race to become the Republican nominee for Kentucky governor is in full swing, with the four tickets appearing at Lincoln Day Dinners, rolling out platforms and raising funds.

Each of the four has also assembled a team of staff and consultants, people typically unknown to the average voter but who have a profound impact on donor confidence and a candidate’s image. Two of the tickets (Comer/McDaniel and Heiner/Crosbie) have already changed campaign managers, but they are also the only two building a team formidable enough to win in November.

Here is a peek at the political operatives behind Kentucky’s GOP gubernatorial tickets:

• Hal Heiner — His operation is run by Kyle Robertson, an experienced operative who previously managed campaigns for Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder and Indiana Gov. Mike Pence. Robertson, 37, originally from Northern Kentucky, took over for Joe Burgan who left the campaign late last year. Robertson has assembled a staff experienced in churning out “voter contact,” a term used by campaign operatives to describe volunteer activities like knocking on doors and making phone calls. That effort is led by political director Rob Secaur, a Northern Kentuckian who served numerous grassroots roles in the last two campaign cycles. Robertson and Secaur have hired several experienced staffers with granular grassroots experience, investing heavily in a modern-day voter turnout operation that could make the difference in a close race.

Kim Alfano returns as Heiner’s ad maker, also her job in his 2010 run for Louisville mayor. She has consulted for Gov. Terry Branstad of Iowa and former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels. The pollsters are Tony Fabrizio and David Lee, experienced GOP hands. The direct mail and digital presence is run by Michael Clingaman, a Louisville native and former executive director of the Republican Party of Kentucky, of the Stoneridge Group.

• James Comer — Like Heiner, Comer shook up his campaign last fall by replacing longtime advisor and campaign manager Holly Harris with Edwin King, 31, who previously worked for Comer’s running mate Chris McDaniel’s 2012 campaign for state Senate. King previously held staff jobs for U.S. Senators Jim Bunning and Rand Paul. Helping King are Corey Bridges, who worked on Comer’s 2011 agriculture commissioner’s race before joining his staff at the department, and Caroline Cash, a well-liked western Kentucky GOP activist from Fancy Farm. Bridges is the grassroots director and Cash is handling fundraising.

Comer boasts perhaps the two most well-known consultants in the race. His ad maker is Jon Downs, a partner at FP1 Strategies in Washington, D.C. Downs is widely regarded as one of the most talented video magicians in the business and was just hired to make ads for Jeb Bush. Operatives involved with the 2012 GOP presidential primary still marvel at Downs’ work for Ron Paul’s campaign, especially his devastating attacks on Newt Gingrich. While Heiner is winning the quantity battle on delivering video content, Comer is winning on the quality front.

Comer’s pollster is Robert Blizzard of Public Opinion Strategies, a well-known firm with heavy Kentucky experience. Blizzard and his partner Neil Newhouse have worked for Kentuckians for Strong Leadership, the SuperPAC that supported U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell’s reelection in 2014 (author’s note: I was a consultant to KSL as well), Congressman Andy Barr and the Republican Party of Kentucky.

• Will T. Scott — The Scott campaign is managed by tea party activist David Adams, a polarizing figure in Republican circles. Adams has been involved in various campaigns over the years, including Phil Moffett’s 2011 gubernatorial run, Rand Paul’s 2010 U.S. Senate primary (he was replaced by Jesse Benton for the general election), and other local races. Most recently, Adams was seen hanging around Matt Bevin’s campaign against McConnell in the 2014 primary for U.S. Senate. He is also suing Gov. Steve Beshear over implementation of Obamacare in Kentucky.

The only other consultant mentioned by Adams is Ray Stewart, a longtime political and media specialist in Eastern Kentucky known for making ads for local officials that sometimes “push the envelope” and are “outrageously negative,” according to Courier-Journal columnist and UK professor Al Cross. It remains to be seen whether Scott will have enough money to deliver any of Stewart’s product.

• Matt Bevin — The last entrant into the race appears to have hired an operative named Ben Hartman as his campaign manager, last seen in Kansas managing the losing effort of tea party Senate candidate Milton Wolf against U.S. Sen. Pat Roberts in the 2014 primary. Wolf’s campaign was supported by the same national groups who backed Bevin over McConnell. It is unclear if other consultants have been hired, but Bevin has apparently opened a few campaign offices and has been seen at events with field staffers. I emailed Hartman with a request for information for this column but he did not respond. He did, however, start following me on Twitter. Bevin has issued a policy platform, notable for flip-flopping his position on cockfighting (he’s against it now).

As we know in Kentucky, jockeys matter in horse races. Which of these political equestrians will have their horse crossing the finish line first on May 19? Time will tell.

With Saturday’s Fancy Farm picnic in the rear view mirror and fewer than 100 days to go before November’s election, here’s a snapshot of what we learned over the weekend about the race for U.S. Senate and President:

U.S. Senator – The race between incumbent Republican Rand Paul and his Democratic challenger Jim Gray has been quiet over the summer, but finally burst from its shell on the Fancy Farm stage. Gray, the mayor of Lexington, delivered a more-than-credible performance in the face of a well-organized contingent of Paul supporters who took up more than half of the speaking pavilion. Gray is not known as a great orator but seemed to relish his first time in the spotlight. Several observers were impressed with Gray and his “Rand for President 2020” T-shirt gag.

Gray was left to twist in the Fancy Farm breeze by Democratic leaders who chose not to participate. Typically, in statewide elections, each party’s speakers use at least some of their time to attack the other party’s nominee or vouch for their own candidate. Gray’s only help came from former North Carolina Sen. Kay Hagan, sent to Western Kentucky by Hillary Clinton’s campaign to speak on her behalf. The hapless Hagan’s presence caused Agriculture Commissioner Ryan Quarles to quip: “Christian Laettner apparently wasn’t available.”

Jennings | Memoir shows McConnell's human side

What happened to Gray at Fancy Farm at the hands of his Democratic wingmen exemplified what Kentucky Democrats are doing across the state – abandoning their candidates for federal office. Secretary of State Alison Grimes, a Lexington resident, could have been particularly persuasive since she is Gray’s constituent and familiar to the Fancy Farm crowd. But, like other Democrats in Kentucky, she appears to have lost hope that Gray can mount a serious challenge.

Grimes enjoyed a united Democratic front in her bid against Mitch McConnell in 2014, with state Democratic leaders going all out to unseat Kentucky’s senior senator. She did not pay it forward.

Grimes had time for a Fancy Farm photo shoot on Thursday of last week, driving all the way out to the picnic grounds with her father to pose under the empty pavilion. But on Saturday, like the farmer in the dell’s cheese, Gray was left to stand alone against the onslaught of Paul and McConnell, who smartly tied Gray to Barack Obama and Clinton. Grimes is clearly not a fan of the movie Top Gun; otherwise, she’d know that leaving your wingman is a big no-no in dogfights.

A survey conducted last week by Harper Polling, a Republican firm, found just 60 percent of registered Democrats supporting Gray at this point, and only 54 percent supporting Clinton. Had other Democrats bolstered Gray on the stage, a much different narrative for his oxygen-starved campaign could have emerged. Gray needs Democrats to believe he’s got a chance to make this a real race, but if his own party leaders don’t seem to have faith in him, why would the grassroots or donor class? Mustering pity for Democratic Senate candidates isn’t something this space does often, but we’ll make an exception in this case.

President – The same Harper Poll showed Donald Trump leading Clinton in Kentucky, 49 percent to 36 percent. That result was to be expected, even as national polling shows Clinton with a sizeable lead.

One dubious metric in the national polling is that both candidates are suffering from a massive trust deficit. The next president of the United States, no matter who wins, is likely to be, in the eyes of a majority of Americans, dishonest and untrustworthy.

Jennings | When liberal thought police descend

In March 2014, a CNN national poll found that 55 percent of Americans found Clinton to be honest. This presidential campaign has wreaked havoc on her image, even as she has gutted out a primary and taken a lead in the general election. Trump’s recent trust problems can be linked to his back-and-forth with the Muslim parents of Capt. Humayun Khan, an American soldier killed in Iraq, which has boosted Clinton in the polls.

This weekend’s Washington Post / ABC News survey showed just 38 percent of voters find Clinton “honest and trustworthy,” four points better than Trump’s 34 percent. Clinton’s trust leak has happened over a long period of time through numerous scandals, culminating with this summer’s damning words from FBI Director James Comey that she was “extremely careless” with sensitive national security information.

Once trust is lost in politics it is difficult to regain. A question for both candidates is, if they win, how to govern when so many Americans have trouble believing them. A new president typically enjoys a honeymoon period with the American people, but will that be the case in 2017?

One way the 45th president can recover credibility is to run a transparent, well-organized transition process that draws on experts from around the country to build the best possible government. Two federal laws—one enacted in 2010 and the other in 2015—have allowed both Clinton and Trump access to federal office space in Washington to plan their government. A smooth presidential transition can help restore confidence after this brutal campaign.

Scott Jennings is emcee for this year’s Fancy Farm picnic.

It’s that time of the year when the commonwealth’s politicos, journalists, and barbecue lovers prepare to trek down to the Jackson Purchase region of Western Kentucky for the annual Fancy Farm picnic, which takes place Saturday, Aug. 6, at the St. Jerome Catholic Church.

We are closing an epic four-year run at Fancy Farm that featured a series of hotly contested statewide elections and newcomers to the political scene. This year finds us in the middle of another race for the U.S. Senate, and with two constitutional officers fighting as much in courtrooms as they are in the court of public opinion.

It should make for a memorable Fancy Farm, which has continuously been a key stop for Kentucky’s politicians since 1880. It is a loud, hot, rowdy venue forcing politicians to bring their “A games” on the first Saturday in August.

Here’s what to expect from the invited speakers:

Gov. Matt Bevin (R) – Kentucky’s new chief magistrate has shaken up Frankfort and performed brilliantly in tackling the messes left behind by his predecessor, thrilling conservatives across the state. Bevin has banished a pervasive timidity that had taken hold on the first floor of the State Capitol and replaced it with a culture of fearlessness when it comes to using the full executive authority of his office. This has rankled Attorney General Andy Beshear and House Speaker Greg Stumbo, who are desperately trying to stop Bevin via the courts. To move even faster on his policy goals, Bevin could use the help of a Republican-controlled House of Representatives, and the picnic provides a great forum to make his case. There’s no pressure on Bevin this year and you can expect the impressive public speaker, like a leadoff hitter with a “two-ball-and-no strikes” count, to hammer out a solid speech.

Sen. Rand Paul (R) – Kentucky’s junior senator faces reelection after an unsuccessful run for president. Paul has quickly regained his local focus and just posted a much-improved fundraising quarter showing twice as much cash as his opponent. Paul delivers interesting messages at Fancy Farm and this year’s presidential race allows him to tee off on the perfect foil for Republicans – Hillary Clinton, who may run worse in Kentucky than Barack Obama.

Lexington Mayor Jim Gray (D) – The Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate will make his first appearance at the historic podium, and the chance to make a positive impression can’t come soon enough as whispers abound in political circles that Gray is in over his head. Gray needs a message that separates himself from his national party while holding liberal Democrats in his camp, a conundrum not solved by any Democrat running for U.S. Senate in Kentucky since 1992.

U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell (R) – Gray’s lack of name recognition makes it unlikely that the Senate Majority Leader will serve as attack dog for Rand Paul. The smart play is to ignore Gray and focus on Clinton, who provides endless fodder. McConnell should take a victory lap on Republican advances in Western Kentucky, given the positive trends in voter registration and Republican victories he helped engineer over the years.

Kentucky State House –Expect the tense battle for control to permeate speeches on both sides of the aisle. Republicans will argue they can move faster on economic development and critical reforms with full control, and Democrats will say that divided government produces solid compromises that reign in the worst impulses of Republicans to cut education and health care. The Kentucky State House, controlled by Democrats for the last 100 years, is the last southern legislative chamber not flying a GOP flag.

Presidential campaign – Both the Trump and Clinton campaigns have been invited to send surrogates, but Kentucky isn’t a target state for either and local speakers may handle the duties. Clinton’s closest ally in Kentucky is Secretary of State Alison Grimes, while Kentucky State Sen. Ralph Alvarado hit a home run for Donald Trump during his speech at the Republican National Convention. Both campaigns would do well to tap these two for surrogate work.

First Congressional District – This is the swan song for Congressman Ed Whitfield, a Fancy Farm fixture since his election to the U.S. House in 1994. Whitfield’s retirement makes way for Jamie Comer, the former Agriculture Commissioner who is all-but-certain to win the seat after his victory in the May Republican primary.

Not Attending: Attorney General Andy Beshear (D) – It has been a rough year for Beshear. He lost his top deputy to a federal indictment for bribery and another top staffer quit following a DUI arrest. Now he’s tangling in court with Gov. Bevin on a routine basis. There are some who want Beshear to follow in his father’s footsteps, but he’ll need better sledding to make a go of it in 2019. Skipping Fancy Farm is a missed opportunity for the younger Beshear.

If you go, say hello to picnic organizer Mark Wilson, one of the most affable guys in Western Kentucky. And think in advance about your answer to a key question: pork or mutton? The barbecue and carnival games support the church, so take cash and spend generously!

Here lies Doug Cobb’s reputation. He had the audacity to express an opinion unpopular with the enlightened, liberal intelligentsia.

I don’t know Doug Cobb, where he lives or even what he does for a living these days. All I know is that Gov. Matt Bevin appointed the founding president and CEO of Greater Louisville, Inc. to the University of Louisville Board of Trustees, a post Cobb later declined after a feeding frenzy among reporters who found it outrageous that Cobb had tweeted opinions contrary to their own.

I don’t necessarily agree with some of Cobb’s tweets, which were breathlessly reported by the bloodthirsty thought police who turned his opinions on Christianity, global warming and sports into a shooting gallery at their ridiculous carnival. But Cobb has a right to express an opinion, and we should be mortified that our town’s unelected information gatekeepers are personally deciding not only who is fit to serve but what opinions disqualify someone from serving.

The blow-by-blow reporting on Cobb’s tweets, recited like some criminal’s rap sheet, reminded me of an old headline in The Onion, a satire newspaper—“Report: Every Potential 2040 President Already Unelectable Due To Facebook.”

Never mind the presidency. Social media has rendered ineligible a guy willing to provide his considerable expertise to an unelected, unpaid board at a local university. I looked through the Kentucky Revised Statutes to determine if tweeting about global warming or basketball disqualifies someone from serving, but found none. I did find a law about requiring a proportional ratio of Republicans and Democrats on university boards, but the thought police must’ve missed that one when former Gov. Steve Beshear, a like-minded liberal, brazenly broke it.

Cobb undoubtedly holds opinions that aren’t popular among the thought troopers who spend their time making fun of the Ark Encounter or of older folks, as they did when pejoratively labeling University of Louisville President James Ramsey “granddaddy” on their own Twitter accounts. And I am sure there are some who believe that people shouldn’t be appointed to public boards who hold unpopular or unproven views.

But our system entrusts our elected representative – Gov. Bevin – to appoint most anyone he wants as long as they meet basic statutory requirements. Don’t like an appointment? Go vote for someone else in 2019; that’s how our system works.

Furthermore, Cobb’s views, while certainly in conflict with the science community and Rick Pitino fan club, are not necessarily out of step with many (most?) Kentuckians. One offensive tweet cited by the thought police concerned Cobb’s opinion that a U of L sports team had “choked” in the NCAA tournament, leaving readers to believe an opinion about sports made him unfit to serve. Who among us has not used the word “choke” to describe a favorite sports team after a tough loss? There won’t be a qualified person left among us!

The question isn’t whether Cobb is right or wrong about evolution, global warming, the tenets of Christianity, or sports teams choking, but whether simply expressing his opinion should have subjected him to public annihilation. The feeding frenzy over Cobb’s Twitter account exposed the core operating principle of the thought police: they will make your life miserable until you conform or retreat.

Oh, thank you, Lord, for sending the Enlightened Few to keep the rest of us in line. We stand in awe of their mystical ability to retweet each other. We deserve our public floggings until our opinions improve.

The gatekeepers will say they are doing their duty. I have no problem with making Cobb’s views known; after all, he made them public himself. But the manner in which it was done – malicious, with intent to kill Cobb’s reputation and appointment – chilled many folks to the bone.

What’s the result of all this beyond Cobb’s banishment? The dissuasion of conservatives previously interested in public service who will now recede, fearful of having their own tweets pored over more carefully than Hillary Clinton’s emails at FBI headquarters. The bullies have won this round.

I have a friend who says “Twitter is the Devil.” He says mindlessly retweeting something today can come back to haunt you in five minutes or five years. But who is really the Devil? Twitter itself, or the trolls who trot out old, random thoughts to castigate conservatives who dare set foot in the public square?

Cobb was appointed to the board of a public university, formerly paragons of the First Amendment and public debate. These days, though, anyone who strays from the doctrine of the liberal thought police need not apply (read The Atlantic’s “The Chilling Effect of Fear at America’s Colleges.”).

We should all fear a world in which free thought is muted by a cynical, angry mob that delights in destroying reputations, especially those of conservative Christians who dare think of volunteering for public service. This Cobb episode embodies everything regular people hate about our media culture, and the liberals who happily mock people in the name of ensuring that non-conforming opinions are run out of their enlightened town.

Know a famous Kentuckian not in our gallery? Nominate him or her in the comments, and be sure to say why they should be included.

With the world’s eyes on Louisville for the funeral of Muhammad Ali, many called the champion boxer the most famous person in the world, at least for a portion of his life.

Measuring fame is tricky, but there is widespread agreement that Ali surpassed all others in his heyday. What other Kentuckians could claim the title of “most famous” during their lifetimes, and who actually holds the distinction now that Ali is gone? An obvious place to start is politics, where Kentucky has produced its share of outsized celebrities, according to Kentucky state historian Dr. James Klotter.

“In Henry Clay's era, the politicians were treated like rock stars. When Clay spoke once, over 100,000 turned out to see him and perhaps hear him,” Klotter said of the 19th-century statesmen, who served in the U.S. House and Senate, was nominated for president three times, and crafted the Great Compromise of 1850. “In his era,” Klotter says, “Clay was the best-known figure.”

Klotter, a professor of history at Georgetown College, offers other Kentuckians from that time: Presidents Abraham Lincoln and Zachary Taylor – Taylor was famous for his exploits in the Mexican War before winning The White House – and John C. Breckinridge, who by age 40 had been state representative, congressman, the youngest vice president up to that time and a presidential candidate in 1860.

Jennings | Memoir shows McConnell's human side

One issue to consider is measuring momentary fame versus lasting societal impact, a point raised by history professor Melissa McEuen of Transylvania University.

“If we take Ali's commitment to civil rights as the basis for his legacy and use it as the framework … I think immediately of Anne Braden, Georgia Davis Powers, George Clooney, A.B. ‘Happy’ Chandler, Wendell Berry, Madeline McDowell Breckinridge and Abraham Lincoln. Other Kentuckians may have enjoyed greater fame in their lifetimes, such as Floyd Collins, whose cave entrapment stoked sensationalist stories in print and on radio in the 1920s, but the accomplishments of these individuals are significant and long-lasting: persistent challenges to racial segregation, poverty, environmental abuses and slavery, to name just a few,” McEuen said.

McEuen highlights Lexington’s Madeline McDowell Breckinridge, “the great-granddaughter of Henry Clay and Kentucky's foremost Progressive Era reformer. Breckinridge worked to improve public education, to create a juvenile justice system, to generate better health care (especially tuberculosis treatment), and to secure suffrage for women. As an officer of the National American Woman Suffrage Association, Breckinridge traveled widely and spoke in support of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. She saw it ratified in her lifetime and cast her vote in the 1920 election, a few weeks before she died.” Check out McEuen’s Kentucky Women: Their Lives and Times for more.

In 1784, frontiersman Daniel Boone became a household name with the publishing of a ghost-written autobiography entitled ""The Discovery, Settlement and Present State of Kentucke"" . . . to which is added an appendix, Containing the Adventures of Col. Daniel Boon, written by John Filson, Kentucky’s first historian and well-known in his own right.

Jennings | Trump can be the Find It candidate

At the turn of the 20th century, “Kentucky writers had 5 of 10 places on the 1903 best-seller list, and Annie Fellows Johnston's ""Little Colonel"" series, set in Pewee Valley, became a staple for a generation of young readers,” according to Klotter. The series proved the power of books to propel a name. Just ask authors Sue Grafton, whose popular “Alphabet Series” of crime novels is read by millions, or “gonzo journalist” and fellow Louisvillian Hunter S. Thompson.

Advancing to the 20th and 21st centuries, Klotter posits three more politicians: Louisa’s Fred Vinson (U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice from 1946-53 who began to break down racial segregation), Paducah’s Alben Barkley (U.S. Senate Majority Leader and Vice President from 1949-53), and Louisville’s Mitch McConnell, the current Senate Majority Leader.

“At the 1949 inaugural, Kentuckian Vinson swears in Truman, whose grandparents had Kentucky ties, and Justice Stanley Reed from Kentucky gives the oath to Vice President Barkley, of Paducah,” Klotter said.

In the 20th century, several sports, entertainment and business personalities emerged. Baseball Hall of Famers Earle Combs (a New York Yankee from Owsley County) and “Pee Wee” Reese (the Brooklyn Dodger from Louisville who embraced Jackie Robinson) were household names. Adolph Rupp, John Calipari, and Rick Pitino became world-famous basketball coaches here, but none were Bluegrass born. Several internationally known musicians arose from Kentucky – Bill Monroe, Loretta Lynn, and The Judds top the list.

Jennings | Rise of the authoritarians

Three Kentuckians are world-famous food wizards, but only one was born here: Duncan Hines, the Bowling Green native known first for travel food writing and then for baking products that bear his name to this day. Colonel Harland Sanders (Kentucky Fried Chicken) and “Papa” John Schnatter (pizza) were born in Indiana but their names and brands are synonymous with Kentucky. Colonel Sanders became a world-famous mascot for KFC after he sold it in 1965 and was the second-most recognized celebrity in 1976 (Ali was number one).

The highly influential “inventor of Hollywood” hails from Oldham County. D.W. Griffith directed the groundbreaking Birth of a Nation in 1916 and “transformed movie-making,” according to Klotter. And Hollywood today may hold the most famous living Kentuckian, likely either Jennifer Lawrence (Louisville), Tom Cruise (not native but lived in Louisville), Johnny Depp (Owensboro) or George Clooney (Lexington). An honorable mention goes to television journalist Diane Sawyer.

Success in politics flows from four virtues: goal setting, planning, patience and teamwork, according to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s just-released memoir ""The Long Game"" (Sentinel, 278 pages, $28), which details the perseverance required of Kentucky’s longest-serving senator to beat polio, overcome the Kentucky Democratic machine and outmaneuver Washington’s sharp-elbowed elite.

David Williams, a McConnell ally and former Kentucky Senate president, used to say, “Instant coffee ruined the world. You need to let things percolate.” Williams dealt with his share of impatient politicians desirous of fame and glory after walking the halls of government for five minutes. In a world brimming with Keurig-style politicos, McConnell has deliberately brewed his success over time.

""The Long Game"" finds McConnell humbly treading through his upbringing in the Deep South, his family’s move to Kentucky and the decisions that ultimately led to successful runs for public office first in 1977 for Jefferson County Judge-Executive and then for U.S. Senate in 1984.

Overcoming polio at 4 shaped McConnell’s life. Born 12 years before Salk’s vaccine, he recalls his struggle to understand his beloved mother’s grueling treatment program. For two years, Julia McConnell kept her young son off his feet as she administered therapies to rescue him from potential paralysis. She explained to him that he could and would walk, but just not at that time.

Jennings | Trump can be the Find It candidate

It’s interesting to think of McConnell – just a toddler – enduring that brutal two-year cycle, overcoming long odds to beat an opponent that seemed insurmountable. Little did he know that his future would also be defined by similarly confounding and exasperating two-year campaign cycles with uncertain outcomes.

A theme for McConnell – from beating up schoolyard bully Dicky McGrew to winning Senate leadership elections before his opponents even knew they had started – is that his adversaries rarely see him coming. Often underestimated (we are going to “kick your ass…all over Kentucky,” a consultant to McConnell victim Dee Huddleston boasted in 1984), McConnell hammers the point that overconfidence can quickly undo any politician. Huddleston, for instance, failed to see McConnell’s famous bloodhounds coming until he was plum up the tree on election night.

McConnell’s deeply personal recollections remind us that the politicians we see vilified in campaign ads or skewered in the press are just people, with the same problems, anxieties, happiness and grief felt by most of us during the course of a lifetime. This memoir, given its candor about McConnell’s toughest times personally, reminds us that the mere act of seeking public office doesn’t make one immune from the stress of courtships, parenting, caring for and eventually burying aging parents and managing tough situations at work.

One shocking anecdote involves McConnell’s deep reflection in 2013 about whether to seek reelection the following year, fearing he could lose and cost the Republican Party a majority in the Senate. The thought of McConnell calling it quits on the eve of winning in a landslide and becoming Senate majority leader seems unfathomable today.

The book succeeds in revealing the very human emotions swirling inside of McConnell, including self-doubt. All of us have lain awake at night fretting over the risks and possible rewards of decisions to be made at work the following day. Am I doomed to fail and just don’t know it? If my job decision goes south, how will I provide for my family? McConnell had these thoughts in 1984 when he came home from a grueling day of campaign travel to find a tree in his yard split by lightning, his goldfish dead and his fed-up girlfriend gone forever (in a message delivered via answering machine, no less).

Jennings | Meeting of the GOP Establishment

McConnell was the first member of his family to finish college. He loved his parents deeply and grieved mightily when they died. He witnessed segregation and has demonstrated a lifelong commitment to civil rights, even voting for Lyndon Johnson over Barry Goldwater in 1964. He did not attend an Ivy League college, opting instead for the Universities of Louisville and Kentucky. He fathered three daughters and endured a divorce. When forced to take jobs for which he lacked passion, he became a restless soul.

His story is very human, very humble and very Kentucky.

He started with a dream, few advantages and plenty of obstacles, just like most of his constituents. And he reacts with the bemusement you’d expect from any up-from-his-bootstraps Kentuckian to becoming a national political figure, one whose every utterance now attracts attention: “Only in America could a bespectacled polio survivor who started out in this business with no contacts, no credentials and no money wake up one day at the age of seventy-two to find himself treated like a celebrity.”

For years, journalists have struggled to understand the winning ways of McConnell, someone they inaccurately portray as a cold, emotionless political operative lacking connectivity to average voters. ""The Long Game""serves as an education about McConnell the human being, whose life experiences form the fabric of his connection to the people of his old Kentucky home.

A favorite game in the Jennings' household is the Find It tube, a cylinder filled with beads and several random small objects. You don’t open it. You just look at it, endlessly turning it, displacing the beads, and checking items off the list as they appear. You see some of the stuff on the list over and over again, a maddening loop that has you looking up Find It’s mailing address so you can send them a strongly worded letter.

If you turn the cylinder long enough, your mind starts to see things that aren’t there. On top of that, there’s supposedly a penny hidden in every tube.

I've never seen the penny.

Out of anger, however, I’ve violently shaken the tube on the belief that it will magically appear when the beads settle.

Jennings | Meeting of the GOP Establishment

That method has never produced the penny, though I must admit it feels good for a few seconds. During that moment of shaking, my brain has reached three conclusions: A) We exhausted all rational ways to find the penny; B) Shaking this thing makes perfect sense because I am tired of waiting for a solution; and C) Man, it feels good to inflict damage on the Devil’s cylinder.

I’ve been thinking about the Find It tube lately because of Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president. Americans, searching for answers to our nation’s problems, angry after years of sifting through politicians and coming across the same stuff over and over again, are on the precipice of deciding whether to violently shake American politics.

Conditions are ripe. Anger among the electorate is so real that it fashioned one major party nominee and darn near another (the gravity-defying delegate rules of the Democratic Party prevented the anger from producing both).

People are fuming about various things (69 percent told CNN/ORC pollsters they were “very” or “somewhat” angry with the way things are going in America), generally speaking at a system increasingly viewed as rigged. Can’t find a better job? Can’t pay off your student debt? The system is rigged against you and favors the “powerful interests,” as 65 percent of Americans reported in a recent Pew Research survey.

Jennings | Trump's remarks on women ripe for Dems

Beyond that, we have a trust epidemic causing voters to tune out information from sources that in previous elections were considered reliable. U.S. News and World Report’s Ken Walsh wrote a piece last summer entitled: “Americans have lost confidence…in everything.” He’s right, and he points to Gallup’s confidence in institutions surveyed as evidence: “Americans have little confidence in most of their major institutions including Congress, the presidency, the Supreme Court, banks and organized religion, according to the latest Gallup poll.”

This also extends to the news media. A recent survey by the Media Insight Project found just 6 percent of Americans have “a lot of confidence” in media, about what they have in Congress. Americans are dismissive of information presented by media these days and often look for ways to disprove it. This puts us in an “alternate reality, a virtual reality, where lies are accepted as truth and where conspiracy theories take root in the fertile soil of falsehoods,” as Marty Baron, executive editor of The Washington Post, said in a recent speech.

Just last week we learned that Facebook employees filtered “trending” topics to suppress conservative news. Even our previously trusted source of organic news selected by computer algorithms and user interest may, in fact, be a censored propaganda machine rigged up by our Silicon Valley overlords. Is there any tree of trust left to climb in America?

Confronted with this perfect storm of anger and a crisis of confidence in institutions and information, what will America do? While this space has been skeptical of Trump’s chances of winning a general election, there is a growing possibility that American voters, sick and tired of looking for the elusive penny, will decide to violently shake the political cylinder just to see what happens by sending a wildcard like Trump to Washington. They doubt their shaking can make it any worse, so why not relieve their frustration? Especially when the alternative is another tired, mistrusted name produced by the same old rigged system.

Jennings | Rise of the authoritarians

Of course, there are persuasive arguments that any Republican – Trump included – faces long odds in taking back the White House. Democrats have a built-in Electoral College advantage of 242-102 (you need 270 to win) if you add up the states that have voted for the same party in each presidential election since 1992.

“The generic Democratic nominee starts with an electoral vote lead of 140, and...needs to find only 28 votes beyond that reliable base to win the presidency,” according to Chris Cillizza, who writes “The Fix” political blog for The Washington Post. That’s a perfectly rational, reasonable way to filter out the “Trump could win” theories for those who value data-driven handicapping over gut-level instinct.

But then again, America’s jaded and weary voters may shake their ballots as hard as they can this November in an effort to find the elusive penny, which to them represents a necessary reset of America’s broken political culture.

[Scene: Undisclosed smoke-filled backroom.]

OK, settle down everyone. You can discuss your portfolios and golf handicaps after we pick up our new suits at Brooks Brothers.

I hereby call this meeting of The Republican Establishment to order. It seems we have a quorum. Good turnout, actually. You guys must have a lot to talk about tonight!

Let’s start with old business. What’s on the agenda? Presidential race. Give us the report.

Going that well, eh? Hmm. What about Kasich? Any chance there? I know, I know. At the last meeting I forgot he was running and some dude gave me a hard time. Yes, I know he turned out to be a Democrat, but he was upset nonetheless.

Ryan? Love it, but he says no. Jeb? Golfing. Marco? Well, he does have more delegates than Kasich even a month after dropping out.

What the heck are we going to do? Doesn’t anyone have an idea?

Cruz? Cruz? Listen to yourselves! Ted freaking Cruz? The guy who called Mitch a liar? This would be a lot easier to swallow if he’d realize that unifying the party means, you know, unifying the party.

Let’s just wrap our brains around this for a second. Show of hands – who thinks Cruz is better than Trump? So we have some support for that idea.

What’s the polling say about who runs better against Hillary? I see that Trump’s down by almost 10 points and Cruz is nipping at her heels. You have my attention.

What about policy? Cruz actually supports conservative stuff. Does Trump? No, no he doesn’t. So you are telling me we can still have a conservative Republican Party if Cruz beats Trump? Maybe this is something we ought to look at.

On the other hand, the only thing Cruz ever accomplished was convincing 99 U.S. Senators to change the lock on the cloakroom door. Bipartisan consensus!

We’ll put this on the agenda at the next meeting in Cleveland for final action. Agreed? Good.

Alright, now to new business. Michael Pape. What’s a Michael Pape? Candidate for Congress? Where? Oh, Western Kentucky. First District.

Right, right. Ed Whitfield is retiring. Yes, good old Ed. Man, he was one of us. An Establishment oak.

Jennings | Trump's remarks on women ripe for Dems

So what’s the deal with Pape? He did what? He dressed up three guys like Mexicans with fake moustaches in a TV ad?

Hang on, hang on. We know this guy! Hasn’t he worked for Ed Whitfield for the last 22 years? Like, as an employee of the federal government?

Yes, of course! He’s got two jobs for Ed! He’s his top adviser, and he’s the chauffeur! I knew I’d seen him somewhere.

So let me get this straight – a dude who has worked his entire career for The Establishment now claims he’s going to build a wall to keep actors pretending to be Mexicans who have better grammar than most of us out of America?

Also, someone from the Wardrobe Committee please call Pape and let him know that blue flannel over a black dickey is not exactly normal dress for The Establishment. Actually, tell him it’s not normal dress for anyone. Gee whiz.

Look, I get it. Pape’s cruising toward a massive federal pension from all of his years chauffeuring Ed and working as a federal bureaucrat. But if he could cool it on the disingenuous race baiting and fashion crimes that would be terrific. After he loses to Jamie Comer we’ll take him back on the condition that he stops dressing like Cousin Eddie and some lumberjack trainee had a baby.

What else? How’s Governor Bevin doing? I know he hasn’t exactly been to our meetings, but most of his staff has. Bevin’s being attacked by the Tea Party? This is their guy!

They are upset about REAL ID? As opposed to what, fake ID? If I were back on campus at the University of Louisville I’d be where the fringe is on this – fake IDs for all of us, am I right? Kidding, kidding.

Jennings | Rise of the authoritarians

Our party still opposes terrorism, doesn’t it? Give me a break. Good for Bevin for having common sense on that one. Motion to support Bevin passes.

By the way, did you guys see the huge wins Bevin scored for conservatives in Frankfort? He brought home a solid budget that actually addresses the pension crisis, and he cut serious spending across state government. Sharp contrast to the last eight years. Maybe voters will send Bevin reinforcements in November. We can only hope…and donate generously!

OK, what else? How’s the U.S. Senate looking? Thank the good Lord above for Mitch McConnell. He’s raising money hand over fist to protect the Republican majority firewall in the U.S. Senate. He’s standing tall on Scalia’s seat, too. The motion to make the sound of Schumer weeping and gnashing teeth the soundtrack of our summer barbecue passes unanimously.

It’s getting late, guys. We need a motion to adjourn. It is two-for-one margarita night at Chili’s! Just don’t tell Pape. He’ll be stacking Legos around anyone who orders the fajitas.

Last one to the bar is a rotten RINO!​

“I don’t remember anyone as extreme as Mitt Romney,” the concerned looking woman said, over and over again, on the television in my office in Columbus, Ohio.

The woman - appearing in an Obama for America television ad - was part of a strategy to portray a future in which a Romney administration would outlaw all abortions (even in the case of rape, incest, or the life of the mother) and birth control.

I watched this woman on my television and computer screen from my perch as Romney’s campaign director in Ohio in 2012. While I imagined her memory was pretty bad if she couldn’t remember anyone as “extreme” as Romney, I knew in my gut her argument was resonating. You could feel it.

Unfortunately, my gut was right. Romney lost women in Ohio 55 percent to 44 percent, according to exit polls. While Romney won all white voters 57 percent to 41 percent, he won just 53 percent of white women.

Jennings | Rise of the authoritarians

Beyond contraception and abortion, the Obama campaign argued that Romney would single out women for punishment when it came to equal pay, education funding, and other areas of concern for female voters. The poor woman on my television screen feared the “extreme” Mitt Romney building a time machine to transport her to the 1950s. Or the 1850s. Or whatever year she considered the worst time in human history for a woman to be alive.

All of these accusations were outrageously false. If you think Mitt Romney is “extreme” in any way, you probably aren’t drinking skim milk for fear of it being too spicy. Romney’s position on abortion was pretty mainstream - he opposed it, but with exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother. He did not wish to remove all birth control from pharmacy shelves.

But of course in presidential campaigns, the truth doesn’t matter. The Obama campaign knew that peeling off a few white female voters with that message in Ohio would likely preclude Mitt Romney from winning the Buckeye State.

And they were right.

Ricky Jones | Why I love Donald Trump

I revisit Romney’s troubles to make a key point: If you are a Republican who was frustrated with the way female voters ultimately viewed the 2012 GOP nominee, you will be sitting in a corner sucking your thumb and muttering “make it stop” by the time Hillary Clinton’s campaign is through with Donald J. Trump.

The evidence is already mounting that Trump, if he succeeds in getting the GOP nomination, will be the “least-popular candidate to represent either party in modern times,” according to a recent analysis by The Washington Post. The article by reporters Robert Costa and Phillip Rucker points out that Trump is already viewed unfavorably by three-quarters of female voters in their outlet’s recent polling.

The worst female-focused gaffe Romney committed during the 2012 campaign was referring to his “binders full of women,” a phrase he uttered in the second debate against Obama when describing his record on appointing highly qualified females to his gubernatorial administration in Massachusetts (gasp! the horror!).

Oh, we will look back fondly on the days of Mitt’s “binders” if Trump becomes the GOP nominee. In the past week, he has defended his campaign manager who was charged with battery after laying hands on a female reporter at an event, and he suggested “punishment” for women who have abortions in the future. Trump’s views on pro-life issues are incoherent and not conservative. They distort the pro-life movement, which is about protecting babies, not hating mothers.

Trump’s problems with women go much, much deeper than these two items, however. Imagine a campaign in which women are put in front of television cameras to read aloud Trump’s on-the-record views on women.

Oh, wait, we don’t have to imagine this. Our Principles PAC, an independent expenditure group running anti-Trump ads, has already done it. (Watch it here: https://goo.gl/TJTQQh)

Imagine this kind of advertising running all fall. Because it will happen.

“Women,” Trump once said, “You have to treat them like sh--.”

“A person who is very flat-chested is very hard to be a 10,” Trump said of a famous actress.

“She’s got a good body, just put a bag on her head,” Trump said of another.

“She was at the wedding and I got extremely angry because she ate almost the entire wedding cake,” Trump said of his second wife.

There’s no room in the Republican Party of the future for Trump’s demeaning views. A true conservative believes in the inherent value of every individual, regardless of gender, race, class, or creed.

Fortunately, it appears the air is seeping from the Trump balloon as we barrel toward a possible contested convention this summer in Cleveland. It’s a good thing, too. The Obama campaign skillfully put words in Romney’s mouth and successfully attributed positions to him that were bald-faced lies.

Imagine what Democratic operatives will do with Trump’s statements, which are irrefutable and beyond reprehensible. There won’t be enough binders to hold the voter rolls of women stampeding to their polling places in November to vote against him.

“Who are you supporting for President?” my buddy said to the man at the airport bar.

“Donald Trump!” the man replied without hesitation.

“Why?”

“Well,” said the man, “I hate my boss, I hate my job, and Trump is going to tell them all to go to hell.”

I haven't heard a better explanation of the Republican primary for president.

At the core of Trump’s candidacy is a call for greater executive authority, with willful disregard for the constitutional limits placed on our chief executive. Trump specifically promises to force individual companies to do things he wants them to do, or else. He promises punishment to those who displease him, which appeals to the miserable man at the airport bar.

Take Ford Motor Co., which has factories in Mexico (it also has many factories in the U.S., including Louisville). The Detroit Free Press reported on Trump’s threats against Ford:

""Within 24 to 48 hours I will get a call from the head of Ford and he will say, 'Mr. President, we have decided we're going to build our new plant in the United States.' ... That's 100 percent sure. ... They're going to say, 'We're moving back. You want us to move to Michigan?' And I'll say, 'Yeah,'"" the newspaper wrote of Trump’s boasts.

Brussels spotlights Trump security threat: Max Boot

Trump previously threatened to slap a 35% tariff on Ford vehicles manufactured in Mexico as punishment for not following his orders. Never mind that Ford invests heavily in the United States already or that the president has no constitutional authority to single out any company for taxation.

And then there’s Apple, which Trump proclaims he will force to make their “damn” products in America. Never mind, as Forbes points out, that Apple already manufactures products in the U.S. (including part of the iPhone in Kentucky), or that the president has no constitutional authority to tell any company where to make stuff.

Ford and Apple can go to hell, Trump says, as we desperately search for that article of the Constitution enabling such a government-mandated trip.

Conservatives railed the past seven years against the imperial presidency of Barack Obama, in which he abused executive authority, bypassed Congress, and wielded the federal regulatory regime against companies he doesn’t like, such as coal operators (and now Hillary Clinton promises the same).

“He’s not a king,” Sen. Rand Paul once said of Obama, a line that used to kill at Republican Party Lincoln Dinners. But would it among Trump supporters?

I was talking to a reporter writing about Trump’s rise due to “anger in the party and how the grassroots element seems to be mad at the establishment.” There’s no doubt, I told him, that people are angry, and that so-called establishment candidates are taking a beating. But that’s how the press explained the rise of the tea party in 2010.

That anger boosted candidates like Paul and Ted Cruz, who passionately railed against executive overreach in their successful campaigns for U.S. Senate. Today, Trump argues for more executive power. Much more. A scary amount. People are still angry, but Trump proposes the opposite remedy to an electorate that at least a portion of which used to believe their problems were rooted in Obama’s executive overkill.

POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media

News coverage simply explaining Trump’s support as “angry voters” misses this critical point. Republicans must not abandon the notion of a restrained presidency in favor of a rampaging executive unbound by facts or the Constitution.

The rise of an authoritarian figure like Trump should be anathema to the angry tea partiers who gave us Paul and Cruz, who consider a president using the levers of taxation to punish their enemies a serious threat to our nation. Surely we haven’t forgotten Obama’s IRS targeting his political enemies.

Do voters who previously hated Obama’s imperialism suddenly want more? Is it as simple as wanting to tell those they blame for any misery that has befallen them “to go to hell?”

For some, perhaps. It may also be that they have given up on everything else. Gallup’s “confidence in institutions” survey found just 8% of American have “a great deal” or “quite a lot” of confidence in Congress, which is supposed to find solutions to national problems. Television and newspapers score just over 20%, institutions which are supposed to tell us the truth. Trump’s core supporters don’t believe anything the press says, as National Journal’s Josh Kraushaar observed.

People hate Congress, and people hate the media. Trump’s campaign is a war on both (literally, it seems, with the allegation surfacing that Trump’s campaign manager physically assaulted a reporter after a press conference last Tuesday). All else has failed, and so, through Trump, the angry, exasperated voters are telling them “to go to hell.”

Goodness knows Congress and the media establishment deserve our enmity. But the answer is not electing a president ignorant of the Constitution, his only guiding principle to tell the world “to go to hell.” Surely we are better than that. Conservatives, no matter how angry, should reject Trump’s short-term salve, which might kill the pain today but may lead to a more damaging infection tomorrow.

The 2016 presidential election will be the first featuring voters who don’t remember 9/11, folks who were then three to six years old who did not comprehend the shock, anger and tears as the second plane hit the World Trade Center. Heck, just seven years later in 2008, many voters had forgotten the lessons of 9/11 by voting for Barack Obama, who has been a foreign policy disaster.

Almost 15 years later, the threat of Islamic terrorism is multiplying. While President George W. Bush kept our homeland safe after 9/11, a pullback of American leadership during the Obama administration has emboldened radical Islamic terrorists, who, in addition to killing people themselves, inspire others like the shooters in San Bernardino to commit horrific acts against freedom-loving people everywhere.

The next president must be willing to accept the world as it is – a place filled with radical jihadists who surely laugh when Obama refuses to call them what they are. That person must be informed and have the judgment to forge the international alliances necessary to defeat this dangerous enemy.

Following South Carolina, it is increasingly possible that the Republican Party could nominate Donald Trump, who once said he receives his foreign policy advice by watching “the shows” on Sunday morning. What else would you expect from a reality-TV-star-come-presidential candidate? TV created him, and TV advises him. Judge Judy for Supreme Court, anyone?

After three nominating contests, three general spheres are in play: Trump’s, which he occupies alone; the Cruz sphere, which he occupies with Ben Carson; and the Rubio/Bush/Kasich sphere, which, with Jeb Bush’s exit, Marco Rubio controls but needs to consolidate further.

Donald Trump’s sphere isn’t going anywhere. No opposition research will shake loose Trump’s core voters; indeed, his foreign policy statements at the South Carolina debate would have seemed extreme at a Code Pink rally, yet it mattered not to his people.

In the first three GOP contests, (Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina), Trump received about 32 percent of the 1.2 million votes cast. His Real Clear Politics national polling average on Feb. 22 was 34 percent. The Trump sphere currently occupies one-third of the GOP, not enough to win the nomination if the field narrows soon.

The Cruz/Carson sphere needs to consolidate immediately to give it a chance. Cruz has won about 21 percent of all votes, and his national polling average is 20.6 percent; Carson has won 6.4 percent of all votes, and his national polling average is 6.6 percent. If most of Carson’s voters (primarily evangelical Tea Partiers) choose Cruz once their man hangs it up, then Cruz could reasonably control about one-quarter (or slightly more) of the GOP. One caveat: Trump performed better than expected with evangelicals in South Carolina; Cruz needs to keep Carson’s voters on the reservation, something that could be difficult given the “dirty tricks” story after Iowa.

The Rubio/Bush/Kasich sphere is the largest but needs to consolidate further. Rubio has received 19.8 percent of all votes, and his national polling average is 16 percent. Bush received 7.8 percent of all votes against a national polling average of 5.4 percent. Kasich has received 8.7 percent of all votes, about what his national polling average is. Let’s assume that Rubio and Kasich split most of Bush’s share, acknowledging that some could leak to the other two. That leaves the Rubio/Kasich sphere occupying as much as 40 percent of the GOP, the largest of the three.

Kasich is running a campaign designed to force a contested convention. Between March 1 and 15, there are 27 contests. Kasich is competitive in just five to seven of them (Michigan, Illinois and Ohio are the biggest), whereas Rubio is competitive everywhere. Rubio could use those delegates to win the nomination; Kasich just wants convention currency. Kasich, Ohio’s governor but a Pennsylvania native, may not have filed enough signatures in his birth state to appear on the ballot, according to sources in the Keystone State. He’s simply not running a national campaign.

There are three real candidates left. Trump and Cruz are far more likely to lose a general election than Rubio. The true path to a GOP victory is for Kasich to drop out, allowing for a consolidation behind Rubio. Unlike Cruz, Rubio has consistently voted to strengthen our military and intelligence capabilities. Far beyond Trump, Rubio has demonstrated the rhetoric, record, policy command and judgment to deal with the threats posed by radical Islamic jihadists.

If Trump is running against a fractured field, he will continue to rack up delegates. Trouble comes in a two- or three-man contest, in which case Cruz and Rubio become serious threats. Indeed, Trump needs a bizarro version of Kentucky’s state motto to continue his grip on the process – a GOP divided and Trump stands, a GOP united and Trump falls.

It is unlikely that Trump would defeat either Cruz or Rubio in a head-to-head match up. Rubio is now the GOP’s best hope for a nominee who can defeat Hillary Clinton and keep us safe. Let’s hope for a Rubio versus Trump match up as soon as possible.

“Let me tell you why the Bush tax cuts are terrible for someone like you,” he said, displaying the same aplomb and glee for debate I remembered from years earlier.

It was 2005, and, even on a busy day at The White House, I gladly took the call from Dr. Paul Weber, the first Director of the McConnell Center at the University of Louisville and my undergraduate academic mentor. I was a 27-year-old staffer for President George W. Bush, talking to an old friend who set me on course for the most interesting job I ever had.

Our free-flowing debates had challenged me since the spring of 1996, when Weber talked me out of going to another college and into accepting the McConnell Scholarship. He was always cogent and entertaining, and he taught me to be agile in my arguments, a useful skill in my line of work.

I chuckled as he made his case, recalling those old days in a sweltering Ford Hall, where he taught us to think deeply about the issues shaping our politics and our world.

The discussions Dr. Weber had with students during McConnell Center gatherings and political science classes are precious memories from a four-year educational experience that a country boy like me could never have imagined growing up. That’s the beauty of this scholarship – they find kids interested in leadership and civic engagement and then give them a four-year experience not available anywhere else in the world.

This year marks the 25th anniversary of the McConnell Center’s founding. It has turned out more than 200 “McConnell Scholars” and dispensed $3.5 million in scholarships. Weber directed the center from its founding in 1991 until 2000, when he handed the reins over to Dr. Gary Gregg, who has taken it to levels far beyond what I experienced in its early days. Gregg’s leadership has been nothing short of brilliant.

The McConnell Center programming in its current iteration is stunning – speeches by high-profile political and world leaders (a president, vice president, speaker of the House, Supreme Court justices, just to name a few), workshops to encourage a deeper understanding of Kentucky perennial issues and the U.S. Constitution, and international travel create a robust academic experience for students already getting a high-quality bachelor’s degree from U of L.

The center chooses 10 students each year to receive a four-year scholarship, so long as they, at least, minor in political science, keep a strong GPA, provide community service in Louisville, and participate in the rigorous McConnell Center programming. Even Ivy League kids don’t get access to the people and experiences you find at the McConnell Center.

“I don’t know of another program in the nation that has our unique blend of liberal education and career development,” Dr. Gregg tells me. “We bring in scholarly experts and award-winning authors from around the nation to lecture, lead seminars, and mentor our students. We are a school without boundaries and with a limitless faculty. The average Ivy League student never has the kind of opportunities offered to McConnell Scholars.”

The McConnell Center has grown since Weber’s day to educate important groups beyond its students. McConnell Center staff have spent thousands of hours in professional development training with Kentucky teachers and with U.S. Army personnel in Strategic Broadening Seminars. The McConnell Center is only the second civilian institution ever to be asked to provide this kind of programming.

“It’s fulfilling work,” Dr. Gregg says. “Soldiers are taking the lessons back to their units, multiplying our impact throughout the Army. What we do is a concentrated version of what we have been doing for the McConnell Scholars. We provide them an environment in which to think, learn, grow, and prepare to lead. We offer lessons from history, literature, philosophy and politics that we are convinced makes them better leaders and soldiers.”

But even as it grows to train people other than college students, the mission of the center will always focus most on its undergraduate scholars, Dr. Gregg says.

“The quality of the applicants for the McConnell Scholars program has risen steadily over the last 20 years. ACT scores are higher, GPAs are higher, students are more engaged in leadership and service in high school, and they are more dedicated than ever to serving our commonwealth.”

***

I came home to Louisville for Weber’s funeral in 2005, just a few months after that phone call. It was the most joyous memorial I’ve ever attended, replete with a rendition of “When the Saints Go Marching In.” Many wept that day for the loss of someone who truly altered the trajectory of so many lives for the better.

Although Weber has been gone 10 years now, the center he pioneered lives on, continuing his mission of identifying, recruiting and nurturing Kentucky's next generation of great leaders. Kentucky high school seniors with a passion for leadership, scholarship and service – the center’s guiding principles – should consider applying to what has become one of the most prestigious and impactful scholarship programs in the nation.

Dispatch from a recent trip to Rwanda and Tanzania to see the results of American foreign aid programming.

The view from high in the mountains of northern Rwanda is breathtaking, both for the arrestingly lush green scenery and for the plight of the roughly 14,000 people who make their home in the Gihembe refugee camp, where I found myself on a recent Wednesday.

You see as many American flags in the camp as Rwandan; aid workers wear the Stars and Stripes on their shirts and banners everywhere say, “from the American people.” Wander by the poultry operation and you’ll find our flag over the door. The projection of American power to these Congolese refugees comes in the form of baby formula and chickens, not military equipment.

Yoko Matsumoto, an American aid worker from California, smiles as she introduces us to some of the women and children who make up over half of the camp’s population. She tells me that American intervention has eliminated instances of HIV/AIDS transmission from mothers to babies.

It is one thing to read about American goodwill in an abstract briefing paper and quite another to see the results firsthand.

Foreign aid helps us achieve many American objectives, such as fighting terrorism and following through on our “moral beliefs and values,” expert Ray Offenheiser writes. Conservatives should embrace the view that foreign aid has a vital place alongside a strong military when it comes to creating a world safe for American values and commerce. The Republican Party’s legacy on the matter is clear.

“The ultimate importance to the United States of our security and development assistance programs cannot be exaggerated. The programs … in these bills will enable the United States to continue its contribution to the achievement of a secure and stable international environment,” President Ronald Reagan said when signing International Security and Foreign Assistance legislation in 1981.

But today’s candidates frequently face voters with long-held misperceptions about what we actually spend on foreign aid in the federal budget. A Kaiser Family Foundation poll in 2013 found that, on average, Americans believe that 28 percent of our budget is spent on foreign aid (that’s more than Social Security, Medicare or defense!). The reality is the number is less than one percent.

Reagan once said that “foreign aid suffers from a lack of domestic constituency, in large part because the results of the programs are not immediately visible and self-evident.” As I stood in a remote Rwandan village with Elevansie and her children, a place few American voters will ever visit, the results were clear. This woman farmer was learning new techniques through a program called Ejo Heza, part of USAID’s “Feed the Future” initiative.

John Ames, an American with Louisville roots who works for a non-profit partner called Global Communities, explained that chronic malnutrition for 44 percent of Rwandan children leads to improper cognitive development and, therefore, an inability to learn properly and eventually participate in the private economy. The convergence of the U.S. government, corporate partners like Walmart, and non-profit implementation in a program like this was reassuring, as taxpayers aren’t shouldering the load alone.

If Elevansie lived closer to Cleveland she’d have a speaking slot at the next Republican National Convention, as she is a perfect example of how conservative, market-based values transform lives. From us she learned to grow cabbage, bananas, and onions so well that she sustains her family’s nutritional needs as well as many in her village. She turned a profit on what she learned and is using the proceeds to send her kids to college, the embodiment of getting a hand up, not a handout.

Her kids won’t need American assistance the way their mother did, and their lives now have a “horizon of hope,” a term used by retired U.S. Army Gen. Kip Ward, a traveling companion on this trip. Ward, the first commander of the United States Africa Command, knows more about this place than most. His point – when people have hope they are less susceptible to the hateful ideologies of ISIS, Al Shabaab, and other terrorist groups.

In Gen. Ward’s eyes, the small amount of money we spend on basic farming instruction in the Nyanza District of Rwanda makes us safer, and I am inclined to believe him.

In Arusha, Tanzania, schoolchildren gleefully sing and dance on a Friday morning. I understand one word: PEPFAR.

It’s amusing and gratifying that a U.S. government acronym has become a happy song lyric.

PEPFAR -- the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief -- was the brainchild of George W. Bush back in 2003. President Bush has saved more lives than any other U.S. president, according to some observers. At last count, 9.5 million people are receiving life-saving assistance from PEPFAR.

The kids I met at the Burka Primary school are among the 5.5 million African orphans and vulnerable children receiving PEPFAR assistance, learning to grow food, filter clean water, and generally sustain themselves. These kids were 12- to 15-years-old, although they looked eight or nine. Malnutrition early in life stunted their growth.

These children are also receiving life-saving HIV/AIDS screenings and treatments through anti-retroviral drugs, part of the overall PEPFAR mission of saving as many lives as possible by finding out who has HIV/AIDS and then providing drugs to extend their lives.

Because of American aid, these orphans can leave behind what would have otherwise been a chaotic existence. I’ve been humming the PEPFAR song since I left Africa.

The Bush Administration approach -- building on Reagan’s legacy -- increased funding, transparency, and accountability. We now prioritize outputs as much as inputs. Nations accepting our assistance through programs like the Millennium Challenge Corporation (another Bush 43 initiative) must meet economic, democratic, and human rights benchmarks. Republicans have been getting this right for a long while and we ought not to stop anytime soon.

Engaging in the world through humanitarian aid is the right thing to do by our moral code, our American values, and our desire for a more secure and stable world. Conservatives should continue to embrace the foreign assistance legacy of Reagan and Bush in 2016 and beyond.

There’s a great scene in Monty Python and the Holy Grail in which King Arthur encounters the obstinate Black Knight, who will not let the monarch cross a bridge. During their fight, King Arthur chops off the Black Knight’s arms.

“You’ve got no arms left!” Arthur declares.

“Just a flesh wound,” the Black Knight retorts, kicking wildly at Arthur. “I’m invincible!” he finally screams, relentlessly ignoring his pitiful vulnerability.

It is a shame that Monty Python isn’t around to adapt the press release entitled: “Governor Steve Beshear’s Legacy: A Kentucky Stronger At Its Core” into its next screenplay. Truly, the main character’s haughty proclamations would make the Black Knight look like a sober realist.

Let’s start with Kentucky’s massive pension problems, which worsened significantly under Beshear. The word “pension” appears in Beshear’s legacy release under the heading “Budget Turnaround,” which is like describing an airplane crash in a paragraph entitled “Successfully Brought Metal Tube Back to Earth.”

Gov.-elect Matt Bevin has sounded the alarm appropriately on the state’s pension system, ranked among the nation’s worst-funded, according to a Bloomberg report. In 2008, Beshear’s first year as governor, the pension system was 52 percent funded; today it sits at 19 percent. If you are but moderately proficient at math you know this is not a “budget turnaround” as Beshear claims.

Beshear’s pension handoff to Bevin is the worst financial problem any governor of Kentucky has ever left a successor. Ignoring Republican calls for drastic pension reform put the state at risk for bankruptcy, destroyed its credit rating, and leaves virtually no discretionary funding for education and social services. That is Beshear’s true legacy.

Bevin’s plan to implement a 401k-style system for new state workers is similar to what you find in the private sector and will create the fiscal discipline necessary to close the tens of billions in unfunded liabilities. Beshear should have embraced this common-sense solution when the Kentucky Senate—in an effort led by David Williams and Damon Thayer—passed it with bipartisan support in 2011.

Like most good Republican ideas in Frankfort, Beshear and Democratic House Speaker Greg Stumbo killed it, burying their heads for the sake of political expediency. Bevin is smart to propose changes beyond what the legislature passed in 2013, and he is right when he says the problem will take “a generation at least” to fix. Beshear campaigned on implementing good ideas no matter their party of origin; fulfilling that promise would have saved the state billions, along with its credit rating.

Calls for cop's arrest in Michael Brown shooting grow

Another ticking time bomb left in Bevin’s desk by Beshear, has to do with the 51,000 Kentuckians who obtained insurance through the now-defunct Kentucky Health Cooperative, the government-subsidized insurance carrier created under Obamacare. These people are among the sickest—and most expensive—insurance customers in the state.

The remaining private insurance companies left in the exchange will take on these expensive customers, forcing them to ask for further rate increases next year. Beshear will be safely retired to his horse farm when that happens, leaving Bevin to muck the health care stalls he left behind. The few remaining Frankfort Democrats will cynically and falsely claim that Bevin’s policies are driving up insurance rates.

The truth is that Beshear — who never faced the voters after unilaterally implementing Obamacare through executive order — is the real culprit. Obamacare and its supporters are responsible for massive rate hikes already, and it is about to get worse.

Beshear rides out of office as more of his punch bowl unpleasantries come to light. WDRB-TV reports that Beshear’s claim of 12,000 new jobs because of expanded Medicaid “hasn’t materialized.” The report says that “3,000 jobs were supposed to be added at hospitals alone in 2014…But instead, hospital employment in Kentucky declined by 2,660 jobs.”

Beshear says he’s leaving the state with a $242 million surplus; one Frankfort insider laughed at that and said: “They’ve put off paying every bill they can. That surplus is spent and then some. This next budget is going to be brutal.” Another tells me to prepare for a shortfall between $500 million and $800 million.

Finally, there are rumors Beshear plans to sign an onslaught of state contracts for major Democratic donors in his final days. The word is that Bevin’s team asked for information on these contracts and was told, in short, to pound sand. Transparency and good governance, thy name is not Beshear.

It is fitting that Beshear, forever linked to Obama, is exiting this way. Obama, like Beshear, will also be remembered for telling us things that just aren’t true. ISIS is not a “JV team,” nor is it “contained.” Americans, as it turns out, were not allowed to keep their health care plans if they liked them. These guys have produced enough bologna to put Oscar Mayer to shame.

Kentuckians have been fed a tremendous amount of bunk over the past eight years about our supposed solid state of affairs. A new Republican governor is left to tell us the truth – that state government is afflicted with far more than simple flesh wounds. Kentucky’s arms are, in fact, off.

Alison Grimes, running against U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell in 2014, released a television ad in which the only image was of a burning house. Voters rejected her anti-McConnell nonsense, but the image of a house fully engulfed in flames has become a perfect metaphor for the current status of the Kentucky Democratic Party.

The fire at 1313 Democrat Street started as mere faulty wiring, found by Kentucky’s inspectors when they elected McConnell to the U.S. Senate in 1984. Six years later, the unrepaired wiring created a spark when McConnell won re-election. The landlords did nothing as their home grew increasingly imperiled.

By 1994, most folks in the house could smell smoke. The election of Ed Whitfield and Ron Lewis to Congress saw a flood of tenants in the western part of the property vacate the premises. They knew something was up.

In 1998, the fire spread to the backyard where a tree planted by Wendell Ford succumbed to the flames. Ford, the last Democrat to win more than 50 percent of the vote in a statewide federal election (1992), couldn’t muster enough water from the garden hose to save his old oak from Jim Bunning.

By 1999, prominent tenants Bob Leeper and Dan Seum were fed up with the property’s management. They packed up and moved out, transitioning control of the Kentucky Senate to the GOP. A 20-18 advantage then is now a 27-11 supermajority.

In 2002, the fire rose higher as McConnell won a 29-point reelection over Lois Combs, the scion of one the property’s chief architects. In 2003, the flames shooting from 1313 Democrat Street could be seen for miles as Ernie Fletcher defeated Ben Chandler for governor. Two historic names found on the property’s cornerstone had been felled in two straight elections.

In 2007, a Frankfort tempest in a teapot produced enough rain to temporarily tamp down the flames, as Steve Beshear, a landlord from years gone by, came back to end Fletcher’s run. The homeowners thought everything was back to normal, and that punishment would soon come to the guy who started the mess 23 years prior.

They were wrong.

In 2008, McConnell proved the fire still burned as he weathered the storm against Bruce Lunsford. Democrats tried to reclaim the western part of the house, but Brett Guthrie absorbed their best shot. That same year, a new landlord named Barack Obama appeared on the scene and began distributing kerosene.

By 2010, the fire was rising again. Rand Paul took over for Bunning and more Republicans went to the State Senate, knocking off two incumbent Democrats along the way. By 2014, the house was fully engulfed. McConnell again won re-election and became U.S. Senate Majority Leader. All but one member of the congressional delegation had become Republican.

And that brings us to last Tuesday. The house at 1313 Democrat Street is nearly unrecognizable after Matt Bevin’s blowout win over Conway for governor. Ryan Quarles, Allison Ball, and Mike Harmon won constitutional offices, further tearing down what once seemed like an indestructible monument to liberalism. Democrats Andy Beshear and Grimes, narrowly elected on Tuesday, join House Speaker Greg Stumbo in wondering: “Is this property even salvageable?”

It is a good question. Since landlord Obama came in 2008, the Democrats have added just 22,961 new people to their rolls. In that same period, Republicans have added 205,671, a ten-fold advantage. For the first time in years, Kentucky has a congressional district (the fourth) with more Republicans than Democrats.

Of course, the foundation of the home persists. The Kentucky State House, which has withstood the flames for decades, remains on the property. Stumbo says he plans to rebuild, but the fire must be hot as he completely melted down on election night. In fact, Stumbo says he plans to rebuild the “party of Obama” on the back of a “lady jockey” riding “an Arkansas Traveler.”

If you are a Democrat running in 2016, let that sink in. Your fate is in the hands of a man who says he “believes in the core values that [Obama] represents,” and promises that Hillary Clinton is “going to come here to Kentucky” during your campaign. (You can switch parties down in Grimes’s office or at your county courthouse, if you feel so compelled.)

McConnell and Bevin are devising other plans; both have made flipping the state House a top priority. In fact, if Bevin achieves that objective, he can change Frankfort more in four years than all governors have changed it in the past century.

More ominous emergencies loom, as the house at 1313 Democrat Street sits on a fault line long overdue for seismic activity. The powerful shaking to come will open a fissure in the earth big enough to swallow what’s left of the old house.

Not to worry, though – new contractors will build something far better than what stood before. The old homeowners will be distant memories. The property will be under new management, and Kentucky has plenty of conservative tenants ready to move in.

Instead of calling Obama and Clinton, perhaps Stumbo should call 9-1-1.

Just two weeks remain for Kentucky’s constitutional office candidates to make their case to the voters, and big independent expenditure news Tuesday changed the landscape. The Republican Governor’s Association (RGA), which had already spent $3 million on behalf of gubernatorial candidate Matt Bevin (R) before pulling out on Sept. 28, threw out conventional wisdom of a likely Jack Conway (D) victory when it plunked down another $1.6 million for TV ads. What once was thought lost for the GOP may now be found. Maybe.

Here’s a stab at ranking the races from most likely to yield a Republican victory to least:

Commissioner of Agriculture – Ryan Quarles (R), a State Representative from Scott County, has run a good campaign against Jean-Marie Lawson Spann (D), who faces a complaint that she “violated campaign finance laws by using her corporate-sponsored radio show to promote her campaign,” according to the Associated Press. Spann’s performance at Fancy Farm left many scratching their heads when she said that people who “go to school” aren’t qualified to be agriculture leaders (don’t tell the University of Kentucky College of Agriculture). Kentuckians have voted Republican in this race three consecutive times, and it is likely Quarles becomes the fourth.

State Treasurer – Allison Ball (R), a lawyer from Prestonsburg, faces state Rep. Rick Nelson (D) of Middlesboro. This peculiar office has made almost no news since James “Honest Dick” Tate absconded with $100,000 from the state treasury in 1888. Tate was never heard from again, and, fortunately, we no longer have tobacco sacks full of gold and silver coins laying around for public officials to snatch. Ball, a bankruptcy attorney, might have to put her skills to use as Kentucky faces $30 billion in unfunded pension liabilities.

Governor – Until Tuesday, the month of October had not been kind to Bevin. The RGA stopped advertising, Conway and his allies increased their expenditures, and public surveys showed Conway ahead, albeit narrowly. A source who tracks media buying tells me Bevin has been outspent in Western Kentucky 3-to-1 overall and as much as 7-to-1 since the RGA pulled out. The Paducah and Evansville TV markets, where Conway has been crushing Bevin in advertising, have served as a firewall for GOP candidates who won close races (examples: Bunning ’04, McConnell ’08, and Paul ’10). Democratic dominance of Western Kentucky’s airwaves is worrisome since the GOP needs the Central Time Zone to produce a big margin on election night.

That said, Bevin could still prevail and here’s why: the RGA, believing Bevin can win among the likeliest voters in this low-turnout election, has come back to potentially save the day. Ads supporting Bevin will air statewide over the final two weeks, including in important Western Kentucky. The RGA believes the Democratic apparatus, having spent most of its $11.5 million on ads attacking Bevin, can’t get Conway over the hump because of the toxic, anti-Obama political environment. Democrats believe Conway remains ahead and argue that even with the RGA’s new money they will still outspend Bevin over the next two weeks.

The Rothenberg/Gonzales Political Report changed its rating to “Tossup/Tilts Democratic” last week, but admitted that a Bevin win “wouldn’t be surprising” given the political atmosphere. That rating was made before the RGA’s announcement, which probably puts the race back into the category of pure tossup.

Attorney General – State Sen. Whitney Westerfield (R) faces Andy Beshear (D) in a very spirited open seat race. These young candidates are running energetic campaigns boosted by massive independent expenditures. Operatives in both parties have been calling the race a tossup for several weeks. It is a shame there weren’t more debates between these two, as their tilt on KET was among the most interesting of the cycle.

Auditor of Public Accounts – State Rep. Mike Harmon (R) is hoping to catch a GOP wave against incumbent Adam Edelen (D), who is preparing a well-crafted advertising blitz to combat his extremely low name identification. Edelen is the favorite, as Harmon has not run a funded campaign to make the case against a second term. The ambitious Edelen, if he prevails, will likely run against U.S. Sen. Rand Paul in 2016 or perhaps become the leading Democratic choice for governor in 2019 if Bevin beats Conway. Edelen’s race is close, but he’s banking on $700,000 in television ads over the last two weeks to seal a narrow win.

Secretary of State – If Steven Knipper (R) beats incumbent Alison Grimes (D), he can write a thank you letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for damaging her image so badly in 2014 that she wasn’t able to recover. Many Republicans are kicking themselves for not getting into this race, and party leaders wonder what might have been had a GOP candidate run a funded campaign.

Political observers predict low voter turnout, which has ranged widely in recent off-year elections: 1999 (22.2 percent); 2003 (40%); 2007 (37.1 percent); 2011 (28.6 percent). We’ll set the over/under this year at 31 percent, a total turnout of 992,574 voters. A Bevin win at the top of the ticket with low turnout increases GOP chances in each race.

“Kentucky is back, and we’re back with a vengeance…”

If there’s a catchphrase associated with Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear’s final months in office, it is this one.

He said it in his State of the Commonwealth speech in January. He was still on message in August at the Kentucky Farm Bureau’s State Fair Ham Breakfast. He says it everywhere he goes.

But three troubling issues have surfaced to cast a pall over Beshear’s pronouncement and create a gloomy backdrop in front of which Matt Bevin, Jack Conway, and Drew Curtis are conducting their campaigns for governor. With 15 to 20 percent of voters who may still be up for grabs, fashioning innovative solutions to these three problems could be the key to winning this race.

The first problem undermining Beshear’s argument dropped on Sept. 1, when Standard & Poor's lowered Kentucky’s credit rating to “A+” from “AA-.” The Courier-Journal’s Tom Loftus explains: “The move puts Kentucky near rock bottom in S&P's credit ratings of the 50 states. Only New Jersey (‘A’) and Illinois (‘A-‘) have a lower rating from S&P.”

The cause of this downgrade is “Kentucky’s substantially underfunded pension liabilities that are the result of chronic underfunding…placing long-term pressures on the state’s finances,” according to S & P analyst John Sugden.

Despite some progress made on this problem in recent years (driven largely by state Senate Republicans), the next governor will deal with a pension crisis that has been decades in the making and will be decades in the solving. Meanwhile, Kentucky is now known as a state that doesn’t have its financial act together because of tens of billions in unfunded public pension liabilities.

* * *

The second problem has to do with health insurance costs. Embedded in Gov. Beshear’s “vengeance” argument is his implementation of Obamacare, which has dropped Kentucky’s uninsured rate largely by putting 400,000 people on Medicaid. Some people—110,000—did find private coverage through Kynect, the state’s health insurance exchange, although a great many of them already had private health insurance, lost it under Obamacare, and were forced onto the exchange against their will.

Those non-Medicaid insurance customers got a rude awakening a few weeks ago when the state announced massive rate increases. As WFPL Radio reported, “all but one of the 13 insurers selling individual and small-group plans in the state are raising rates.”

But it gets worse, WFPL says, because the “carrier designed to provide the most affordable plans...will see a 25.1 percent rate increase for individual plans this year.” And this is on top of a 20 percent rate increase last year.

The report says it all: “Funded by a federal loan made available through the Affordable Care Act, its massive back-to-back rate increases suggest things aren’t working as planned.”

The next governor must decide whether Kentucky can sustain such a large chunk of its population (more than 25 percent) being on Medicaid, and whether the private exchange is actually working when rates are skyrocketing.

* * *

The third problem has to do with new census data showing Kentucky’s poverty rate up and household median income down.

According to the Kentucky Center for Economic Policy, a liberal think tank, “Kentucky’s overall poverty rate went from 18.8 percent in 2013 to 19.1 percent in 2014 while median household income in Kentucky fell from an inflation-adjusted $44,097 in 2013 to $42,958 in 2014.”

For African Americans the story is worse. The Courier-Journal’s Phillip Bailey reported that blacks in Kentucky “saw their average yearly incomes drop by more than 11 percent” and that poverty rose “at a rate four times more than the rest of the state from 2013 to 2014,” with nearly one-third of African Americans now living in poverty. Black incomes dropped from $30,183 to $26,735.

Since the recession, economist Paul Coomes told the Lexington Herald-Leader this summer that Kentucky is “slipping, relative to other states, in terms of average pay.” This fact is driving more people into poverty, including children.

In Eastern Kentucky, nearly 40 percent of children are now living in poverty. Statewide, 25,000 more children are living in poverty than when Beshear took office, according to the Kids Count Data Center.

While Kentucky’s unemployment rate has dropped to 5.2 percent, it is at least in part because people are dropping out of the workforce altogether. In December 2007, when Beshear was sworn in, 61.5 percent of able-bodied Kentuckians were working or looking for work. Today, just 56.3 percent are actively participating in the labor market. Kentucky has 81,558 fewer people participating in the workforce than when Beshear took office, despite a civilian, non-institutional population increase of 156,000 between December 2007 and August 2015. There are 71,259 fewer people working in Kentucky today than when Beshear took his oath.

These mighty problems—pensions, health care costs, and economic prosperity—await Kentucky’s next governor. Everything he does must be aimed at confronting these things because, to those Kentuckians facing joblessness, falling incomes, rising poverty, and skyrocketing health care costs, it must feel as though someone has indeed taken vengeance upon them.

As this newspaper hit your doorstep (either real or virtual) this morning, a close friend of mine and his wife were delivering their first child.

In about a month, my wife will bring home a third boy, giving us ages six, two, and one month to dress for Halloween. My dream of toting tiny versions of Ned Nederlander, Dusty Bottoms, and Lucky Day around the neighborhood begging for candy may finally be realized. Note to my wife: if you are reading this, please dig the emergency sombreros out of the hall closet.

My friend has asked me about diapers, sleeping, and feeding – the basic mechanics of raising a human baby. Or a pet kangaroo. Is there a difference? Neither recognizes our cultural norms when it comes to waste evacuation or refraining from kicking one’s handlers in the groin.

But we haven’t talked as much about what fatherhood really means these days. I have learned in the last six years that being a parent is a great competition, and that every father is woefully out-manned but not necessarily out-gunned.

We are raising children in an “on demand” world. There’s no waiting for anything. Every image on every screen is engineered by well-trained experts who understand the human brain better than you ever will.

These experts are paid huge sums to beat you in this competition. But to win, all you need to pay is attention.

I love video games. The ones I grew up with had something in common – you could die and have to start over. Or worse, wait for Player Two to die. They were enormously frustrating and trained me to be patient.

Believing it might be fun for my six year old to play Dad’s video games, I arranged for us to play Sonic the Hedgehog, in which the surprisingly fragile mammal races around interesting places. You can die very easily in this game, as it was invented by a cult of masochists somewhere in Japan.

In the video games my son normally plays — mostly Lego-based — you die all the time, your tiny Lego parts crumbling under the weight of an enemy’s blow. But then a miracle happens: you re-spawn — endlessly — right where you bought the farm. There’s no starting over, no waiting for your friend to finish, no excruciating return to the beginning of a maddening level.

You just come back to life, picking up as though Sandman didn’t just pound you into oblivion with his grainy fist.

We played Sonic together once. My son died about 10 seconds in, and then suffered the indignity of waiting for Dad to finish up. He has not asked to play again, reverting to the consequence-free Lego world where Spiderman absorbs ceaseless punishment.

My son’s games are beautifully rendered, made to minimize frustration and encourage endless replay. There are literally hundreds of people — programmers, artists, psychologists — sitting in a room somewhere scheming on how best to win the competition for my son’s time and attention with games like this.

It would be easy for a new father to throw up his hands, surrendering to the clever engineers who have all the resources anyone would need to win this battle.

But of course, we have something they don’t have – the sacred bond between fathers and their children, forged through years of changing dirty diapers and dutifully turning knees into wildly unstable ponies.

If you listen closely to your children — taking your eyes off your own laptop and phone, designed by the same smart people fighting you for your children — you will hear everything you need to know to win this battle.

When my son isn’t defeating Lego evildoers, he loves more than anything to hike through the woods. The programmers might know best how to trigger the synapses in his brain, but they cannot answer the questions that dominate his mind as he traverses the forest with Dad.

Did you have a dog when you were a kid? What is bacteria? Why aren’t your mom and dad married? What was it like at your school? How can we trap a lizard? Will a crawdad bite my toe? What’s your favorite kind of hawk?

This non sequitur Gatling gun fires uninterrupted as we hike towards a creek. He pauses only to concentrate on fording the stream, a proud moment for a six year old explorer. The questions start again as we climb a downed tree on the other side, taking in the beautiful scenery.

How old is this creek? Did Jesus ever come here? What kind of bug is this? Can this bug defeat a cicada? Why does Barack Obama raise our taxes?

To my friend, you will answer an incalculable number of questions in the years to come. There will be days when you feel too tired or distracted to hike or to answer. Don’t give in. This is what the engineers are banking on, because, despite their resources, they ultimately cannot compete as long as you keep your head in the game.

When this child comes, your time will no longer be your own. Do not regret this. Embrace the competition for your child’s attention. Winning is everything.

The last time Kentucky’s political collective descended on Fancy Farm, the U.S. Senate race between Mitch McConnell and Alison Grimes was in full bloom, with both candidates and their respective apparatuses already spending freely. Last time around, Fancy Farm felt like the beginning of the fourth quarter of the Super Bowl rather than the kickoff.

This year, another statewide campaign – this time for governor – is under way, but you’d hardly know it. The combatants have barely come out of the locker room for the coin flip.

The race between Republican Matt Bevin and Democrat Jack Conway has been sleepy, with neither campaign generating much news since the May primary. Conway and his allies have released a couple of ads, while the Republican Governor’s Association (RGA) has unleashed attack ads on behalf of Bevin. The RGA ads look a lot like the pro-McConnell spots that helped tank Grimes in 2014, which surely must worry Conway’s allies.

The political environment continues to favor Bevin and the GOP. Kentucky remains decidedly opposed to President Barack Obama and those who support his agenda, and polling in the race so far has shown Republicans from top to bottom running ahead of or even with their Democratic counterparts. A new Bluegrass Poll comes later this week.

We are in for a short campaign, hopefully jumpstarted this weekend in Western Kentucky at the annual Fancy Farm Political Picnic at St. Jerome’s Catholic Church. Here is what to expect from the key speakers:

Matt Bevin – His previous appearance came in 2013, just after he launched his bid against McConnell in the U.S. Senate primary. Bevin is a talented public speaker and used those skills in the gubernatorial primary to best his opponents. His mission Saturday is simple – paint Conway as an extension of Obama, and present himself as someone with a grasp of how conservative principles can improve state government. This platform gives him a chance to do something he has not had to do before – talk to general election voters who have no idea who he is or what he stands for. The assembled partisans matter less than the likely voters who will view the speech coverage later.

Jack Conway – The Attorney General has appeared at Fancy Farm many times, and it gives the Louisville resident a chance to talk about his Western Kentucky roots. Conway once stumbled here, clumsily cursing during a speech in an attempt to sound tough (picnic organizers were not pleased). Conway’s tenure as Attorney General is now largely defined by the issue of gay marriage; he needs it to be something else. The challenge for Conway is to convince conservative Democrats to stick with their party in November without depressing his liberal Louisville base, a Gordian knot for Democrats in Kentucky these days.

U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell – Nobody is better at drawing bright-line contrasts between Democrats and Republicans than McConnell, and you can bet he’ll lay out the choice in November in unambiguous terms. McConnell, the new Senate Majority Leader, would be well within his rights to take a victory lap for getting the Senate working again, as the institution had all but ground to a halt under the grip of Nevada’s Harry Reid. McConnell is not a flashy orator, but every sentence is well-crafted and packs a punch in this setting. McConnell’s Fancy Farm speeches are calibrated for posterity, not instant gratification.

Gov. Steve Beshear – Kentucky’s outgoing governor will deliver his last Fancy Farm speech, passing the torch to Conway and his son, Andy Beshear, the Democratic nominee for Attorney General. Beshear’s legacy is fully wrapped up in his implementation of Obamacare, which still doesn’t poll well even as Beshear maintains decent approval numbers. He will surely want to deliver a legacy-focused speech but must be careful not to play into the Republican strategy of defining Conway as an Obama acolyte. As a stunt to kick off his speech in 2014, Beshear took a selfie on-stage with McConnell, proclaiming his desire to preserve the memory of the senior senator’s last Fancy Farm. As it turns out, it is McConnell who will outlast Beshear on the Fancy Farm stage.

2016 U.S. Senate Race Implications – Secretary of State Grimes and State Auditor Adam Edelen are both in tight races for re-election, and both are mentioned as possible U.S. Senate candidates in 2016 against Rand Paul. Grimes is trying to shake off horrific image problems from her loss to McConnell, and Edelen is hoping an anti-Democratic wave doesn’t sweep him away with the rest of the ticket. Paul is not appearing this year, opting to campaign for president in New Hampshire.

Fancy Farm Rookie Speakers – Republicans: Jenean Hampton (Lt. Governor); Whitney Westerfield (Attorney General); Steven Knipper (Secretary of State); Ryan Quarles (Agriculture Commissioner); Allison Ball (Treasurer). Democrats: Sannie Overly (Lt. Governor); Beshear (Attorney General); Jean-Marie Lawson (Agriculture Commissioner); Rick Nelson (Treasurer).

What a beautiful building you have here, Governor Dennison,"" he said, smiling after reading a telegram. The tall Kentuckian had just been informed the Electoral College elected him president of the United States.

Abraham Lincoln was visiting the Ohio State House in Columbus on Feb. 13, 1861, when he learned the good news. He was in the office of his friend, Gov. William Dennison, who he later appointed postmaster general. There's still a desk in that office which Lincoln used during his visit, and Lincoln's bust now looks over the shoulders of Ohio governors who occupy the space. A few minutes after getting the note, Lincoln walked onto the state house floor and addressed the legislators (the chair that sits on the rostrum is called The Lincoln Chair), simultaneously projecting the relief of an election ending while no doubt feeling the crushing weight of his coming task.

I learned this history visiting the Ohio capitol on Jan. 5 for the election of Cliff Rosenberger as speaker of the Ohio House. Rosenberger, 33, is one of the youngest state legislative leaders in the nation. I first met him as a hard-working intern-turned-staffer in the White House Office of Political Affairs, where he and I served together in the second term of President George W. Bush. Cliff is part of a new generation of GOP leaders who embody Lincoln's character, principles and values. He is exactly the kind of person you want running a state house.

After his federal service, Rosenberger, a Korean-American, went home to Ohio and, shocked by a massive plant closure in his community that cost thousands of jobs — including his own mother's — ran for state representative. Just a few years later, he's presiding over the Ohio House from Lincoln's Chair.

""In the traditional sense, I am a conservative, but my goal as speaker is to do what is best for the state of Ohio,"" Rosenberger told the Columbus Dispatch. He was channeling his inner-Lincoln, who told Ohio legislators in his famous address: ""We entertain different views upon political questions, but nobody is suffering anything.""

Cliff is among a new crop of young, dynamic and diverse GOP leaders who shatter the conventional wisdom that the GOP is made up of cranky, old white guys.

He's joined in the Ohio House by a 23-year-old law student named Niraj Antani, a former intern of mine from Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign. Antani, an Indian-American, is the youngest member of the Ohio state legislature and was named to Forbes Magazine's 30 Under 30 list the other day.

""I am in public service because my generation demands representation. We need leaders who are not afraid to take on the tough issues of the day, to lead,"" Antani tells me.

He also channels Lincoln, particularly in their shared desire for a bold and inclusive Republican Party. Lincoln's words, these from his Cooper Union Address in 1860, hover over Antani, who seeks to bring millennials to the GOP: ""Let us have faith that right makes might, and in that faith, let us, to the end, dare to do our duty as we understand it.""

These two immigrants' sons are joined in elective office by another in Kentucky. Dr. Ralph Alvarado, elected to the state Senate in November, is the first Hispanic-American in Kentucky's upper chamber.

""Once you get into office, the way I see it is you put the D and the R aside, and ultimately it's a team that everyone's put together … like any business you sit down and start looking toward what you have in common, and you start achieving those goals,"" the 44-year old Alvarado told CN2's ""Pure Politics.""

Alvarado's greatest political strength? Perseverance. He ran for office four times before finally knocking off Senate Minority Leader R.J. Palmer (I helped his failed state Senate bid in 2010). Lincoln, of course, lost five elections before winning the presidency.

In 2006, after losing a race for state representative, Alvarado's home was vandalized with a racial slur. Eight years later he's making policy in Frankfort, where it is already clear that he's one of the smartest people in the room.

People sometimes ask me what makes a good candidate, or if they should take the plunge and run for office. I always say the same thing: You don't win 100 percent of the races you don't enter. The trick, of course, is to banish the fear of failure from your mind. It is a condition that afflicts most of us at one time or another — the fear that someone will laugh at us if we fail. It is, after all, easier to dream than to try. That fear sometimes keeps the people you want in politics out of it.

Cliff, Niraj and Ralph fear nothing except living in a world without problem-solvers committed to their communities. Their electoral appeal is not gimmicky, based on half-baked policy ideas or clever quippery. What these young leaders care about most is finding solutions. Projecting that attitude is the secret sauce for a Republican to win the White House in 2016.

384,Mannon,Shannon,goodmenproject,"“Guys need to be able to get together, take our armor off, put salve on our wounds, and then put our armor back on to do what [society] wants us to do to take care of our families,” shared Nat Turner, 60 of Ellicott City, MD.

He was speaking with two other men he’d never met in front of a live national audience at the invitation of his daughter Briscoe.

The three men opened up about their relationship struggles, challenging family histories, and shared longing for authentic connection with other men in their lives.

But this wasn’t a conversation on male vulnerability or even a program on redefining masculinity in the 21st century.

This was a Living Room Conversation.

Briscoe Turner, 22 a University of Maryland student and member of Living Room Conversation’s Youth Council, co-hosted this live conversation with Becca Kearl, of Utah, managing partner at the organization. The event was designed to encourage connection across generations during a holiday season hamstrung by COVID.

Three father – daughter pairs came together for a virtual conversation using Living Room Conversation’s Good Questions for Great Gatherings: Connecting Across Generations holiday resource. Each family selected one question from the guide to pose to the group.

Brialle Ringer, 26, of Atlanta, responded to the first question, “what’s been your experience with forgiveness? Who have you forgiven and why?” She told a story about confronting, and ultimately forgiving, a young man who sexually assaulted her in high school, immediately cranking up the voltage of the conversation.

By taking agency and confronting her assaulter, Brialle created the conditions to heal her trauma. No longer a victim, she became the hero in her story.

Yet for every brave woman emboldened to share her survival story in this #MeToo era, there’s a father stomaching a hidden heartbreak. For every daughter assaulted in the bedroom or the boardroom, a father is reckoning with a culture labeling him a failure for not protecting his child.

Brialle’s dad Gary Ringer, 45, of Detroit, trying to forgive in the face of his powerlessness, the path forward is murkier.

“I’ve just recently gotten to the point where I could listen to [Brialle’s story] out loud without getting infuriated,” Gary admitted. “I appreciate Bri for providing me with the courage to address my own moments of trauma and begin to forgive others.”

Men offering exquisite care

The other fathers in the conversation honored Brialle’s courage, then quickly turned to Gary.

“I can’t even imagine what that was like for [Gary] to go through that, and still go through it,” Bill Lawler of Utah began. Nat echoed him, “as a Dad, I appreciate the calmness you sit with now, Gary, and imagine what it took to get there.”

Soon the two fathers moved beyond empathy to acknowledge their own struggles with forgiveness.

Bill described how hard it was to forgive his mother who abandoned them when he was just five years old.

Nat shared his disappointment in his oldest brother who often shirked family responsibilities. “When our sister was dying, my brother showed up for her. He said, ‘I’m standing in for you, Nat.’ I said ‘No, I’ve been standing in for you all these years.’ We both cried. I felt free and light.”

The three men formed a web of solidarity through their storytelling. They didn’t try to fix or save. Just by sharing burdens, they lightened each other’s loads.

This conversation highlighted what exquisite care men can offer each other.

Bringing intimacy into public life

Living Room Conversations are designed to create conditions for our caring instincts to emerge. A formalized structure with searching questions, a warm invitation from someone you know, and conversation agreements that provide guard rails all set the stage for deep sharing. By starting with such a vulnerable story, Brialle, too, helped invite responses in kind.

But the fathers acknowledge that bringing more intimacy into public life is challenging. These muscles must be continually strengthened through the practice of conversation, and that’s not something any of us can do alone.

As a Black man, Gary says his world is “hyper-masculine.” Conversations like this, and groups like the B.O.M.B Squad (short for Bringing Our Men Back) in Detroit, help him “rebuke those old social norms and live a more authentic life.”

Meanwhile, this conversation highlighted for Bill that he’s missing deeper connections with other men. “I play ball with men, but we don’t talk about real stuff. I am going to seek out places I can dive deeper. I want to meaningfully communicate with men to support each other. That wasn’t even on my radar before this conversation.”

Surprising impact for conversation viewers and participants

There are unexcepted ripples from these conversations. After listening to her dad, Becca was prompted to check in with her husband about his needs. “I asked whether he also felt a need to be in conversation with other men, and how I could support that.”

Brialle felt inspired to change the narrative for her family’s next generation of men. “I’m eager to find ways to bring these opportunities for authentic sharing and listening to our larger family gathers, [to benefit] my little brother Gavyn who’s 9 years old.”

With more than 90 comments on the Facebook feed alone, the impact of this conversation, which can be viewed here, wasn’t limited to the participants. Viewer Beth Raps commented, “Wow, Gary’s statement describes my father, ‘physically present, emotionally absent.’ There are so many benefits to this conversation for [us] listeners.”

“I love all the honesty and vulnerability as well as the mutual respect,” echoed viewer Esther Zanovitch. “This has been a truly beautiful and inspirational experience,” added Nicole Dolan. “Thank you all for sharing from your hearts.”

Our ability to meaningfully connect across generations, race, or most any substantial difference has atrophied. And not just for men.

So much in our common lives has grown parched and brittle. But this moment of reckoning offers us an unprecedented opportunity. Structured conversation brings the intimacy and care we long for back into the public square and helps us reimagine a future alive with possibility.

With the rifts exposed by this year’s divisive presidential election still raw, families are cobbling together shrunken Thanksgiving celebrations as COVID-19 rates rise. Nerves are shot. Emotions are running hot on all sides.

But the holidays are one of the remaining windows into perspectives different from our own, and it’s a window we can’t afford to lose.

According to a Pew research study, most of us have few or no friends from the opposing side. That’s a dangerous trend because our attitudes become more extreme after speaking with those who share our views, without us realizing it, the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology reports.

We’re reimaging our gatherings this holiday season. Let’s reimagine our conversations, too.

Fortunately, our limited exposure to each other this Thanksgiving — brief backyard visits or Zoom calls — makes it easier for us to practice the skills that can repair the fractures between us.

I spent Thanksgiving 2016 much like I spent the rest of that year, blundering my way through uncomfortable conversations. Trump just got elected, and I was horrified to find myself becoming increasingly judgmental toward those who voted for him. I could either spend the next four years becoming bitter and angry with people I loved, or I could try to find out why.

I made countless mistakes in conversations with right-leaning friends. I’d begin with genuine curiosity. Inevitably, I’d get triggered and pounce on them. Friends responded to my well-reasoned arguments by changing the subject, not changing their hearts.

As a mediator, the founder of a storytelling platform created to increase empathy, even as a middle child, seeking peace is bred into me. But it wasn’t until the Trump administration that I realized while I was preaching peace, I sure wasn’t living peace.

So I’ve spent the past four years trying to become less of a hypocrite. I’ve interviewed neuroscientists, conflict researchers and dialogue experts to learn how to have better conversations that hold our shared humanity as firmly as our differences.

Learning to have good conversations

But nothing has helped me embody peace like having Living Room Conversations, a structured model designed to help regular people connect across differences.

I learned that having a meaningful conversation starts on the inside. It means summoning the generosity to assume good intent, and the humility to honor life experiences that shaped opinions different from mine.

The purpose of these kinds of conversations is not to change minds, but to understand perspectives. Liberated from convincing and fixing, we can build our endurance to sit with the complexity of the enormous challenges we face.

Good questions are at the heart of great conversations. Open, searching, generous questions draw out life stories, hopes and fears. “I am wondering…” and “tell me about a time when you…” plant us in fertile soil.

Nothing shuts down a conversation faster than trying to be right and proving a point, like those “gotcha” questions that dominate the media landscape. Living Room Conversation’s Good Questions for Great Gatherings — curated questions grouped by theme and distilled from more than 100 topics — is a helpful short cut.

Shame won't change minds

Holding space as someone works through their reasons for what I believe is a truly unjust opinion was one of the most challenging skills to cultivate. It helped to remember what peace and conflict researcher Emile Bruneau said, that lasting change comes through trusting relationships.

In his studies of former white supremacists, Bruneau found that it was never snark, shame or shutting down a conversation that changed minds. It was a kind gesture and repeated, unexpected, undeserved gentleness that eventually reached them.

When triggers invariably arise, repeating a mantra like ""listening doesn’t imply consent"" can be helpful. Expressing curiosity about a different perspective doesn’t endorse that belief.

Our words matter. Certain ones will elicit a knee-jerk reaction counter to the goal of deepening understanding and connection — words like racist, misogynist, socialist, white supremacy and privilege. Don’t avoid the topic, just avoid words that shut down any hope of meaningfully addressing the topic.

Throughout the pandemic, we’ve demonstrated that we’re far more resilient and adaptable than we realized. This stripped down holiday season, instead of preparing to host dozens for dinner, we can prepare ourselves for meaningful conversations, where our passion for issues doesn’t eclipse our passion for each other.

Andre Odom worked as a graduate assistant at Temple after his college football career ended and eventually landed a job as a scouting assistant with the Chicago Bears before he transitioned to representing players instead of evaluating them. He made the right move. When NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell steps to the podium next Thursday night in Cleveland to announce the first-round draft picks, two of Odom’s clients — Florida tight end Kyle Pitts and Penn State linebacker Micah Parsons — could be picked in the top 10. Another client, Penn State defensive Jayson Oweh, could go in the first round. It’s been a long journey to reach this point for Odom, an agent with Athletes First who also co-represented 2020 first-round pick K’Lavon Chaisson. “It’s been an obstacle course of many trials and tribulations, many sleepless nights, 17, 18 hours in the office as a graduate assistant,” Odom said. “Then going to the NFL and working in the front office, having long, tiring days and not seeing your family. It was definitely a journey, a tremendous grind, but it was more than worth it.” Odom was raised by his grandmother in Philadelphia and was a two-way starter at running back and defensive back at George Washington High School from 2001-03. He went to Bloomsburg University and played defensive back and was a sprinter on the track team before he transferred to Temple. Odom walked on Temple's football team under coach Al Golden, but a severe back injury ended his playing career before it began. After earning a bachelor's degree in communications, Odom worked in radio sales and banking and returned to his high school as an assistant coach. He joined Temple's staff as a graduate assistant in 2011 and spent three seasons there while earning a master's degree in sports management. Odom joined the Bears in 2013, and had not considered becoming an agent until he was fired in 2015. He pursued it because of his passion to help young athletes develop into better men. “Growing up and being hands on with these athletes, people kind of looked at me as a street agent,” Odom said. “A lot of those individuals are really good people and those athletes need those people because where we’re from, some of us don’t have parents. I didn’t have a mom and dad to hold my hand and walk me through, and a lot of these young men don’t. “It’s a tough life being a professional athlete. It’s not easy. Everything is not going to be perfect sunny days. You’re going to have those rainy days. You’re going to have those painful days when things don’t go well. So who’s going to be with you? Who’s going to help educate you? Who’s going to truly be fully invested in your future, not just your success contractually, but individually, emotionally, mentally, things of that nature. So I just felt like me personally, I had a lot to offer.” Odom credits William Wesley for helping him become an agent at Creative Artists Agency in 2017. Wesley, currently the executive vice-president and senior basketball adviser for the New York Knicks, was a consultant at CAA. “I don’t get to CAA without Wes,” Odom said. “My relationship with him goes far deeper than business. He mentored me and taught me how to deal with people, being strategic, how to treat people the right way. The knowledge I acquired from him has helped me become who I am. It gave me the ability and credibility to sign these guys.” Wide receiver Robby Anderson was Odom’s first client. He also represented Devon White, Marquise Brown and Rock Ya-Sin. Odom joined Athletes First in January 2020. He had to navigate the challenges of working through a pandemic in his first year at a new agency. “I wasn’t really able to get out there and hit the road as I would have liked to, but we found a way to get it done,” Odom said. He also signed Georgia defensive back Mark Webb and Syracuse safety Andre Cisco. Both players expect to hear their name called next weekend. Odom says there’s an “unfair stigma” attached to being an agent based on a negative perception because of the way they’ve been portrayed on television and in movies. “If you’re doing it from the right place in your heart, the right place spiritually and mentally, you’re going to really help these guys become who they want to become,” he said. “You’re going to help them through this tough journey that is almost seemingly never ending because someone’s always grabbing at you, someone always wants something. Your phone is always ringing. ""But what they don’t tell them is that when your career is over, when the celebrity dwindles, when your phone stops ringing, no one cares. Who’s going to be there for you? Who’s going to be taking your calls? Who’s going to help you walk down that path to the next portion of your life? Because when a lot of these young men retire, they’re still young.” Working in sales helped Odom learn how to build and cultivate relationships. His time working in a front office allowed him to learn contract language. His coaching background taught him another important perspective. So despite not having a traditional background, he’s quickly become successful. “I didn’t have the red carpet laid out for me,” he said. “I had to really go out there and earn everything. I embraced it and that’s what really distinguishes me from a lot of people. My entire life was like that. I never had anything easy. Nothing was ever handed or given to me on a silver platter. That’s not what I come from. So this was going to be no different. I had to really set my mind to it.” Odom will join Pitts and Parsons next week in Cleveland. After the NFL conducted a virtual draft last year, some players and their families will attend this one. Pitts and Parsons were among the first 10 to accept the invitations. “It’s certainly life changing and for some of these guys, it's monumental depending on their upbringing and circumstances and how and where they grew up,” Odom said. “You are ecstatic for these guys and their families. But it’s not about us, it’s about them and their joy and their families. Seeing their smiles is breathtaking.” ___ More AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL Rob Maaddi, The Associated Press",-1,https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/news/learned-stop-judging-start-listening-110304330.html

“O, let America be America again —

The land that never has been yet —

And yet must be — the land where every man is free.”

— Langston Hughes

We have two ears and one mouth so that we can listen twice as much as we speak, the saying goes.

Unfortunately, that’s not the experience for most of us, in our common life together. More often, we’re hurling opinions at each other, or, at best, waiting for our turn to talk.

And that makes sense.

Talking is so satisfying. The sound of our own voice lights up the reward centers of brain.

Listening, on the other hand, takes energy, concentration, and focus. Despite appearing passive, even easy, anyone who engages in full body listening can tell you just how challenging it is.

We know listening is hard. We know it’s necessary. We know that with intention and effort, we improve.

Today, I find hope in the growing movement of people who’ve committed to put that knowing into practice.

These wide swaths of Americans accompany each other in the hard work of listening, through the framework of structured conversation through a vast network of organizations like Living Room Conversations, Make America Dinner Again, and The People’s Supper, to name just a few.

Isn’t that incredible?

A wildly diverse band of people across this fractured nation voluntarily come together, for no external reward, to practice an intangible, undervalued skill, simply because they believe it makes them better people, and better citizens.

Now that’s something to celebrate.

Before us, on this complicated Independence Day of 2020, is the opportunity to dream new possibilities for our lives together, for our communities, for our nations.

Before us is the opportunity to put our listening skills into practice, to lean into discomfort of unpacking the myth of America, to taking a hard and honest look at our reality.

To inch one step closer, as Langston Hughes wrote, to letting America be America again.

While we’re doing the difficult work of stretching our imaginations around what could be, may we also rest in the joy that comes from the simple and profound act of listening.

May we celebrate those occasional, magical moments in conversation where, through listening, the thin veil separating us dissolves.

Where we realize, for one fleeting moment, that down at the fertile bottom of things, we’re all connected.

Where we draw strength to keep us going, onward and forward, to do the immense work before us.

By Shannon Mannon, Co-Founder, the 3-Minute Storyteller, and Partnership Community Leader

Thanks Shannon for your permission to reprint the 3MS June, 2020 newsletter post.

Do you also feel like we’re living inside a cycle of epic destruction, the stuff of myths, Book of Exodus times?

Black people are being murdered. Riots and looting are unfolding in the streets. Unemployment rates are soaring. A global pandemic isn’t close to being contained.

All of these viruses—racism, COVID-19, inequality, poverty, white supremacy—have finally triggered our sluggish, collective immune system to respond.

But life perpetuates itself through death. Forest fires seed new growth. Fields left fallow produce bountiful harvest. Falling leaves make way for spring buds.

Watching protests and riots roil across communities in America, like a snake wrapped around itself, it’s hard to tell where destruction ends, and creation begins.

Maybe that’s the point. Maybe we aren’t supposed to.

First the truth, then the reconciling

During South Africa’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission, white perpetrators were required to come face to face with the black families they had victimized physically, socially, and economically.

Before his new government could have any hope of legitimacy, Mandela intuited that there needed to be a public airing of the trauma and violence that happened under apartheid. A strong foundation of democracy could not be built until they listened to each other’s stories, and publicly acknowledged generations of wrong-doing.

He understood the necessary order of things: First the truth, then the reconciling.

While the commission has been criticized for not going far enough to repair the wounds of apartheid, it did succeed in pulling the country back from the brink of civil war, and into safer waters.

A fundamental change in our worldview is required to build a new world not based in the domination and dehumanization, but in partnership and love.

Our United States has not yet mustered the collective courage to address our original sins.

We want to bypass the uncomfortable truth-telling and get straight to the reconciling. After all, that fits better with the story we tell ourselves about America.

Our preferred narrative says that the evils of slavery were mended by the civil rights era, and the Obama presidency proved that we’re a post-racial society. Progress might be slow, but we’re on an inevitable march towards equality.

The truth is much closer to the fight scene in the movie Anchorman.

Instead of newscasters, it’s a relentless push and pull between forces fighting to maintain the punishing status quo, those demanding we live into our promise of liberty and justice for all, and those somewhere in the middle wrestling with guilt, complacency, and an earnest desire to do better.

Trading judgement for awe

Hope lies in how many of us are dusting off the cobwebs of passivity, reclaiming power to shape our future, to become what Emerson calls “active souls.”

Just because our leaders aren’t ready to reckon with the truth doesn’t mean we can’t be.

We can walk out our front door right now and invite someone we’d like to better understand into conversation. We can practice how to disagree respectfully, challenge perspectives, not people, and call each other into widening circles of care.

Guerilla truth commissions fueled by a grassroots network of meaningful conversations can crop up wherever we gather—dinner tables, zoom meetings, one day again, coffee shops—and unleash a firestorm of empathy and compassion.

“The ultimate measure of health in any community might well reside in our ability to stand in awe at what folks have to carry rather than in judgement at how they carry it,” Father Greg Boyle, Founder of Homeboy Industries, a Los Angeles gang rehabilitation center, said in our 2017 conversation.

Conversations get us closer to trading judgement for awe. Sometimes, with a little luck and lots of vulnerability, sharing the stories of our lives helps us breach the semi-permeable membrane between us. As the veils of separation thin, we catch a fleeting glimpse of the field of perpetually existing love that connects us.

With new eyes, new ears, and new hearts, looting and rioting begin to look less deserving of our swift condemnation, and more like an expression of hopelessness from people for whom the promise of America has repeatedly failed.

Inner work for outer change

Martin Luther King, Jr.’s posthumously published “A Testament of Hope,” helps put today’s protests in context with the long legacy of civil uprising.

“Americans who genuinely treasure our national ideals, who know they are still elusive dreams for all too many, should welcome the stirring of Negro demands,” he writes. “Negro agitation is requiring America to reexamine its comforting myths and may yet catalyze drastic reforms that will save us from social catastrophe.”

Decades of grassroots activism, and the scaffolding of organizing that supports it, have led us from the civil rights era to this moment of mass uprising.

Major cities are divesting from punitive tactics of violent domination and investing in community care and social healing. Confederate statues are falling. Anti-racism books lighting up best seller lists.

These are good signs of change. But we need to be mindful of our entrenched urge to declare victory.

Our ability to live into the promise of America isn’t a going to happen through elections and reforms alone.

External reforms can only go as far as the internal work that accompanies them. A fundamental change in our worldview, a new way of processing everything we know, is required to build a new world not based in the domination and dehumanization, but in partnership and love.

It took a global pandemic to slow us down long enough to process the moral outrage of Black people being killed by those sworn to protect them.

May that keep us humble to the work ahead.

Undoing generations of emotional repression, projection, and denial, what Carl Jung called our “collective shadow” that’s kept us all trapped in system of white supremacy, isn’t going to happen overnight. Cultivating whole-hearted connection with ourselves, each other, and the world around us, takes time, training, and lots of practice.

My husband Mike taught our son that in order to hit the ball hard, he had to hold his golf club softly, as if he was cradling a tiny bird.

Ahead of us is a long, slow, grueling path towards living into our fullest potential, into freedom, into collective liberation.

May we hold each other gently, like a baby bird.

Making goodness irresistible

Today’s movement for black lives holds a vision that is less about resistance and more about making goodness irresistible.

Fierce demands for justice are woven with scared healing practices to combat grief and heal the trauma of racism.

The statement of beliefs of Black Lives Matter Global Network is a declaration of interdependence. Such evocative language shimmers and beacons——

“Healing ourselves and each other.”

“Co-creating alongside comrades, allies, and family a culture where each person feels seen, heard, and supported.”

“Work vigorously for freedom and justice for Black people and, by extension, all people.”

“Intentionally build and nurture a beloved community that is bonded together through a beautiful struggle that is restorative, not depleting.”

Peaceful demonstrations in more than 2,000 US communities, in all 50 states, and in many countries, mostly organized by the Black Lives Matter global movement alchemizes these transcendent words into immanent reality.

Antwon Rose was the honor roll high school student killed in 2018 by a police officer in Pittsburgh. At a protest this week, I listened as his cousin addressed the crowd.

He began by saying, “Let me be clear. To the police officers here today, we love you. We are you brothers and sisters. This is not a black community vs. police officers issue. This is not a black vs. white issue. This is all of us against systemic racism.”

Antwon’s murder devastated and outraged him and his entire family. Then George Floyd’s murder triggered them all over again.

He stood before the crowd as a living testimony for what it means to love your enemy, to forgive your oppressor, to choose love over fear, to channel outrage for peace.

Wholeness and healing, he showed us, doesn’t come in spite of grief and loss, but because of it.

Becoming benders

These demonstrations are full-bodied civil liturgies awakening our body politic—clapping, stomping, call-and-response-fist pumping—the physicality of ritual shakes the dust off our sense of possibility.

Black church reimagined for public square: bodies together in motion awaken collective hope.

As Martin Luther King, Jr. said “the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.”

But this arc does not bend on its own.

It bends because we bend it.

The choice before us now is to not to rush to a happy ending, but to summon a complexity that can bear the urge to quell the agitation rocking our nation while remaining ever vigilant to promise of new beginnings.

Black Lives more than matter. Black Lives are exalted. Black Lives are divine.

We are Black Lives, and Black Lives are us.

We are a nation burning, yes.

We are also a nation building.

Birthing.

Bending.

392,Mannon,Shannon,medium,"Glidera Garner raised her voice to calls us into a moment of silence to honor George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and so many others senselessly murdered. As we knelt, an electric current was transmitted from her megaphone directly into our guts.

Garner is one of the student leaders from Phoenixville Area High School who organized the community’s protest on Friday.

Black youth led.

We followed.

Everyone, for one afternoon at least, understood the necessary order of things.

Adults supported the event behind the scenes. Teachers, administrators, and local authorities secured the perimeter, cleared obstacles, and then stepped back and positioned the spotlight directly onto these young revolutionaries.

Nerves mixed with raw zeal emitted from the bodies of the organizing youth, a penetrating purity from which even the most cynical adult had no defense.

One after another, black students and white friends and allies unleashed their pain and heartbreak and hope across the captivated crowd. Not even the mid-speech downpour could flatten our goosebumps.

“We need to break the silence and the violence of 400 years of oppression,” cried McKenzie Hodges.

“It’s a privilege to learn about racism rather than experience it your whole life,”

said white student Rachel Asalton, quoting Muhammed Ali.

A full-bodied civic liturgy commenced — clapping, stomping, call-and-response-fist pumping — the sheer physicality of these rituals shook the dust off our sense of possibility.

The secret of the Black church was brought to life in Reeves Park that afternoon: bodies together in motion awaken collective hope.

In a tender moment, Nakialere Beasley got on stage, hands covering his face, and told the crowd he didn’t like public speaking.

His friends rushed to envelope him. Fortified by their hands on his shoulders, he told of a recent rally when his friend fell to her knees, covered her face and begged an officer,

“Please don’t shoot.”

Then she was shot in the face with a rubber bullet.

Geographically, the march was small, spanning a few blocks. It was pulled together quickly and minimally publicized to ensure peace and safety.

Still, an estimated 2,000 people attended.

Phoenixville’s borough has about 17,000 residents, so while some attendees likely came from neighboring towns, somewhere near 10% of the population came out in the middle of a sweltering workday under threatening skies in solidarity and in rage.

Across the nation, today’s youth are increasingly stepping into the moral vacuum and filling it with radiant courage. Greta Thunberg, the Parkland High School students who Marched for Our Lives, and a global network of young climate activists are renewing hope for the future.

Any grown up with a pulse is dazzled by their leadership.

But that doesn’t get us off the hook.

Living into the promise of America is much too heavy a load for one generation, no matter how impressive, to bear.

These young leaders deserve our praise, but more urgently, demand our support. While we may have forfeited our right to lead movements for change, we can still take responsibility for mentoring and modeling and networking and connecting and protecting and amplifying.

We must weave them into an intergenerational fabric, reimagining a social safety net on a whole new order, to hold them and love them and remind them that they are but one chapter in an everlasting story of elders and ancestor and decedents.

Let them shatter our complacency with the genius of their urgency.

Then, let’s hand the microphone and get out of the way.

393,Mannon,Shannon,medium,"Standing in Awe

A derecho storm blew through my corner of the world this week. Along with massive outages, downed trees, widespread damage, it ushered in a rare, early June heat wave. My family lost power for three days.

None of us slept. We struggled to feed ourselves and took brief ice cold showers. Worried our septic system would flood the basement with sewage, by day three we stopped using running water altogether.

I stopped by The Dollar Tree, one of the few stores with power, to pick up a few things. In the next aisle, I overhear a mom giving her toddler the business. Cursing, yelling, getting after the child for exploring the items on the shelf.

There was such exasperation in her voice, crushing exhaustion.

Instantly, I imagine that toddler as a young boy in the classroom hurling those same curse words at the teacher. I imagine him pulling at his mom’s hemline. His arms raised to be picked up for a hug, and repeatedly getting his hand swatted away, until one day, he just stops asking.

The child wasn’t in danger, but still, I wonder if should do something.

Instead, I went home to resume my daily practice of moping around, fuzzy brained and short tempered.

That’s when my youngest decided to follow me room to room to make sure I was never far from his piercing tantrum. His 13–year-old sister, who apparently has a bigger capacity for parenting than me, saw the seething on my face and intervened.

“Stop it,” she whispered to her brother, “can’t you see Mom is going to lose it!? Look at her!”

I felt so ashamed of my lack of resilience. But, whatever. At least she got one night of good sleep in air conditioning at a friend’s house who had gotten power back.

I just wanted to brush my damn teeth.

Rise to my best self? I could barely even function.

Days passed in a blur and with them, my caring habits. Exercise, meditation, healthy eating, good sleep, all now seem like insurmountable goals. Slumped on my couch in a stupor, I suddenly saw them for the privilege they are.

During my conversation with Father Greg Boyle, Founder of Homeboy Industries, a Los Angeles gang rehabilitation center, he said,

“The ultimate measure of health in any community might well reside in our ability to stand in awe at what folks have to carry rather than in judgement at how they carry it.”

I thought of the mother in the aisle. How many days had she spent feeling just like this? Months? Years?

Instead of projecting a narrative about her life, what if I held her in the radiance of awe?

Perhaps I could have distracted her toddler so she could shop in peace for five minutes. Slipped her a gift card. Or simply caught her eye and offered her that mom-to-exasperated-mom knowing smile.

Even now, I only have the space to reflect because my power is back on. I can sit in my cool house and sip my warm coffee beside the hum of a freshly stocked fridge.

Every good thing about my life — relationships, resilience, creativity — is born from my capacity for inner speciousness. In just three days without running water or reliable electricity, I was stunned, humbled, and frankly, horrified, to see just how quickly it eroded.

I wonder about the Dollar Tree Momma.

How does she cultivate a capacity to nourish her dreams for her child, for herself, and for everyone she loves?

Can her burden be eased by the flick of a switch?

394,Mannon,Shannon,medium,"On September 11, 2001, I was 24 years old and convinced that I was a fraud.

A few weeks after the attacks, I remember opening the full color front page of the Sunday paper. Almost three thousand faces of the dead stared back, lives prematurely ended in that act of unspeakable violence.

“Bear witness,” I whispered.

But I didn’t.

Instead, I balled up the paper, buried it in the bottom of the recycling bin, and tried to forget what I saw.

A sensitive child growing up in a loud world, I’ve always been quite skilled at repressing pain. With 9/11, I went through the motions of grieving alongside our nation, believing that if you can outrun fear, it can’t swallow you whole.

But pain bats last. And I was left exhausted from denying my sorrow, ashamed for trying to avoid it, and diminished by my belief that I wasn’t strong enough to handle any of it.

I had yet to learn the paradoxical truth about suffering.

Denying suffering destroys you. Opening to it awakens our compassion, which is the gateway to the most powerful force in the world:

Love.

Coronavirus, with its human and economic wreckage, evokes an eerily similar response as 9/11. The toll still unknown, but devastation is assured.

All will be well

Over these almost 20 years, I’ve practiced inhabiting the places that scare me. I’m still plenty afraid, but, mercifully, have more awareness when I start to fear the fear.

The funny thing about fear is how is dissipates — softens, loosens — when we bring gentle attention to it. A quieter truth emerges. Something akin to your Grandma Helen’s needlepoint above the kitchen sink: “This too shall pass.”

Lately, friends sheltering in places have called confessing to waking up to a mystifying calmness amidst the swirling chaos.

Unlike my 9/11 avoidance, their peace doesn’t deny terrible crisis. Instead they’ve cultivated a quality of aliveness that illness, devastation, even death, can’t touch.

14th century mystic Julian of Norwich said “all will be well, all will be well, all manner of things will be well.

Against all reason, they believe her.

Sacred is at the heart of sacrifice

Coronavirus is demanding sacrifices from us, great and small. “Sacred” is at the root of sacrifice, meaning to cut open, to give something up. Not because a vengeful God requires sacrifice, but because the friction of shedding ignites the fire of purification necessary to reveal the gold within.

When everything is given up, everything can be given.

As a global body, we’ve been careening forward unsustainably for far too long. The horrible truth is that some of us will pay a higher price than others. Those least responsible are most at risk. For it’s not the corporate titans who’ve chosen profit over people, but the laborers with no safety net who are most vulnerable.

Sacrifice hurts, even for those of us lucky enough to ride this thing out with our basic needs met. But great sages throughout time teach that the inside in the fire of tribulation is a womb that gives birth to a renewed spirit inside us. There is a stirring in the womb of life. A loudening rumble that the great pause of Coronavirus lets us hear.

Tip the scales towards equilibrium

The history of emergencies is that short-term fixes become entrenched ways of life. Consider our pre and post 9/11 flying norms of shoe removable and liquid restrictions, as one example. Decisions that would normally take years are made in days.

Make no mistake. There are real systems that profit from isolation and alienating us.

As Rebecca Solnit says, people who find their deepest meaning and satisfaction in their connection to each other don’t make good consumers.

We must act decisively so short-term measures tip the scales towards equilibrium, mercy, and community care, not tightening authoritarianism. Becoming co-creators of the future we want to inhabit begins with believing that’s possible. We have far greater power and resilience than we realize. How quickly we’ve adapted to thrive in this new environment with no preparation, under enormous stress.

Normal wasn’t working for us

Individually, we’re sharing with each other, talking to our neighbors from a safe distance, checking in on the vulnerable. Evenings are spent playing games, cooking meals, or enjoying the solitude of long walks. By no longer commuting to work or chauffeuring kids, we’re reducing our carbon footprint, and rediscovering simple joys.

Nationally, impossibilities have become possible. Astra Taylor reports on Coronavirus’s impact on public life.

“All along, the homeless could’ve been housed and sheltered in government buildings; water and electricity didn’t need to be turned off for people behind on their bills; paid sick leave could‘ve been a right for all workers; paying your mortgage late didn’t need to lead to foreclosure.”

Parents thrown into homeschooling may now be more invested in the most effective ways to engage curious learners, rather than relentlessly pursuing Harvard. Telemedicine can transform healthcare, just like online learning could spark innovation to reduce the astronomical costs of higher education. After being forced to abandon our (atrophying) public spaces, we can create space anew. Modern day parlors, French for “a place for speaking,” living rooms where our social imagination can be nourished, and we find our way back to each other.

Maybe we don’t want to go back to normal. Maybe normal wasn’t working for us.

“Now I deem the world To be a womb In this womb I have seen such serenity in the midst of the flames I saw a whole new world.” — Rumi

Just one year ago, we watched in horror as Notre Dame, known as our great mother, burned. As her famous spire crackled and fell, Parisians poured onto the streets holding candles and singing songs of praise and mourning, compelled to metabolize their grief in public.

What if they harnessed the generative power of their grief and turned to each other to rebuild their home? Instead, this vital work was given over to a small group of outsider experts, funded by a handful of powerful billionaires.

We did not heed her prophetic warning.

Christians recently celebrated Easter, where the darkness of the tomb gives way to light. Death is overcome by life eternal.

Here again, we’re at the time of the census.

Mother Mary gave birth to Jesus in Bethlehem where she’d traveled for the census to stand up and be counted.

What we thought was a tomb is a womb.

The future we imagine is laboring hard, pregnant with anticipation, but she will not birth herself. We’re her midwives. Like Mary, let’s stand up and be counted. Let’s find each other and work together to give birth to a new way of life.

395,Mannon,Shannon,thephiladelphiacitizen,"The physical distancing necessary to slow down the spread of the coronavirus puts us at higher risk for another serious health concern: social isolation.

Long before the coronavirus crisis, America had a public health epidemic of loneliness, rising rates of teen suicide and our widening political divide. Because of that, we’re already far along the path of isolation.

It’s making us sick.

New evidence shows that social isolation is a greater detriment to health than obesity and smoking, and that it increases our chances of getting heart disease, dementia and depression.

As we’re now forced to take extreme measures to distance ourselves (and rightly so), we have a rare opportunity to reckon with the social isolation we’ve allowed to fester.

This moment offers us a choice.

Physical distancing can push us further apart, rupturing into social recession. Or, we can rise up, like Americans often do in time of crisis, and band together to create a better future.

Fortunately, fertile soil awaits.

A robust movement is simmering beneath the surface: neighbors, organizations, coalitions who refuse to believe that our isolation is inevitable. This grassroots alliance of social fabric-weavers is harnessing the inexhaustible power of our primal drive for connection to build a future we want to inhabit.

Now, they’re poised to lead us back together.

A group of us in Phoenixville, PA—five mothers concerned with the future we’re creating for our children—created the Phoenixville Conversation Project. While the most extreme voices get the most airtime, causing many to withdraw, structured conversation can bring us back together.

It’s working.

We’re hosting a series of Living Room Conversations, a simple structure for people who disagree to have a meaningful conversation. These conversations allow our community to grapple with hard issues. We’re building trust, deepening relationships and increasing a sense of belonging.

Coronavirus means we’re shifting to virtual conversations, but participants are more committed than ever. During conversations we listen not to respond, but to understand, a practice that spills over into our lives.

“Because of these conversations,” shares participant Stephanie Root, “I’m conscious of how I listen. I assumed people wanted comments like ‘Yeah!’ I’m learning that being quiet and present is enough.”

Conversation helps us cultivate inner spaciousness that brings calm clarity in moments of high anxiety. “I’m learning to practice silent affirmation during our conversations,” said participant Linda Valloor. “Showing care without words helps me as a teacher and parent.”

Social connection doesn’t require physical contact. Dr. Catherine Renzulli, principal of Phoenixville’s Schuylkill Elementary, was looking for opportunities to increase civic discourse. The Conversation Project inspired her to consider adding a “question of the week” prompt in her weekly email blasts to equip families with tools for connection while schools are closed.

Living Room Conversations has created a new resource hub, which includes new conversation guides about “Life in the Time of Corona” to help a bewildered nation grapple with a rapidly shifting environment.

They’re just some of more than 100 Conversation Guides that can be downloaded for free and used to host virtual conversations on video conferencing platforms like Zoom. Inviting vulnerable people into conversation, folks who live alone, senior citizens, or those with weaker immune systems, can reduce their isolation and help us care for each other.

Additionally, Nation Conversation Project’s 300 partner organizations have created a new campaign to help Americans connect, converse and care in response to the pandemic. Its new site includes conversation prompts, acts of kindness and caring ideas.

Disasters reveal our buried capacities. Most people are more generous and more caring than we assume. Physical distancing can bring renewed vigor to our social connection. Despite our seismic differences, we need each other. Not just to reach across divides to design robust solutions, but because we’re tied together in invisible places. When we tear, it diminishes us all.

Conversation, imbued by a spirit of generous listening, might be one of the last, best spaces where we taste the America that’s possible. The America, in fact, that we want to be.
