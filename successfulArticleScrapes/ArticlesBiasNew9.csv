0,Bush,George W.,washingtonpost,"I hope that these faces, and the stories that accompany them, serve as a reminder that immigration isn’t just a part of our heritage. New Americans are just as much a force for good now, with their energy, idealism and love of country, as they have always been.

I write about a champion runner who barely survived ethnic violence in East Africa, and who told me, “America has given me everything I dreamed of as a boy.” I share the story of a young man from France who followed his dream to become an American soldier, and went on to earn the Medal of Honor. And readers may recognize two distinguished citizens who fled prewar Europe as children, and who each became U.S. secretary of state.

The backgrounds are varied, but readers won’t have to search hard for a common theme. It’s gratitude. So many immigrants are filled with appreciation, a spirit nicely summed up by a Cuban American friend who said: “If I live for a hundred years, I could never repay what this country has done for me.”

The help and respect historically accorded to new arrivals is one reason so many people still aspire and wait to become Americans. So how is it that in a country more generous to new arrivals than any other, immigration policy is the source of so much rancor and ill will? The short answer is that the issue has been exploited in ways that do little credit to either party. And no proposal on immigration will have credibility without confidence that our laws are carried out consistently and in good faith.

“Out of Many, One” is not a brief for any specific set of policies, which I leave to the political leaders of today. However, the book — along with the George W. Bush Presidential Center — does set forth principles for reform that can restore the people’s confidence in an immigration system that serves both our values and our interests.

One place to start is DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals). Americans who favor a path to citizenship for those brought here as children, known as ""dreamers,"" are not advocating open borders. They just recognize that young men and women who grew up in the United States, and who never knew any other place as home, are fundamentally American. And they ought not be punished for choices made by their parents.

Another opportunity for agreement is the border. I have long said that we can be both a lawful and a welcoming nation at the same time. We need a secure and efficient border, and we should apply all the necessary resources — manpower, physical barriers, advanced technology, streamlined and efficient ports of entry, and a robust legal immigration system — to assure it.

Effective border management starts well beyond the border, so we must work with our neighbors to help them build freedom and opportunity so their citizens can thrive at home. We cannot rely on enforcement alone to prevent the untenable and so often heartbreaking scenes that come with large-scale migration.

We also need a modernized asylum system that provides humanitarian support and appropriate legal channels for refugees to pursue their cases in a timely manner. The rules for asylum should be reformed by Congress to guard against unmerited entry and reserve that vital status for its intended recipients.

Increased legal immigration, focused on employment and skills, is also a choice that both parties should be able to get behind. The United States is better off when talented people bring their ideas and aspirations here. We could also improve our temporary entry program, so that seasonal and other short-term jobs can more readily be filled by guest workers who help our economy, support their families and then return home.

As for the millions of undocumented men and women currently living in the United States, a grant of amnesty would be fundamentally unfair to those who came legally or are still waiting their turn to become citizens. But undocumented immigrants should be brought out of the shadows through a gradual process in which legal residency and citizenship must be earned, as for anyone else applying for the privilege. Requirements should include proof of work history, payment of a fine and back taxes, English proficiency and knowledge of U.S. history and civics, and a clean background check. We should never forget that the desire to live in the United States — a worldwide and as powerful an aspiration as ever — is an affirmation of our country and what we stand for. Over the years, our instincts have always tended toward fairness and generosity. The reward has been generations of grateful, hard-working, self-reliant, patriotic Americans who came here by choice.

If we trust those instincts in the current debate, then bipartisan reform is possible. And we will again see immigration for what it is: not a problem and source of discord, but a great and defining asset of the United States.",1,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/04/16/george-w-bush-immigration-portraits-out-of-many-one/
1,Bush,George W.,newsbreak,"Aiming for six-pack abs may create paradoxical dilemmas for fitness enthusiasts. If you check Google for six-pack abs you may come up with 44 million results. If you search YouTube, you can see thousands of videos. Almost all fitness magazines have at least one article about how to get six-pack abs. This article reveals my hard-learned lessons about the pursuit of defined abdominals spanning two decades.

Photo by James Barr on Unsplash

As an indication, some videos about six-pack abs get millions of views on YouTube. These viral videos are prepared by both male and female presenters. For example, this 12-minute video about a six-pack abs workout by a male presenter received 75 million views. And this 10-minute video by a female presenter received almost 46 million views.

A massive focus on workouts and the many resources I read and watch relates to belly fat loss and defined body. However, from my experience, gaining six-pack abs require more than just exercise.

Fitness has been a long journey for me.

I have never felt obsessed with a six-pack belly. Gaining six-pack abdominals has not been my specific fitness goal.

My specific goals were increasing my flexibility, agility, strength, and lean muscle mass. Gaining defined abdominal after the age of 50 was a pleasant surprise.

It happened as a by-product of my effective lifestyle choices. Witnessing defined abdominals without losing lean muscles indicated my fitness progress was on the right track.

It won't be right if I say it didn't give me super joy after 20 years of effort. Losing undesirable abdominal fat and excess skin has been a remarkable achievement.

Gaining a defined abdomen is a long process. Reviewing and redefining my fitness goals and making tiny tweaks in my lifestyle choices became the catalyst.

Prioritising fitness, making it a passion, integrating practical activities, and turning them into micro habits, opened the doors.

Consistently moving my body with joy has been the framework of my fitness regime.

Experiencing many ups and downs, fitness was always the main priority over other tasks. I sacrificed sleep, social gatherings, and even some work commitments just to be able to stay fit. As crazy as it may sound, getting nicknames such as ""fitness freak"" energized me even more.

Anything excessive taken to extreme measures come with a high cost. Setting goals kept my dopamine level intact hence I always felt motivated for workouts. My deadly mistake was thinking exercise was the only solution to have a defined body. I invested more than the required time to lose body fat and keep lean muscles.

This mistake cost me a lot. It delayed my outcomes for at least three decades. During this long period gaining muscles was not an issue; however, losing fat without losing muscle was a challenge. As a result, I wasted decades on the wrong path by only addressing one part of the equation for fitness.

Neglecting diet as the other part of the equation was the main culprit for my failure. From hindsight, it was not neglect, but the unchallenged beliefs gained from wrong information. Thinking fat-free and low calory food was best became the central part of the problem.

Logically caloric deficit would cause losing fat but not knowing about the effect of insulin and cortisol on fat metabolism created a mysteries dilemma.

Learning about the role of elevated cortisol on belly fat became an “aha” moment for me. Several other hormonal intricacies of fat metabolism put me on the right track.

With the blessing of never gaining excess fat or being obese, I always suffered from undesirable belly fat.

With the new knowledge at 40, I made dramatic changes in my lifestyle. Rather than entirely focusing on exercise, I concentrated on using body fat as my primary energy source.

Using body fat as the source of energy, I transformed into a fat-adapted mode. Doing this turned out to be the secret weapon in my arsenal.

After achieving the fat-adapted state, tremendous changes happened to my metabolism.

Cravings disappeared. Blood glucose got stabilised. Insulin spikes and elevated cortisol levels substantially declined.

Learning the roles of insulin and cortisol in getting rid of abdominal fat gave me the key to a fascinating success. When body blood glucose stabilised, insulin spikes disappeared, and cortisol levels dropped, the belly fat started mobilising and melting.

More exciting, burning belly fat as the energy source increased my motivation and joy. Workouts became natural. Fatigue and tiredness disappeared.

Even though it is a controversial topic, fasting has been the best tool in controlling my blood glucose and insulin. Eating just one meal a day turned out to be a new lifestyle.

Fasting did not cost me any money. It helped me save money. I used to spend a lot of money on protein powders and a lot of expensive fitness supplements. Fasting replaced all those investments.

As a by-product of fasting, my body activated the recovery system. Staying in a fasted state long expedited fat burning and got rid of toxins and even unwanted skin, especially from the abdominal area.

Initially, fasting was a bit challenging, but after being fat-adapted, it turned into a natural process. Fasting also helped me change my diet regime. Eating just one meal a day turned out to be a new lifestyle.

Losing fat is relatively easier than maintaining a low-fat state. With one meal a day, maintaining this has never become an issue again. Nowadays, I rarely feel hungry even after 24 hours of fasting.

To summarise, fat adaption was my first secret to getting rid of stubborn belly fat.

Secondly, understanding cortisol's role in belly fat and reducing elevated level opened the secret door to success.

Thirdly, keeping my blood sugar and insulin levels under control provided a sustainable solution.

With these three radical and essential changes in my lifestyle, I Freed Myself From Inflammation, Back Pain, And Limping. Reducing inflammation helped burn more fat, reduced a bloated look, and gave me a better-defined body.

While shrinking my fat cells and loose skin cells, my stress tolerance has substantially increased. My motivation for resistance training increased. The quality of my sleep improved.

Having six-pack belly fat is not just about aesthetics and vanity but more about experiencing a fitter, healthier, happier, and more productive life.

We don't need to make having a six-pack belly an ultimate goal; instead, we need to focus on fitness, health and joy. The manifestation of a defined abdominal area serves as useful feedback indicating our success and showing us we are on the right track.

Eliminating belly fat and getting rid of loose skin naturally may take decades, but the results can create substantial pleasure in our lives.

Thank you for reading my perspectives.

2,Bush,George W.,fivebooks,"When you listen to presidential memoirs as audiobooks, you can hear an American president telling you their own story—at least when it comes to recent presidents. Going further back in time, biographies may be more useful. Veteran audiobook reviewer Robin Whitten , editor of Audiofile magazine, recommends the best audiobooks about US presidents, and explains the crucial role of professional narrators in bringing big books to life.

Your recommendations focus on audiobooks where you can hear a president telling their own story, in their own voice. But you’re also going to mention some biographies, just so listeners have a wider selection to choose from, is that right?

Yes, we’re going to talk about presidential memoirs, primarily, today. But I realized that in the audiobook format, the idea of a memoir where you actually hear the subject—or in this case a president, or former president—is a relatively new phenomenon. Recording a living person in an audiobook studio doesn’t go back very far, probably to the 1980s. Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan did memoirs, but they were abridgements. They are archival because you hear their voices in the recording, but they are not full-length memoirs.

Perhaps the lucrative incentive of writing a memoir and recording it has encouraged the later American presidents. Earlier presidents seem to have waited to do a lifetime memoir. Now we have people writing memoirs about early parts of their lives, so in the course of a lifetime, there will be multiple memoirs, not just one.

Is it partly that it’s easier to make recordings now? As you said, the earlier ones are all abridged and quite brief, whereas now, Obama’s presidential memoir is 29 hours or so, which is a lot of time in a studio, narrating.

It’s interesting, because there are usually two versions of the memoirs. In the case of Bill Clinton, the memoir that he reads is an abridgment, it’s six hours. But there also is the full-length recording of the entire text, which is close to 30 hours, but that was recorded by a professional narrator. All along, we’ve had that balance of hearing the president himself on a shorter version or abridgment. And then, if you are truly interested in listening to the entire memoir, there usually has been an unabridged version with a professional narrator. And very happily with the Obama memoir, we have the totally unabridged version with President Obama reading it.

Read 1 A Promised Land by Barack Obama Read

Let’s go through the audiobooks you’re recommending today. Why don’t we start with your favourite. Which of these presidential memoirs do you think is the best as an audiobook?

As an audiobook, hands down it’s President Obama’s A Promised Land, which has just come out in the last few months. It’s absolutely stunning as a listening experience, and I think his style of writing and presentation suit the format beautifully. As he’s said in interviews he’s done about the memoir, he wants to speak directly to listeners and in particular to young people. I heard him do a presentation for the high school system of Chicago, where he is talking to the students. In his lovely style he says, ‘kids, you’re not really going to enjoy all of it. But there’s a lot of really important stuff that I put in here for you.’ And I think that’s true. There are really wonderful lessons and thoughtful ideas for young people to take hold of.

As a genre the presidential memoir is going to include detailed stuff on, say, in Obama’s case, the passage of a healthcare reform bill. It’s not going to be edge-of-your-seat listening, I suppose.

You’re going over many years of history, of a person’s life. With the Obama memoir, at AudioFile we interviewed the producer of the audiobook, Dan Zitt, who is an executive producer at Penguin Random House. He said that if you think of memoir as a genre, it begins with the writer trying to recreate their journey in a way that satisfies their own need for reflection. I thought that was such an interesting thing to say about Obama. It is probably one of the reasons that his memoir is so brilliant, his reflective nature about his presidential terms. It also tells you why the George Bush memoir is a totally different kind of journey. Each of them is taking a journey and they’re wanting to tell you a story about that journey.

Read 2 My Life by Bill Clinton Read

Which one do you want to talk about next?

Let’s go on to the Bill Clinton memoir, My Life.

How highly do you rate Bill Clinton as an audiobook narrator of his memoir?

I think he has a very good presentational style. I listened primarily to the short one, with President Clinton, who did a narration of six hours. I loved it. You’re really hearing him, his style and his accent, his voice, which I recognize. When I then switched and listened to Michael Beck, who is the narrator of the unabridged version, it really seemed to lack something for me. That’s because I know what Bill Clinton’s voice sounds like. 20 years from now, the people listening probably won’t recall his voice so specifically.

When it comes out in a timely way, you appreciate the fact that you’re hearing a president tell the story of his life. It’s very effective that way. But if you are a serious reader of memoirs and history, you don’t want to miss anything that might have been cut out of the full memoir.

My Life follows very much the form of mixing personal and political life, which, of course, is completely intertwined for all of them. But I think that intersection of the personal and political in the Clinton memoir was a particularly interesting aspect of it, as he tells it.

Clinton’s memoir is quite candid, then? It’s a satisfying experience listening to it?

I think so. Of course, it was carefully prepared, but he was good with his presentation. Whether he wrote it completely himself or not, I don’t really know. With the Obama memoir, they say he did pretty much write all of it himself, which I’m not sure is the case for some of the others.

Not to give too many compliments to Obama, but even before he became president, he’d won a Grammy for the reading of an audiobook memoir. Bill Clinton is obviously a very good public speaker, a charismatic person, and I like his accent. But that doesn’t necessarily translate into perfect audiobook narration. I felt Obama was more professional at the actual audiobook delivery.

Right, and that’s because Obama has experience with two other audiobooks and he understands the storytelling nature of the audiobook format. You have to tell it like a story. You can’t just read the text well. And I think when you get to George W. Bush’s Decision Points, his style, it’s very clear that he’s reading what he has written. In this case, if I wanted to hear his version of his presidency, I probably would want to listen to Ron McLarty, who reads the unabridged version of Decision Points.

It’s complicated, isn’t it?

Yes, it’s sometimes complicated by what you think about their politics, but also whether you like the sound of their voice.

There’s also the archival nature of these memoirs. They are not only recordings of the presidents’ voices, but with their own story. That creates something that is very important history.

By saying it’s their story are you saying they’re putting their spin on it?

Yes, but also that they’ve written it as their memoir.

Read 3 Decision Points by George W Bush Read

Let’s talk about Decisions Points next, as we’ve already mentioned it. This is George W. Bush’s bestselling memoir, which covers the terrorist attacks of 9/11 and the financial crisis. It was quite an eventful presidency, so should make for interesting reading. How does it rate as an audiobook?

It’s interesting to see the variety of these memoirs. Much as I’m not a big fan of George W. Bush for his politics, it was an important time in history, and his take on it is important too, and hearing him talk about it. But I think his writing is not as well-suited to narrative. It doesn’t flow in a storytelling style.

“You appreciate the fact that you’re hearing a president tell the story of his life”

When you talk to authors who are writing fiction, if they read their work aloud to themselves when they’re writing it, it’s probably going to be a better audiobook than if no one has ever read that sentence aloud. One of the things about history—and probably biography as well—is that not all authors, including presidents, think about creating a sentence that is to be read aloud. I think I might be more interested in reading George W. Bush’s memoir in full length with my eyes.

Read 4 Promise Me, Dad by Joe Biden Read

Next on your list of presidential memoir audiobooks is a reasonably short one—just under nine hours—by the man who has since become the 46th President of the United States. This is Promise Me, Dad, by Joe Biden.

This is Joe Biden‘s first memoir, probably there will be others. It’s perhaps not as substantial a memoir as he may write later. He published Promise Me, Dad in 2017 and it’s more or less a memoir about his time as vice president at the time of his son Beau’s death. It’s a moving, personal story delivered with empathy.

I think right now people are very interested in Joe Biden. That’s why I put it on the list—if you want to know a little bit more about not just his own personal tragedy and how he felt and his reflections on that, but also about his time in the US Senate and as vice president.

It’s also interesting listening to this now and thinking about whether what he said he wanted to do then is something that he can actually implement as president. What is going to happen in the term that’s just starting?

Does Biden narrate the whole of Promise Me, Dad?

Yes. It’s bit like Obama’s Audacity of Hope, or Dreams From My Father. Both of those are shorter. Just like Biden’s book, the scope of time was limited—they’re not about an entire presidency or an entire life.

But they’re still political. These are memoirs by people with an eye on higher office, rather than candid tell-alls of their life?

Right. Whatever they’re telling, it seems that it’s probably for a purpose in their political career.

Read 5 The Annotated Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant by Ulysses S Grant and Elizabeth Samet (editor), Mark Bramhall (narrator) Read

Let’s move on to the fifth presidential memoir audiobook you’ve selected, which, sadly, was not narrated by the president himself. At the beginning of Decision Points, George W Bush tells us that this was the memoir people recommended he read as he set out writing his own memoir.

Yes, for my fifth book, I picked probably one of the most highly regarded memoirs by an American president, which is The Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant. Grant was the US president after the Civil War, after Abraham Lincoln was assassinated. He had two terms as president, but his career before that had been as a general, as commander of the Union Army.

After his presidency, he wrote voluminous memoirs, looking back at a lot of the Civil War battles and giving his overview and perspective on the history. He seems to have found a voice in his memoirs, that maybe no one expected.

The audiobook of the memoir is read by a professional narrator, Mark Bramhall. This is again very long, nearly 30 hours. Particularly for this long form, you have to engage your listeners and the narrator needs to be engaged with the material. In order to sustain your listeners, you have to keep a pace. What I really liked about Mark’s narration is that he was able to do that.

He manages to pull it off, does he?

He does, really well. Possibly years from now we’ll look back at these current memoirs, that were read by a professional narrator. If you’re really interested in the history of the time, having someone who paces your listening experience, who sustains the energy throughout the whole thing, will be a plus.

Wow, that’s fascinating that a narrator can keep it up for such a voluminous book.

Yes, it’s long. And we see the same thing when it comes to biographies.

Yes, before we get to the last presidential memoir you’ve chosen as a good audiobook experience, you wanted to mention a few presidential biographies that have been well done as audiobooks. Is that partly because biographies allow us to go a bit further back in time?

Yes, it allows us to go a little further back, but also because I think that audiobook biographies are a great category. And there are lots of interesting ones, particularly of several of the American presidents.

The Passage of Power is one of four, possibly five, volumes of Robert Caro’s biography of Lyndon B. Johnson (the whole thing is called The Years of Lyndon Johnson). Each of them is around 30 hours long and they’re all narrated by Grover Gardner, over a period of almost 20 years. He’s in the head of Robert Caro and is totally connected to that writing. He is an AudioFile Golden Voice Narrator and has a long career of nonfiction biography. He just knows how to make the pace for these very long, longform works to keep the listeners with him, with enough energy but not putting so much energy in that it’s exhausting for you as a listener.

“You have to tell it like a story. You can’t just read the text well”

Also, keeping the details straight. In all of these books there’s a lot of historical and political detail. If you’re reading with your eyes, if there’s a long section about legislation that you might not be interested in, you can just skip ahead a bit. You can’t do that easily in an audiobook—so that puts a burden on the narrator to get you through the long and perhaps less exciting parts of an audiobook memoir or biography.

Once you get to biographies, you also get the perspective of time. Memoirs are written when that person is alive, so there’s not as much opportunity for that. In this book you get Robert Caro’s perspective as a biographer and historian and possibly see the person and the presidency in a slightly different light. Lyndon B Johnson was a master of how to get really important legislation through the US Senate.

You also like the narration of Truman by David McCullough and read by Nelson Runger. Oh my goodness, this one is 54 hours! Was he a good president?

Harry Truman was a president that probably didn’t enjoy as much of a positive reputation for his presidency at the time, but the way McCullough was able to profile him brought him into a context that made his presidency better understood.

Alright, and then going back to the beginning of the American Republic, you also wanted to mention The Founding Fathers Collection. This is useful if somebody is comprehensively looking for audiobooks about presidents. It’s a nice collection of audiobooks to learn about some of the early presidents like Washington, Adams, Madison, etc.

Yes, because we don’t have memoirs, we have biographies. There is also an interesting biography of Ulysses S Grant called Grant by Ron Chernow. That’s read by the same narrator who did the memoirs, Mark Bramhall.

Read 6 White House Diary by Jimmy Carter Read

Finally, let’s go back to the last memoir you chose that’s narrated by a president himself. This is Jimmy Carter’s White House Diary. Carter has done a lot of memoirs hasn’t he? There’s one about being a boy in Depression-era Georgia, then he’s also written A Full Life: Reflections at Ninety. He’s quite prolific, isn’t it?

He is. He enjoys writing. Maybe doing these memoirs of different parts of his life was more interesting to him than doing a definitive, long one starting with, ‘I was born in Georgia.’ He’s still recording programs in his 90s. His last book was faith-based, as I recall. I didn’t mention it, because it wasn’t about his life as president.

And White House Diary is a good one to listen to?

White House Diary is interesting. It’s a focused part of the time that he was in the White House. It’s shorter than some of the other books we’ve been discussing, it’s not an exhaustive look at his presidency.

He’s probably done more impressive stuff since his presidency, so maybe it makes sense that it’s not his only point of focus.

I think that’s true. He came to the presidency without a lot of political background, and that’s really hard. The humanitarian work he did in the years after the presidency is perhaps more significant in a way—like his involvement with Habitat for Humanity and other things that he has done.",1,https://fivebooks.com/best-books/presidential-memoirs-audiobooks-robin-whitten/
3,Bush,George W.,newsbreak,"The convictions of Derek Chauvin might not mark the end of this racially divisive case. The US Supreme Court might ultimately decide whether to uphold the convictions. Congresswoman Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) made a statement — while jurors in the trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin were not yet sequestered — which demanded street confrontations unless Chauvin were found guilty of murder. The trial judge correctly suggested that any conviction in the case might ultimately be thrown out on appeal, based on what Waters said. He condemned Waters’ remarks in the strongest terms, but he did not have the courage to grant a defense motion for a mistrial. Had he done so, that almost certainly would have led to riots — which would have been blamed on the judge, not on Rep. Waters. So he left it to the court of appeals, months in the future, to grant a new trial — which he should have granted.",1,https://www.newsbreak.com/news/2113809045358/cornyn-on-biden-aides-undisclosed-ties-the-senate-is-not-obligated-to-confirm-anyone-who-hides-this-information

6,Bush,George W.,organicconsumers,"Seven CIA veterans have severely criticized the official account of 9/11 and have called for a new investigation. ""I think at simplest terms, there's a cover-up. The 9/11 Report is a joke,"" said Raymond McGovern, 27-year veteran of the CIA, who chaired National Intelligence Estimates during the seventies. ""There are a whole bunch of unanswered questions. And the reason they're unanswered is because this administration will not answer the questions,"" he said. McGovern, who is also the founder of VIPS (Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity), is one of many signers of a petition to reinvestigate 9/11.[1] During his 27-year CIA career, McGovern personally delivered intelligence briefings to Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, their Vice Presidents, Secretaries of State, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and many other senior government officials. Upon retirement in 1990, McGovern was awarded the CIA's Intelligence Commendation Medallion and received a letter of appreciation from then President George H. W. Bush. However, McGovern returned the award[2] in 2006 in protest of the current George W. Bush Administration's advocacy and use of torture.In his blurb for 9/11 and American Empire: Intellectuals Speak Out,"" edited by David Ray Griffin and Peter Dale Scott, McGovern wrote[3]: ""It has long been clear that the Bush-Cheney administration cynically exploited the attacks of 9/11 to promote its imperial designs. But the present volume confronts us with evidence for an even more disturbing conclusion: that the 9/11 attacks were themselves orchestrated by this administration precisely so they could be thus exploited. If this is true, it is not merely the case, as the Downing Street memos show, that the stated reason for attacking Iraq was a lie. It is also the case that the whole ""war on terror"" was based on a prior deception. This book hence confronts the American people---indeed the people of the world as a whole---with an issue second to none in importance and urgency. I give this book, which in no way can be dismissed as the ravings of 'paranoid conspiracy theorists,' my highest possible recommendation.""William Christison, a 29-year CIA veteran, former National Intelligence Officer (NIO) and former Director of the CIA's Office of Regional and Political Analysis also describes the 9/11 Commission Report as a ""joke"" and offers even more outspoken criticism. In a 2006 audio interview[4] he said, ""We very seriously need an entirely new very high level and truly independent investigation of the events of 9/11. I think you almost have to look at the 9/11 Commission Report as a joke and not a serious piece of analysis at all.""Earlier this year, in an endorsement of David Ray Griffin's book, Debunking 9/11 Debunking, Christison wrote[5], ""[There's] a strong body of evidence showing the official U.S. Government story of what happened on September 11, 2001 to be almost certainly a monstrous series of lies."" And in an online essay[6] in late 2006, he wrote, ""I now think there is persuasive evidence that the events of September did not unfold as the Bush administration and the 9/11 Commission would have us believe. An airliner almost certainly did not hit The Pentagon. The North and South Towers of the World Trade Center almost certainly did not collapse and fall to earth because hijacked aircraft hit them.""Prior to his retirement from the CIA in 1979, Christison served as Director of the CIA's Office of Regional and Political Analysis, overseeing 200 analysts who collected intelligence and provided analysis on all regions and every country in the world. Prior to that, he served as one of only a handful of NIO's in the intelligence community. NIO's are responsible for the intelligence community efforts in a particular area and are the principal advisors to the Director of Central Intelligence. Christison was NIO for Southeast Asia, South Asia, and Africa.Melvin Goodman, PhD, is another former senior CIA official who calls the 9/11 Commission Report a ""coverup"" and who signed the petition to reinvestigate 9/11.[7] Goodman was the Division Chief of the CIA's Office of Soviet Affairs and served as Senior Analyst from 1966 - 1990. He also served as Professor of International Security at the National War College from 1986 - 2004.In testimony before a 2005 Congressional briefing on the 9/11 Commission Report[8], Goodman said, ""I want to talk about the [9/11] Commission itself, about the flawed process of the Commission and finally about the conflict of interest within the Commission that is extremely important to understand the failure of the Commission. The final report is ultimately a coverup. I don't know how else to describe it."" Goodman is currently Senior Fellow at the Center for International Policy and Adjunct Professor of Government at Johns Hopkins University.Robert Baer is another well known CIA veteran who has questioned the official account of 9/11. A 21-year CIA veteran and specialist in the Middle East, Baer was awarded the Career Intelligence Medal upon his retirement in 1997. After retirement, he wrote two best-selling non-fiction books about the CIA, See No Evil and Sleeping with the Devil, the former of which was the basis for the Academy Award-winning movie Syriana, starring George Clooney. Baer was also the writer and on-camera commentator for the Emmy Award-nominated documentary Cult of the Suicide Bomber.Baer has repeatedly questioned whether al-Qaida could have accomplished 9/11 alone. The 9/11 Commission Report categorically found al-Qaida to be entirely responsible for 9/11, stating, ""Similarly, we have seen no evidence that any foreign government -- or government official -- supplied any funding."" However, this 9/11 Commission finding directly contradicts the earlier finding of the Joint House-Senate Select Intelligence Committee's 2002 Report[9] (p.415) of ""sources of foreign support for some of the September 11 hijackers.""In a 2002 essay[10] for The Guardian, Baer wrote, ""Did bin Laden act alone, through his own al-Qaida network, in launching the attacks? About that I'm far more certain and emphatic: no."" In subsequent interviews, Baer has suggested that support for the attacks could have come from Saudi Arabia and Iran.In 2006, during an interview by Thom Hartmann[11], Baer, after commenting on the financial profits being made from 9/11, was asked: ""What about political profit? There are those who suggest that ... someone in that chain of command ... had pretty good knowledge that 9/11 was going to happen -- and really didn't do much to stop it -- or even obstructed efforts to stop it because they thought it would lend legitimacy to Bush's ... failing presidency."" Baer replied: ""Absolutely."" Hartmann then asked, ""So you are personally of the opinion ... that there was an aspect of 'inside job' to 9/11 within the U.S. government?"" To which Baer replied, ""There is that possibility, the evidence points at it."" When Hartmann continued, ""And why is it not being investigated?"" Baer replied, ""Why isn't the WMD story being investigated? Why hasn't anybody been held accountable for 9/11? We held people accountable after Pearl Harbor. Why has there been no change in command? Why have there been no political repercussions? Why has there been no -- any sort of exposure on this? It really makes you wonder.""In his blurb for the revised and updated edition of David Ray Griffin's Debunking 9/11 Debunking, Baer wrote[12]: ""Until we get a complete, honest, transparent investigation , we will never know what happened on 9/11.""""I am forced to conclude that 9/11 was at a minimum allowed to happen as a pretext for war,"" wrote well-known intelligence analyst Robert David Steele in 2006 in a review of the book, 9/11 Synthetic Terror by Webster Tarpley[13]. Steele is the author of numerous books on the intelligence services and is currently the CEO of OSS.net, a proponent of Open Source Intelligence. Steele has 25 years of combined service in the CIA and the U.S. Marine Corps. He also served as the second ranking civilian (GS-14) in U.S. Marine Corps Intelligence from 1988 - 1992 and was a member of the Adjunct Faculty of Marine Corps University. Steele continued, ""I have to tell anyone who cares to read this: I believe it. I believe it enough to want a full investigation that passes the smell test of the 9/11 families as well as objective outside observers.""In a subsequent interview on the Alex Jones Show[14], Steele said, ""The U.S. government did not properly investigate this [9/11] and there are more rocks to be turned over,"" and added, ""I'm absolutely certain that WTC 7 was brought down by controlled demolition and that, as far as I'm concerned, means that this case has not been properly investigated. There's no way that building could have come down without controlled demolition.""In late 2004, a group of 25 intelligence service and law enforcement veterans sent a joint letter to Congress[15] expressing their concerns about ""serious shortcomings,"" ""omissions,"" and ""major flaws"" in the 9/11 Commission Report and offering their services for a new investigation. Their letter was apparently entirely ignored. Among the signers were four CIA veterans; Raymond McGovern and Melvin Goodman (both mentioned above) and Lynne Larkin and David MacMichael.Lynne Larkin was a CIA Operations Officer who served in several CIA foreign stations before being assigned to the CIA's Counter-Intelligence Center. There, she co-chaired a multi-agency task force, which, among other functions, provided direction to other federal agencies for coordinating intelligence efforts among the many intelligence and law enforcement agencies.David MacMichael, PhD, is a former Senior Estimates Officer at the CIA with special responsibility for Western Hemisphere Affairs at the CIA's National Intelligence Council. Prior to joining the CIA, he served as a U.S. Marine Corps officer for ten years and for four years as a counter-insurgency advisor to the government.Their letter read:""[W]e the undersigned wish to bring to the attention of the Congress and the people of the United States what we believe are serious shortcomings in the report and its recommendations.Omission is one of the major flaws in the Commission's report. We are aware of significant issues and cases that were duly reported to the commission by those of us with direct knowledge, but somehow escaped attention.The omission of such serious and applicable issues and information by itself renders the report flawed, and casts doubt on the validity of many of its recommendations. ...The Commission, with its incomplete report of ""facts and circumstances"", intentional avoidance of assigning accountability, and disregard for the knowledge, expertise and experience of those who actually do the job, has now set about pressuring our Congress and our nation to hastily implement all its recommendations.We the undersigned, who have worked within various government agencies (FBI, CIA, FAA, DIA, Customs) responsible for national security and public safety, call upon you in Congress to include the voices of those with first-hand knowledge and expertise in the important issues at hand. We stand ready to do our part.""And they and thousands of dedicated, loyal, and experienced military officers, intelligence service and law enforcement veterans, and government officials still stand ready to provide assistance for a thorough, impartial, and honest investigation into the terrible acts of 9/11.Statements questioning the official account of 9/11 and calls for a new investigation by hundreds of credible individuals can be found at http://PatriotsQuestion911.com--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[1] Petition to Reinvestigate 9/11.

7,Bush,George W.,thebulwark,"We have all heard any number of explanations for President Donald Trump’s seemingly erratic behavior. They range from the psychological—he’s insecure, narcissistic, and megalomaniacal—to the folksy—he’s childish, selfish, immature—to the calculating—he measures his worth by wealth as well as his ability to dominate “deals.”

Let me add to these plausible explanations another—one potentially more dangerous. Yes, wealth (or, especially, being viewed as wealthy) is rooted deep in his self-understanding. But let’s look at his “calculation” in more than economic terms. His vision of his own greatness has ingredients beyond the monetary: It also includes sexual conquests, whether easy or forced; the ability to raise up friends and destroy enemies at will; plus all the varied aspects of love of power seemingly exercised for its own sake but, more often, used to control or humiliate those who might cross him. These desires may seem wanton or self-defeating, but he pursues them with a singleness of purpose that have all the hallmarks of calculation.

But calculation toward what end, what purpose? He is a rabid self-promoter, but to stop there is to put too easygoing a name on it. What he seems on every level to love is fame—notoriety, celebrity, importance. It matters not if fame comes from good works and admiration or from hatred and contempt: It all leads to the same glory—he came, he saw, he conquered.

Now the love of fame is an odd attribute, perhaps especially in a democracy. Hamilton in The Federalist refers to it as “the ruling passion of the noblest minds.” When love of fame is linked to doing right by one’s country, the judgment of history can give such a statesman and his name a kind of eternal life.

Hamilton understood the limits and the perils of this passion when thwarted by legal obstacles or public rejection. But it remained for Lincoln, in his famous Lyceum address in 1838, to make the dangers of this all-consuming love of celebrity and fame most clear: While America remained an experiment in self-government, “all that sought celebrity and fame, and distinction, expected to find them in the success of that experiment.” But the experiment in liberal self-government has succeeded, and new “men of ambition” will “naturally seek the gratification of their ruling passion, as others have so done before them.”

But can that gratification be found in supporting and maintaining an edifice that has been erected by others? Hardly. “Towering genius”—or, just as bad, he who sees himself as such a genius—“disdains a beaten path.” An American Caesar would see scant distinction in adding increments to our greatness; he would scorn, in Lincoln’s words, “to tread in the footsteps of any predecessor.” With Trump’s re-election chances dwindling, and with little to satisfy his thirst for fame by any gracious departure, the surest path to world-historical distinction would now be, as Lincoln warned, to “set boldly to the task of pulling down.”

With other avenues of greater fame becoming closed off to him, to undermine and perhaps destroy the confidence of Americans in the worth or even the possibility of self-government would be the last, most incredible thing Trump could do. To proclaim that the election is already rigged against him and thus he needn’t respect a fraudulent result; to declare that whole categories of voting, whether early or by mail or absentee, are subject to massive manipulation and have already made the election fixed; to declare that the media are his enemies and the enemies of the people (and have his attorney general mouth the same slander) and that their reporting should be disbelieved; to continually divide the American people and then hint at civil war; to encourage his armed militias and his “Second Amendment people” to stand by and be prepared—these and so many more offenses to democratic government suggest that we may not be in for an easy or rational transfer of power but perhaps the most massive attack on American self-government that we will have experienced since the Civil War.

While it’s possible that the next few months will be merely bumpy but manageable, it seems far more likely that it will take everything in the arsenal of democratic government—political maneuvers, legal battles, protests, demonstrations, public anger, and steadfastness—before we see the end of this.

And all because of an arrogant would-be tyrant and an overweening pride and a twisted love of fame.",1,https://thebulwark.com/the-fruits-of-trumps-arrogant-pride-and-twisted-love-of-fame/

9,Bush,George W.,theimaginativeconservative,"On September 11, 2001, the American way of life was attacked. Today, on the anniversary of the tragic event, let us recall the address of President George W. Bush in order to remember the innocent men and women who lost their lives. Let us remember the values that bind us together as a people, the same values for which those innocent Americans were killed. May God bless America.

Good evening.

Today, our fellow citizens, our way of life, our very freedom came under attack in a series of deliberate and deadly terrorist acts. The victims were in airplanes or in their offices: secretaries, business men and women, military and federal workers, moms and dads, friends and neighbors. Thousands of lives were suddenly ended by evil, despicable acts of terror. The pictures of airplanes flying into buildings, fires burning, huge—huge structures collapsing have filled us with disbelief, terrible sadness, and a quiet, unyielding anger. These acts of mass murder were intended to frighten our nation into chaos and retreat. But they have failed. Our country is strong.

A great people has been moved to defend a great nation. Terrorist attacks can shake the foundations of our biggest buildings, but they cannot touch the foundation of America. These acts shatter steel, but they cannot dent the steel of American resolve. America was targeted for attack because we’re the brightest beacon for freedom and opportunity in the world. And no one will keep that light from shining. Today, our nation saw evil—the very worst of human nature—and we responded with the best of America. With the daring of our rescue workers, with the caring for strangers and neighbors who came to give blood and help in any way they could.

Immediately following the first attack, I implemented our government’s emergency response plans. Our military is powerful, and it’s prepared. Our emergency teams are working in New York City and Washington D.C. to help with local rescue efforts. Our first priority is to get help to those who have been injured and to take every precaution to protect our citizens at home and around the world from further attacks. The functions of our government continue without interruption. Federal agencies in Washington, which had to be evacuated today, are reopening for essential personnel tonight and will be open for business tomorrow. Our financial institutions remain strong and the American economy will be open for business as well.

The search is underway for those who were behind these evil acts. I have directed the full resources of our intelligence and law enforcement communities to find those responsible and to bring them to justice. We will make no distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbor them.

I appreciate so very much the members of Congress who have joined me in strongly condemning these attacks. And, on behalf of the American people, I thank the many world leaders who have called to offer their condolences and assistance. America and our friends and allies join with all those who want peace and security in the world, and we stand together to win the war against terrorism.

Tonight, I ask for your prayers for all those who grieve, for the children whose worlds have been shattered, for all whose sense of safety and security has been threatened. And I pray they will be comforted by a Power greater than any of us, spoken through the ages in Psalm 23:

Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil for you are with me.

This is a day when all Americans from every walk of life unite in our resolve for justice and peace. America has stood down enemies before, and we will do so this time. None of us will ever forget this day; yet, we go forward to defend freedom and all that is good and just in our world.

Thank you. Good night. And God bless America.

11,Bush,George W.,houstonchronicle,"Following Hurricane Harvey, about 30,000 Texas residents fled their homes to seek safety in emergency shelters with potentially hundreds of thousands evacuating to stay with family and friends. Approximately 10,000 sheltered in the George R. Brown Convention Center in downtown Houston. Today, this situation would create another problem - the threat of “super spreading” COVID-19.

Experts are predicting an above-normal hurricane season with 13 to 19 named storms and three to six major hurricanes of Category 3 or greater with wind speeds of more than 100 miles per hour. These storms not only bring wind and flood damage, they can displace hundreds of thousands of coastal and inland residents.

When a large-scale natural disaster strikes, the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) first provides Transitional Sheltering Assistance (TSA), which moves displaced residents from emergency shelters into temporary, non-congregate locations such as hotels. Following TSA, FEMA’s standard post-disaster short-term housing program is the temporary placement of travel trailers and manufactured housing units, or MHUs.

The problem with trailers and MHUs is that they are expensive and difficult to place with burdensome regulation. MHUs can cost taxpayers up to $250,000 to haul, install and deactivate, and are considerably less resilient to disaster than many alternative housing options created since the Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act was passed in 1988. Additionally, it does not provide a long-term solution - only temporary housing. If a hurricane survivor cannot repair or rebuild their home on their own, they are back to being homeless once the FEMA mission is over in about 18 months.

Following Hurricane Harvey, the Texas General Land Office (GLO) was tapped by Governor Greg Abbott to be the first to partner with FEMA on the short-term housing mission to expedite getting resources to those who needed them in Texas’ coastal communities. I negotiated for multiple programs to be provided, including providing limited repairs allowing survivors to remain at home while rebuilding their lives. One of these programs, Partial Repair and Essential Power for Sheltering, or PREPS, provided efficient temporary repairs to homes that sustained less than $17,000 in FEMA verified loss — the damage threshold to qualify for most FEMA-funded housing assistance programs. While not a comprehensive repair program, the goal was to make the home safe, sanitary and functional, thus enabling survivors live in their homes and community and avoid prolonged reliance on temporary sheltering assistance such as group shelters and hotels.

FEMA received nearly a million applications for housing and financial assistance from those affected by Hurricane Harvey. Between the efforts of the GLO and FEMA, more than 3,500 families were placed in trailers and MHUs. However, 15,666 families were able to move back into their homes thanks to the PREPS program administered by the GLO with FEMA funding. PREPS helped more than four times as many families with a much greater long-term return on investment.

To celebrate completing our 15,000 PREPS house, my team and I visited the Montez family in South Houston. Several families also helped by the program joined us to share their experiences with PREPS and how it helped them live at home while working to fully rebuild. Many said the PREPS program made a huge difference in helping them rebuild and stay in their communities.

PREPS allowed thousands of Texas families to live at home, while avoiding congregant sheltering or living in close quarters with family or friends. This program could easily be retooled to remove bureaucratic hurdles that slowed its implementation and be quickly deployed to more families in need of assistance to provide a level of repairs necessary to restore basic functionality to homes.

Partial repair programs can make a huge difference in the long-term rebuilding of homes damaged by hurricanes. When homes are damaged beyond repair, innovative housing solutions could be used to quickly build a safe and sanitary home meeting the needs of displaced families. At a time when having a home means staying safe, it is important to think outside the box.

FEMA’s recent decision to discontinue a partial home repair program is not advisable, especially considering the current COVID-19 pandemic we are in this hurricane season. We need more options - not less.

I encourage our federal partners to reexamine disaster aid programs and adapt to the current landscape based on best practices and experience. The COVID-19 pandemic poses an unprecedented challenge for temporary sheltering following a disaster, and governments charged with facilitating sheltering should have every available tool at their disposal to provide safe, sanitary and functional housing. Retooling a more affordable and viable partial repair program provides additional flexibility to respond to a major disaster while simultaneously minimizing the spread of a highly transmittable virus. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we must change how we look at post-disaster sheltering and provide more options that allow survivors to return home as quickly as possible.

Part One chronicles Bush’s unorthodox road to the White House. The once wild son of a political dynasty, few expected Bush to ascend to the presidency. Yet 36 days after the November 2000 election, Bush emerged the victor of the most hotly contested race in the nation's history. Little in the new president’s past could have prepared him for the events that unfolded on September 11, 2001. Thrust into the role of war president, Bush's response to the deadly terrorist attack would come to define a new era in American foreign policy.

Part Two opens with the ensuing war in Iraq and continues through Bush’s second term, as the president confronts the devastating impact of Hurricane Katrina and the most serious financial crisis since the Great Depression.",1,https://www.wlrn.org/post/george-w-bush-born-political-dynasty-tested-political-reality

Stay tuned in to our local news coverage: Listen to 90.7 WMFE on your FM or HD radio, the WMFE mobile app or your smart speaker — say “Alexa, play NPR” and you’ll be connected.



A group of former George W. Bush administration officials has pledged to “engage and mobilize disenchanted GOP voters” through a new super PAC formed to elect Joe Biden to the White House.

The group — 43 Alumni for Biden, a reference to Bush, the 43rd president — described its formation as an effort to restore “the principles of unity, tolerance and compassion to the greatest elected office in the world.”

“For four years, we have watched with grave concern as the party we loved has morphed into a cult of personality that little resembles the party of Lincoln and Reagan,” said Karen Kirksey, the group’s director.

“We endorse Joe Biden not necessarily in full support of his political agenda but rather in full agreement with the urgent need to restore the soul of this nation. Once elected, we look forward to working in a bipartisan way through civil, spirited debate on the many important issues facing Americans today and for decades to come.”

The group, consisting of hundreds of former Bush officials, is the latest effort by establishment Republicans to reject the leadership of President Trump, who sailed to the presidency in the 2016 election on a blistering, divisive campaign centered on nationalism and a rejection of the politically correct.

The Nov. 3 faceoff between Trump and Biden will be a referendum on both the policies and the posture that Trump has brought to American politics over the last several years. Issues including the faltering U.S. economy, the coronavirus pandemic and the administration’s response to it, as well as climate change, are all expected to play heavily into voters’ considerations.

15,Bush,George W.,dallasnews,"Editor's note: The following is an excerpt of George H.W. Bush's speech before a joint session of Congress on Sept. 11, 1990, in which he describes his vision of a new world order amid the Persian Gulf crisis. Read the full speech here.

We stand today at a unique and extraordinary moment. The crisis in the Persian Gulf, as grave as it is, also offers a rare opportunity to move toward an historic period of cooperation. Out of these troubled times, our fifth objective — a new world order — can emerge: a new era — freer from the threat of terror, stronger in the pursuit of justice, and more secure in the quest for peace. An era in which the nations of the world, East and West, North and South, can prosper and live in harmony.

A hundred generations have searched for this elusive path to peace, while a thousand wars raged across the span of human endeavor. Today that new world is struggling to be born, a world quite different from the one we've known. A world where the rule of law supplants the rule of the jungle. A world in which nations recognize the shared responsibility for freedom and justice. A world where the strong respect the rights of the weak. This is the vision that I shared with President Gorbachev in Helsinki. He and other leaders from Europe, the Gulf, and around the world understand that how we manage this crisis today could shape the future for generations to come.

The test we face is great, and so are the stakes. This is the first assault on the new world that we seek, the first test of our mettle. Had we not responded to this first provocation with clarity of purpose, if we do not continue to demonstrate our determination, it would be a signal to actual and potential despots around the world. America and the world must defend common vital interests — and we will. America and the world must support the rule of law — and we will. America and the world must stand up to aggression — and we will. And one thing more: In the pursuit of these goals, America will not be intimidated.

Vital issues of principle are at stake. Saddam Hussein is literally trying to wipe a country off the face of the Earth. We do not exaggerate. Nor do we exaggerate when we say Saddam Hussein will fail. Vital economic interests are at risk as well. Iraq itself controls some 10 percent of the world's proven oil reserves. Iraq plus Kuwait controls twice that. An Iraq permitted to swallow Kuwait would have the economic and military power, as well as the arrogance, to intimidate and coerce its neighbors — neighbors who control the lion's share of the world's remaining oil reserves. We cannot permit a resource so vital to be dominated by one so ruthless. And we won't.

Recent events have surely proven that there is no substitute for American leadership. In the face of tyranny, let no one doubt American credibility and reliability. Let no one doubt our staying power. We will stand by our friends. One way or another, the leader of Iraq must learn this fundamental truth. From the outset, acting hand in hand with others, we've sought to fashion the broadest possible international response to Iraq's aggression. The level of world cooperation and condemnation of Iraq is unprecedented. Armed forces from countries spanning four continents are there at the request of King Fahd of Saudi Arabia to deter and, if need be, to defend against attack. Moslems and non-Moslems, Arabs and non-Arabs, soldiers from many nations stand shoulder to shoulder, resolute against Saddam Hussein's ambitions. ...

I cannot predict just how long it will take to convince Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait. Sanctions will take time to have their full intended effect. We will continue to review all options with our allies, but let it be clear: We will not let this aggression stand.

18,Bush,George W.,adn,"Laura and I are anguished by the brutal suffocation of George Floyd and disturbed by the injustice and fear that suffocate our country. Yet we have resisted the urge to speak out, because this is not the time for us to lecture. It is time for us to listen. It is time for America to examine our tragic failures – and as we do, we will also see some of our redeeming strengths.

It remains a shocking failure that many African Americans, especially young African American men, are harassed and threatened in their own country. It is a strength when protesters, protected by responsible law enforcement, march for a better future. This tragedy — in a long series of similar tragedies — raises a long overdue question: How do we end systemic racism in our society? The only way to see ourselves in a true light is to listen to the voices of so many who are hurting and grieving. Those who set out to silence those voices do not understand the meaning of America — or how it becomes a better place.

America’s greatest challenge has long been to unite people of very different backgrounds into a single nation of justice and opportunity. The doctrine and habits of racial superiority, which once nearly split our country, still threaten our Union. The answers to American problems are found by living up to American ideals — to the fundamental truth that all human beings are created equal and endowed by God with certain rights. We have often underestimated how radical that quest really is, and how our cherished principles challenge systems of intended or assumed injustice. The heroes of America — from Frederick Douglass, to Harriet Tubman, to Abraham Lincoln, to Martin Luther King, Jr. — are heroes of unity. Their calling has never been for the fainthearted. They often revealed the nation’s disturbing bigotry and exploitation — stains on our character sometimes difficult for the American majority to examine. We can only see the reality of America’s need by seeing it through the eyes of the threatened, oppressed, and disenfranchised.

That is exactly where we now stand. Many doubt the justice of our country, and with good reason. Black people see the repeated violation of their rights without an urgent and adequate response from American institutions. We know that lasting justice will only come by peaceful means. Looting is not liberation, and destruction is not progress. But we also know that lasting peace in our communities requires truly equal justice. The rule of law ultimately depends on the fairness and legitimacy of the legal system. And achieving justice for all is the duty of all.

This will require a consistent, courageous, and creative effort. We serve our neighbors best when we try to understand their experience. We love our neighbors as ourselves when we treat them as equals, in both protection and compassion. There is a better way — the way of empathy, and shared commitment, and bold action, and a peace rooted in justice. I am confident that together, Americans will choose the better way.

Image Credit: NYT

Washington: Fourteen years ago, two federal government doctors, Richard Hatchett and Carter Mecher, met with a colleague at a burger joint in suburban Washington for a final review of a proposal they knew would be treated like a pinata: telling Americans to stay home from work and school the next time the country was hit by a deadly pandemic.

When they presented their plan not long after, it was met with scepticism and a degree of ridicule by senior officials who, like others in the United States, had grown accustomed to relying on the pharmaceutical industry, with its ever-growing array of new treatments, to confront evolving health challenges.

Hatchett and Mecher were proposing instead that Americans in some places might have to turn back to an approach, self-isolation, first widely employed in the Middle Ages.

How that idea - born out of a request by President George W. Bush to ensure the nation was better prepared for the next contagious disease outbreak - became the heart of the national playbook for responding to a pandemic is one of the untold stories of the coronavirus crisis.

Initial opposition

It required the key proponents - Mecher, a Department of Veterans Affairs physician, and Hatchett, an oncologist turned White House adviser - to overcome intense initial opposition.

It brought their work together with that of a Defense Department team assigned to a similar task.

And it had some unexpected detours, including a deep dive into the history of the 1918 Spanish flu and an important discovery kicked off by a high school research project pursued by the daughter of a scientist at the Sandia National Laboratories.

The concept of social distancing is now intimately familiar to almost everyone. But as it first made its way through the federal bureaucracy in 2006 and 2007, it was viewed as impractical, unnecessary and politically infeasible.

“There were two words between ‘shut’ and ‘up’” initially, said Dr Howard Markel, who directs the University of Michigan’s Center for the History of Medicine and who played a role in shaping the policy as a member of the Pentagon research team. “It was really ugly.”

A pandemic is a lot like a forest fire. If caught early it might be extinguished with limited damage. If allowed to smoulder, undetected, it can grow to an inferno that can spread quickly beyond our ability to control it. - George W. Bush, former US President

Mecher was there when Hatchett presented government public health experts with the plan that the two of them and Dr Lisa Koonin of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had reviewed.

“People could not believe that the strategy would be effective or even feasible,” Mecher recalled.

But within the Bush administration, they were encouraged to keep at it and follow the science. And ultimately, their arguments proved persuasive.

Official policy

In February 2007, the CDC made their approach - bureaucratically called nonpharmaceutical interventions, or NPIs - official US policy.

Following a five-year review by the Obama administration, the strategy was updated in a document published in 2017. And after long delays in which President Donald Trump played down the threat from COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, and failed to heed warnings about it from inside his own government, it was used to encourage the states to lock down as confirmed cases and deaths shot up.

Effort began with concern by Bush

The effort began in the summer of 2005 when Bush, already concerned with bioterrorism after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, read a forthcoming book, “The Great Influenza,” by John Barry, about the Spanish flu outbreak of 1918.

Bush’s concern was elevated by a string of new outbreaks caused by infectious diseases transferring from birds and other animals to humans, including a bird flu outbreak that year in Vietnam. Because there was no vaccine for these new threats, they could spread rapidly.

“A pandemic is a lot like a forest fire,” Bush said in a speech at the National Institutes of Health. “If caught early it might be extinguished with limited damage. If allowed to smoulder, undetected, it can grow to an inferno that can spread quickly beyond our ability to control it.”

To develop ideas, the Bush administration enlisted Hatchett, who had served as a White House biodefense policy adviser, and Mecher, who was a Veterans Affairs medical officer in Georgia overseeing care in the Southeast.

An experiment with schools

Given the increased danger from new strains of influenza and the reality that existing antiviral drugs like Tamiflu did not work against all contagious diseases, Hatchett, Mecher and their team began exploring other ways to combat a large-scale contagion.

It was about that time that Mecher heard from Robert Glass, a senior scientist at Sandia in New Mexico who specialised in building advanced models to explain how complex systems work - and what can cause catastrophic failures.

Glass’ daughter Laura, then 14, had done a class project in which she built a model of social networks at her Albuquerque high school, and when Glass looked at it, he was intrigued.

Students are so closely tied together - in social networks, on school buses and in classrooms - that they were a near-perfect vehicle for a contagious disease to spread.

Image Credit: NYT

Glass piggybacked on his daughter’s work to explore with her what effect breaking up these networks would have on knocking down the disease.

The outcome of their research was startling. By closing the schools in a hypothetical town of 10,000 people, only 500 people got sick. If they remained open, half of the population would be infected.

“My God, we could use the same results she has and work from there,” Glass recalled thinking. He took their preliminary data and built on it by running it through the supercomputers at Sandia, more typically used to engineer nuclear weapons. (His daughter’s project was entered in the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair in 2006.)

Mecher received the results at his office in Washington and was amazed.

If cities closed their public schools, the data suggested, the spread of a disease would be significantly slowed, making this move perhaps the most important of all the social distancing options they were considering.

Role of timing in reducing deaths

Markel had published a book, “When Germs Travel,” in 2004 that examined six major epidemics since 1900 and how they had travelled across the United States. He decided to work with Dr Martin Cetron, director of the CDC’s quarantine division, to look more closely at the lessons of the Spanish flu of 1918.

The research started with St. Louis, which had moved relatively quickly to head off the spread of the flu, and Philadelphia, which waited much longer and suffered far more.

Officials in Philadelphia did not want to let the flu disrupt daily life, so they went ahead in September 1918 with a long-planned parade that drew hundreds of thousands of spectators to promote war bonds.

In St. Louis, by contrast, the city health commissioner quickly moved to close schools, churches, theatres, saloons, sporting events and other public gathering spots.

Markel and his team set out to confirm just how important a role timing had played in reducing deaths. They gathered census records and thousands of other documents detailing the date of the first infection, the first death, the first social distancing policies and how long they were left in place in 43 US cities.

Separately, Mecher and his team looked at the experience of 17 cities, using newspaper clips and other sources.

Both teams came to the same conclusion and published papers on their findings within months of each other in 2007. Early, aggressive action to limit social interaction using multiple measures like closing schools or shutting down public gatherings was vital to limiting the death toll, they found.

“It’s like treating heart-attack patients,” Mecher said. “Timing matters.”

Expectation for available fix

After decades of advances by the nation’s pharmaceutical companies - finding treatments or vaccines for major illnesses, including HIV and smallpox - Americans by the early 21st century had a built-in expectation that no matter what the ailment, there must be some kind of available fix. Locking your family inside your home seemed backward, and encouraging people not to go to work economically disastrous.

The idea of forcibly limiting public assembly or movement had also long been seen as legally and ethically questionable.

So the considerable scepticism among local officials, public health experts and policymakers in Washington was not surprising.

One particularly vociferous critic was Dr D.A. Henderson, who had been the leader of the international effort to eradicate smallpox and had been named by Bush to help oversee the nation’s biodefense efforts after the 2001 terrorist attacks.

Henderson was convinced that it made no sense to force schools to close or public gatherings to stop. Teenagers would escape their homes to hang out at the mall. School lunch programmes would close, and impoverished children would not have enough to eat. Hospital staff would have a hard time going to work if their children were at home.

The measures embraced by Mecher and Hatchett would “result in significant disruption of the social functioning of communities and result in possibly serious economic problems,” Henderson wrote in his own academic paper responding to their ideas. The answer, he insisted, was to tough it out: Let the pandemic spread, treat people who get sick and work quickly to develop a vaccine to prevent it from coming back.

Plan put to work

Caught in the middle, CDC leaders decided to conduct more research and survey community leaders around the country.

The administration ultimately sided with the proponents of social distancing and shutdowns - though their victory was little noticed outside of public health circles. Their policy would become the basis for government planning and would be used extensively in simulations used to prepare for pandemics and in a limited way in 2009 during an outbreak of the influenza called H1N1.

Then the coronavirus came and the plan was put to work across the country for the first time.

Mecher was a key voice on the “Red Dawn” email chain of public health experts in raising early warnings this year about the coronavirus outbreak and Trump’s reluctance to embrace shutdowns and social distancing. The shutdown this year is much bigger than Mecher and others imagined would be necessary or practical. Testing has been limited, and some states issued social distancing orders even before confirming the coronavirus was spreading within their borders.

Markel called it “very gratifying to see our work used to help save lives.” But, he added, “it is also horrifying.”",1,https://gulfnews.com/world/americas/covid-19-the-untold-story-of-the-birth-of-social-distancing-1.71130153
28,Bush,George W.,en,"As you watch the developments in Baghdad, it's important to understand that we will not be able to prevent every al Qaeda attack. When a terrorist is willing to kill himself to kill others, it's really hard to stop him. Yet, over time, the security operation in Baghdad is designed to shrink the areas where al Qaeda can operate, it's designed to bring out more intelligence about their presence, and designed to allow American and Iraqi forces to dismantle their network.

We have a strategy to deal with al Qaeda in Iraq. But any time you say to a bunch of cold-blooded killers, success depends on no violence, all that does is hand them the opportunity to be successful. And it's hard. I know it's hard for the American people to turn on their TV screens and see the horrific violence. It speaks volumes about the American desire to protect lives of innocent people, America's deep concern about human rights and human dignity. It also speaks volumes about al Qaeda, that they're willing to take innocent life to achieve political objectives.

The terrorists will continue to fight back. In other words, they understand what they're doing. And casualties are likely to stay high. Yet, day by day, block by block, we are steadfast in helping Iraqi leaders counter the terrorists, protect their people, and reclaim the capital. And if I didn't think it was necessary for the security of the country, I wouldn't put our kids in harm's way.

...Either we'll succeed, or we won't succeed. And the definition of success as I described is sectarian violence down. Success is not, no violence. There are parts of our own country that have got a certain level of violence to it. But success is a level of violence where the people feel comfortable about living their daily lives. And that's what we're trying to achieve.",1,https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/George_W._Bush
29,Bush,George W.,glasstire,"The Houston Public Library will host Portraits of Courage: A Commander in Chief’s Tribute to America’s Warriors, a collection of painted portraits of military veterans by former president George W. Bush. Some of the veterans will be present to autograph copies of the Portraits of Courage book at the show’s opening reception, February 27, 6-8 PM (more on that below).

Glasstire contributor Rich Lopez reviewed the exhibition when it was on view at the Museum of the Southwest in Bush’s hometown of Midland, Texas in 2018. Lopez writes:“Portraits of Courage presents an odd viewer experience. Bush sets out to honor these men and women, and he does. Each painting feels like a love letter to their service. And he captures distinct moments in some of their faces. But at the same time, it’s difficult to come away from the show with a deeper sense of who any of them are.”

Was this a common critique? The Portraits of Courage book includes each veteran’s story alongside their portrait, and the press release for the exhibition states that viewers will learn “the stories of each of the warriors featured in the exhibit, glean an appreciation for the service and sacrifice of those who serve in the United States military, [and] understand the impacts of the wounds of war — both visible and invisible.”

Again: Military veterans will be present to autograph copies of the Portraits of Courage book at the show’s opening reception, February 27, 6-8 PM. Refreshments will be served, and musicians from UH’s Moores School of Music will deliver a performance. The exhibition is free and open to the public, and will run from February 21-April 25.

30,Bush,George W.,dallasnews,"As our state begins a new year, we face a familiar challenge: How do we better prepare the next generation of Texas leaders?

As a former public school teacher, I think the answer to that question is found in our schools. The workers of tomorrow are being trained in the classrooms of today. So, are the leaders of tomorrow adequately prepared in our classrooms?

The Texas General Land Office is one of the largest financiers of public education in the state. As land commissioner and a former educator, I felt it was important to get an inside look at what our students are doing in the classroom, lend a helping hand, and speak with administrators and teachers. Too often, we strive to enhance education without understanding exactly where the need resides.

This past year, I decided to personally invest my time and energy in Texas students and schools. During the Texas General Land Office’s Year of Education, I visited with more than 80 administrators, 60 teachers and almost 4,000 students from across the state. I didn’t limit these visits to one region or one type of school. Rather, I visited educational environments of all types: public, private, charter, home-school, rural, urban and suburban.

For most of these lessons, I taught a class on Texas history featuring primary source material from the GLO archives, like a historic map of Texas. But what I found to be most rewarding were the moments not when I was talking, but when I was listening. And after hearing from so many administrators, teachers and students, some of the next steps our state needs to take in improving Texas education became clear.

Better education means a stronger emphasis on a flexible curriculum. We need to give schools and teachers the ability to find the sources and methods that work best for their kids. One size certainly does not fit all.

Better education means teaching critical thinking. With the age of artificial intelligence upon us, we need to ensure that our students are learning to think and ask the right questions. This requires a stronger emphasis on writing, reading and projects that require students to think hard and get to the bottom of tough questions.

Better education means a greater emphasis on vocational education. Not every child needs to go to college. The Texas economy of the future will undoubtedly require scientists and engineers, but it will also require carpenters, plumbers and electricians — jobs that require not college but training and that pay well, too.

Better education means more school choice. When we give parents a choice, we give kids a chance. Children should not be stuck in schools that don’t perform and won’t change. A ZIP code should not determine a child’s success in life.

But better education means focusing on models that work, like Dallas ISD. Schools that are implementing this model are quickly turning around, improving their ratings across the board. Thought leaders should seek to further explore models such as this, and act quickly to enact changes to improve failing school districts.

And better education means doing more to teach the history of our great state. The leaders of Texas’ future must know the story of Texas’ past. When I visited classrooms last year, I took actual primary source material from our archives to teach the heroism of the Alamo defenders, including a cannonball fired at the Battle of the Alamo. It’s one thing to read a textbook; it’s another thing to hold a piece of Texas history in your hands. I saw the light in the eyes of so many young Texans as they learned about the Alamo by experiencing it.

This year at the General Land Office, we will continue to build on the Year of Education and continue distributing more money than ever before to public education. I call on our legislative leaders to enact common-sense, conservative reforms to make our schools better.

Far too often, decision-makers in Austin sit back and decide our children’s future without understanding the challenges faced by teachers and administrators each and every day. As a former teacher, I know that these heroes deserve our support. And I’ll continue to look for ways to help them succeed in the classroom. That’s what the Year of Education was all about — understanding what our future needs.

As Texas looks to the future, we must focus on improving and dedicating additional resources to education. That is an investment we can make today that will pay dividends for years to come.

This will not stand, this aggression against Kuwait. Remarks to reporters (5 August 1990)



Clearly, no longer can a dictator count on East-West confrontation to stymie concerted United Nations action against aggression. A new partnership of nations has begun. And we stand today at a unique and extraordinary moment. The crisis in the Persian Gulf, as grave as it is, also offers a rare opportunity to move toward an historic period of cooperation. Out of these troubled times, our fifth objective — a new world order — can emerge: a new era, freer from the threat of terror, stronger in the pursuit of justice, and more secure in the quest for peace. An era in which the nations of the world, east and west, north and south, can prosper and live in harmony.

This is an historic moment. We have in this past year made great progress in ending the long era of conflict and cold war.

When we are successful, and we will be, we have a real chance at this new world order, an order in which a credible United Nations can use its peacekeeping role to fulfill the promise and vision of the U.N.'s founders.

Trying to eliminate Saddam, extending the ground war into an occupation of Iraq, would have violated our guideline about not changing objectives in midstream, engaging in ""mission creep"", and would have incurred incalculable human and political costs. Apprehending him was probably impossible. We had been unable to find Noriega in Panama, which we knew intimately. We would have been forced to occupy Baghdad and, in effect, rule Iraq. The coalition would instantly have collapsed, the Arabs deserting it in anger and other allies pulling out as well. Under those circumstances, furthermore, we had been self-consciously trying to set a pattern for handling aggression in the post-cold war world. Going in and occupying Iraq, thus unilaterally exceeding the U.N.'s mandate, would have destroyed the precedent of international response to aggression we hoped to establish. Had we gone the invasion route, the U.S. could conceivably still be an occupying power in a bitterly hostile land. It would have been a dramatically different — and perhaps barren — outcome. A World Transformed (1998) by George H.W. Bush and Brent Scowcroft; also as an excerpt in Time Magazine in 1998.



Whose life would be on my hands as the commander-in-chief because I, unilaterally, went beyond the international law, went beyond the stated mission, and said we're going to show our macho? We're going into Baghdad. We're going to be an occupying power — America in an Arab land — with no allies at our side. It would have been disastrous. We don't gain the size of our victory by how many innocent kids running away — even though they're bad guys — that we can slaughter. … We're American soldiers; we don't do business that way.

RNC acceptance speech (1988) [ edit ]

We're a nation of community, of thousands and tens of thousands of ethnic, religious, social, business, labor union, neighborhood, regional and other organizations, all of them varied, voluntary and unique.

This is America: the Knights of Columbus, the Grange, Hadassah, the Disabled American Veterans, the Order of Ahepa, the Business and Professional Women of America, the union hall, the Bible study group, LULAC, ""Holy Name"" — a brilliant diversity spread like stars, like a thousand points of light in a broad and peaceful sky.

Does government have a place? Yes. Government is part of the nation of communities, not the whole, just a part.

And I don't hate government. A government that remembers that the people are its master is a good and needed thing.

And I respect old-fashioned common sense and have no great love for the imaginings of the social planners.

I'm the one who will not raise taxes. My opponent now says he'll raise them as a last resort, or a third resort. But when a politician talks like that, you know that's one resort he'll be checking into. My opponent, my opponent won't rule out raising taxes. But I will. And The Congress will push me to raise taxes and I'll say no. And they'll push, and I'll say no, and they'll push again, and I'll say, to them, ""Read my lips: no new taxes.""

I intend to speak for freedom, stand for freedom and be a patient friend to anyone, East or West, who will fight for freedom.

It seems to me the presidency provides an incomparable opportunity for ""gentle persuasion.""

I hope to stand for a new harmony, a greater tolerance. We've come far, but I think we need a new harmony among the races in our country. And we're on a journey into a new century, and we've got to leave that tired old baggage of bigotry behind.

Some people who are enjoying our prosperity have forgotten what it's for. But they diminish our triumph when they act as if wealth is an end in itself.

And there are those who have dropped their standards along the way, as if ethics were too heavy and slowed their rise to the top.

The fact is: Prosperity has a purpose. It's to allow us to pursue ""the better angels,"" to give us time to think and grow. Prosperity with a purpose means taking your idealism and making it concrete by certain acts of goodness. It means helping a child from an unhappy home learn how to read, and I thank my wife, Barbara, for all her work in helping people to read, in all her work for literacy in this country. It means teaching troubled children through your presence that there is such a thing as reliable love. Some would say it's soft and insufficiently tough to care about these things. But where is it written that we must act if we do not care, as if we are not moved?

Well, I am moved. I want a kinder and gentler nation.

Inaugural Address (1989) [ edit ]

America is never wholly herself unless she is engaged in high moral principle . We as a people have such a purpose today. It is to make kinder the face of the Nation and gentler the face of the world

A President is neither prince nor pope, and I don't seek a window on men's souls . In fact, I yearn for a greater tolerance , an easy-goingness about each other's attitudes and way of life

Washington, D. C. (20 January 1989) Full text online at Yale University

I have just repeated word for word the oath taken by George Washington 200 years ago, and the Bible on which I placed my hand is the Bible on which he placed his. It is right that the memory of Washington be with us today, not only because this is our Bicentennial Inauguration, but because Washington remains the Father of our Country. And he would, I think, be gladdened by this day; for today is the concrete expression of a stunning fact: our continuity these 200 years since our government began.

We meet on democracy's front porch, a good place to talk as neighbors and as friends. For this is a day when our nation is made whole, when our differences, for a moment, are suspended.

I come before you and assume the Presidency at a moment rich with promise. We live in a peaceful, prosperous time, but we can make it better. For a new breeze is blowing, and a world refreshed by freedom seems reborn; for in man's heart, if not in fact, the day of the dictator is over. The totalitarian era is passing, its old ideas blown away like leaves from an ancient, lifeless tree. A new breeze is blowing, and a nation refreshed by freedom stands ready to push on. There is new ground to be broken, and new action to be taken. There are times when the future seems thick as a fog; you sit and wait, hoping the mists will lift and reveal the right path. But this is a time when the future seems a door you can walk right through into a room called tomorrow.

Great nations of the world are moving toward democracy through the door to freedom. Men and women of the world move toward free markets through the door to prosperity. The people of the world agitate for free expression and free thought through the door to the moral and intellectual satisfactions that only liberty allows.

We know what works: Freedom works. We know what's right: Freedom is right. We know how to secure a more just and prosperous life for man on Earth: through free markets, free speech, free elections, and the exercise of free will unhampered by the state.

We must act on what we know. I take as my guide the hope of a saint: In crucial things, unity; in important things, diversity; in all things, generosity.

There is but one just use of power, and it is to serve people. Help us to remember it, Lord.

'America is never wholly herself unless she is engaged in high moral principle. We as a people have such a purpose today. It is to make kinder the face of the Nation and gentler the face of the world.

The American people await action. They didn't send us here to bicker. They ask us to rise above the merely partisan. ""In crucial things, unity"" — and this, my friends, is crucial.

A President is neither prince nor pope, and I don't seek a window on men's souls. In fact, I yearn for a greater tolerance, an easy-goingness about each other's attitudes and way of life.

I do not mistrust the future; I do not fear what is ahead. For our problems are large, but our heart is larger. Our challenges are great, but our will is greater. And if our flaws are endless, God's love is truly boundless.

Some see leadership as high drama, and the sound of trumpets calling, and sometimes it is that. But I see history as a book with many pages, and each day we fill a page with acts of hopefulness and meaning. The new breeze blows, a page turns, the story unfolds. And so today a chapter begins, a small and stately story of unity, diversity, and generosity — shared, and written, together.

Address to the Senior Executive Service (1989) [ edit ]

There is no higher honor than to serve free men and women, no greater privilege than to labor in government beneath the Great Seal of the United States and the American flag.

There is nothing more fulfilling than to serve your country and your fellow citizens and to do it well. And that's what our system of self-government depends on.

To those who work outside Washington, I would send a special message. At times it may be frustrating when it seems that the head office is thousands of miles away and the message is not getting through. But if I may, I'm going to issue a verbal Executive order: We're going to listen, because the heart of our government is not here in Washington, it's in every county office, every town, every city across this land. Wherever the people of America are, that's where the heart of our government is.

The Government is here to serve, but it cannot replace individual service. And shouldn't all of us who are public servants also set an example of service as private citizens? So, I want to ask all of you, and all the appointees in this administration, to do what so many of you already do: to reach out and lend a hand. Ours should be a nation characterized by conspicuous compassion, generosity that is overflowing and abundant.

Presidential Economic Address, February 9, 1989 [ edit ]

And let all Americans remember that no problem of human making is too great to be overcome by human ingenuity, human energy, and the untiring hope of the human spirit. I believe this. I would not have asked to be your President if I didn't.

Since this is Flag City, let me close with a flag story. During the Gulf war, I received a letter from the Mayor of Stantonsburg, North Carolina. He told me about watching two little girls about 10 years old walking across the school yard. One day, they went across. He was watching, and they were pulling their mom's laundry on a wagon. As the girls passed the pole in front of the town hall, they looked up and saw the United States flag flapping in the wind. Unaware that anyone was watching, these two little girls stopped, placed their hands over their hearts, and pledged allegiance to the flag. One little girl said simply, ""It's important to do this, you know, because of the war and all."" Well, this election, like all elections, is about that little girl, and all the kids in Findlay, in Lima, and all the kids in America. If we do what is right today, we can take advantage of the opportunity of our global victory. We can build a land where they will be safe and strong and secure, where they can climb the flagpole of opportunity and put their hands over their hearts with pride, knowing that in their land the sun is always just peeking out over the horizon.

I'm just not very high on atheists. Attributed by atheist activist Robert I.

Initially reported soon after the incident, years afterward disputes on the accuracy of the reports arose. Other journalists present have neither confirmed nor contradicted Sherman's account of the exchange. Sherman cites official correspondence about the incident between Jon Garth Murra, President of American Atheists, and White House Counsel C.

Quotes about Bush [ edit ]

The sort of man who steps out of the shower to take a piss. Widely quoted remark of an anonymous Texan, published in The Right Nation : Conservative Power in America (2004) by John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge, p. 33; also published as a book excerpt in the The New York Times (28 November 2004)



In 1980 the Democrats were pretty much stuck with Jimmy Carter and Walter Mondale, who ran under the slogan ""Four More Years?"" The Republicans, meanwhile, had a spirited primary campaign season, which came down to a duel between Reagan and George Herbert Walker Norris Wainright Armoire Vestibule Pomegranate Bush IV, who had achieved a distinguished record of public service despite having a voice that sounded like he had just inhaled an entire blimp-load of helium. Dave Barry, Dave Barry Slept Here: A Sort of History of the United States (1989), p. 167



On Monday in Baltimore, many baseball fans may be tempted to utter a testy little boo when they see yet another politician who seems to be horning in on Opening Day. President George Bush is different. If his First Ball bounces, it was probably a curve. And if he's wearing a glove, it's his own. Thomas Boswell, ""A President's Passion for Baseball"", The Washington Post (March 31, 1989), p. B2



I just couldn't believe that any politician could look that comfortable out there. [...] It was obvious he had played before. You could just tell, the way he shifted his feet and changed position. He had one difficult fielding chance. He knocked the ball down and threw to the pitcher for the out. Jim Burris (Denver Bears GM), regarding the sitting Vice President's participation in an otherwise exclusively MLB-based Old-Timer's Game held at Mile High Stadium on Friday, July 13, 1984; as quoted in ""Sports People; Who's On First"" in The New York Times (July 15, 1984), p. C2



Poor George. He can’t help it. He was born with a silver foot in his mouth. Former Texas Governor Ann Richards, in a keynote address at the 1988 Democratic National Convention (18 July 1988)



During the parade, George H.W. Bush came over and talked with Carolyn and me at length, as proud a father as could be. It was not quite two years earlier that I'd had the pleasure of celebrating his seventy-fifth birthday with him in what was dubbed Operation Spring Colt, a parachute jump from twelve thousand feet with the parachuting team. What few people realize is that shortly after he jumped from the aircraft, the former President had trouble getting into position and began to tumble uncontrollably. It was only through the extraordinary aerial prowess of one of the Golden Knights, the Army's elite parachute team and a member of the U.S. Freefall Association that they were able to steady the guest of honor so that his parachute could properly deploy, and that happened only at the last possible moment. Once safely on the ground, the former President was aglow, joking with us on how much more pleasurable it was than the first time he'd jumped, which was over the Pacific after his bomber had been disabled by Japanese gunfire in World War II. Hugh Shelton, Without Hesitation: The Odyssey of an American Warrior (2010), p. 400



Before the game, they said the V.P. was going to pinch-hit, and he requested me to pitch to him. He even called me ""Spahnie"" this afternoon. Talk about a thrill. Warren Spahn, regarding Bush's participation in an MLB Old-Timers' Game held on Friday, July 13, 1984; as quoted in ""Morning Briefing: Bully Staying Home, So Briggs Talk Is Easy"" in The Los Angeles Times (July 15, 1984), p. C2



So the punchline for George Bush is this, you would have wanted him on your side. He never lost his sense of humor. Humor is a universal solvent against the abrasiveness of life. He never hated anyone — he knew what his mother and my mother always knew: hatred corrodes the container it’s carried in. Eulogy by Alan K. Simpson reported in Reynolds, Nick ( ). Former Wyoming Sen.

32,Bush,George W.,georgewbushbooks,"A deluxe, signed edition of President George W. Bush’s collection of oil paintings and stories honoring the sacrifice and courage of America’s military veterans. With Forewords by former First Lady Laura Bush and General Peter Pace, 16th Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Growing out of President Bush’s own outreach and the ongoing work of the George W. Bush Institute's Military Service Initiative, Portraits of Courage brings together sixty-six full-color portraits and a four-panel mural painted by President Bush of members of the United States military who have served our nation with honor since 9/11—and whom he has come to know personally. This deluxe, oversized edition of the book is signed by the President and cloth-bound with a specially designed slipcover.

Our men and women in uniform have faced down enemies, liberated millions, and in doing so showed the true compassion of our nation. Often, they return home with injuries—both visible and invisible—that intensify the challenges of transitioning into civilian life. In addition to these burdens, research shows a civilian-military divide. Seventy-one percent of Americans say they have little understanding of the issues facing veterans, and veterans agree: eighty-four percent say that the public has ""little awareness"" of the issues facing them and their families.

Each painting in this meticulously produced hardcover volume is accompanied by the inspiring story of the veteran depicted, written by the President. Readers can see the faces of those who answered the nation’s call and learn from their bravery on the battlefield, their journeys to recovery, and the continued leadership and contributions they are making as civilians. It is President Bush’s desire that these stories of courage and resilience will honor our men and women in uniform, highlight their family and caregivers who bear the burden of their sacrifice, and help Americans understand how we can support our veterans and empower them to succeed.

President Bush will donate his net author proceeds from PORTRAITS OF COURAGE to the George W. Bush Presidential Center, a non-profit organization whose Military Service Initiative works to ensure that post-9/11 veterans and their families make successful transitions to civilian life with a focus on gaining meaningful employment and overcoming the invisible wounds of war.",1,http://georgewbushbooks.com/books/portraits-of-courage-hc/portraits-of-courage-deluxe-signed-edition-hc
33,Bush,George W.,uncoverdc,"By Tracy Beanz

On Tuesday, the fifteen-page opening statement from William Taylor, who some are calling the Democrats “star witness” was leaked and reported by legacy media outlets. Ambassador William Taylor is thought to be a linchpin in the case by proponents of the impeachment inquiry, while Republicans are stating that he has no direct evidence of a quid pro quo with Ukrainian President Zelensky, and that his opening statement and testimony is rife with hearsay.

In the early pages of his remarks, William Taylor noted the following:

“I had served as Ambassador to Ukraine from 2006 to 2009, having been nominated

by George W. Bush, and, in the intervening 10 years, I have stayed engaged with

Ukraine, visiting frequently since 2013 as a board member of a small Ukrainian

non-governmental organization supporting good governance and reform.”

UncoverDC can report that although it has been scrubbed almost entirely from the web, William Taylor spent several years on the board of a Ukranian NGO called EEF, or the East Europe Foundation, that has a strong partnership with Open Cities Association. Open Cities Association is funded by “Open Governments Partnership” which accepts large amounts of funding from George Soros’ Open Society Foundation.

William Taylor also has strong connections to other dark power players, many of whom are embroiled in the spying scandal currently under investigation by Attorney General William Barr and US Attorney John Durham. Taylor was a senior advisor to the US- Ukraine Business Council (USUBC), where he often presented round table discussions about policy with David Kramer from the McCain Institute. Evidence has shown that David Kramer was responsible for laundering the Steele Dossier into the FBI on behalf of John McCain, as well as providing the dossier to Buzzfeed. Also a key player at the USUBC is the Atlantic Council, a Washington DC based organization funded in part by Victor Pinchuk, a Ukrainian billionaire who has donated to the Clinton Foundation. Crowdstrike co-founder and CTO Dmitri Alperovitch is also a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. Crowdstrike was responsible for the DNC servers, and claims that it was Russia that hacked the servers and provided the information to Wikileaks. Crowdstrike also held them privately for analysis rather than allow the FBI to forensically analyze them. In the now infamous call with the President Zelensky, President Trump asked him to look for the missing DNC servers suspecting they were in Ukraine.

In addition, the Atlantic Council worked closely with Victoria Nuland, the Obama Administration’s Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs. Nuland was embroiled in controversy after a conversation she had with the ambassador to Ukraine at the time, Geoffrey Pyatt, was leaked to YouTube. In the call, the pair are discussing who they wish to install in Ukrainian government. Nuland is also embroiled in controversy regarding 2016 election interference, admitting in testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence that she and the State Department had hosted Christopher Steele. Former State Department employees Jonathan Winer and Kathleen Kavalec are also under closer scrutiny.

Additionally, internet sleuths seem to have uncovered who the whistle blower is, as have some in Congress. Eric Ciaramella has been mentioned by Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) in questioning at a hearing on the fiscal control board that governs Puerto Rico’s debt because the Executive Director of that board used to be Ukraine’s finance minister. In photos discovered by Twitter user @CarrollQuigley1, Ciaramella is seen wearing a pin from the US-Ukraine Business Council; the same USUBC that hosted William Taylor as a Senior Advisor, David Kramer, and the Atlantic Council among others. Adding more credibility to the claim, threads on the topic are being retweeted by powerhouse Flynn attorney Sidney Powell.

35,Bush,George W.,althistory,"George Walker Bush (born 6 July 1946) is a Californian politician who served as the 24th Chancellor of California from 2004 until 2010. He is the eldest son of Barbara and George H. W. Bush. After graduating from the University of Los Angeles in 1968 and Harvard Business School in 1975, he worked in oil businesses. Bush married Laura Welch in 1977 and ran unsuccessfully for the Californian House of Representatives shortly thereafter. He later co-owned the Maricopa Lions football team before becoming successful in his second bid to become a parliamentarian, and entered the House of Representatives as the Member for Lubbock-Abilene in 1985. Bush was elected leader of the Liberal Party in 2003, and led them to victory in the November election against the Democratic-Progressive Coalition under incumbent Chancellor Al Gore. He went on to serve two terms as chancellor, winning re-election in 2006. He ran again in 2009, but was defeated by the Coalition under Barack Obama, who succeeded him as Chancellor the following year. Bush is the first chancellor to have been the son of a former chancellor.

37,Bush,George W.,routefifty,"Not long after the El Paso shootings occurred, I took to Twitter to denounce white-nationalist terrorism as a real threat to our country. I didn’t realize at the time that I was the first major Republican elected official to do so. But I certainly won’t be the last, as more details come out about the goals and views of this terrorist.

What made me comment so soon? It’s simple: I read the shooter’s manifesto. We don’t have to guess what was on the shooter’s mind—he told us in plain, dark, and racist language. He wrote about protecting white people from an “invasion” of Hispanics and wanting to kill “Mexicans.” Plus, his actions underscored his words—he drove nine hours from Dallas to a shopping center in El Paso. Why didn’t he go to a mall in North Dallas to kill people? The answer is obvious—he wanted to kill Hispanic people.

But for me, the real question now is: What comes next? Terrorism by white supremacists is indeed a real and present danger. We’ve seen it in this country in El Paso, Texas, and in Gilroy, California. We’ve also seen it in faraway places like New Zealand, where another white supremacist walked into a mosque and killed 51 and injured another 49.

The recent attacks in the United States are shocking, but not surprising. Just a few days ago, FBI Director Christopher Wray testified before the U.S. Senate that most domestic terrorism arrests in 2019 have been related to white terrorism. Stop and think about that statistic. Islamic radical terrorism remains a real threat around the world and even here at home, but most of the terrorist attacks in the U.S. are a consequence of white-nationalist terrorism.

No substantive debate exists about whether this threat is real. The only question is: What are we doing to do about it?

As a statewide elected official in Texas and as a naval intelligence officer who served during Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, I believe we must continue to defeat and destroy terrorism whenever we can, wherever we find it. And that means all terrorism. Many on the left are wrong in downplaying the threat of Islamic radical terrorism, and many on the right are wrong in downplaying homegrown white-supremacist terrorism. Both are evil, both are real, and both must be confronted and conquered.

As a conservative, I especially want to charge my party to take this challenge seriously. As the heirs to Lincoln and Reagan, we can’t look the other way when people threaten our security. When President Ronald Reagan spoke to the nation following his military action against Libya after a brutal terrorist attack in 1986, he said that the Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi “counted on America to be passive. He counted wrong.”

Today, we face the same sort of challenge. By definition, conservatives know that the world is a fallen place and that evil exists. We are not naive to it. And we have historically been willing to confront this evil. We must not be passive. We must not look away. The stakes are too high, and so are the consequences.

Confronting domestic terrorism starts with speaking honestly about the threat itself. No more euphemisms, no more attempts to explain away these actions. When a terrorist tells us in his manifesto that he is killing people because of their race, we should take him at his word.

But confronting domestic terrorism also means strengthening our law-enforcement approach to the challenge it poses. I applaud the U.S. attorney for the Western District of Texas for announcing that the shooter will be prosecuted on domestic-terrorism charges. We should prosecute white-supremacist terrorists the exact same way we do other terrorists.

Furthermore, confronting domestic terrorism means rebuilding the bond of trust between Americans and their law-enforcement agencies. There were a great number of heroes in El Paso on Saturday, and many of them were wearing uniforms. Police officers were on the scene in El Paso in just six minutes. And, once there, they quickly detained the shooter and saved countless lives.

Being Hispanic, I appreciate that there is sometimes tension between minority communities and police officers. But police brutality is, by far, the exception and not the rule. The vast majority of police officers around the nation are heroes who, every day, are willing to risk their lives to save others. We must support these brave men and women. And we must look for ways to work more closely with them to fight domestic terrorism. The policy of “If you see something, say something” needs to be followed when people see someone acting suspiciously, regardless of who it is.

Finally, confronting domestic terrorism means leading by example. All of us have a role to play. I know that our country has come a long way in addressing our national birth defect—racism. But more work remains to be done. Racism of the past was overt; racism of today is often covert. It’s more casual, but no less toxic. When I was growing up, I experienced open racism, including being called a wetback. Now the racism I encounter is generally more subtle. When I ran for reelection as Texas land commissioner, I saw ugly vestiges of racism. For my work in trying to protect and preserve the Alamo for generations to come, I was accused of wanting to change the story of the Alamo and to build a statue honoring Mexican General Santa Anna. It was offensive, it was outrageous, and it was completely untrue. It was also racist.

As conservatives, we have to do better than this because we are better than this. “I know in my heart that man is good, that what is right will always eventually triumph, and there is purpose and worth to each and every life,” Reagan once said. Those words were later engraved on Reagan’s tombstone. And they speak to the heart of what conservatives believe. Conservatives must defend all Americans from all threats. There are no second-class Americans. All of us help make this country great. Like different streams flowing into one river, America is made a stronger place by the unique communities and cultures all across our land. “Out of many, one,” our national motto says. And we must defend this principle from attack.

Conservatives have not been afraid to confront extremism in our world, and we must not be afraid to confront terrorism here at home: anywhere, anytime, and in any form. The events in El Paso serve as a painful reminder that we don’t have any other choice.",1,https://www.routefifty.com/public-safety/2019/08/white-nationalist-terrorism-must-be-stopped/158940/?oref=RouteFiftyTCO

39,Bush,George W.,politico,"The 2019 hurricane season in the Atlantic is underway and with it brings the threat of dangerous winds, storm surges and flooding to many coastal states. But hurricanes are not the only natural disasters that devastate American communities. President Dwight D. Eisenhower issued the first federal disaster declaration in 1953 after a tornado devastated four counties in Georgia. Since then, more than 4,000 disasters have received this designation. This year, 44 federal disaster declarations have been issued for 26 states and one U.S. territory. Since June 1, Louisiana, South Dakota, North Dakota, Idaho and Vermont have all received major disaster declarations. Responding to and recovering from disasters concerns everyone elected to protect and serve others.

But as I discovered leading the housing assistance mission after Hurricane Harvey, even though we are a nation of innovation, the federal disaster recovery process remains outdated, cumbersome and costly.

Hurricane Harvey was the second-largest storm in U.S. history, and it devastated my home state of Texas. About 30 percent of Texans were directly affected, and more than 750,000 people evacuated their homes. The scale of the disaster recovery was made even worse by the fact that two other major hurricanes struck American territory within 39 days: Harvey was followed five days later by Irma hitting Florida and then Maria decimating Puerto Rico.

I was in Houston mucking out homes with a group of military veteran volunteers, when I got a call from Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. The governor said he was tapping me and my agency, the Texas General Land Office, to partner with the Federal Emergency Management Agency on the short-term disaster housing mission. Traditionally, FEMA had sole responsibility for temporarily housing displaced residents, but the scale of this disaster was enormous. In addition to the deadly storms, wildfires burned more than half-a-million acres of California in 2017. With available federal recovery resources stretched extremely thin, this operation called for more direct oversight at the state level and we were eager to serve. For the first time in history, a state agency would partner with FEMA in carrying out a disaster housing mission. Over the next two years, my state agency and FEMA would help more than 60,000 Texans return home after the storm through assistance programs that provided both temporary housing units and repairs.

As I tackled this new mission, I quickly encountered two problems that impeded the short-term recovery process.

FIRST, WE LEARNED that federal law limits FEMA to providing “temporary” housing under the Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act of 1988. That definition tied our hands and prevented the use of innovative solutions. This language values short-term fixes over long-term solutions, creating an expensive and ineffective approach to distributing disaster recovery housing resources. The manufactured houses and travel trailers predominantly used by FEMA after natural disasters are extremely costly. After purchasing the unit, transportation, installation, recertification, other administrative costs, disconnection and removal, the costs per unit typically incur between $125,000 to $200,000.

A plethora of alternative housing options are available now that were not on the market when the Stafford Act passed in 1988, replacing the Disaster Relief Act of 1974. Some of these innovative housing solutions were developed in Texas, where we have a history of repeat disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires and floods. These options include stackable shipping containers, small modular homes and expandable “core unit” housing utilized under an initiative called RAPIDO, a temporary-to-permanent housing strategy that provides a safe, “core” home that is customizable to meet the family’s needs for about $60,000. Owners can add on to these units as needed later on. An Austin-based 3D home technology company, ICON, can print sturdy, 600- to 800-square-foot homes in less than 24 hours for $4,000. These homes can be placed quickly and left permanently for a fraction of the cost of a temporary FEMA trailer. They can also withstand subsequent hurricane or flooding events.

Even though many of these innovative options are cheaper, more durable and quickly deployable, “permanent” housing is ineligible under the Stafford Act. The manufactured housing units and travel trailers traditionally utilized by FEMA sit on axles, meaning you can haul it away after use – therefore passing the “temporary” housing test. After use, FEMA refurbishes former temporary housing units in good enough condition and the General Services Administration auctions them off, but typically for a small fraction of their cost. We can agree that the current disaster recovery process is not cost-effective.



SECOND, FEDERAL LAW prevented coordination with local officials to help displaced residents. With nearly 1 million applications for FEMA assistance submitted, county judges, mayors and other local leaders asked repeatedly for information on who needed help. FEMA controlled the application process and provided my team the names of only those deemed eligible for short-term disaster housing assistance. The federal assistance application process is daunting. It requires survivors to submit the same onerous application whether they need simple financial assistance, a small business loan, or short-term housing. Further, we had no information on who was found ineligible; therefore, community leadership had no ability to explain to constituents why they were declined for help. Many were deemed ineligible due to an error that could be easily corrected, but often the applicant gave up in frustration. Without knowing who was rejected, we could not work with survivors to file an appeal or find other forms of assistance until my staff was cleared after eight weeks of federal background checks.

Additionally, we were prohibited by the federal Privacy Act of 1974 from providing any “personally identifiable information” of eligible applicants to anyone outside the program. Local leaders trying to coordinate volunteer groups and potentially distribute donated resources were baffled by the unnecessary barriers to helping survivors at a time when expediency was critical. County judges and mayors from affected areas all along the Texas coast, such as Rockport/Fulton, Kingwood, Dickinson, Port Arthur and more, were calling me daily asking for help connecting those who needed help with the volunteer organizations that were showing up on the doorsteps of their county courthouses and city halls. I personally attended more than a hundred hearings, briefings, meetings and events in affected communities to relay information and answer questions, but I couldn’t provide a simple list of names and phone numbers for those needing help. During this time of crisis, federal privacy laws choked the flow of information and recovery resources to those in need and there was nothing those of us on the ground could do to fix it.

There are two relatively easy steps federal leaders could take to drastically improve the short-term disaster housing mission:

1. Congress should amend the Stafford Act to remove the word “temporary” from the requirements, therefore allowing cost-effective, permanent resources to house displaced residents.

2. FEMA should amend the application for assistance to allow people to voluntarily make their data available shareable with their state and local government authorities.

The lessons Texas learned in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey can help all states facing natural disasters. Congress should learn these lessons from Texas now, before catastrophic events hit Americans in other parts of the country. On the one-year anniversary after landfall, I released a lessons-learned report, Hurricane Harvey: Texas at Risk, with policy recommendations for local, state and federal officials to improve the disaster recovery process.

We can’t stop natural disasters from happening, but we can innovate the way in which we respond and rebuild.

George P. Bush is commissioner for the Texas General Land Office, the state agency tasked with leading the disaster recovery housing mission after Hurricane Harvey, the second-most destructive storm in American history.

40,Bush,George W.,realclearbooks,"In this Listening to Leaders interview, President George W. Bush draws upon his international, national, and state leadership to discuss the importance of vision and values in leading people, organizations, and even nations. Those essentials start well before someone becomes a leader, he says, and they involve listening to people and caring for others.

How do you define great leadership?

I define a great leader as someone who has vision, someone who knows where they want to go, and someone who will be able to define a set of principles that will enable a more successful journey.

A leader is optimistic and believes that the vision and the principles will lead to a better tomorrow. A leader also is someone who understands how to assemble a great team of people to achieve the vision. Someone who can laugh, someone who shares credit and who takes blame.

There is a lot in there about values and vision. Where do leaders get those? Where did they come from in your case?

I think it comes from how you were raised. In my case, it came from where I was raised — in Midland, Texas. And I believe that one learns values through family and religion.

I don’t think leadership can be taught. But I think leadership comes in all different forms and one can gain leadership traits. They can gain the ability to lead through experience.

You mentioned optimism. We know the world can be a challenging place, even dark at times. How do leaders speak about hope and optimism with authenticity in moments like that?

The question is, are you an authentically optimistic person? I believe I am and I believe I am because of my religion. I believe religion, in my case Christianity, provides hope even in the darkest moments. I also was raised by optimistic people. Over time I came to realize how fortunate I was to have been raised by whom I was raised and where I was raised.

Keeping life in perspective is very important to keeping an optimistic view. That means recognizing everybody has problems, and a lot of people have bigger problems than me. And it means recognizing that every country’s got problems, and there are a lot with bigger problems than we have in America

It seems like a lot of leadership is relational. Is knowing how to read people something that somebody can acquire or is that just innate?

To a certain extent, it’s innate. But it’s not so much how to read people, it is how to relate to people, how to listen to people, and how to care about people.

To be a people person, you really have to be interested in somebody, and you have to care about their plight and feelings. That’s a very important part of leadership. A leader understands that other people matter more than he or she does.

Another key trait to leadership is understanding the importance of culture, and that a culture has got to revolve around something other than a person. If a culture is based on a personality, then that culture will fail because all people are infallible. If the culture’s based upon larger concepts, then it is much easier to build a team of people who are headed in the same direction.

How do leaders apply these skills in the international arena where people come from different backgrounds and cultures?

First, you’ve got to understand that there are universal values. One such value is that freedom is a universal thought. In other words, it’s not America’s gift. It is inherent in every soul. That thought was very controversial when I was president, but what would have made it more controversial would have been to equivocate on it

Fortunately, there are historical examples of the universality of freedom, and that freedom leads to peace. Japan and Germany after World War II are examples. The fact that democracies don’t war with each other is another example.

By applying universal thought in a complex international world, you’re able to find common ground. Again, not every leader agreed. But ultimately that’s where the world will head with the proper leadership.

Secondly, like anything else, spending time with these leaders and getting to know leaders and listening to them is important. An ironic friendship I had was with (then-Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro) Koizumi. The reason we became friends is because we spent a lot of time talking about our lives and common interests. I listened to his view of the history of Japan and where he wanted to take his nation. If you listen to the person and take time to engage with them, you find common ground.

Historian Ronald White said in an interview for this series that leaders need a good sense of timing so they know what to say in a particular moment. How do you learn that?

A lot of it depends on the people you surround yourself with who will make timing recommendations. One of my miscalculations was the timing of whether or not to spend political capital on Social Security or immigration reform after the 2004 election. As I look back on it, I didn’t do a very good job of listening to advisors and moved ahead with Social Security reform. I regret having done that. In retrospect, my moving ahead cost an opportunity, I think, to reform immigration.

How do you develop the sense of knowing when to act and when not to act?

That becomes pretty clear at times. The political process will tell you when you are able to act or not to act. If you’re riding high, obviously it’s easier to act. But if people are getting tired of you, or people sense that you’re a lame duck, then it’s harder to act. You have to accommodate the moment.

A presidency, by the way, is defined oftentimes by the unexpected. What was expected was that our troops would be funded during the surge, and even though the Congress was against it, we never lost the vote. What was unexpected was the financial meltdown, so the timing of decisions was immediate. We didn’t have any choice. Sometimes you have choices, sometimes you don’t have choices.

You mentioned the surge. Do big decisions like that sometimes have to be visceral in nature?

That was visceral.

How did you know in your gut that was the right thing to do?

A handful of advisors kept reminding me that things were getting worse, not better. So I said, ""Okay, give me options."" They presented an option that gave us the best chance of achieving our objective, which was an ally in the war on terrorism and an example of a functioning democracy in the Middle East. There was only one option that enabled us to achieve the goal.

The visceral nature of the decision was that I refused to abandon a battlefield and those who sacrificed on the battlefield because of the politics that were difficult. The goal was not saving my political skin. The goal was achieving an objective, and, thankfully, it worked.

You were kind of making a call about the surge where you were out there on your own…

I wasn’t on my own, though. There was a group of insurgents inside the White House, like [then-National Security Adviser Stephen] Hadley. And [then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen.] Pete Pace had to sell it to reluctant generals. Of course, we had to make a leadership change in order to make it a credible change. [Then-Secretary of Defense] Bob Gates was all on board.

But there was a lot of reluctance, particularly in the Congress. This is an example where I believed so strongly in the mission and I knew how important it was that I was going to do what it took to win. We made a wise selection in [Gen. David] Petraeus. He had credibility in the Congress, and he could handle it. Gates was the new secretary of defense, and instinctively we wanted to give the secretary of defense some leeway.

Yeah, it was a tough slog. But we forged ahead.

What is the importance of asking the right questions of your team, and how do you know what to ask?

Really important. A leader’s got to be able to see the crux of an issue, distill it, and then direct minds toward the solution.

I don’t know where you learn that. It’s just from experience and understanding the core of an issue. It’s basically to simplify goals. I used to say, there’s so many goals in education, there are no goals. You have to have a few things and focus on them.

A key to success in any organization is to lay out goals that everybody can understand and what we’re going to do to achieve them

What would you say to prospective or current leaders about knowing which decisions to involve yourself in?

In a complex environment, the president has to insist that all big decisions come to his desk, because you don’t want to be surprised. But micromanaging a complex organization is a bad leadership trait.

As president and governor, how much opportunity did you get to look toward the future versus being consumed with the moment?

It is really important to look to the future and to anticipate pending problems. Some of them are obvious. It’s a balance that I thought was pretty easy to achieve. You need to look long-term and be optimistic

Take Social Security. That is an easy problem to see and a hard problem to fix. I thought it was important to explain to the American people that this system is not working.

One runs because one sees the long-term problems and tries to lay a foundation so that they become less of a problem.

Is there a way to build that into a leader’s daily schedule so they can keep looking over the horizon?

No, but you’re there for a reason. The question is, why are you the leader? Are you there for self-aggrandizement, or are you there to promote a better tomorrow? It depends on the motivations. I would hope most leaders want to solve problems.

41,Bush,George W.,buffalonews,"But, perhaps because the answer is impossible to discern, it is much more interesting to contemplate the extent to which the sometimes tortured execution of these portraits reflects the emotional life of their creator.

How much of that emotional life is made of up of pure and unalloyed American patriotism, and how much of it contains tinges of guilt? The introduction and the profiles in the book suggest one answer, but the portraits suggest another.

Few transformations in public life have been more fascinating to watch, or more indicative of the public's desire to forget, than Bush’s post-presidency. And these portraits are the latest example of that shift from reviled politician to cute and meme-worthy old man.

If we let it, each new stroke of each new portrait could further obscure the fact that America waged a war on based on, at best, dubious intelligence, costing the lives of nearly 4,500 Americans and between 150,000 and 1 million Iraqis. It is easy to forget the weight of that decision. We want to forget, because the notion of coming to terms with with it seems impossible.

But these portraits, and Bush’s surprisingly adept career as an artist, don’t have to exist merely to polish a legacy that may not be polishable. They could serve a much more noble function.",1,https://buffalonews.com/2017/03/30/former-president-deals-painful-part-legacy/

43,Bush,George W.,bartleby,"From The Examiner

I AM prevailed on, through the importunity of friends, to interrupt the scheme I had begun in my last paper, by an Essay upon the Art of Political Lying. We are told the devil is the father of lies, and was a liar from the beginning; so that, beyond contradiction, the invention is old: and, which is more, his first Essay of it was purely political, employed in undermining the authority of his prince, and seducing a third part of the subjects from their obedience: for which he was driven down from Heaven, where (as Milton expresses it) he had been viceroy of a great western province; and forced to exercise his talent in inferior regions among other fallen spirits, poor or deluded men, whom he still daily tempts to his own sin, and will ever do so, till he be chained in the bottomless pit. 1

But although the devil be the father of lies, he seems, like other great inventors, to have lost much of his reputation, by the continual improvements that have been made upon him. 2

Who first reduced lying into an art, and adapted it to politics, is not so clear from history, although I have made some diligent inquiries. I shall therefore consider it only according to the modern system, as it has been cultivated these twenty years past in the southern part of our own island. 3

The poets tell us, that after the giants were overthrown by the gods, the earth in revenge produced her last offspring which was Fame. And the fable is thus interpreted: that when tumults and seditions are quieted, rumours and false reports are plentifully spread through a nation. So that, by this account, lying is the last relief of a routed, earth-born, rebellious party in a state. But here the moderns have made great additions, applying this art to the gaining of power and preserving it, as well as revenging themselves after they have lost it; as the same instruments are made use of by animals to feed themselves when they are hungry, and to bite those that tread upon them. 4

But the same genealogy cannot always be admitted for political lying; I shall therefore desire to refine upon it, by adding some circumstances of its birth and parents. A political lie is sometimes born out of a discarded statesman’s head, and thence delivered to be nursed and dandled by the rabble. Sometimes it is produced a monster, and licked into shape: at other times it comes into the world completely formed, and is spoiled in the licking. It is often born an infant in the regular way, and requires time to mature it; and often it sees the light in its full growth, but dwindles away by degrees. Sometimes it is of noble birth; and sometimes the spawn of a stock-jobber. Here it screams aloud at the opening of the womb; and there it is delivered with a whisper. I know a lie that now disturbs half the kingdom with its noise, which, although too proud and great at present to own its parents, I can remember its whisperhood. To conclude the nativity of this monster; when it comes into the world without a sting, it is still-born; and whenever it loses its sting, it dies. 5

No wonder if an infant so miraculous in its birth should be destined for great adventures: and accordingly we see it hath been the guardian spirit of a prevailing party for almost twenty years. It can conquer kingdoms without fighting, and sometimes with the loss of a battle. It gives and resumes employments; can sink a mountain to a mole-hill, and raise a mole-hill to a mountain: hath presided for many years at committees of elections; can wash a blackmoor white; make a saint of an atheist, and a patriot of a profligate; can furnish foreign ministers with intelligence, and raise or let fall the credit of the nation. This goddess flies with a huge looking-glass in her hands, to dazzle the crowd, and make them see, according as she turns it, their ruin in their interest, and their interest in their ruin. In this glass you will behold your best friends, clad in coats powdered with fleurs de lis, and triple crowns; their girdles hung round with chains, and beads, and wooden shoes; and your worst enemies adorned with the ensigns of liberty, property, indulgence, moderation, and a cornucopia in their hands. Her large wings, like those of a flying-fish, are of no use but while they are moist; she therefore dips them in mud, and soaring aloft scatters it in the eyes of the multitude, flying with great swiftness; but at every turn is forced to stoop in dirty ways for new supplies. 6

I have been sometimes thinking, if a man had the art of the second sight for seeing lies, as they have in Scotland for seeing spirits, how admirably he might entertain himself in this town, by observing the different shapes, sizes, and colours of those swarms of lies which buzz about the heads of some people, like flies about a horse’s ears in summer; or those legions hovering every afternoon in Exchange-alley, enough to darken the air; or over a club of discontented grandees, and thence sent down in cargoes to be scattered at elections. 7

There is one essential point wherein a political liar differs from others of the faculty, that he ought to have but a short memory, which is necessary, according to the various occasions he meets with every hour of differing from himself, and swearing to both sides of a contradiction, as he finds the persons disposed with whom he hath to deal. In describing the virtues and vices of mankind, it is convenient, upon every article, to have some eminent person in our eye, from whom we copy our description. I have strictly observed this rule, and my imagination this minute represents before me a certain great man famous for this talent, to the constant practice of which he owes his twenty years’ reputation of the most skilful head in England, for the management of nice affairs. The superiority of his genius consists in nothing else but an inexhaustible fund of political lies, which he plentifully distributes every minute he speaks, and by an unparalleled generosity forgets, and consequently contradicts, the next half hour. He never yet considered whether any proposition were true or false, but whether it were convenient for the present minute or company to affirm or deny it; so that if you think fit to refine upon him, by interpreting everything he says, as we do dreams, by the contrary, you are still to seek, and will find yourself equally deceived whether you believe or not: the only remedy is to suppose, that you have heard some inarticulate sounds, without any meaning at all; and besides, that will take off the horror you might be apt to conceive at the oaths, wherewith he perpetually tags both ends of every proposition; although, at the same time, I think he cannot with any justice be taxed with perjury, when he invokes God and Christ, because he hath often fairly given public notice to the world that he believes in neither. 8",1,https://www.bartleby.com/209/633.html
44,Bush,George W.,houstonchronicle,"Everything is bigger in Texas, and that includes construction. From the towering high-rises going up in our cities to the growth of residential housing across the state, building is one of our strongest businesses. In recent years, the construction industry has contributed $91.2 billion to our powerhouse economy and accounted for more than 726,000 jobs. And this will only continue to increase as our population grows by a thousand new Texans every day.

Since Hurricane Harvey, Texas builders have been a major part of the recovery effort, readily assisting with public outreach, charity and rebuilding. Harvey’s winds were brutal in the Coastal Bend, and the 27 trillion gallons of rainfall flooded countless homes in and near Houston and across southeast Texas. We heard from thousands of families displaced by tragic flooding. It was devastating, but seeing construction trucks and loads of drywall heading to homesites gave us hope.

Now we must turn to the future and think about what we can do to protect our homes from this happening again. The indisputable fact remains that Texas is — and will continue to be — at a high risk for natural disasters, particularly hurricanes and floods. It is not a matter of if Texas will be devastated by another hurricane. It is a matter of when.

As we approach another hurricane season with the impact of Harvey still lingering, there is no better time to consider what more the state can do to protect life and property against future disasters. We must make every effort to ensure that families and communities are prepared to withstand the inevitable next storm, starting with updated building codes that strengthen the integrity of a home or business even in hurricane-force winds or monumental flooding.

The extensive damage caused to commercial and residential buildings by Harvey should serve as a wake-up call and tell us that we, as a state, are not doing enough. Current building codes required by state statute are more than a decade old. They are so outdated, in fact, that training is no longer offered by the council that created the guidelines. Texas trails Louisiana and Florida, both of which have updated building codes to mitigate risk and prevent loss of life.

What this means for Texans is that many of our neighbors, friends and family bought homes they thought were safe, but lost their life savings repairing damage caused by flooding from Harvey.

In Harris County, effective building code changes and enforcement prevented this problem. While 6 percent of all homes in Harris County sustained flood damage during Harvey, engineers reported that less than 1 percent of homes built after 2009 flooded. This is because the slab elevation standards were raised in 2009 and then rigorously enforced.

These are significant improvements, but more must be done throughout flood-prone areas. Many builders already build above and beyond what is required to increase the resiliency of homes, but these standards should be codified in state statute.

Evidence clearly shows homes and businesses built according to robust disaster building code standards have survived hurricanes, floods and tornadoes where others have been destroyed or severely damaged.

Texas is a large state, and we must be thoughtful about what the building code enforcement codes should be in each area. Homes built near rivers and along the coast should be subject to stricter flood elevation codes than those in areas that do not face this consistent possibility. Common sense reforms are needed to protect, not inhibit, residents of our local communities.

I commend Rep. Dennis Paul, R-Houston, for filing a bill to address this issue, which codifies the International Residential Code for 2012 in state statute and requires municipalities to hold public hearings to increase transparency when adopting building code amendments. Construction is the foundation of Texas, and we will continue to work with builders, local leaders and state officials to ensure that our foundation remains strong.

48,Bush,George W.,statesman,"Hurricane Harvey was the most destructive storm ever to hit the Texas coast with four days of rain inundating communities with 27 trillion gallons of water. Since the storm made landfall, my team at the Texas General Land Office and I have logged more than 350 meetings, briefings and other events throughout the affected area, speaking with more than 180 community leaders, including judges, county commissioners and mayors.

After a year of recovery work crisscrossing 49 affected counties, I issued a report titled ""Hurricane Harvey: Texas At Risk,"" which captures lessons learned and proposes several policy recommendations. These recommendations benefit all levels of government with the overarching objectives of better protecting Texans in advance of the next disaster and improving both speed and effectiveness of recovery efforts.

In the report we examine current flood control management, including consolidating jurisdiction over planning and oversight. Current flood mitigation efforts are dispersed at various levels of government and there is no state agency empowered to coordinate and direct flood control efforts. What happens upstream can cause flooding downstream, yet cities and counties cannot protect their communities with flood prevention improvements outside their borders.

There must be an authority at the state level to coordinate flood mitigation projects in upstream watersheds. Additionally, this state entity could bring together multiple stakeholders to benefit all communities in the region.

It is difficult to conduct flood mitigation at the federal level because of the bureaucracy and inconsistent funding. Texans are better able to lead this effort at the state level rather than rely on the federal government. State ownership of flood control efforts will not completely eliminate the problem but can substantially reduce it.

The population of Texas has more than doubled since 1980, with most of the growth occurring in the population triangle of Dallas, San Antonio, and Houston. While this concentrated growth has fueled the Texas economy, it is not without its challenges. Inside this triangle are a multitude of rivers and streams that can cause drastic flooding events in these heavily populated areas.

Fort Bend County is a primary example of several local, state and federal entities having an overlapping role in flood mitigation. In this county, 17 cities, 20 levee improvement districts, numerous drainage districts, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the Brazos River Authority all share some responsibility for flood control. This makes it difficult to assess risk and coordinate protection for the more than 764,000 residents who call it home.

Texas has a pressing need for a single governmental body to provide overall flood control management for the watersheds affecting major population areas and guide state and local flood control policy. In the General Land Office's report, we recommended that the Texas Water Development Board’s statutory authority be substantially expanded to include jurisdiction to coordinate flood control efforts across the various state river authorities, contributing to water development where possible.

I strongly support legislative action and I commend Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, Senator Charles Perry and other members of the Texas Legislature for focusing on legislation that prioritizes flood planning and mitigation.

49,Bush,George W.,houstonchronicle,"What was Lincoln is now Montrose. What used to be San Felipe in the Fourth Ward is now West Dallas. And what's now Cullen used to be St. Bernard.

Dozens of Houston streets have changed names over the years. More recently, you might remember Dowling -- named after local saloon owner and Confederate lieutenant Dick Dowling -- changing its name to Emancipation Avenue.

Here are two more examples of Houstonians looking to rename a street. One was successful, the other was not. One stemmed from a war fought an ocean away, another came about under mysterious circumstances.

For years, German Street was a major thoroughfare in the Second Ward. Its name served as a reminder of the significant German population that settled in the area in the 19th century. A Houston Chronicle article noted that ""with its extension, German Avenue, it passes through Central and Magnolia parks and ultimately reaches the Ship Channel. It is the main thoroughfare through Central Park.""

But by 1917 the U.S. had declared war on Germany. In June, combat forces would arrive in Europe to take on that nation's army. Patriotism was running high in the U.S. and in Houston, especially on German Street.

Residents there figured they didn't want to live on a road that bore the name of the enemy. So in June, a group representing that street met at the county courthouse and unanimously voted to change its name.

""How can a man who believes in the justice of the allied cause reside on German Street and be patriotic?"" T.B. Tucker told Houston City Council the following week, according to the July 3 Chronicle. ""We know German Street is almost as old as Houston, but we want its name changed to Belgium Street. The Belgian army saved Europe. They held back the German tidal wave until France and England could mobilize. France and England will hold the enemy until America mobilizes, and then the war will be over.""

What's the matter with Mattes? Another name considered for German Street was Mattes, in honor of Army Capt. Joseph W. Mattes. He was brutally killed by mutinous soldiers during the Houston Riot of 1917. Problem is, residents said they couldn't pronounce his name, the Chronicle reported on June 4, 1918. Instead, it became Canal. See More Collapse

No one apparently asked Fannie Culmore, of 2118 German St., what she thought of the name change. After learning of the news to rename it she gave council a piece of her mind.

""We are not fighting the German people; we are fighting the kaiser, and the kaiser does not truly represent the real German character,"" she said, as reported in the July 19 Chronicle. ""No reasonable person will agree that any good purpose would be served by changing the name of one of the oldest streets in Houston. On the other hand, it would be plain hysteria.

""German Street was given its name 70 years ago by John Fisher, one of the first settlers here. It was named German Street when I moved there, in 1861, and this is the first time I have ever heard a suggestion to give it some other name.

""Eleven of my 12 children were born on German Street. My father lived there before me. If you give it another name, I am ready to move -- and that would break my heart.""

That was enough for council to drop the matter ... for 11 months.

On June 3, 1918, Houston City Council passed an ordinance renaming German Street to Canal. The following night, city leaders in Magnolia Park voted to change it to Belgian Street. (One has to assume Belgian became Canal when Houston annexed Magnolia Park in 1926.)

The name change was buried in the Chronicle. A check of the 1922 City Directory shows that Culmore didn't stick to her vow. Her address is listed as 2118 Canal.

***

Over in the North Side, Common Street begins at Burnett and runs parallel to Fulton. In October 1919, residents there filed a petition seeking to change its name to Melrose.

""Just what the cause of this is, remains a mystery,"" the Chronicle wrote in its Oct. 8 editions. ""The petition filed with the city council asking that the name of the street be changed from Common to 'Melrose' gives no reason why the change is desired.""

Following the idea that a person is judged by the name of the street they live on, the Chronicle figured that since residents there were ""railway employees and have enjoyed an unprecedented era of prosperity,"" they sought a name that sounded more ""mellifluous.""

Whatever the reason, it fell flat. Common Street remains to this day.

50,Bush,George W.,si,"President George W. Bush has been a Texas sports fan since he was

a young child. He grew up in the West Texas town of Midland,

where his family moved from Connecticut when he was two. The

former governor and onetime managing partner of the Texas Rangers

recalls his excitement at seeing the first issue of Sports

Illustrated at a friend's house in 1954. On the occasion of the

magazine's 50th anniversary, he sat down with SI's Don Yaeger to

talk about sports and the Lone Star State.

SI: Why is Texas such a big sports state?

GWB: First of all, the weather is pretty darn good, so people can

stay outside a lot. The main sport is football, and it's probably

because years ago high schools became the center point of the

small towns. High school football became the thing to do on a

Friday night.

The elementary school I went to was in front of Midland Memorial

Stadium. And Wahoo McDaniel was the Midland High football star.

He went on to [Oklahoma] and then played linebacker for the Jets,

and then became a professional wrestler. I remember as a kid

watching Wahoo McDaniel play football.

SI: What's your favorite Texas rivalry?

GWB: I'd have to say the Texas-Texas A&M football game. It's the

kind of game where all records go out the window because of the

intensity of the rivalry. When Texas A&M comes to Austin to play,

the Aggie band and the Corps of Cadets march down Congress

Avenue, which is the main street, to the stadium. The whole

series is full of tradition. Plus they're good games, generally.

SI: You've been quoted as saying that as an athlete you peaked in

Little League.

GWB: Right.

SI: Tell me about your Little League career.

GWB: Well, I was a pretty good catcher. In Midland we lived right

behind an old buffalo wallow that they'd converted into a Little

League park, so all I had to do was walk out our backyard, and

there I was in the field. And I played for hours. You hear the

stories about the mother leaning out the door screaming for the

son to come back for dinner--that was me. The other thing I

remember about Little League is that my mother was at every game.

She was the scorekeeper and, believe it or not, actually didn't

yell a lot at me or the umpires.

SI: How did you become a baseball fan?

GWB: Well, my dad and mother were fans. I was born my dad's

sophomore year in college, and he was a baseball star. And Mother

would take me to the games. I can remember being a little guy and

going through his scrapbook, looking at the box scores for the

Yale team. And I remember playing catch with him.

SI: At Yale you were a pitcher, right?

GWB: I was a middle reliever my freshman year. And I was mediocre

at best. And then I went on and played rugby my senior year.

SI: As a boy did you have a role model who was an athlete?

GWB: I was enamored with Willie Mays because of his speed, his

power. He was such a charismatic ballplayer. When I went to visit

my grandparents, who lived in Greenwich, Connecticut, my Uncle

Buck took me to the New York Giants game at the old Polo Grounds,

and I saw Willie firsthand and then followed him from that point

on.

SI: What was your best move with the Texas Rangers?

GWB: Convincing the citizens of Arlington [to build The Ballpark

in Arlington]. It changed the franchise.

SI: What was your worst move?

GWB: Some of our trades coming down the stretch. Of course the

[1989 Sammy] Sosa deal [with the White Sox] has to be one of the

alltime failed trades. The idea was to get Harold Baines to help

kick-start the offense. Sammy was a young ballplayer, and the

front office came to the conclusion that while he could be a good

ballplayer, he'd be nothing like Juan Gonzalez.

SI: Do you still root for the Rangers?

GWB: It's a tough year to root for them, but I do. And the

Astros. You know, we moved to Houston in '59, and the Astros came

shortly thereafter. I used to go to a lot of Astros games and was

an Astros fan for a long, long time.

SI: What's your favorite college team, besides Yale?

GWB: [Laughs] Let's see, that's a tough one with these guys [his

staff, many of them Texans] in here. I like the Texas teams, let

me put it to you that way. I'm somewhat partial to the University

of Texas, because when I was governor, I spent a lot of time in

the gym [there]; that was a place where I could go work out and

be alone, if I needed to be. And I got to know [football coach]

Mack Brown and Jeff (Mad Dog) Madden, the strength coach. I got

to see the insides of the program and became very fond of the men

that were involved with the program. But I also like A&M a lot.

And the truth of the matter is, I root for all Texas teams.

SI: Who's your favorite baseball player today?

GWB: I'd probably say some of the old Rangers, guys I got to

know. Pudge [Rodriguez], for example. I like Raffy--Rafael

Palmeiro. You know, one of my favorite ballplayers of all is

Julio Franco. Great hitter. He was gracious enough to invite

Laura and me and our twins to his wedding at his house in

Arlington. The girls will never forget it. They still think about

him.

SI: The Washington Post wrote a story that baseball helped give

people a sense of you as more of a regular guy. Do you agree with

that description? Or do you think that, because some people look

at your family and think--GWB: Yes, elite.

SI: Elite--GWB: I don't know. As The Washington Post has since

found out, I don't sit around trying to analyze myself a lot. I

hope people saw me as a good businessman and somebody who, when

given a responsibility [to run the Rangers], upheld the

responsibility.

SI: You were pretty famous for sitting in the stands.

GWB: I sat in the stands, signed autographs, tried to make the

park as fan-friendly as possible. There was many a day when you'd

be sitting there about the seventh inning [and fans would be

yelling], ""More pitching, Bush!"" That's all part of sport.

SI: Who's the best Texas sportswriter ever?

GWB: I'd say Blackie Sherrod was one of the greats. I'll tell

you, though, [sitting in the dugout, talking to sportswriters

before the game] was one of my favorite moments. You know,

[Gerry] Fraley and [Randy] Galloway and [Phil] Rogers--I can't

remember all their names. But we'd sit around and talk baseball.

It was really a good relationship.

And occasionally I would get on Randy Galloway's talk shows. You

know, ""Bill from Garland: 'Well, that Bush is such a lousy....

Why won't you sign so-and-so?'"" And I'd kind of wink at Galloway

and go on and answer the question. Again, that's all part of

building a franchise.

SI: Alex Rodriguez is making $22 million more this year than you

are--what do you think of that?

GWB: That's right. What Babe Ruth said--that line, ""He's having a

better year."" Alex Rodriguez is a fine person, a great

ballplayer. History will decide whether or not he was worth the

price. I guess if--when--the Rangers win a pennant, it will be

worth it.

SI: When will they win one?

GWB: Well, they have a pretty interesting-looking [team]. They

just need--listen, it's the same old worry we've always had,

depth in the pitching staff. They have some good young arms, it

looks like, who need a little seasoning. But they've got a heck

of an infield.

SI: Who do you talk sports with?

GWB: Around the office [I used to talk with former press

secretary] Ari Fleischer, a huge Yankees fan. I needled him about

the Yankees. My brother Marvin is a sports fan, and we love to

talk sports. Barney, the dog, when we're watching a ball game

[laughs]. He's the only one who sits there and watches the games

with me. I probably watch, try to catch part of a ball game, five

days a week. After work, if I'm reviewing a speech or just want a

little downtime, I'll have the ball game on in the background.

Some people like to listen to opera--I like to have the ball game

in the background.

SI: Any interest in getting back into baseball someday?

GWB: I don't think so. I will always be a fan, and I don't know

what I'll do. I ran into Joe Morgan, who was one of my favorite

ballplayers when he was with the Astros, and he asked me would I

think about being a commissioner, and my immediate answer was no.

And I think it's probably true.

Corpus Christi Caller-Times Opinion

The man I simply called ""Gampy"" was known to the world as George Herbert Walker Bush. And he was the most gracious, most decent and most humble man I will ever know. In fact, he would tell you how blessed he was and how thankful he was for each blessing.

My grandfather was thankful for his family.

He would wake up about 5 a.m. to review security briefings and grab his first coffee of the day. When the coast was clear, all of the grandkids would do our best to snag a spot on his bed with Ganny, while they read the paper.

We all grew up in awe of our grandfather — a larger-than-life figure fly-fishing off the rocks in Maine. He would be the first to host intense horseshoe matchups between family and secret service, or any willing head of state, while encouraging trash talk like ""power outage"" if you were short on your throw, or ""Woodrow Wilson"" if you were long. His typical spread included barbecue, tacos or pork rinds with hot sauce — of course with a healthy dose of Blue Bell ice cream. Always the competitor, each night closed with Gampy challenging us to the coveted ""first asleep"" award.

In classic Gampy fashion, he would write letters of encouragement — whether one of us had a hard semester at school, one of us (not me) drove his boat Fidelity into the rocks, or one of us (definitely not me) ended up in Ganny's crosshairs.

'Greatest of the greatest generation':Mourners remember President George H. W. Bush

At the close of one summer, after he had left public service, Gampy wrote an email to all of us:

The only thing wrong with the last five months is that none of you were here enough. Next year, promise this old gampster that you will spend more time with us here by the sea. As you know, I have had to give up fly-fishing off the rocks, but there is plenty left to do — plenty of wonderful things. I think of all of you an awful lot. I just wonder how each of you is doing — in life, in college, in school. If you need me, I am here for you, because I love you very much.

In Psalm 91:16, God makes this promise: ""With long life, I will satisfy him and show him my salvation."" Today, we know that Gampy did enjoy a long life, and we know he is enjoying the beginning of his next life with my Ganny and his beloved Robin.

He was thankful to serve

My grandfather was thankful for his country.

My grandfather was grateful to lead a country where people can go as far, and as fast, as their dreams can take them; a country that celebrates individuals alone or working together to improve the condition of their fellow man on a voluntary basis — an initiative he would later describe as a ""thousand points of light.""

He often spoke about the timeless creed of ""duty, honor, country"" that has sustained the republic for more than 240 years.

Neil Bush:My father believed in service to others

Our view:George H.W. Bush was a great American, class act and underrated president

But this wasn't something he just talked about ... it was something he lived. He flew 58 combat missions in the Pacific, was shot down and rescued at sea. Yet he never saw his own heroism as being any greater than anyone else's. I know this because I experienced it personally. Gampy was so proud when my cousin Walker joined the Marines and I joined the Navy, and he was even prouder when we served overseas. In no way did our service compare with his, yet we could never convince him of that.

In our times together, our big, wonderful and competitive family saw his personal goodness that led to his historical greatness. He left a simple yet profound legacy to his children and grandchildren and to our great country — service to others. When the last word on George H.W. Bush is written, it will almost certainly be this: The fulfillment of a complete life cannot be achieved without service to others.

He was thankful to God

Finally, my grandfather was thankful for his God.

Gampy once said: ""God is good, but his love has a cost: We must be good to one another."" It was his faith and his love for others that drove him, that fulfilled him, and that led him to a calling in public life.

Toward the end of his service as president, at a prayer breakfast here in Houston, he reflected on his time aboard the submarine USS Finback after being shot down during World War II — he went up topside one night on the deck, stood watch and looked out at the dark. He said: ""The sky was clear; the stars were brilliant like a blizzard of fireflies in the night. There was a calm inner peace. Halfway around the world in a war zone, there was a calm inner peace: God's therapy.""

Today, after 94 years, the heavy hand of time has claimed the life of my Gamps. But in death, as in life, my grandfather has won — for he has exchanged his earthly burdens for a heavenly home and is at peace.

Yes, the man I simply called Gampy was the most gracious, most decent and most humble man I will ever know. And it's the honor of a lifetime to share his name.

Always the competitor, each night closed with Gampy challenging us to the coveted ""first asleep"" award.

In classic Gampy fashion, he would write letters of encouragement — whether one of us had a hard semester at school, one of us (not me) drove his boat Fidelity into the rocks, or one of us (definitely not me) ended up in Ganny's crosshairs.

'Greatest of the greatest generation':Mourners remember President George H. W. Bush at Houston funeral

At the close of one summer, after he had left public service, Gampy wrote an email to all of us:

The only thing wrong with the last five months is that none of you were here enough. Next year, promise this old gampster that you will spend more time with us here by the sea. As you know, I have had to give up fly-fishing off the rocks, but there is plenty left to do — plenty of wonderful things. I think of all of you an awful lot. I just wonder how each of you is doing — in life, in college, in school. If you need me, I am here for you, because I love you very much.

In Psalm 91:16, God makes this promise: ""With long life, I will satisfy him and show him my salvation."" Today, we know that Gampy did enjoy a long life, and we know he is enjoying the beginning of his next life with my Ganny and his beloved Robin.

He was thankful to serve

My grandfather was thankful for his country.

My grandfather was grateful to lead a country where people can go as far, and as fast, as their dreams can take them; a country that celebrates individuals alone or working together to improve the condition of their fellow man on a voluntary basis — an initiative he would later describe as a ""thousand points of light.""

He often spoke about the timeless creed of ""duty, honor, country"" that has sustained the republic for more than 240 years.

Neil Bush:My father believed in service to others

Related:Understanding George H.W. Bush, one letter at a time

Our view:George H.W. Bush was a great American, class act and underrated president

But this wasn't something he just talked about ... it was something he lived. He flew 58 combat missions in the Pacific, was shot down and rescued at sea. Yet he never saw his own heroism as being any greater than anyone else's. I know this because I experienced it personally. Gampy was so proud when my cousin Walker joined the Marines and I joined the Navy, and he was even prouder when we served overseas. In no way did our service compare with his, yet we could never convince him of that.

In our times together, our big, wonderful and competitive family saw his personal goodness that led to his historical greatness. He left a simple yet profound legacy to his children and grandchildren and to our great country — service to others. When the last word on George H.W. Bush is written, it will almost certainly be this: The fulfillment of a complete life cannot be achieved without service to others.

He was thankful to God

Finally, my grandfather was thankful for his God.

Gampy once said: ""God is good, but his love has a cost: We must be good to one another."" It was his faith and his love for others that drove him, that fulfilled him, and that led him to a calling in public life.

Toward the end of his service as president, at a prayer breakfast here in Houston, he reflected on his time aboard the submarine USS Finback after being shot down during World War II — he went up topside one night on the deck, stood watch and looked out at the dark. He said: ""The sky was clear; the stars were brilliant like a blizzard of fireflies in the night. There was a calm inner peace. Halfway around the world in a war zone, there was a calm inner peace: God's therapy.""

Today, after 94 years, the heavy hand of time has claimed the life of my Gamps. But in death, as in life, my grandfather has won — for he has exchanged his earthly burdens for a heavenly home and is at peace.

Yes, the man I simply called Gampy was the most gracious, most decent and most humble man I will ever know. And it's the honor of a lifetime to share his name.

God bless you, Gampy. Until we meet again.

The man I simply called “Gampy” was known to the world as George Herbert Walker Bush. And he was the most gracious, most decent, and most humble man I will ever know. In fact, he would tell you how blessed he was and how thankful he was for each blessing.

My grandfather was thankful for his family.

He would wake up around 5 a.m. to review security briefings and grab his first coffee of the day. When the coast was clear, all of the grandkids would do our best to snag a spot on his bed with Ganny while they read the paper.

We all grew up in awe of my grandfather – a larger than life figure fly-fishing off the rocks in Maine while talking up where the blue fish were running. He would be the first to host intense horseshoe match ups between family and secret service or any willing head of state, while encouraging trash talk like “power outage” if you were short, or “Woodrow Wilson” if you were long on your throw.

60,Bush,George W.,boston,"BOSTON (CBS) – Paul Kelly spent most of his adult life serving his country and protecting American leaders, but there was one who stood out. He says President George H.W. Bush treated him like family. “Secret Service had got to the point where there was such a bond and a commitment that was mutual,” Kelly said.

After Vietnam, Kelly left Weymouth and joined the Secret Service. His first big assignment was to go with Ambassador Bush to China, because Kelly was fluent in Mandarin.

He brought Barbara with him and his Cocker Spaniel, C. Fred Bush. “At that time it was pretty much acknowledged that that was the only domesticated dog in China,” Kelly said.

Kelly served five presidents, but it was the Bush family and their kindness that touched him most. “They were sincere, they were outgoing and they were very considerate of everybody,” Kelly said.

In the summer, when the president got on his boat, Kelly was designated as the “swimmer” should something happen. “His hat fell in the water one day,” Kelly said. “He says, ‘Kelly are you going to get that?’ I said I don’t do windows and I don’t do hats. So then I reached over with a gaff hook and I got the hat.”

After over 20 years at the Secret Service, Kelly has long since retired. On Wednesday, he had to turn down an invitation to the Bush service for medical reasons, but watching on TV, he said “George was mission-oriented and he wants to complete his mission. I think he did that today.”",1,https://boston.cbslocal.com/2018/12/05/george-hw-bush-secret-service-agent/

62,Bush,George W.,time,"Read an excerpt from the forthcoming commemorative edition on the life and legacy of George H.W. Bush, from Time Inc. Books, a division of Meredith Corporation:

George Bush will never be remembered for soaring rhetorical flourishes. His legacy as a speaker will be defined by abrupt — and much mimicked — phrases such as “Wouldn’t be prudent” and “Read my lips.” But as much as he may have seemed at times to be distant at the podium, the man who put pen to paper in private was less self-conscious, at times personable and at times combative and, on occasion, quite funny. Unlike most presidents who author autobiographies shortly after leaving office — both to pay the bills and to offer an unchallenged defense of events that happened on their watch — Bush declined such offers, leaving historians the task of assessing his tenure. Instead he assembled a lifetime of letters and other writings into the revealing 1999 bestseller All the Best. What follows is a small collection of excerpts that capture pivotal moments in his life in his own words.

‘I KISSED BARBARA AND AM GLAD OF IT’

To his mother

1942, written at the Wold-Chamberlain Naval Air Station, Minneapolis, Minn.

Kissing is not an obligation a girl owes a boy regardless of how often he takes her out or how much money he spends … but I don’t think that it is entirely wrong for a girl to be kissed by a boy. Let us take this famous case [Barbara] Pierce vs. [George] Bush summer ’42. I kissed Barbara and am glad of it. I don’t believe she will ever regret it or resent it, and I certainly am not ashamed of it. I’d tell you, Mrs. Pierce, or anybody but at the same time I might as well tell you I have never felt towards another girl as I do towards her. Whether the feeling is mutual I cannot say. To get back to my example, however, if Barbara sort of forgets me, which is not unlikely, as I have no chance to see her at all, I don’t believe she will ever dislike me more for having kissed her. She knows how I felt towards her and she must have shared some of the same feeling or she would not have allowed me to kiss her. I have never kissed another girl.

‘YOU LOOK YOUNGER THAN I THOUGHT’

Journal entry

November 7, 1987, warming up for the presidential campaign

Brandon, Iowa. A tiny little town. More people in the middle of the little town than lived in the town. They came in from everywhere. The firemen, dressed in yellow coats, holding the crowd back. Young kids, banners, homemade signs welcoming the Vice President. I go into the Brandon Feed Store, and just before walking in I was shaking hands with all the people and an older woman said to me, “You look younger than I thought.” I said, “A lot of people say, taller.” She said, “No, I say a lot younger.” I said, “Well, I’m 63.” She said, “No shit?” Everybody heard her. All of the people standing next to her looked shocked, looked kind of held back. I laughed and then they laughed like mad. It was absolutely fantastic. One of the great moments in my life politically.

‘I HATE BROCCOLI’

Journal entry March 23, 1990

The broccoli war is heating up. On March 21st, the Broccoli Association announces they’re sending a couple of tons of the stuff, but I’m sticking with my position that I hate broccoli. I think I’ll get Barbara, who likes broccoli, to go out and greet the broccoli caravan. I refuse to give an inch on this, and I so advised the press. I can’t stand the stuff; it smells up everything; and I’m against it.

‘SAYING GOOD-BYE’

Journal entry

January 20, 1993, last day in the White House

My last walk around the [White House] grounds. It’s clear, blue, crisp, cold, and I think of the many walks I’ve had around here and what a joy it’s been. …

The worst will be saying good-bye to the staff today, but if I lose it, too bad, they’ve been a part of our lives and they know we care. …

And so time goes on and I’m sitting here now alone, the desk is clear and the pictures are gone. I leave a note on the desk for Bill Clinton. It looks a little lonely sitting there. I don’t want it to be overly dramatic, but I did want him to know that I would be rooting for him.

I think of the happiness we’ve had here. Somebody points out, “Well, the polls look good today—you’re leaving with people liking you.” And I’m saying, “Well that’s nice, that’s very nice, but I didn’t finish the job.” They may be pleasant in that way, but I don’t think they know my heartbeat.

‘I AM GETTING OLDER NOW’

To his children

September 23, 1998 [Bush ends his book with this letter]

This letter is about aging. Not about the President’s Conference on Aging and how we should play lawn bowling, get discounts at the movies, turn into skin-conscious sun blockers, take Metamucil and grow old gracefully. No, it’s about me, about what happened between last year and this, between being 73 and 74. …

Last year I could fly fish on the end rocks at the Point, and not be too concerned about losing my balance. Oh, if I’d been casting at one target for a while way back in the summer of ’97, my spike clad feet firmly placed on two rocks, and then I turned fast I’d feel a little—what’s the word here—not “wobbly” but “unbalanced”—that’s the feeling. …

Then there’s memory. I’m still pretty good at faking it. “Well, I’ll be darn, how in the heck are you?” or “long time no see!” or “What you been up to?”…

If I try to read after dinner I fall asleep on the third page no matter how gripping the mystery. Read a briefing paper in bed? No way—Sominex time!

No there is a difference now and maybe when we reconvene next year, you’ll notice even more of a gentle slide. I hope not. I want to put this “aging” on hold for awhile now.

I don’t expect to be on the A team any more, but I want to play golf with you. And I want to fish or throw shoes. And I want to rejoice in your victories be they political, or business, or family happiness.

63,Bush,George W.,chicagotribune,"George Herbert Walker Bush never wrote a real memoir. In fact, he seemed to avoid it. Leading up to his 1988 presidential campaign, Bush published ""Looking Forward,"" a ghostwritten affair he later dismissed as ""the kind of book that comes out about the candidate during an election year."" The 1998 volume on his foreign policy, ""A World Transformed,"" is co-authored with Brent Scowcroft and features alternating passages by the two men. (Scowcroft's are better.) A decade later, Bush's diary from his time as China envoy in the mid-1970s morphed into a book only after a historian pitched the idea and did all the work. And a lifetime of letters came together in ""All the Best, George Bush,"" a 2013 collection that the former president stresses was ""not meant to be an autobiography."" Loved ones have written about him - his late wife, Barbara, in her 1994 memoir; George W. in the loyal ""41"" - and historians and former aides have taken their turns. But not Bush himself. ""I was unpersuaded,"" he explained simply. It's our loss. George H.W. Bush had the experiences, insights, revelations and blind spots that could have made for a terrific memoir. The raw material is scattered throughout these various works. Individually, they are snapshots of a life. Together, they could have redefined it. In these pages, Bush - so often labeled the speedboating, fly-fishing scion of Kennebunkport - grapples with his advantages, early and late in life. He is aware of his rhetorical limitations but, even as a younger man, treats higher office as a certainty. He is indignant at the suggestion that he cared more for foreign than domestic policy yet privately admits the truth of the charge. A decorated Navy pilot who fought a world war and closed out a cold one, he is thoughtful about the horrors of armed conflict but lets slip a moralizing militarism that feels more 43 than 41. Remembered as awkward and out of touch, here Bush can be emotional, self-aware, even funny. Most revealing, the candidate and president who couldn't nail down the ""vision thing"" displays in his writing a clearer worldview than he gets credit for - one in which leadership, America's and his own, is not a means but its own end. Bush, who passed away Friday at 94, had a vision. He just had to look in a mirror to find it. When Bush was preparing to accept the Republican presidential nomination in 1988, he sent his speechwriter a list of notions that he believed best represented him. ""Words I like: family, loyalty, kids, freedom, grandkids, caring, love, heart, decency, faith, honor, service to country, pride, fair (fair play), tolerance, strength, hope, healing kindness, excellence ... I like people; I'm proud of USA; I like sports; I'm experienced; I love kids."" Yes, he likes kids so much he mentions them twice. This jumble exemplifies Bush's difficulty in conveying his personal values and political project, a condition he both disputes and acknowledges in his writings. ""The criticism was off-base,"" Bush complains of the coverage he received during his 1980 presidential bid. But even as vice president, he can't really explain, beyond banalities, why he seeks the top job. ""I want to see an educated America,"" he writes in a November 1986 diary entry. He also wanted to see an America that was literate, drug-free, employed, peaceful and focused on family values. ""But, how do you say all these things and get it into a slogan or a formula - a catch-all. I don't know."" Bush received frequent letters from voters complaining about his speaking style, and when his phrases prove memorable - ""voodoo economics"" or ""read my lips"" - he wishes they hadn't. What is mushy on the stump, however, becomes sharper with Bush in action. In ""A World Transformed,"" Bush and Scowcroft explain their thinking during the end of the Cold War, the Tiananmen crisis, Desert Storm and the Soviet collapse. ""While there were dramatic moments, epitomized by the opening of the Berlin Wall, perhaps the most important story is that they came largely (BEGIN ITAL)without(END ITAL) great drama,"" they write. The framework for Bush's foreign policy ""was very deliberate: encouraging, guiding, and managing change without provoking backlash and crackdown."" Bush was ""no drama"" before Obama. As president, his overriding concern is the affirmation of American strength. ""My own thoughts were focused on putting the United States back out in front, leading the West as we tackled the challenges in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union,"" Bush writes of the earliest days of his presidency. And though he had difficulty making the public case for military action in the Persian Gulf - ""I am not good at that,"" he said when people encouraged him to deliver FDR-style fireside chats on the war - in private he stated it forthrightly. ""Saddam Hussein will get out of Kuwait, and the United States will have been the catalyst and the key in getting this done, and that is important,"" he dictates to his diary. ""Our role as a world leader will once again be reaffirmed."" Bush's sense of leadership was wrapped up in the presidency. Though he served in the House of Representatives and twice ran for the Senate, he didn't much like the legislative branch, where ""there are a lot of weirdos who have all sorts of crazy ideas,"" as he confided to Margaret Thatcher. The fall of 1990, when Bush dueled with a Democratic majority over his Mideast military buildup and the federal budget, ""became one of the frustrating periods of my presidency,"" he writes. ""I knew that there were some areas of genuine disagreement with members of Congress over policy, but I thought the budget and the Persian Gulf should not be among them."" Consider that. Lawmakers can disagree with the president - just not on matters of federal spending or military force.

This mix of duty and arrogance surfaces throughout his career. Bush's posts are so brief - two terms as a congressman from Texas, two years as ambassador to the United Nations, less than two years as Republican National Committee chairman, 14 months as China envoy, one year as CIA director - that they feel like bullet points on a predestined presidential résumé. He goes to China to nail down foreign policy credentials ""that not many Republican politicians will have."" While in Beijing, he plots a possible campaign for governor of Texas in between tennis matches and stomach viruses. ""If the Texas Gov thing in '78 made any sense at all I'd maybe take a look at it hard,"" he writes to a Washington friend, ""keeping in mind that I wouldn't do it unless there was a possibility of taking a shot at something bigger in '80."" And when President Gerald Ford offers him the CIA director job, Bush worries he is being frozen out of veep consideration in 1976. ""Could (BEGIN ITAL)that(END ITAL) be what was happening?"" he wonders in his diary. ""Bury Bush at the CIA?"" His top suspect, White House chief of staff Donald Rumsfeld, denied any scheming, Bush recalls, and ""I accepted his word."" (Reminder: ""I accepted his word"" is Washington-speak for ""I can't prove he's lying."") But when Jimmy Carter defeated Ford in 1976, even the president-elect foresaw Bush's continued ascent. Among his final acts as CIA chief, Bush briefed Carter. In ""Looking Forward,"" Bush recalls that when a colleague began outlining national security challenges that could arise by the mid-1980s, Carter held up his hand. ""I don't need to worry about that,"" he said with a smile. ""By then George will be president and he can take care of it."" Bush has the grace - or false modesty - to express bewilderment. ""(BEGIN ITAL)George will be president?(END ITAL) It was an odd statement, coming from Jimmy Carter,"" he writes. ""I wondered what he meant."" I'm pretty sure Bush knew. At key moments, Bush's progress came thanks to the wealth and connections of his family - from his uncle Herbie Walker, who provided money and expertise to help young George start an oil-lease business in Texas, to his father, Prescott Bush, a Wall Street executive who served for a decade as a U.S. senator from Connecticut. George Bush availed himself of these advantages, though with some ambivalence. ""I am not sure I want to capitalize completely on the benefits I received at birth,"" he writes to a friend shortly before graduating from Yale University. ""Doing well merely because I have had the opportunity to attend the same debut parties as some of my customers, does not appeal to me."" Who knew privilege-checking was around in 1948? Yet using public service to ease a wealthy conscience is a Bush family tradition. ""I knew what motivated him,"" Bush writes of his father's decision to run for the Senate. ""He'd made his mark in the business world. Now he felt he had a debt to pay."" Speaking at a 1997 alumni reunion of the Greenwich Country Day School, which Bush had attended during the Great Depression, he decried the ""elite editorialists"" who had argued that a man like him couldn't relate to ordinary Americans. ""You know what the critics missed? They missed 'values' ... Our parents taught us to care - and the faculty here seemed to be intent on inculcating into us the fact that we had an obligation to care."" At times, Bush struggled to balance another obligation - political self-preservation - against these more civic-minded imperatives. As GOP chairman during the final months of Watergate (a ""political nightmare,"" he calls it) Bush was conflicted between loyalty to his president and the pangs of his conscience, though it is hard to miss more political considerations. Eight days before President Richard Nixon announced his departure, Bush was strategizing with White House Chief of Staff Alexander Haig about the best timing for the move, suggesting that Nixon should leave before the midterms, thus avoiding a ""bigger bath"" for Republican candidates. ""I told Haig I didn't feel that political expediency should be a consideration for resignation,"" Bush assures in his diary, then adding: ""But it was hard to discount politics."" Only on the eve of Nixon's resignation speech did Bush send a letter urging the president to step down - a missive directed as much to the history books as to White House. He relied on it later when he became CIA director under Ford. ""I am confident the record will reveal I spoke out over and over again against Watergate,"" he writes to a Time magazine reporter. ""I did, however, stop short of condemning the President until the final tape proved to me that he had been lying. At that point I urged him to resign."" Always take the high road, Bush admonishes. ""Jugular politics - going for the opposition's throat - wasn't my style,"" he writes. So after going negative against Sen. Bob Dole in the 1988 Republican primary race, Bush insists that he did so ""against my better judgment."" He congratulates himself for refraining from ""red meat""speeches against Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, omitting mention of the attempts to link the Democratic nominee to Willie Horton, a convicted murderer who committed further violent crimes while on a Massachusetts weekend furlough. ""By the time we're finished, they're going to wonder whether Willie Horton is Dukakis' running mate,"" Bush campaign manager Lee Atwater infamously said. Bush's only admission of anything untoward appears in a footnote describing Atwater's tactics: ""He was young, aggressive (some people would say ruthless), and brilliant at politics."" And Bush brilliantly, some would say ruthlessly, averted his eyes. Bush is less self-serving, more circumspect, when it comes to war. As a young naval aviator, he was shot down on a bombing run against Japanese installations in the Pacific; his two crewmates died. ""I still don't understand the 'logic' of war - why some survive and others are lost in their prime,"" Bush reflects in a letter to his parents written aboard the USS Finback, the submarine that rescued him from his lifeboat.

Bush's careful attitude toward foreign policy and national security became evident when the Berlin Wall fell and reporters wondered why the new president's mood was not more celebratory. ""Of course, I was thankful about the events in Berlin,"" he later writes, ""but as I answered questions my mind kept racing over a possible Soviet crackdown, turning all the happiness to tragedy."" Much, too, has been made of Bush's restraint at the end of the Persian Gulf War, when he did not march toward Baghdad because, as he explains in ""A World Transformed,"" he worried about embarking upon ""an unwinnable urban guerrilla war [that] could only plunge that part of the world into even greater instability."" In a diary entry from the fall of 1990, Bush notes that ""my wartime experience does condition me as commander-in-chief and makes me cautious."" The contrast with George W. Bush, who invaded Iraq a dozen years later, is stark, and distinctions are easy to draw between the levelheaded father and reckless son. But as the elder Bush built the coalition to oust Iraq from Kuwait, his case also became more strident than sober. ""I began to move from viewing Saddam's aggression exclusively as a dangerous strategic threat and an injustice to its reversal as a moral crusade,"" he wrote. ""It was good versus evil, right versus wrong."" When Soviet premier Mikhail Gorbachev suggested that the international community should not back Hussein into a corner, Bush replied, ""If we had offered Hitler some way out, would it have succeeded?"" Writing in ""A World Transformed,"" Scowcroft recalls worrying that Bush was becoming ""emotionally involved"" in the crisis and that the president risked making it seem like a vendetta against Iraq's leader. It wasn't quite axis-of-evil stuff, but it was close. What grounded Bush's foreign policy, in part, was his ability to forge close relationships with other heads of state. ""I had known many of the current foreign leaders for years, often before they took office, and that would help strengthen trust."" He admires the forthrightness of French President François Mitterrand - ""when I would call him about difficult problems, he would give me a straight answer"" - whom he had buttered up during a visit to Kennebunkport. He regrets that he was never as close to Thatcher as Ronald Reagan had been. And his most significant connection was with Gorbachev. ""I liked the personal contact with Mikhail - I liked (BEGIN ITAL)him(END ITAL),"" Bush writes in his foreign policy volume. ""I thought I had a feel for his heartbeat."" (It was not the final time a President Bush would attempt to glimpse the soul of a Russian leader, a family tradition with uneven consequences.) At times Bush grew defensive about his personalistic approach to foreign policy. ""Some feel emphasis on personal relationships between leaders is unimportant or unnecessary,"" he writes. ""Henry Kissinger once argued to me that these are no substitutes for deep national interests ... For me, personal diplomacy and leadership went hand in hand."" Of course, this disagreement may have been personal, too. In his China diary, Bush unloads on Kissinger, calling him ""intolerable,"" ""nasty,"" ""regal"" and ""dictatorial."" Three decades later, in the preface to the published diary, Bush tries to take it back. ""When I finally did reread the diary, I was amused by some of my frustrations with then-Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, a man whom I greatly respect and consider a friend."" On this, let's accept Bush's word. So effective on the international stage, Bush's personal touch faltered at home. He knew it, and it annoyed him. ""The Libs charge that I am not interested in Domestic Policy,"" he writes in a 1991 letter to a friend in Texas. ""Wrong!!"" But in Bush's diary, his preferences are clear. In the early days of Operation Desert Shield, for example, he felt ""fully engrossed in this international crisis, and I must say I enjoy working on all the parts of it and I get into much more detail than I do on the domestic scene."" Bush expresses contempt for Washington politicking, for ""the posturing on both sides ... [people] putting their own selves ahead of the overall good."" He was confident that he embodied that overall good and that voters would recognize that. When he ran for re-election in 1992, Bush thought he would defeat Bill Clinton because he was the better person. ""He's better at facts-figures than I am,"" he writes to Peggy Noonan. ""I'm better at life."" No surprise, he resented the charge that he was aloof or disconnected - ""that I never stood for anything, that I didn't care about people,"" Bush writes to one of his brothers after the loss to Clinton. ""I stood for a lot of things on issues ... but what I want to have people know I stood for were 'Duty, Honor, Country' and yes, as Dad taught us, 'service.' That's not all bad."" His empathy emerged in small, forgotten moments and in dramatic ones, too. As a congressman from Texas, Bush voted for the Fair Housing Act in 1968, essentially reversing his earlier position on civil rights. He suffered through boos at a rally back home but insisted that ""a man should not have a door slammed in his face because he is a Negro or speaks with a Latin American accent."" At the end of the event, he received a standing ovation, and nearly two decades later, he wrote that nothing else he'd experienced in public life matched the feeling from that evening. Bush also recalls skipping Nixon's 1969 inauguration parade to attend President Lyndon Johnson's farewell at Andrews Air Force Base. ""This was a President who not many years before had moved through crowds with outstretched hands,"" Bush writes. ""But because of Vietnam, the cheering had stopped, and he was going back to Texas a defeated man. I shook his hand and wished him a safe journey. He nodded, took a few steps toward the ramp, then turned, looked back at me, and said, 'Thanks for coming.'"" And Bush had been vice president only a couple of months when John Hinckley Jr. shot Reagan. A military aide wanted to helicopter the vice president straight to the White House, but Bush insisted that they stop at his residence and then drive to 1600 Pennsylvania. As he explained to the perplexed aide, ""only the president lands on the South Lawn.""",1,https://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/ct-books-bush-memoir-20181203-story.html
64,Bush,George W.,newsone,"NewsOne Featured Video CLOSE

It had been a while since Joe Biden stuck his foot in his mouth, but he shattered that dry spell and then some on Monday when he offered some glowing words about former President George H.W. Bush during a speaking event at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas law school.

Bush, who died Friday, has been remembered as everything from a war hero to the architect of a “kinder, gentler and more colorful GOP.” That, despite the 41st president’s series of political missteps, especially when it came to Black people in particular. And while hyperbole is no stranger to posthumous recognition, it was still nonetheless strange to hear Biden suggest that Bush was the most decent president he ever served under.

“I’ve been there with eight presidents as an elected official and none had more class and a greater sense of decency than President Bush,” Biden, who was, by the way, Barack Obama‘s vice president, boldly declared on Monday.

Many users on social media took exception to the comment and construed it to be a direct shot at Obama, who just this past summer was ranked by the American public as the best president of their lives. George H.W. Bush came in at seventh on that list, falling behind names like Bill Clinton, Ronald Reagan and, yes, even Donald Trump.

Releasing statements that fawn over presidents who have died is par for the course in Washington; especially from someone who has admitted he still has presidential ambitions and just may be looking to garner support from moderate Republicans in 2020 with his words Monday.

But let’s be clear: Bush Sr. was guilty of such misdeeds that included nominating Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court and opposing the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which, as the New York Times reminded readers, “ended segregated lunch counters, restrooms, movie theaters and other public accommodations, and made employment discrimination illegal.

Nevermind Bush’s overtly racist TV commercial while running for president in 1988, or his disingenuous war on drugs, which he started by entrapping a Black teenager into selling drugs in a park across the street from the White House.

Twitter users demanded to know how any of that was classy or decent, to paraphrase Biden.",1,https://newsone.com/playlist/joe-biden-george-hw-bush-obama/
65,Bush,George W.,dfw,"HOUSTON (AP) — Former President George H.W. Bush will be honored during several public and private events in Houston and Washington before his burial Thursday in Texas.

Four days of events for Bush, who died Friday at age 94, include a state funeral at Washington’s National Cathedral, a private service at his longtime church in Houston and public viewings in both cities. He will be buried next to wife, Barbara, and their daughter, Robin, who died in 1953.

Here are details about the events:

TRANSPORT FROM HOUSTON TO WASHINGTON

Bush’s body will be transported by a motorcade Monday morning from a Houston funeral home to Ellington Field Joint Reserve Base, a Texas Air National Guard base. The casket will be loaded onto a plane during a departure ceremony scheduled to start at 10:30 a.m. CST and flown to Joint Base Andrews in Maryland.

Relatives accompanying the casket will include his sons, former President George W. Bush and Neil Bush, along with members of their immediate families. The rest of the Bush family is expected to be at Joint Base Andrews when the body arrives.

STATE FUNERAL IN WASHINGTON

In Washington, Bush will lie in state in the rotunda of the U.S. Capitol from Monday at 7:30 p.m. EST until Wednesday at 8:45 a.m. EST. His casket will be transported by motorcade Wednesday morning to the National Cathedral, where a state funeral will be held at 11 a.m. EST. President Donald Trump has indicated he and first lady Melania Trump will attend the state funeral.

Trump has said he plans to designate Wednesday as a national day of mourning.

RETURN TO HOUSTON

Following the service at the National Cathedral, Bush will be flown to Houston on Wednesday with a scheduled arrival of around 4:30 p.m. CST. His body will be transported by motorcade to St. Martin’s Episcopal Church, where he and his wife regularly worshipped. A public viewing of Bush’s casket will be held at the church from 6:45 p.m. CST on Wednesday until 6 a.m. CST on Thursday.\

On Thursday, a private funeral service with about 1,200 invited guests will be held at the church starting at 10 a.m. CST. After the hour-long service, a motorcade will transport Bush’s casket to a train station north of Houston, near the international airport named after Bush.

A ceremony will be held at the train station as Bush’s casket is loaded onto a Union Pacific train. The train will take about 2½ hours to travel roughly 70 miles (113 kilometers) to the city of College Station, home to Bush’s presidential library at Texas A&M University. The locomotive has been painted the colors of the Air Force One plane used during his presidency and bears the number “4141” in honor of the 41st president.

BURIAL IN COLLEGE STATION

The train is scheduled to arrive in College Station on Thursday around 3:45 p.m. CST. Bush’s casket will then be transported by motorcade to the presidential library, where he will be buried at the gated family plot near his wife and their daughter Robin, who died of leukemia at age 3. Barbara Bush died on April 17 at their Houston home. The couple was married for 73 years, longer than any other U.S. presidential couple.

Ceremonies at the presidential library will include a missing man formation flyover. The casket will then be rolled along a path through woods, over a bridge and over a creek for burial during a private graveside service with Bush’s family.

66,Bush,George W.,dfw,"Things have been pointing up for the University of North Texas football team since Seth Littrell became head coach three years ago. To prove that, the Mean Green are headed west after accepting an invitation to play in a bowl game for the third consecutive season.

The Mean Green will play Utah State in the New Mexico Bowl December 15 in Albuquerque.

The New Mexico Bowl appearance marks the eleventh bowl game in North Texas history.

The Mean Green have played in bowl games in each year of Seth Littrell’s tenure as head coach in Denton.

“We are excited to be playing in the New Mexico Bowl,” said UNT head coach Seth Littrell in a statement urging fans to attend the game. “Albuquerque is an easy travel destination for our fans and alumni, and I know this team is excited to play in front of a national audience on ESPN in the very first bowl game of the season. It will be a tremendous challenge but we are excited to get to work.”

UNT athletic director Wren Baker agreed.

“Coach Littrell, this coaching staff and these student-athletes have raised the level of expectations for this program,” said Baker. “Playing in our third consecutive bowl game is something everyone associated with this university should take pride in.”

The team wrapped up their second consecutive nine-win regular season under Littrell and people are taking notice of the success.

North Texas begins preparing for the New Mexico Bowl wondering if their head coach will still be with them. Littrell’s name has been linked to several head coaching vacancies in the last few weeks, with the most recent being the Kansas State job after Bill Snyder announced his retirement.

Utah State lost their head coach Matt Wells to Texas Tech, replacing the fired Kliff Kingsbury. The Aggies have named Frank Maile as their interim head coach

Regardless of who is coaching the two teams, the New Mexico Bowl will mark the eighth meeting between North Texas and Utah State. USU owns a 4-3 advantage in the series, with the last meeting coming in 2004, when the Mean Green defeated the Aggies 31-23.",1,https://dfw.cbslocal.com/2018/12/02/unt-will-face-utah-state-in-their-3rd-consecutive-bowl-game/

68,Bush,George W.,dfw,"(AP)- Georgia was oh-so-close to knocking off top-ranked Alabama in the Southeastern Conference championship game and earning a spot in the College Football Playoff.

Instead, the Bulldogs must settle for an intriguing matchup against Texas in the Sugar Bowl on New Year’s Day in New Orleans. It’s the first time the powerhouse programs have played since squaring off in the Cotton Bowl on Jan. 2, 1984.

Georgia (11-2, 7-1 SEC) is led by D’Andre Swift and Elijah Holyfield, an impressive tandem of running backs who have combined for nearly 2,000 yards on the ground this season. The Bulldogs’ only two losses were to LSU during the regular season, and the 35-28 loss to the Tide on Saturday.

Texas (9-4, 7-2) enjoyed a breakout regular season and has a chance to win 10 games for the first time since 2009. The Longhorns lost to Oklahoma on Saturday in the Big 12 championship game.

Here are some other things to know about the Georgia-Texas matchup in the Sugar Bowl:

EHLINGER’S BIG TARGETS

Texas sophomore Sam Ehlinger has had an excellent year, throwing for 3,123 yards, 25 touchdowns and just five interceptions. His two favorite targets are Lil’Jordan Humphrey (6-foot-4, 225 pounds) and Collin Johnson (6-6, 220), who have the size and speed to potentially give Georgia problems.

WATCH FOR OMENIHU

Georgia’s defense will need to keep its eyes on defensive lineman Charles Omenihu, who was an All-Big 12 selection after making 16 tackles for a loss, including 9½ sacks. The 6-6, 275-pound junior could create issues for Georgia quarterback Jake Fromm, who does many things well but is not considered a particularly mobile quarterback.

FABULOUS FROMM

Fromm isn’t often mentioned among the nation’s elite quarterbacks, but against Alabama in the SEC championship he showed he can put up big numbers against an excellent defense. Fromm completed 25 of 39 passes for 301 yards and three touchdowns against the Tide.

SMART VS. HERMAN

Georgia’s Kirby Smart and Texas’ Tom Herman are widely considered some of the nation’s top young coaches. Smart has a 32-9 overall record during his three seasons at Georgia, including back-to-back appearances in the SEC championship game and an appearance in last year’s College Football Playoff title game. Herman is 16-10 in his second season with the Longhorns, including a 12-6 mark in Big 12 regular season games.

IN THE SUGAR BOWL

This is the 10th time Georgia has played in the Sugar Bowl and the first appearance since 2008, when it beat Hawaii 41-10. The Longhorns are back at the Sugar Bowl for just the fourth time and its first appearance since losing to Virginia Tech in the 1995 game.

70,Bush,George W.,dfw,"(AP) – Faced with a tricky choice, the College Football Playoff selection committee fell back on some simple criteria: One loss is better than two. Winning a conference championship is better than not. Go with the team that didn’t get blown out.

Oklahoma is in the playoff, moving into the fourth and final spot Sunday after avenging its only loss by winning the Big 12 championship against Texas.

“I feel like we have a team worthy of it, a team that can go make a run,” Sooners coach Lincoln Riley said on ESPN.

The Sooners (12-1) will face No. 1 Alabama (13-0) in the Orange Bowl on Dec. 29 in a matchup of Heisman Trophy front-runner quarterbacks — Kyler Murray of Oklahoma and the Tide’s Tua Tagovailoa, who sprained his ankle in the Southeastern Conference championship game Saturday and is expected to miss at least two weeks.

No. 2 Clemson (13-0) plays No. 3 Notre Dame (12-0) in the Cotton Bowl on the same day. The winners meet in the championship game on Jan. 7 in Santa Clara, California.

Georgia (11-2) dropped a spot to fifth and Ohio State (12-1) remained sixth in the selection committee’s final top 25 released Sunday. The Bulldogs lost to Alabama in the Southeastern Conference championship game Saturday while the Buckeyes won the Big Ten championship against Northwestern.

“In the end, one-loss conference champion with their only loss being on a neutral field to a ranked team, which they avenged in their conference championship,” selection committee chairman Rob Mullens said on ESPN. “Every combination was vetted, looking at their full body of work, their resumes side-by-side. In the end, what we decided was amongst the group of three, Oklahoma, Georgia, Ohio State, the committee voted that no one was unequivocally better than the other so then we leaned on the protocol. So we went with the one-loss conference champion.”

Selection committee protocol states conference championships work as a virtual tiebreaker when teams are close. The Sooners beat Texas for the Big 12 title on Saturday, paying back a three-point loss in October in Dallas in the Red River Rivalry game.

Oklahoma is making its third appearance in the five-year-old playoff. Defending national champion Alabama has played in them all. Clemson is making its fourth straight appearance. Notre Dame is in the playoff for the first time, making it 10 teams in five seasons to participate in the playoff. Unbeaten UCF finished eighth in the final rankings, nowhere to be found in the committee’s playoff discussion. The Knights will take their 25-game winning streak to a marquee bowl game, probably the Fiesta Bowl. The rest of the New Year’s Six bowl pairings were to be announced later Sunday.

The debate leading up to championship Saturday was whether Oklahoma or Ohio State might take the fourth spot if Alabama beat Georgia.

The wild card was Georgia beating the mighty Tide, which could have meant two SEC teams for the second straight season. Instead, the Bulldogs lost but played well enough to allow coach Kirby Smart to make that case that Georgia should remain in the top four. Smart told reporters after the SEC title game to ask Alabama coach Nick Saban which team he would like to avoid in the playoff? Saban, of course, endorsed his former defensive coordinator and conference-mate.

The committee didn’t buy it and stayed with the one consistent data point throughout the five years of playoff selections: No team with more than one loss has ever made the playoff. Of the 20 teams that have been selected, only two have not won a conference title.

For the second straight season, two of the Power Five conferences were left out and for the second straight season it was the Big Ten and Pac-12. Ohio State was the first team out last season and again appears to have gotten squeezed because of a lopsided loss to an unranked team. The Buckeyes were blown out by Purdue in October, similar to the way they lost at Iowa in 2017.

The Pac-12 was never really in the discussion, with its champion Washington finishing 10-3.

Georgia had both two losses and a blowout loss (at LSU, by 20 in October). The Bulldogs have been rolling since and had Alabama on the ropes before the Tide erased a 14-point deficit. The Bulldogs proved they could hang against the best, but it was not enough.

Oklahoma has had defensive issues all season, but its offense has been virtually unstoppable.

72,Bush,George W.,inquisitr,"Demi Lovato is fighting to move forward with her life after her ongoing battle with drug addiction. Not only is she taking the personal steps to take back her life, she's also making financial decisions to ensure she doesn't look back. According to the Blast, Demi Lovato has been trying relentlessly to sell her home.

It has been reported that the ""Sorry Not Sorry"" singer has been struggling to sell the pricey pad, which was previously listed with an asking price of $8,995,000. Demi Lovato originally purchased the 4-bed, 6-bath home in September of 2016, but shortly after closing on the home, she overdosed on meth and nearly died there. Because of the harrowing memories, the singer's view of the home has been tainted. She's reportedly relocated to a live-in rehab facility and has not returned to Los Angeles since the life altering incident.

On November 30, Demi Lovato removed the active real estate listing for the home, replacing it with a rental advertisement. Now, she's attempting to rent the home for $39,500 per month. Although the singer is likely losing money because the house hasn't sold, insiders close to Demi Lovato has no interest in returning to the home. During Demi's recovery, her mother Dianna De La Garza released a statement to News Max TV about the progress her daughter had made. However, at the time it was unclear whether or not she'd be returning to the home.

""I can honestly say today that she is doing really well. She's happy, she's healthy. She's working on her sobriety, and she's getting the help she needs, and that in itself encourages me about her future and about the future of our family.""

The latest new follows a string of reports about Demi Lovato's battle with drug addiction. When Demi appeared on Good Morning America in March of this year, she opened up about her battle with drug addiction and her six years of sobriety.She admitted the one of the most challenging aspects of recovery is actually admitting that there is a problem. ""I think that the very first thing you have to do is admit that you have a problem and then you have to ask for help,"" Lovato said on GMA in March. ""You also have to know that it's possible. One of the reasons why I've stayed sober is because I want people to know that it is possible for you to get help and to recover.""",1,https://www.inquisitr.com/5190608/demi-lovato-reportedly-struggling-to-sell-home-refuses-to-return-following-overdose/

74,Bush,George W.,inquisitr,"Last Friday, President Trump said that he ""doesn't believe"" the report of the catastrophic impact of climate change on the U.S. economy that was released by his own administration, according to ABC News. Some observers were initially perplexed that the president would deny a report that was created by his own administration, but the fact is that President Trump didn't have a choice in the matter. That's because nearly thirty years ago, President George H.W. Bush established the environmental impact program first envisioned during the Reagan administration that was signed into law by Congress in 1990, as reported by Forbes.

President Bush, who made a fortune in the oil industry before following in his father's footsteps as a U.S. Congressman in the 1960s, and would later bear the burden of the nation's secrets as the Director of the CIA, was in line with President Reagan's concerns about climate change. Recently released memos from the Bush administration detail a growing concern with the global phenomenon.

According to the Hill, Acting Assistant Secretary of State Richard J. Smith sent a memo to Secretary of State James Baker in 1989 that read, ""Global climate change is the most far reaching environmental issue of our time. If the climate change within the range of current predictions actually occurs, the consequences for every nation and every aspect of human activity will be profound. As you yourself stated we cannot wait until all the uncertainties have been resolved before we act to limit greenhouse gas emissions and to prepare for whatever climate change we are already committed to.""

According to The National Security Archive at George Washington University, both the Reagan and Bush administrations believed in the importance of climate change action.

In connection with the Montreal Protocol (negotiated in 1987 and put into effect in 1989), both Reagan and Bush 41 showed a clear desire to tackle environmental concerns and to lead the global community in that effort, according to the documents. Protests by the Domestic Policy Council, led by Attorney General Edwin Meese, and other agency heads led Reagan to step in to ensure adoption of the final set of U.S. objectives for the treaty. Bush basically shared his predecessor's views on entering office in January 1989. Both presidents' secretaries of state, George P. Shultz and James A. Baker III, played key roles in blocking efforts by other Cabinet secretaries to frustrate implementation of more environmentally friendly policies. For example, memos for senior State Department officials in today's posting note that ""Global climate change is the most far reaching environmental issue of our time"" and that notwithstanding the need for continued research, ""We simply cannot wait – the costs of inaction will be too high.""

[... direct] the President to establish an interagency United States Global Change Research Program to improve understanding of global change. Requires the Chairman of the Council, through the Committee, to develop a National Global Change Research Plan for implementation of the Program. Sets forth required Plan contents and research elements, including that the Plan provide recommendations for collaboration within the Federal Government and among nations.

[... requires] the Council, at least every four years, through the Committee, to submit to the President and the Congress an assessment regarding the findings of the Program and associated uncertainties, the effects of global change, and current and major long-term trends in global change.

President Bush established the U.S. Global Change Research Program in 1989 via a Presidential Initiative, and Congress enacted the Global Change Research Act in 1990. The key aspects of the law...The directive that established the climate report that President Trump currently opposes is found in another section of the law which...In a bipartisan show of solidarity largely unseen in today's political climate, the Global Change Research Act was passed unanimously in the Senate. Senator Ernest ""Fritz"" Hollings (D-South Carolina), upon the passage of the Act, said ""The problem we face is potentially enormous. Global warming could radically change world climate and world agriculture … We need a determined and coordinated research effort, both here in the United States and with other nations, to get the facts about the exact causes and consequences of global change. For our children and grandchildren, now is the time to start that effort.""

In a 1988 campaign speech from Boston Harbor, Bush declared ""Those who think we are powerless to do anything about the greenhouse effect are forgetting about the White House effect. As president, I intend to do something about it."" Unlike other more famous campaign promises Bush made that year, this was one that President Bush kept, and is a positive reflection on his complicated legacy.",1,https://www.inquisitr.com/5190507/climate-change-report-that-trump-denies-was-established-by-george-h-w-bush/
75,Bush,George W.,inquisitr,"Adonis Stevenson, the 41-year-old Haitian-born Canadian boxing star who reigned as World Boxing Council light heavyweight champion since defeating American Chad Dawson on June 8 of 2013, per BoxRec, remained in critical condition in a Quebec hospital on Sunday morning after suffering a brutal knockout loss to Ukrainian challenger Oleksandr Gvozdy on Saturday night at Videotron Centre in Quebec City.

The fight was broadcast on Showtime Championship Boxing as part of the run-up to the Deontay Wilder vs. Tyson Fury heavyweight title fight later that night in Los Angeles, as Inquisitr reported.

Stevenson, who had previously lost only one fight — and not since 2010 — took a flurry of hard punches from the undefeated (16-0) Ukrainian — who is 10 years Stevenson's junior — in the final seconds of the 11th round of their title bout. ""In the 11th, Gvozdyk swarmed and landed a hard right hand that snapped Stevenson's head back and sent him reeling to a corner, where Gvozdyk finished him with a power punch that sent Stevenson crumpling to the canvas,"" the Los Angeles Times reported in its description of the knockout, which came with 13 seconds remaining in the round.

While Stevenson was stretchered out of the arena and taken to a nearby hospitably ambulance, the extent of his injuries were not immediately evident, according to an account by Britain's Daily Mail.

Watch the brutal 11th round knockout in the Stevenson-Gvozdyk fight in the video below, courtesy of Showtime Championship Boxing. At about 2:30 a.m. local time, approximately five hours after the fight ended, Stevenson's promoter Yvon Michel released a statement revealing that the boxer was in the intensive care unit.

""The family of Adonis and Yvon Michel are currently with Adonis Stevenson. They want to inform friends and supporters that Adonis is currently in critical condition in intensive care, at the hospital, following his fight against Oleksander Gvozdyk,"" Michel said in the statement, according to Boxing Scene. ""They appreciate the concern and support of everyone. There will be no further comments at this time and they respectfully request your understanding in their desire to stay private.""

The World Boxing Council also sent a message to Stevenson, via Twitter.

The WBC and boxing community from the world join in prayers for the safe recovery of our dear friend, great fighter and exemplary human being @AdonisSuperman . May God provide the strength to overcome this unfortunate set back. — World Boxing Council (@WBCBoxing) December 2, 2018

With the knockout, Stevenson lost his title and Gvozdyk, who trains out of the Boxing Lab gym in Oxnard, California, walked away with the WBC Light Heavyweight belt. Before Gvozdyk erupted with his 11th-round flurry, the WBC title fight had been even, with one judge recording a 95-95 scorecard at the time of the KO.

Stevenson had stunned Gvozdyk with a right hand in the 10th round, but the younger fighter came back to land the combination that weakened Stevenson, leading to the 11th-round knockout.",1,https://www.inquisitr.com/5190575/light-heavyweight-champ-adonis-stevenson-critical-condition/
76,Bush,George W.,houstonchronicle,"This opinion piece was originally published July 28, 1963, in the Houston Chronicle's Outlook section. In anticipation of an active election season, the newspaper asked the chairmen of the Harris County Republican and Democratic parties what to expect.

For decades, Democrats had a firm grip on Texas politics. But Republican John Tower's election to the Senate in 1961 gave the GOP hope that Texas would become a ""two-party"" state. The following year, the Chronicle said ""Republicans are making their strongest bid in Texas history to elect both state-wide and local officers.""

By this time, George H.W. Bush was president of Zapata Offshore Co. and chairman of the Harris County Republican Party. More than a month after this was published, he would announce his candidacy for U.S. Senate against incumbent Ralph Yarborough. Though unsuccessful, it put him on the path of public service that would eventually lead him to the White House.

This is the political climate Bush found himself in ahead of the 1964 election season. -- J.R. Gonzales

***

The Republican Party of Harris County stands at one of the most challenging crossroads in its history. The way we move during the next two years may well determine the fate of a two-party Texas; for if in 1963 or 1964 we elect Republicans to office in Harris County, there can be little question of the inevitability of a state-wide movement to the Republican party.

On the other hand, if we fail to capitalize on the advances already made in such places as Dallas and Midland, then it might be argued that the Republican victories have been freakish and that Texas is not yet ready to part from its traditional place in the one-party South.

Where do we now stand in Harris County -- what are our strengths and weaknesses? Right now, from an organizational standpoint, the party is stronger than the general public might think -- but weaker than we should be.

We now have the most dedicated and strongest political organization in Harris County. Our party is young, philosophically united, eager and willing to work hard. We are afflicted by some dry-martini critics who talk but don't work. We also have the problem of the downtown businessman who thinks Republican, votes Republican, occasionally gives quietly Republican, but for ""political"" reasons won't identify as a Republican. I am convinced the latter problem can be overcome by electing Republicans.

It is much more respectable to be a Republican in Texas today than it was five years ago. If Jack Cox were governor and Ross Baker and Des Barry were in Congress, it would be quite acceptable to be publicly identified as a Republican. [In 1962, Cox lost to Democrat John Connally in the race for Texas governor. Ross Baker unsuccessfully ran against incumbent U.S. Rep. Bob Casey, a conservative Democrat, for the 22nd congressional district post. And Desmond Barry lost to Dallas' Joe Pool for an at-large congressional seat. -- JR] Add to these a Republican mayor or county judge (we strongly believe that Republicans should compete for office at all levels of government) and I'm convinced Houston would become and would remain a great Republican stronghold.

Our ""liberal"" opponents continually harp on two areas of criticism against the Republican party: First, they attempt to present us as racists. The Republican party of Harris County is not a racist party. We have not presented our story to the Negroes in the county. Our failure to attract the Negro voter has not been because of a racist philosophy; rather it has been a product of our not having had the organization to tackle all parts of the county.

Negroes highly receptive to GOP

Now we are on the move in this area and we are finding the Negroes highly receptive. For too long they have succumbed to the dictates and promises of some Democratic prophet who vanishes a day or two after election day. When the Negro community votes approximately 29,000 to 1,000 for Joe Pool over Des Barry, it is evident to any thinking person ""someone is being had.""

We are now appealing to the Negro vote not with promises of more and more federal programs or charity. We believe in the basic premise that an individual Negro surrenders the very dignity and freedom he is struggling for when he accepts money for his vote or when he goes along with the bloc vote dictates of some Democrat boss who couldn't care less about the quality of candidates he is pushing.

We have a tough row to hoe here, but what we are proposing is so obviously right that when we say, ""Look at the candidates, then decide for whom to vote,"" this rightness inspires zeal and enthusiasm.

Our second area of vulnerability in the eyes of our opponents is so-called ""extremism."" I think the left-wingers' dedication to discussing right-wing extremists in the Republican party is some psychological defensive reaction to the difficulty they have in defending the inherent weaknesses in their own cause -- as exemplified by the Ban-the-Bomb types, the Americans for Democratic Action.

Wherever one goes in so-called liberal circles, there is a great clatter of discussion about Republican extremists. (Parkinson might develop a helpful formula for this: The concern of the left-winger on this matter is directly related to his degree of his left-wingism.)

The Republican party of Harris County is not an extremist party -- and for this I am glad. In our zeal to free the individual from government control, in our eagerness to see our country stand up to the menace of world communism, and in our fervor to preserve our great economic system, we must not scrap our Bill of Rights.

There is no place in our party organization for the cowardly unsigned ""hate"" letter, the anonymous telephone call, the ""branding"" of one's fellow man for his unwillingness to conform to the brander's every ideological point. We have spoken out and will continue to speak out against this type of behavior whether it be in our party, in the Democratic party, or the Communist party.

The Republican party in Harris County and in Texas will have a challenging opportunity in 1964. In my opinion, the Democrat conventions and the Democrat primaries are going to show clearly that ""conservative Democrats"" no longer have a party. Today, as I go around our county, it's not the conservative Democrats we run into in our organizational work -- it is the left-wing Democrats -- the so-called ""liberal"" Democrats. These are the people who are working and working hard at political organization.

Conservative? You belong with us

Last year's vote for governor set the pattern for the conventions. The left-wing Democrats are in the saddle and they're riding hard. Four to six years ago, when Republicans ran for office, the war cry ""downtown"" was, ""Your Republicans are fouling up 'conservatism' for Texas."" Now, however, though some may still feel this way, many are coming to realize that the Republican party is the only hope for the voter who believes in freedom from strong federal control, in fiscal responsibility, and in the individual's right to manage his own affairs.

I believe Sen. Ralph Yarborough will be unbeatable in next year's Democratic primary no matter who opposes him. But in the general election, I am certain he will be defeated. Sen. Yarborough presents a strong case for the left-wingers in Texas. There is no question as to where he stands. For the most part, he is diametrically opposed to the things we Republicans believe in.

More and more this will prove to be the case in the Democratic party and as it develops, as other candidates philosophically aligned with Sen. Yarborough gain prominence, the Republican party will grow. Sen. Yarborough's thinking does not represent the views of a majority of Texans -- if, indeed, of even an appreciable minority, but he will win his primary because of political organization.

One last comment on the question of the two-party state. The traditional ""conservative"" Democrat often defends his precarious position of remaining in a left-wing controlled party in Harris County, Texas by saying ""Well, there's no difference between the two parties nationally"" or ""Look at Rockefeller or Javits"" or ""Look what Eisenhower spent in 1958.""

My answer to these comments is, ""Look at the record."" Certainly, Rockefeller and Javits are to the left of some Democratic senators; yes Eisenhower proposed a whopping program in 1958 -- generously supplemented, I might add, by a spendthrift Democrat-controlled Congress.

But politics is neither all fish nor all fowl. There is an ideological overlap between some Republicans and some Democrats, but an objective analysis of the votes in the Senate and House over the years will clearly reveal that the Republican party is the party of individual liberty and fiscal responsibility and the Democratic party is the party of fiscal irresponsibility and the trend towards socialism. This is not to say that some realignment is not necessary to make the distinction even more clear.

As conservative Democrats in the South seek vainly for the now-extinct party of their ancestors, the ideological lines become much more clear. The Republican party at its National Convention can accomplish much for all Americans through furtherance of this realignment by offering its presidential nomination to a leader who leaves no doubt as to his position on the basic question of the role of the Federal Government in the lives of the people. I personally am strongly in favor of offering the voters a clear-cut choice.

One final problem which plagues us locally is the ""label"" problem. It plagues the Democrats, too. The words ""Conservative"" and ""Liberal"" are vastly overworked and distorted completely beyond their original meanings. In the Negro community, the word ""Conservative"" is a dirty word. It doesn't mean economic conservatism -- not spending more than you take in, as it should. It doesn't mean an economic system free from government controls, as it should. It means only one thing: ""Segregation!"" This is false -- at least, in the Republican party.

In other areas, the same thing holds true. ""Conservative"" means one thing to one person and something else to another. Too often, people working every day in a political organization, are inclined to overlook the fact that the way to win elections is to attract and secure votes. We must have in our party a united philosophy, but we must avoid at all costs delineating such a narrow party line that we appeal only to a narrow segment of voters.

I decry the tendency on the part of some few party people of both parties to say, in effect, ""If you don't agree with me on every single issue, then you aren't a member of MY party"" -- be it Republican or Democrat. Zealots without political maturity finish second at election time. This is no plea for spinelessness on issues. It is a plea for responsible political behavior.

We're building at the grass roots

My job as Harris County Republican chairman is an organizational job. We plan to continue the building of a strong grass roots organization, precinct by precinct, composed of people who will canvass, get out the vote, and raise money for candidates. We Republicans will have more active primaries and it is here that Republicans will battle Republicans.

But when the primaries are over, we will join together to win the general elections. I am a strong believer in a two-party system. My belief precludes any interest whatsoever in a third-party movement or a Dixiecrat splinter group. The way to be effective politically is to work within one of the major parties -- Republican or Democrat -- even if one doesn't get all his preferred candidates all the time.

There will be much at stake in 1964. People are tired of the one-party government. Necessary reform at all levels government is becoming more and more essential. There is no better instrument to reduce graft and incompetency than to have a strong party competing for offices at all levels. The theory of organized ""local"" opposition is a good one. It will work just as well at the courthouse level as at the White House level.

It's exciting to be a Republican in Harris County, Texas today. The inevitability of our victory is clear. One only has to graph the vast Republican strides made at the polls over the last 10 years to see the picture. Our party is not without its problems, but we are relatively united, we are energetic and dedicated to a political philosophy which is strong because it places a basic trust in the people and in our Constitution. If we act responsibility, if we make a principled appeal to all voters, and if we continue our program of basic political organization, we cannot help but become the dominant force in Texas politics.

This, then, is our challenge and Texas' opportunity. We are prepared to meet our responsibilities and I believe Texans in Harris County are prepared to defend their Constitutional rights through the Republican party.",1,https://www.houstonchronicle.com/local/bayou-city-history/article/In-his-own-words-Bush-and-the-Harris-County-GOP-13437473.php
77,Bush,George W.,mailchi,"This is our new occasional feature: The Sunday Long Thread. If there’s a Twitter thread you’d like to see featured in this space, please let us know editors@sundaylongread.com.



This is how I met President George H.W. Bush. He wrote me a fan later saying he loved one of my thrillers, and could I sign a copy? Of course, I sent him a book. When we finally met, he spent the first ten minutes trying to convince my wife that he invented the phrase “You da Man.”



She actually believed it — until Mrs. Bush started yelling: “Stop teasing the poor girl!” From there, I told him I was researching a book about the life of a former President.



He quickly invited me to spend a week in Houston, with unprecedented access to him and Mrs. Bush. What did I learn? That he was one of the most decent and honorable people I’d ever encountered. He loved his family, loved his sports, and believed deeply in the power of service.



I learned even more when I spoke to the Secret Service. Make no mistake, they don’t love everyone they protect. But President Bush? Over and over, they told the same story: That he always knew them by name, and always asked about their kids and families and hobbies.



He was the most powerful man in the world, but he always took time to treat you like a human being. Especially today, that level of kindness and class is a rare thing. It never left him. Over the years, we had so many adventures and laughs.



He invited me to a private lunch upstairs in the White House, and showed us everything from the secret passages to the Lincoln bedroom. But one of my most cherished memories of him? When I asked him about his plane crashing in WWII.



He was a 22-year-old pilot, yelling to his crew, signaling for them to bail out of the smoking plane. “Hit the silk! Hit the silk!“ He knew what would happen if they were captured: they’d be tortured and executed. The plane was a fireball, falling from the sky.



Still, he was determined to save his crewmen, John Delaney and Ted White. As the plane was going down, he turned it purposely to take the air pressure off the crew’s door. He did that to give them a better chance to survive and get out first. When his parachute opened too early,



George Bush’s head rammed into the bomber’s tail. When he landed, he was bleeding, vomiting, crying. He’d just survived a burning plane crash. His crewmates, despite all his actions, didn’t. Those crewmates didn’t just give their lives. They gave him a reason to appreciate living. It was a gift George Bush never forgot. The last time I saw him was a few weeks back as we honored Mrs. Bush. I’ll save that story for another day.

But of all the photos I have with him, this is the one I love most, him grabbing my hand with all that strength. Still gets me every time. Oh, and right now? You know what Mrs Bush just said to him? “What took you so long?” Sir, you really were the Man. #RIPGeorgeBush",1,https://mailchi.mp/sundaylongread/the-sunday-long-read-with-martin?e=ec0053d15a

Bush founded Points of Light, a nonprofit organization that inspires people to take action around the world.

Our founder President @GeorgeHWBush was a kind, compassionate and humble man; a leader who believed in service for the betterment of society.

“He named an individual every day,” said Gregg Petersmeyer, a board member of the foundation and a former assistant to Bush. “Starting in November of 1989, right till he left office. And he called them ‘a daily point of light.'”

The students of Karen Lim-Smith’s Music Starz Studios are also young musicians who perform up to 180 concerts a year, specifically for patients in assisted care facilities.

Lim-Smith said her hope is that “these students would cherish and learn from their experiences through their adulthood, and continue this for the rest of their lives.”

Petersmeyer said Bush was a tremendous role model whose life was defined by service to his country.

“Right up until the last few days, he has been signing a letter to a different individual in America, thanking them, for something they’re doing‚” said Petersmeyer.

Lim-Smith said she hopes this sparks a passion for volunteering in others.

“I think it was his hope to inspire us to do more,” said Smith. “To do more than what we do everyday. I think it also teaches us that by being inspired, we can also inspire others. And that will be his legacy.”",1,https://dfw.cbslocal.com/2018/12/01/north-texas-music-students-receive-award-from-foundation-created-by-george-h-w-bush/

80,Bush,George W.,foreignaffairs,"No one is under oath when writing their memoirs, but this joint account by former President George Bush and his national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, has better credentials than most. They not only had privileged access to official documentation, as well as their own sources, but also were generously helped by former staffers like Richard Haass, Condoleezza Rice, and Philip Zelikow. Furthermore, the two authors separate their observations, which take the form of individual comments on a central narrative. This structure gives the work a freshness that makes it readable as well as authoritative. In short, it is a good buy, both for scholars and the general public.

That said, the book contains few surprises. The three years it covers, from January 1989 to December 1991, were among the most momentous of the century, including as they did the liberation of Eastern Europe, the Tiananmen Square massacre, the unification of Germany, the Gulf War, and the disintegration of the Soviet Union. They have already been microscopically examined by scholars, journalists, and memoir writers. But the view from the Oval Office is unique, even if the events are already familiar. In particular, the book tells us nothing that we did not know about President Bush himself. Both in background and personality, he was well fitted for the task of navigating the rapids through which the United States and the world passed during those three stupendous years. He was a thorough professional, having spent the best part of two decades in high office in Washington. He knew how government worked and how the world worked. As vice president he had come to know most of the world's leaders -- usually at the funerals of their predecessors -- and was on friendly terms with many of them. Unlike some of his own predecessors, he was not dependent on policy experts he did not trust or cronies trusted by nobody else. As a man born to the senatorial (if not the presidential) purple, he accepted power easily and carried it graciously. He assembled a team as professional as himself, among whom Brent Scowcroft was preeminent.

A GENIUS FOR FRIENDSHIP

Scowcroft had also been a Washington insider for 20 years and understood both the importance and the limitations of his role. Hard-working, strong-minded, yet self-effacing, he knew that his task was not to make policy ...a la Kissinger (whose offers of help he politely rejected), but to create harmony among the able people who constituted the presidential team and present the president with practicable choices of action. His relationship with the president was like that between a general and his chief of staff. Like all such successful relationships, it deepened into close friendship.

Indeed, friendship was the clue to Bush's success, and he had a genius for it. It went far deeper than the backslapping camaraderie with which some Americans try to establish relationships with foreigners, which is usually deeply resented. Clearly, Bush not only liked but understood people, including those of different cultures. That made them tend to like him. He was, admittedly, lucky in the leaders with whom he had to deal. German Chancellor Helmut Kohl shared Bush's informal tastes and anyhow knew the importance of keeping the United States on his side during the delicate process of German reunification. Margaret Thatcher never concealed her suspicion of Bush's tendency, as she saw it, ""to go wobbly,"" but her determination to preserve the ""special relationship"" between Britain and the United States kept her in line. Francois Mitterrand was another matter altogether: Had Bush not charmed the French president during an informal weekend in Kennebunkport, the persistent efforts of the Quai d'Orsay to rock the boat might have caused a great deal more trouble.

But most important of all was the friendship with Mikhail Gorbachev. It was not just that Bush, like Thatcher, found it easy to do business with him. From the very beginning, he admits, ""I liked him."" Under other circumstances, Bush would no doubt have kept these feelings under close control, but in solving the problems that lay before them, a relationship of close confidence could do nothing but good. Scowcroft was professionally more cautious. It took him some time, as it took many other Americans, to realize that Gorbachev was ""for real."" He feared that Gorbachev was launching a dangerously successful charm offensive to disarm the West, and warned Bush accordingly. As the year wore on, however, it became clear that Gorbachev's concessions over arms control and Eastern Europe were not only sincerely meant but bitterly opposed within his own entourage. The support of Gorbachev against his internal enemies became a firm plank of Western policy.

Nonetheless, even Bush was determined that Gorbachev should not be allowed to shape the future unilaterally with his dramatic concessions. Bush was initially criticized for his apparent lack of ideas, and he disarmingly confessed that he was not good at ""the vision thing."" During the first six months of his presidency, however, he badgered his staff to produce ideas that would enable him to preserve the initiative. But by the summer of 1989, events in Europe were moving so fast that ""the vision thing"" became largely irrelevant. All the United States could do, in Bush's words, was encourage, guide, and manage change. This required seat-of-the-pants planning, not a Wilsonian vision of a new world order.

SWALLOWING TOADS

The fundamental question was how to keep the Soviet Union on board -- first while the people of central and Eastern Europe struggled to free themselves from communism, then while Germany pursued reunification, and finally to ensure that a united Germany remained within NATO. This task involved convincing the Soviet leadership to swallow a prolonged meal of toads, and only the most assiduous personal diplomacy could have persuaded even Gorbachev to do so. The determination to do nothing to humiliate the Soviet Union was fundamental to Bush's policy, and it is clear that this was based not only on prudent recollections of what happened in a humiliated Germany after World War I but on Bush's own gentlemanly inclinations. He stifled all manifestations of triumphalism after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Bush also made it clear to Gorbachev that he understood Moscow's dilemma when the Baltic states demanded their independence. He encouraged the states of Eastern Europe not so much to distance themselves from the Soviet Union as to liberalize their own political and economic systems. The achievement of Bush during this delicate period of transition was not that he did the right things but that he avoided doing the wrong ones.

The problems presented by the reunification of Germany were more complex, if less dramatic. Here, whether the Americans liked it or not, the initiative lay largely with Kohl. Had there been less confidence between Kohl and Bush, the entire alliance might have fallen apart. Doubts about the wisdom of unifying Germany were widespread among all the allies, not least the United States, but Bush himself did not share them. As he put it, he was ""comfortable"" with the prospect and therefore prepared to back Kohl in a policy that was not entirely welcome even to all the chancellor's fellow citizens in the Federal Republic. As it was, toads had to be swallowed not only by the Soviet Union, but also by close U.S. allies like Britain and France. Thatcher did not conceal how much she disliked the taste, but having made her protest, she fell in line. So did Mitterrand, whose ""special relationship"" with Germany was as important to France as that with the United States was for Britain. A final problem was how to reshape NATO so as to convince the Soviets that the West no longer presented a threat, thereby easing their withdrawal from Eastern Europe. Again, Thatcher protested but acquiesced, while the French were able to say that, since they did not belong to the military structure of NATO, it had nothing to do with them. Scowcroft reflects that in these negotiations Britain and France might have been handled more tactfully, but it probably would not have made much difference to the outcome. Although neither liked taking a back seat, the reality is that the key players were Kohl, Gorbachev, and Bush. So long as they agreed, nothing else mattered.

NO WOBBLES HERE

The Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany was signed in Moscow on September 12, 1990. Six weeks earlier, Saddam Hussein had invaded Kuwait, and the White House was already busy dealing with that crisis. Presidential diplomacy was at even more of a premium here. Bush was careful to touch base, as he put it, not only with President Husni Mubarak of Egypt, King Hussein of Jordan, King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, and President Turgut Uzal of Turkey, but also with the rulers of the smaller Arab emirates, and most important of all, with Gorbachev. It was Gorbachev's promise of cooperation in the Persian Gulf that led Bush to express premature hopes for a new world order in which the superpowers would collaborate in preserving world peace. Although initially cautious about the use of force, Bush was always sufficiently determined about the need for firm action to require no lecturing from Thatcher about being ""wobbly."" When on August 5 he declared, ""This will not stand, this aggression against Kuwait,"" he meant what he said. But it was not until the end of September that reports of atrocities in Kuwait convinced him that the defeat of Saddam was a moral as well as a prudential imperative and that his task was to mobilize the forces of the United Nations -- not just to preserve the rule of law but for a crusade against evil.

At that point his own compass was set, but his real troubles were just beginning. As it became increasingly clear that economic sanctions were not working, the use of military force became unavoidable. Bush's domestic critics, who had accused him of indecision, now complained about a policy that they feared would lead to another Vietnam and enormous casualties. Even the hard-won U.N. Security Council resolution of November 29, authorizing its members to ""use all necessary means"" to restore peace and security, had so little effect on a deeply divided U.S. public that the Senate vote to authorize the use of force passed by only three voices. Meanwhile, many of the allies were wavering, sending emissaries to Baghdad in a vain attempt to extract concessions that would redound to their own political advantage. It needed all of Bush's strength and self-confidence to hold the course and go through with the conflict that he knew to be necessary and believed -- in the teeth of much expert military opinion -- would be brief. The only way of managing this crisis, he saw, was by fighting a successful war.

TRIUMPH WITHOUT VICTORY

Yet here again Bush was modest in his objectives. He knew that there was little point in dictating peace to Baghdad, hounding Saddam into exile, or martyring him by execution and thereby assuming responsibility for governing a resentful Iraq -- even if his Arab allies would have tolerated it, which they emphatically would not. If the Iraqi people and their Arab neighbors could not deal with Saddam themselves, it was no responsibility of the United States. Prudence, rather than gentlemanly restraint, dictated Bush's actions. It may have left unfinished political business, but it also left an unblemished military triumph. The role of the United States as the world's leader had, as Bush intended, been reaffirmed. ""We could now,"" as even the cautious Scowcroft expressed it, ""consider the possibility of a new world order, one based on U.S.-Soviet cooperation against unprovoked aggression.""

Alas for the vanity of human wishes. Even as the Gulf War was being fought, it was clear that the basis of Gorbachev's domestic support was precarious. The last section of the book traces the reaction in the White House to its erosion and to the erosion of the Soviet Union. Bush did not, of course, allow his deep friendship with Gorbachev to interfere with his duty of establishing as close relations as possible with his successor, Boris Yeltsin. But the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the descent of its successor states into chaos eliminated Moscow as a serious partner for the United States. Bush's own successor, Bill Clinton, was to have a different order of priorities and confront even more complex international problems. In retrospect, 1989-91 now seems as briefly euphoric as 1944-45. George Bush acknowledges in these memoirs how lucky and privileged he feels to have been president during those years, but it can equally be said that the United States, and the rest of the world, were very lucky to have had him as president. He was a hard act to follow.",1,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/1998-11-01/prudence-thing-george-bushs-class-act

Love and War

When Japan bombed Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, I was a seventeen-year-old high school senior at Phillips Academy, Andover. I could hardly wait to get out of school and enlist. Six months later, Secretary of War Henry Stimson delivered our commencement address and advised my class to go to college. He predicted it would be a long war, and there would be plenty of time for us to serve. My dad, Prescott Bush, with whom it was not easy to disagree, hoped I would listen to Secretary Stimson and go on to Yale. After the ceremony, Dad asked me if I had changed my mind. I told him no, I was ""joining up."" Dad simply nodded his okay. On my eighteenth birthday, June 12, 1942, I enlisted in the Navy's flight training program as a seaman second class.

My mother kept all the letters I wrote to her and Dad during World War II, so most of these come from her collection. You will find only one letter to a Barbara Pierce of Rye, New York. Barbara lost her ""love"" letters during one of our many moves after we got married.

This first group of letters was written from Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where I was enrolled in Naval Aviation Pre-Flight School. For some reason I did not date these letters, but I was stationed there from August to October of 1942.

Dear Mum and Dad,

...Today I felt better than I have since I've been here. It was hot but not unbearable. One fellow fainted at drill just to remind us that it was still hot. It is amazing how our moods change here. So many little things affect us. A cold Coke after drill can do more for one than you can imagine. I have never appreciated little things before. Ice cream, movies, a 15 minute rest, a letter, a compliment to our platoon. All these little things amount to so much in your mind and it is fun. Spirits go way up and way down, but when they're up you feel so wonderful...

I have gotten to know most of the fellows in the platoon. They are a darn good-hearted bunch...There are so many different types here. We have a pretty friendly platoon — also good spirit...

On our 5 hr. hike tomorrow my heart'll be with you in the ""docks."" So drink a sip of water for me. It is our greatest luxury — a swallow of cold water. I think I'm really going to get a lot out of this place. Already we have learned a lot about people & discipline and tired muscles.





Much love, Pop

This is a letter to my sister, Nancy, who was two years my junior. I was one of five children: Prescott (whom we called Pres or Pressy), myself, Nancy, Jonathan, and William (nicknamed Bucky), who was only four years old when I joined the Navy.





Dear Nance,

...There is not much ""news"" here. We live by the day — a wholesome life, at times seemingly futile, but looking at it philosophically I wouldn't change positions with any fellow in civilian life. The Navy itself is great, but what we are here for is even greater, and if at all times I can keep my objective in view I am hopeful of a successful conclusion to this one year course. After having been here just one month my desire to win my wings and become an officer is tremendous. I'm afraid if I fail for any reason my disappointment will be very deep. I am proud to be here, Nance, and as I said before wouldn't change for the world.

...I have to write Bobsie now. I miss her more than she knows, Nance. I don't know why but she seems so perfect a girl — beautiful, gentle, a wonderful sense of humor, so much fun etc. I think of her all the time and would love to see her.

Give her my love especially —

Much love to you and write if you get another minute — so long,

Dear Mum and Dad,

...The only thing wrong with this place is, they don't realize the average intelligence. They hand out so much crude propaganda here. It is really sickening — Many of the men here realize it — also the intelligent officers. Stuff like ""Kill the Japs — hate — murder"" and a lot of stuff like ""you are the cream of American youth."" Some fellows swallow it all. These are the fellows many whom are below average intelligence, 2 of my roommates, for example, get a big kick out of hearing it. Maybe it is good. All the well educated fellows know what they are fighting for -- why they are here and don't need to be ""brainwashed"" into anything...





Much love, Pop

Dear Mum,

Well the war strikes home, as it were, doesn't it — c.c. with the very sad news of George Mead. I didn't know him very well, but from all sides all you could hear was praise. He died the way all of us would like to die when our time comes — Mum, it's a very funny thing. I have no fear of death now. Maybe it's because I am here safely on the ground that I say this. I do not think I will change. All heroics aside, I feel, and every fellow here I'm sure feels, that the only part of the whole thing of any worry would be the sorrow it might cause to our families. I cannot express myself as clearly as I see it in my own mind. Once in the air death may strike at any time, but I shall not fear it. Perhaps with this fleet it will be different — God grant it won't!...





Much, much love, Pop

Dear Mum,

Well today sure was wonderful.

...I met Barbara at the Inn at 12. She took a cab over from Raleigh. She looked too cute for words — really beautiful. We had a sandwich in town and then walked. I showed her the plant and then we walked over to Keenan Stadium. When we started it was clear, but once there it poured — just buckets. We got some protection from the canvas covered press box, but couldn't leave there....Not thrilling but such fun just seeing her. We laughed at everything. I had formation at six so we went back to the Inn. She took a bus for Raleigh where she is staying overnight with a girl from school. She was so swell to come way over here. I sure am glad you said ""grand idea"" to Mrs. Pierce....





Much love to all, Pop

This next group of letters were written from Wold-Chamberlain Naval Air Station, Minneapolis, where I was based from November 1942 to February 1943. It was here that I finally began to learn how to fly.





Dear Mum,

Well today was the big day — in fact one of the biggest thrills of my life, I imagine. We marched down to the #1 hanger and they read out the names for the first hop. I was in. I went down, got my gear, and then consulted the board. Plane P-18 1st hop — 2nd hop Plane P-18 check pilot Boyle. I immediately went around trying to find out what kind of a check Boyle is. All I got was ""pretty tough"". This was quite disheartening. I then went out and warmed up the ship waiting for Ens. Crume (CRUME pronounced croom) to arrive....The fog was pretty thick but they let us go up. Crume came and we were off. I did it all myself and everything went O.K. However, I was so nervous, that in the beginning my legs were shivering around. Once in the air I was completely cool much to my surprise. We did some emergencies and landings and then came in. I gave him one poor landing so I wasn't sure about my ""up"", but when we got out he told me ""O.K."" Then for the real check. Ens. Boyle came out. Once in the plane we didn't say a word. I taxied out, revved up the engine, locked the tailwheel, adjusted my goggles & seat, checked the instruments & the tower, swung into the wind and we were off. For about one turn of the field I was pretty nervous. First he signaled (wouldn't talk) to make 2 landings (When I speak of landings I mean ""touch and go"" except for this final one before the plane stops rolling, gun her and take off again.) The first landing was swell — the 2nd rather rough. We then dove into the fog and went off and did 2 1,000-foot emergencies. (That is he cuts the gas, and I have to establish a glide, get going into the wind to land on a field which I select — we don't actually land, just go down to about 75 feet) Once I picked out a good field but the other time I'm afraid it'd have been a pretty rough procedure if I had had to land. He then indicated to head back to the field — For a minute I was lost — couldn't see the field through the mist, but luckily I located it. I did 2 more landings and taxied in. My nervousness, which had subsided after the first takeoff, came on again. As he climbed out I looked for the verdict. ""Did you get an up from your instructor,"" he said. ""O.K. — then take it up yourself,"" and off he walked. There I was alone in the plane: I gave the ""thumbs up"" to the plane captain, he removed the chocks and I was off. I wasn't shaky on the controls, and was completely confident for some reason. I had to taxi way down between rows of army bombers to get to my take off point. My solo was just ""2 landings"" — that's your first solo assignment. Off I zoomed — climbed to 300 ft at 65 knots; level off — pass under the traffic circle. Nobody was there saying all this, this time yet I did it — The needle seemed to stay right at 500 — whereas with the instructors I'd drop or gain. Everything seemed so free and easy and really wonderful. My landings weren't good — I bounced and didn't cut quite soon enough, but I didn't worry as I have before. This was the thing that made it so much fun. I turned back in and it was over -- just as quickly as it had come. I felt good though — Mum, It was the first time I have climbed out of the plane without worrying or having a touch of discouragement. Yes, tonight I am very happy.

When we leave here we want to specify the type of flying we want to do. I have been considering the Marines (I'd be commissioned 2nd Lt. instead of Ensign) The reason is they fly a lot in attack bombers — fly low and strafe as well as bomb. They clear the way for advancing troops. This or long range bombing appeals to me more than anything else, and from all I can gather, the Marines do more of it than the Navy. I have 2 months before I choose anyway, and besides you don't always get your choice. I'll let you know what I decide as soon as I know more about flying and find out what I'd be best in...

Well, Mum, I better go back and get some sleep — Much love to all,

Dear Mum,

...Thanksgiving comes tomorrow. I guess that I will hardly notice it here — that is outwardly as we can't leave the base and just get 1 hr. off, but it won't just be a regular day Mum. We all do have something to be thankful for, even though the days are darker than when we could all be together. I guess I'm the most thanks-giving fellow here, because even though I'm a couple of thousand miles off I'm lucky, Mum — Lucky for you and Dad and all the family and so many other things. I thought when I was away at school I understood it all, but being away in the Navy for this long and with so many different types of fellows has made me see more clearly still how much I do have to be thankful for....





Much love, Mum dear Pop

Dear Mum,

Gosh it was wonderful hearing your voice today — It was swell of you to call. I got the message just after I came back from church....

It was interesting to see a lot of these fellows, today. Some tough ones, some common, other grand fellows. We all are up to our beds for a few minutes after church, and most of the fellows were quiet — thinking of other Thanksgiving days. For many it was the first time away and it was a bit strange. It will always be strange to me, to be away on a day like this, at least until I have my own home. It's days like this that makes me anxious to be out fighting — though I know I can never become a killer, I will never feel right until I have actually fought. Being physically able and young enough I belong out at the front and the sooner there, the better. The job seems so tremendous, yet it must end and when it does and we have won perhaps days like this will once again be symbolic of happiness and freedom and the ironic note added by a brutal war will be far removed....





Much love, Pop

Dear Dad and Mum,

...Yesterday a friend of mine cracked up. His motor cut on him and all landing sites were poor. He managed to get it fairly well down but then he nosed over, flipped onto his back, and was hanging by his safety belt — about 1 ft. from the ground (his head). The tail was wiped right off the plane. Luckily he unhooked his belt and could slip out O.K. Poor Ed. He hasn't been doing too well anyway and this may be just what he doesn't need. The motors are apt to cut on cold days — Once I started looking for a field but the thing got going O.K. again...

Barbara knitted me a pair of socks which she claims don't look at all like socks but she's sending them anyway. Maybe I can make a neck protector out of 'em if they are too big....





Much love, Pop

Dear Mum and Dad,

Well my first Xmas away is over and gone, but I don't believe I'll ever forget it. I missed you all very much, yet I wasn't homesick. Your lovely presents are wonderful. I've got the bracelet on and it'll never be taken off permanently until I'm back for good. It's beautiful, Mum, and it means an awful lot to me. The goggles I wore today and they are wonderful. I'm surprised you could get such grand ones. They are just what I needed — good protection by that rubber and it holds my face mask firmly in place and also they don't hurt across the nose. The bathrobe is swell, too. Thank you so much — oh yes, the stocking too — I only hope that we'll never think we're too old for them...

...My Xmas take was good. $25 from Gampy, and numerous socks and the like. Got a big box of food from the Pierces and Barbara is sending me soon what I asked for; namely a decent picture of her...





As always, Pop





------

Occasionally in my letters home I would include diagrams to illustrate what I was learning. This is a typical example:





Dear Mum,

Well the sky is clear today and it looks like I'll get my hop in...

My inverted spins were really pretty good fun. You are really thrown outward with terrific force and if it weren't for the belt you'd fly through space. I also had immelman's and falling leaf. An immelman's starts off like a loop. Dive to pick up your 125 knots, pull back to upside down — now here's the difference — instead of coming on around you do a slow roll from the upside down position and fly on out.

They are about the hardest but are also good fun....

Please keep in mind as you read this letter that I was a very innocent eighteen-year-old, and it was 1942. Things were very different way back then. Having said that, I do not think it would be a bad thing if more eighteen-year-olds today were just as innocent. As to the reference to my sister, Nancy, I suspect Mum had caught her kissing a beau.





Dearest Mum,

Now about your question, Mum. I do love to kid you and did this summer but I agree with you in part. I would hate to have Nancy a necker at heart. Nothing could be worse. Kissing is not an obligation a girl owes a boy regardless of how often he takes her out or how much money he spends...but I don't think that it is entirely wrong for a girl to be kissed by a boy. Let us take this famous case Pierce vs. Bush summer '42. I kissed Barbara and am glad of it. I don't believe she will ever regret it or resent it, and I certainly am not ashamed of it. I'd tell you, Mrs. Pierce, or anybody but at the same time I might as well tell you I have never felt towards another girl as I do towards her. Whether the feeling is mutual I cannot say. To get back to my example, however, if Barbara sort of forgets me, which is not unlikely, as I have no chance to see her at all, I don't believe she will ever dislike me more for having kissed her. She knows how I felt towards her and she must have shared some of the same feeling or she would not have allowed me to kiss her. I have never kissed another girl — this making myself just as much of an oddity as Nancy, since most of the boys do not stop with kissing — (how terribly true that is here, more than home, but then again most of these fellows are grown men — also men with different background.) It's not because I have honestly disapproved of it, however. If I said it were I would be lying. In conclusion a Mrs. Simmons kiss, both sides willing, I believe harmless; to neck — entirely wrong — for a girl to be kissed by someone whom she loves (or thinks she love) and who — she is sure cares for her — O.K. This is a very uncoordinated piece of writing and unorganized but I've said about what I mean. For a kiss to mean engagement is a very beautiful idea, Mama, but it went out a while back I guess.

Now for me to continue and tell you the facts of life — of the life I'm living in 1940's — Apparently Mum you seemed so terribly surprised when Pressy and I hinted around about the ""things that went on?"" Pressy and I share a view which few others, very few others even in Greenwich share. That's regarding intercourse before marriage. I would hate to find that my wife had known some other man, and it seems to me only fair to her that she be able to expect the same standards from me. Pres agrees as I said before, but not many others our age will. Daddy has never discussed such things with us — of this I am very glad. But we have learned as the years went on by his character what is right and what is wrong. Most fellows here — true some are engaged and some believe as I do — but most fellows take sex as much they can get. This town in particular seems full of girls (working in offices etc.) rather attractive girls at that, who after a couple of drinks would just as soon go to bed with some cadet. They are partly uniform conscious I suppose, but the thing is they, as well as the cadet, have been brought up differently. They believe in satisfying any sexual urge by contact with men. They all say ""I'm not that type of girl, but all-right — just for you!"" Every single girl says this. These girls are not prostitutes, but just girls without any morals at all. Somehow it does seem a little worse for girls to me, I suppose it shouldn't but it does. Leading the life we lead one cannot help but feel the desire for a woman. I would be most facetious were I to deny ever having experienced said feelings. The difference is entirely in what we have been taught; not only in ""what"" but in ""how well"" we have been taught it.

This pertains not only to the N.A.S. [Naval Air Station] Minneapolis, Minn., but to every town in the country, to college campuses — yes, even to Yale University. Boys you know — boys I like very much — and even boys I admire have had intercourse with women....

Some guys, you know one perfect example in New Haven, because they love a girl believe in relationships before marriage. This seems to me more excusable than just plain sex — sex to satisfy physical biological emotions — yet I know it is not right.

Most of this you have probably known, but this is how I feel. I hope that this letter does not seem presumptuous. To think all this was brought on by your asking me what I thought about kissing.





Much love, Pop professor ""sexology"" Ph.D.

Dear Mum,

Last night I really had quite a scare in night flying. I finished all my night flying last night. I just had one solo yesterday. The wind was almost from south — a little southwest, but they had the runway laid out west. This meant we were landing somewhat crosswind to start with — an undesirable setup. Furthermore they had the runway much narrower than usual. It was like landing on a pin. All the instructors were griping about how narrow the runway was. You see with the crosswind there was considerable drift. In other words you'd have your plane pointing one way, and you'd be making true a different course over the ground. It was quite tough, but I surprised myself and really made some nice landings (Night flying is much easier alone as you can see all the signals more clearly and command a better view of the runway.) Well, I was coming in for my last landing. I got all ""squared away"" and even got a green light from the truck. Suddenly I heard this scraping noise — I had hit a tree — Well you can imagine my feelings. I didn't know whether the next second I'd hit one with my prop instead of my wheels. I gave full throttle and climbed up — flew across the field and came in again. It turned out later that two instructors also hit this tree. The runway was too close to the woods on the east side of the field. I just thanked my lucky stars I wasn't 2 or 3 feet lower or I'd have hit the prop and then, well I don't really know. It's a funny thing — you don't ever get scared till afterwards. Same with a dangerous landing or something....





So long for now, Mum Much much love,

Pop

Dear Mum,

Yesterday was one of the — if not the — most unpleasant days of my life — at least 1 1/4 hours of it. I had my ""D"" check with Ensign Warren. He was very nice on the ground, but no sooner did we get in the plane than he started yelling. In no time in my life have I ever felt so uncomfortable. According to him I just couldn't do a thing right. Frankly, before my check I was confident but once in that plane I was lost. Taxing, climbing — even on fundamentals like that — he bellowed. I was so flustered I couldn't think. (How I pity guys with instructors like that) Well we got on the ground and I was beat. But after it was over he gave me a very weak ""up"" nevertheless it's an ""up."" It was an experience I'll probably have to undergo again. But I sure hope not. That must be the philosophy of some pilots to make you fly under tough conditions. The fact remains however, that I got an up....

...The realization came upon me yesterday that I'm 2é3 on the way to my commission and wings almost. It is a wonderful feeling and I just hope that in 3 months more I'll actually get through...





Much love to all, Pop

This next series of letters were written from the U.S. Naval Air Station in Corpus Christi, Texas, where I was stationed from February to June 1943.





Dear Mum,

...Today I went to church here. There were only about 12 cadets and 8 others there but it was very nice. The Chaplain was an awfully young fellow with a most appealing nature. It was held in ground school. I was very poor about churching in Mpls....

I got a letter from F. Von Stade. He was on a 14 day furlough at Aiken [S.C.] recovering from pneumonia — what a break. Anyway he called up Barbara...He claims Barbara said she was glad I was in Texas where the girls are lousy so maybe I still am in. I sure so hope so. If she ""fluffed me off"" without warning I would be absolutely sick no kidding. Every day practically guys are getting ""fluffed off"" from girls they've left....All the time it happens. You know Mum it's funny being thrown in with a bunch of guys so much older — They don't seem older, but here they are, all thinking and talking about getting married etc. Everyone asks me, after looking at Barbara's picture, when I'm going to marry her. Good heaven's! To think that last year at this time I was thinking along lines of prep school proms and stuff seems unbelievable. That's the hard part. Being around guys averaging 22 about it's only natural to think as they do on general things, and yet my 18 years keep coming up. I wish I were 20 or 21. It's not that I feel younger or anything, but I just wish I were. The fellows whose lives may be better for this thing are those who graduated last fall or Xmas from college. They have a degree and can probably get a decent job after the war and still will profit from having had military experience. Say the war ends in 2 years and I go to college. I'll feel like the old man...all my friends'll be through. That'll all straighten out though, and if you think I'd change with any of those fellows at Yale, you're sadly mistaken. I still would like to be 21 — have a million dollars, and a beautiful wife. I can remember how I once said I wasn't going to get married.

...I do still love (I honestly feel sure of it) Barbara, Mum, yet I know that there is such a chance of her meeting some other guy. She is so very young and so darn attractive and I could hardly expect her to keep caring about me for years. ENOUGH OF THIS!!!!!!!! You both must think I'm crazy!...





Much love, Pop

Dear Mum and Dad,

Today was the big day and after a great deal of confusion it seems that your loving son is a torpedo bomber selectee. Yes I got my first choice and tomorrow morning, unless some unforeseen circumstances arise, I pack my belongings and move out to nearby (3 miles) Waldron Field, new home of the Torpedo squadron. I really am delighted with my lot and provided all goes well I should be home with you all in less than 6 weeks.

...John Buckby, one of my roommates now, 19 years old (the only other fellow I've met that young) is going to get married when he graduates. Naturally we all talk about these things, and he is convinced that he should — however, he has no money aside from the $250 he'll be making and then his future is a bit of a ""?"" I don't quite see how these guys get married when they know that they have no means of support and probably will be out of this country in a short time....





Much love, Pop

Dear Mum,

...Barbara knit me another pair of socks. The last ones, except for the shape, were really swell. These, she says, are too heavy and miles too big. At the last minute she always gets embarrassed and won't send them until I persuade her.

...Mum, I don't know why, but I can hardly believe that I'll be an officer soon. It just is something I've really wanted and now that it looks like I'm going to get it, I find it hard to believe. From what I can gather I will be the youngest flying officer (maybe officers) in the Navy. I'm not proud of being young — but it's a fact so I've been told. The youngest in the Army is 19....





Much much love, Pop

Mum, De-ah,

...Mum, I'm really worried. I hope it's one of her lapses which she falls in occasionally either because she's busy or just to keep me anxious and interested; but I haven't gotten but 1 letter in 3 1/2 weeks. Before there were a couple of 2 week famines but never this. I don't know, hope it's not the ""fluff."" Being away from all nice girls I worry more than usual over Barb. It's silly but that's how its been. As I've said before Barb is really a smart girl in that she can be sweet and all that without committing herself to any great degree — Oh well, not much I can do now....





Much love, Pop

I received my wings on June 9, 1943, in Corpus Christi, three days before my nineteenth birthday. After a short leave at home, I reported to the U.S. naval air station in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where I would learn how to fly torpedo bombers.





Dear Mum,

First of all and mainly is the matter of a glorious 5 days. Never in the world could any son ever have been given such a welcome. You and Dad just did too much for me. Not much else I can say about it, except that those short 5 days have made all my time away from home seem worthwhile. Trite though it may be, it's a short stay with those you love which re-clarifies in one's mind exactly what you're fighting for. From now on it will be no picnic. Two months here (no more). A week or so at Chicago and then as quickly as one squadron can form at either San Diego or Norfolk or Oklahoma, we head overseas. That takes perhaps a week, perhaps 2 months, depending on the men available. Being here and seeing these monstrous ships in their battle paint brings home the point that it won't be long now. I cannot wait — not because of the glamour or of the thrills — for heaven's knows I love my home like few others — but because it is my job, clearly defined and it must be done....

One last thing, sweet Mama! The way you and Dad both were so wonderful about Barbara probably meant more to me than anything. After all you hadn't seen me in ages and yet you didn't object to my running off. I needn't bother to tell you how much Barbara means to me — pretty evident I guess — knowing this you must know how happy you made me by being so marvelous about having her up etc.

Goodnight and much, much love,





Pop

Dear Mum and Dad,

...I saw a Henry Aldrich movie here at the base tonight. Also heard Fred & am now back listening to Marian Anderson. I have used this radio almost incessantly....

I sent Barbara an alligator; he ate Mrs. Pierce's frog in her pool, and finally beat an escape into the woods. If you would like a 'gator' at home — give me the word and he's as good as yours.





Much love, Pop

I finished my training in Fort Lauderdale in August 1943 and then headed for the huge naval base in Norfolk, Virginia. For the next few months, as I entered my final stage of training, I bounced around quite a bit — to the naval air station at Chincoteague, Virginia; back to Norfolk; up to Hyannis, Massachusetts; to Charlestown, Rhode Island; then back to Norfolk. During this period my squadron was formed, VT-51. (For some reason, I also started dating my letters about this time.)





Monday, Nov. 1 Dear Dad,

I've thought this over and I wasn't quite sure whether I should write or not, but I wanted to tell someone about it, and I think it wiser to tell you, cause Mum might do some unnecessary worrying. I hope you won't worry about me after hearing it. I wanted to tell you all about it though.

Today on my last flight I was coming in for my final landing when I hit a vicious slipstream from 2 recently landed TBF's. I was ready to land but I shoved on full throttle to go around again — by that time, however, the slipstream had one wing down on the runway. I swerved to that (the left side) going off the runway. As I went off — my wheels hit and one gave way — This sent me careening sort of half sideway on one wing and the belly over the ground. Everything happened so quickly that I can't exactly remember it all. The prop hit and stopped. I was scared we'd tip over, but luckily we didn't. As soon as she stopped — I snapped off the switch, gas, and battery and leapt out and to the stern. My crewmen were scurrying out as I opened the back door. Luckily none of the 3 of us was injured at all. The plane is a total loss. Both wings smashed, fuselage slightly buckled etc.-etc. It gave me quite a feeling. While careening speedily and recklessly across the runway a feeling of helplessness not fear seized me. Then there flashed thru my mind the question ""will we go over?"" -- then she stopped and I leapt. Funny I never really was scared. After it was over I had that excited feeling in the pit of my stomach. We were terribly lucky that the ship didn't burn.

The skipper was very understanding & nice about the whole thing. Nothing will happen to me, I'll just sign a report. It really was something — one of the things that make flying dangerous is the slipstream, and I really got hit bad.

I feel perfectly now and am anxious to get back in the air tomorrow, so don't give it another thought. I just wanted to let you know about it.

It was really great seeing you all again this weekend, and I'm now looking forward to the next one —





Ever devotedly, Pop





------

Dear Mum,

...Now, Mum, I may have quite a secret to tell you in a few days — are you wiser at all? Maybe you can guess — maybe not.

It was such fun seeing you, Mum. It really wasn't for long — I feel badly about it after; came home and then see you so little. Must be love Mum — No longer am I confused though — I'm just so convinced that Barbara is the girl for me. The only thing that bothers me is the future. I feel certain that right now I could hold down a job as well as men with an educational advantage over me. I have associated for the most part with college fellows since I've been in the Navy and in my own heart I know I could do a job as well — The question is what — I wouldn't want to fly all my life for a living — any job where I could make enough money to have the few basic things I desire would be most welcome. I often think and worry about it — I now know exactly what I want. No college, I'll have to do without, just a job anywhere with a fairly decent salary. The war will probably last at least 2 years more so my problem is not as imminent as it might be, but it worries me a little. Why this outburst I don't know — anyway lots of people will need a good butler when this is over....





Ever lovingly, Pop

This letter was written after I had been home on leave, during which I told my mother that Barbara and I were ""secretly"" engaged.





Dear Mum,

...I'm glad I told you all about Bar & me. You probably knew already; but do tell Dad! I found two letters from Barbara here today. I think she has told her family. She said she was going to and she told me to tell all my family — Poor child doesn't quite know what ""all"" means in this case I'm afraid. I do think I'll write Ganny & Flash sometime soon about it. I don't quite know how to go about it all. As things stand now I'll probably wait about a year to announce it, but things do so change — I think Barbara is partial to the present — I'll have to see her soon again and talk it all over. She agreed to my suggestion of waiting till after the fleet, but I can't be sure her heart feels that way until I see her. As for me, the present would be fine, but somehow the other seems wiser...

Incidentally if you see any shiny rocks on our driveway collect them — Seriously though, Mum just for interests sake what does a fairly decent looking ring cost?...





Much love, Pop





------

As I mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, Barbara lost all my letters to her during the war — except for this one, which she kept in her engagement scrapbook.





Dec. 12, 1943 My darling Bar,

This should be a very easy letter to write — words should come easily and in short it should be simple for me to tell you how desperately happy I was to open the paper and see the announcement of our engagement, but somehow I can't possibly say all in a letter I should like to.

I love you, precious, with all my heart and to know that you love me means my life. How often I have thought about the immeasurable joy that will be ours some day. How lucky our children will be to have a mother like you —

As the days go by the time of our departure draws nearer. For a long time I had anxiously looked forward to the day when we would go aboard and set to sea. It seemed that obtaining that goal would be all I could desire for some time, but, Bar, you have changed all that. I cannot say that I do not want to go — for that would be a lie. We have been working for a long time with a single purpose in mind, to be so equipped that we could meet and defeat our enemy. I do want to go because it is my part, but now leaving presents itself not as an adventure but as a job which I hope will be over before long. Even now, with a good while between us and the sea, I am thinking of getting back. This may sound melodramatic, but if it does it is only my inadequacy to say what I mean. Bar, you have made my life full of everything I could ever dream of — my complete happiness should be a token of my love for you.

Wednesday is definitely the commissioning and I do hope you'll be there. I'll call Mum tomorrow about my plan. A lot of fellows put down their parents or wives and they aren't going so you could pass as a Mrs. — Just say you lost the invite and give your name. They'll check the list and you'll be in. How proud I'll be if you can come.

I'll tell you all about the latest flying developments later. We have so much to do and so little time to do it in. It is frightening at times. The seriousness of this thing is beginning to strike home. I have been made asst. gunnery officer and when Lt. Houle leaves I will be gunnery officer. I'm afraid I know very little about it but I am excited at having such a job. I'll tell you all about this later too.

The wind of late has been blowing like mad and our flying has been cut to a minimum. My plane, #2 now, is up at Quonset, having a camera installed. It is Bar #2 but purely in spirit since the Atlantic fleet won't let us have names on our planes.

Goodnite, my beautiful. Everytime I say beautiful you about kill me but you'll have to accept it —

I hope I get Thursday off — there's still a chance. All my love darling —





Poppy public fiancé as of 12/12/43

December 29 Dear Mum,

...I changed my allotment check, so starting either at the end of January or the end of February the check for 143 dollars will come to you every month. The reason for this is because if I left it made out to the bank and I should become lost the payments would immediately be stopped. If it is made out to you and I am lost the checks will continue to come in until it is definitely established that I am safely in heaven....

Jan. 11 Dear Mum,

...I miss Bar something terrific but I suppose it's only natural. It's really agony -- so close and yet so far away. I think of her every minute and know that I will be completely happy only when I am with her again. I will be so pleased when she is mine for keeps. When that will be it is hard to guess. I certainly hope we can get married before she finishes Smith. As far as her wanting to, that's settled. We both want to be married, but it's so clear to see that our wants are not the determining factor in this case. What do you both think I should have to offer Bar before we can get married? She does not expect us to have a thing, but I wonder if it would be fair to her to get married with what I have saved, say in a year after I get back I will have well over $2,000 by then.

Perhaps I'd be sent back out again a few months after we were married. There are so many considerations. The one thing I really want is to have Barbara for my wife and naturally I want that as soon as possible....I have talked to Bar a good deal about it and we both want to get married when I come back from the fleet next year. Please tell me what you think. Mr. Pierce would like Barbara to finish Smith, but I don't think he'd disapprove of our getting married next year — I don't know for sure. Mrs. Pierce probably would hate to lose her daughter but she does want her to be happy so that's the way that stands. Perhaps I should have a talk with Mr. P after shakedown.





Much love to all, Pop

Jan. 25 Dear Mum,

Yesterday we went and landed aboard the San [Jac] for the first time...We, the TBF's, landed first. The ship looked really swell steaming along in her battle camouflage. We made a few practice passes down wind and then she swung around into the wind and we came aboard. She was moving at a good clip and the air was nice and smooth, facilitating landings. We each made 3 landings and then cut our motors on the deck. We taxied into position before cutting the motors. On Carriers it is necessary to utilize every inch of deck space. The result is that the line-men taxi you right up to the very edge of the deck. They put me right on the starboard bow and I thought I was going to fall over any minute. With the water rushing by over the side etc. it is quite scary. This putting the planes where they want them is called spotting and it's very important. The loudspeakers announced that the pilots had 7 minutes so then 3 of us went below for coffee. Everyone aboard welcomed us and was swell to us. These are the first landings a lot of the crew had seen so they were quite excited. Soon the loudspeaker boomed and we manned our planes, started the engines etc. We were catapulted off. In fact I made the first catapult shot ever made from the USS San Jacinto — I was mighty glad the machine worked. I think I'd rather be catapulted than make a full deck take off....

After a two-week shakedown cruise to Trinidad, British West Indies, the San Jac set sail March 25, 1944, heading for San Diego first, then to the South Pacific. The next group of letters was written from the ship.





Wed. April 12, 1944 Dear Mum and Dad,

...I wish I could tell you where we are, what we're doing etc. I can't of course mainly because we aren't allowed to, secondly because I really can't be sure I know.

I finished the 4 books you gave me Mum and loved them all. I'm going to pick up a couple of more. I am trying to read a few on Russia, because I have become pretty much interested in that end of our diplomatic relations. Then, too, I know so little about it all that a couple of books wouldn't hurt anyway....

Well, so long for now and much, much love to all,

April 27, 1944 Dearest Mum and Dad,

I haven't written for several days but still there is little to write about — at least little which I am allowed to write. I wish I could tell all because it is interesting and will be plenty exciting no doubt.

Have piled up quite a few hours lately and have boosted my total landings aboard up to about 47. One of them (my second to last to be exact) really was a scary devil. I came in high and a little fast — I got the cut & nosed once but not enough — I then hauled back and made a real hard landing, blowing out my right tire and stopping precariously near the catwalk. How I hate to make a terrible landing — I get to worrying about it and also it's not good for the crewmen. Everyday someone at least gets a tire or 2; so it's not serious, but I don't like it.

...From now on it's going to be plenty rugged duty — in a way I'm glad, cause I probably need the experience — maybe you should have been a little bit mean so I would relish the thought of killing etc. When my time is up all I ask for is to get married and be able to be with my wife for some sort of a decent amount of time. How I miss my Barbara — It's such fun at nite after the hectic turmoil of carrier flight operations is over to lie in my upper and let my mind relax, think of you both, all at home, and of Bar — our wedding.





Much love, Pop

May 24, 1944 Dear Mum and Dad,

...I can say that I have been in battle against the enemy. It is quite a feeling, Mum to be shot at I assure you. The nervousness which is with you before a game of some kind, was extremely noticeable but no great fear thank heavens. I wish I could tell you more about it. Probably will be able to later. Must stop now —





Much much love, Pop

May 26, 1944 Dear Mum and Dad,

Here is some distressing news which I hate to report. Jim Wykes is officially missing. It has affected those of us who knew him very deeply as he was a fellow whom everyone liked. I personally, have far from given up hope, and as I write this can't help but feel that he will turn up. He may fall into enemy hands, but at least he'll still have his life. All we can do is hope. His family has been notified, so it's O.K. to mention it now. He disappeared on a search mission — good men [his crew], one of whom had just become a father shortly before leaving the states. News like this is unpleasant, but I guess I'll just have to learn to take it. Jim was my closest friend on the ship — a fellow whom I was very fond of. There is a definite hope — perhaps he will even turn up soon.

Well, I must stop for now and get up on security watch. With much love to all the family I am —





Devotedly yours, Pop





------





June 4, 1944 My Dear Mrs. Wykes,

For the past year your son, Jim, and I have been very close friends. We have been together at all our various stations, joined the squadron together, and have roomed together for a year now, even aboard this ship. I know your son well and have long considered myself fortunate to be one of his intimate friends. His kindly nature and all around goodness have won for him the friendship and respect of every officer and enlisted man in the squadron.

I realize that the news of his being missing has undoubtedly brought into your home a good deal of grief and sorrow — but however difficult it may be, you must never give up hope. All of us out here firmly believe that there is an excellent chance that Jim and his 2 crewmen are still alive. I am not saying this merely to console you, for I would not want to give you false hope. You have lost a loving son, we have lost a beloved friend; so let us be brave — let us keep faith and hope in our hearts and may our prayers be answered.





God bless you and your family Sincerely yours,

George Bush

June 10th Dear Mum and Dad,

I suppose this is the first letter you've received from me in a long time, but in my last I told you it would be a while between so I hope you haven't worried at all.

...We have received flashes on the invasion of Europe and eagerly await any further news. Every day our ship puts out a sort of newspaper. The news in it is gathered for the most part from aboard ship, but there are a few short wave radioed messages. I am eager to receive your letters telling about how the news was received at home, but I will have to wait a while more for any letters I'm afraid.

...As much as I hate to admit it, and though I'd never tell Bar for fear she'd misconstrue what I said, I really think we did the right thing in not getting married. A couple of fellows' wives in our outfit are having babies now. The guys worry a lot and I imagine it must be hell on the poor girls. No it wouldn't have been fair to Bar to have gotten married. When I return I certainly hope we can, however. I will have saved $3000 by next fall. I have learned a good deal out here — lots that's not practical by a long shot, but it all goes to making a man out of one. As far as elapsed time making a difference in my feeling toward Bar I was sure when I left I'd never change, and now as each day passes I am never more sure....





Your ever devoted son, Pop





------





June 22, 1944 Dear Mum and Dad,

Things have been happening so fast that I have forgotten when I wrote you last. 3 days ago I had to make a forced landing in the water. It was my first water landing and when my engine acted up I was a bit nervous. It went off o.k. however. All three of us got out safely and into our raft. We were rescued by a destroyer. I'm afraid I can tell you no more details than that.

As I write this I have not gotten back to my own ship. Yesterday I was transferred from the destroyer by ""breeches buoy"" to this ship. When I will get back I do not know. I am getting a rest here so I don't care too much, though I would rather be back with my own squadron.

The transfer on the breeches buoy was quite a thrill. I really enjoyed my stay aboard the destroyer. They all treated me and my crewmen like kings. I slept a good deal read a lot and generally enjoyed myself. When they picked us out of the water the Doc administered us some brandy. The crewmen were always surrounded by an attentive group of listeners and they would have liked to stay there....

Some of the experiences that fellows out here have had lately would really amaze you. The ""braid"" will go thru almost anything to rescue pilots and crews, and believe me, it's a real comforting feeling. Well that's about all for now — with much love to all —





Pop

Mon. June 26th Dear Mum and Dad,

Once more back aboard my own ship and really glad to be back. Before actually getting back I was transferred from 3 different ships, 2 destroyers and one carrier. (I am assuming you got my letter telling you about my crash landing in the water.) It was certainly nice to get the clean clothes back on and get in my own sack. Two new pilots joined our squadron and came aboard with me. By then I was an old hand at being transferred by breeches buoy.

The high point of my return was 4 letters — 2 Bar, 1 Mum, 1 Aunt Nance...

Bar's two letters (and yours of course) were a Godsend. I miss her so desperately and love to think of getting home to her. She is so marvelous to me, and now she is the object of prime importance in my life. After these hectic, often frightening days, it is indeed a comfort to lie in my upper and think of those marvelous days ahead with Barbara. If only I could see her — look into those lovely eyes, hear her laugh, and watch her playing with Bucky. Enough of that for now.

...Have you read this gov't education Bill? Looks to me like it might be a nice 2 or 3 year rest at college. I'll have saved some money and then they pay you, too, it seems. It's just a passing fancy — probably because right now the lazy routine of college would appeal to me. We could live in some swell apartment and I could study -- Bar too if she wanted — Well, it's just something to think about. My mind grasps onto any and every possibility since it's so much fun planning and wondering. Barbara's letters are so wonderful. I do hope she is happy at Smith. I'm afraid she misses out on some fun by being engaged, but she's always been cute about it....

We've been flying a good deal midst lots of excitement. The initial shakiness has left me before the battles, but the intensity of fire over the objectives will always scare me — of that I'm sure. Keeps you a good Christian anyway.

...For the most part I am relatively happy. The time has seemed endless since we parted. However when all's said, I'll have to admit I'm glad I am here — though I do wish this phase of it were behind me and I was home again, having been through it. At last I feel that I am at least doing my part and when I get back I'll have no feeling of guilt about being in the States.

Oh Mum I hope John and Buck and my own children never have to fight a war. Friends disappearing, lives being extinguished. It's just not right. The glory of being a carrier pilot has certainly worn off. True it's always a thrill to land successfully aboard, to return and see your ship steaming along, there's lots of thrills; but I mean it's mostly work.

I have mumbled on pages and have said very little I'm afraid — I love you all very much —





Your ever devoted son, Pop

P.S. While I remember — don't ever send me any packages. They take ages and always get crushed.

July 12, 1944 Dear Mum and Dad,

...First while I remember I am enclosing a copy of a letter from Jim Wykes' mother, Mrs. Anna Wykes (don't know husband's name). Please save it for me, Mum. It is to me a beautiful letter, perhaps not eloquent or verbose, but one written from the depths of a loving mother's heart. How my heart aches for them. Jim has 2 brothers, both in service, and then his Mother and Father. Still no word of him and though I have not given up all hope, it is a bit discouraging. Today Bush Daniels, Lou Grab & I were standing at the small boat landing when a dark-skinned fellow jumped out of a little landing boat. He looked an awful lot like Jim and the 3 of us just stared. Unfortunately it wasn't he at all. I told you that Bob Whalen, Wykes' gunner, is married and his wife is with child. That, too, is terribly sad. I didn't mean to dwell on this subject for so long, but Jim was very close to me, and I feel his loss more each day. He has not been the only fellow I know that has been lost — not by a long shot — but I knew him so well....





Lots of love, Pop





------





July 21st Dear Mum and Dad,

...During these last few hectic days, I have had little time for reading or the like -- most fun when you get the chance is to stretch out on the sack or in a ready room chair and think. I also try to figure out what I'll do after the war.

One thing which appeals to me, is a job like Pressy's — go to S. America for a year ( not much more). It would be fun provided, of course, Bar were with me. The whole fun of it would lie in our being together — laughing and stumbling along in Portuguese, Espanol or what have you....Barbara with her Northampton Spanish, me with none at all — live in some small cottage. The only thing I'd be scared of would be that she'd be lonely — miles away from her family and friends. I wouldn't care what kind of work I did.

So far I haven't been able to make up my mind on what I want to do....Further education isn't out of my mind by a long shot. If I went to college I'd definitely find plenty to interest me — of that I am sure now. Before, I couldn't see that. It took the war, and the Navy to show me how advantageous a good education can be. I say advantageous and not necessary, for I do feel that I would get along with a bit of initiative and honest endeavor provided I could get some employer to give me a chance. I am prepared and fully cognizant of the fact that my salary will not be near what it is now. Barbara, too knows what to expect. When I return next fall I'll have saved $3000 — we can make that last awhile anyway. Besides the S. Amer. and college plans — there is a third — a regular job in the U.S....It would be nice to know I could get a job for sure — a job which would not require me to dig a ditch — merely because I don't have a ""college education.""...





Much love to all, Pop

July 22nd My Dear Mrs. Wykes,

I received your letter one week ago. We had been at sea for a long time — that accounts for the delay. I was very touched by your kind words.

I wish I could tell you exactly what happened to Jim, but I do not know — nor does anyone, I'm afraid. He just never returned from a search flight. We all felt certain that when we returned to port he would be there; However, when we did get back there was no trace of him. A search had been launched by another carrier, and everyone around that area was notified. It is entirely possible that at this very minute he is on some island. I know how hard it must be for you to keep your spirits up, but all of us must keep saying to ourselves that Jim is still alive. At times, I feel ""oh what's the use"", but then I check myself. As long as there is a thread of hope I think we should cling to it. Some of islands in the vicinity were enemy held, as there is always that possibility to consider. Others were practically uninhabited!

...I wish this letter could give you some new hope, some evidence that your loving son is all right, but I'm afraid I don't have such tidings. Lets just keep that ray of hope in our hearts and in our prayers, and perhaps our faith will be rewarded.

My sincerest affection to you and your family —





George Bush

[Jim Wykes was never found.]

Sunday July 30th Dear Mum and Dad,

...I wrote the Pierces a few days ago asking them how they felt about a wedding when I get back. I have been thinking about it so much and wondering how they felt that I just had to write. I don't ever like to think how it will be if they say ""No"". I have counted on it so much, even thought imaginary plans so often, and in fact just based my whole future around it, that I shall be very disappointed if they choose to make us wait.

...Incidentally, Dad, I would appreciate it, if you would let me know what you feel I should do after the war. As I have said before I do think I can get a job — a modest one at first of course, irregardless of my lack of college education. I wonder if you agree with me on this point....





Much love to one and all, Pop

Aug. 13th Sunday Dear Mum and Dad,

...People are talking a good deal about the election. It's hard to say what the consensus of opinion is — I think most feel FDR will win, but then most of the people I know around here seem to be Dewey voters. The southern boys will support Roosevelt. The ones I've talked with seem to think he's some sort of a god — I don't believe they look too closely at what the New Deal administration has done or has not done....





Much love to all, Pop

Aug. 19th Dear Mum and Dad,

...Got a letter from Mr. Pierce telling me that they did approve of our plans. I felt sure they would, but now that I have that definite 'yes' I feel terribly glad. From what he said, Bar is going to leave Smith since she wouldn't have time to complete the term. It will be nice for her to be with her family for a while anyway. I hope she comes up to Maine with you. If only I could snap my fingers and have these next months shoot swiftly by — I have so much to look forward to now — so very much!

...Mrs. GHWB — long but very nice! We are going to be the happiest Mr. & Mrs. going -- or shall I say the happiest young Mr. & Mrs. going?

...Will stop now as it is almost time for dinner. Steak tonite I think. Usually the steaks have a great deal in common with an old sneaker sole, but occasionally a good one slips past the cook and the mess boys and gets as far as one of the tables.

Of course you heard about the muscular fellow who got himself a job at the zoo. He applied to be a trainer but when they told him they only needed an ape (since theirs had died) he volunteered to act as an ape. They gave him a costume and for several days he thrilled the customers with his ape-like antics. One day he did a terrific somersault, but unfortunately he landed in the lions cage. As the ferocious lion began to draw near him, the fellow started to holler and yell and run for the door. Suddenly the lion spoke up and said, ""Take it easy, buddy, do you want to get us both fired?!

Much love to all the family,





Ever devotedly, Pop

August 24th Dear Mum and Dad,

...Gosh I'd like to see you all now — I miss you so much. Give all the family my love. John'll be going back for his 8th and last year soon I imagine and William should be about ready to battle his way into grade 1. I get such a kick out of Buck -- I picture him so clearly at all times — He is sort of a symbol to me in a way. I remember how Bar & I used to play with him. We'd pretend he was our little boy. I don't know why, but little old Buck so often is brought to my mind — even when I'm up flying I'll burst out laughing at times....Perhaps it's because he's so young and innocent....

Today Rumania quit the war, according to a press release we received. That is indeed a good sign that that phase of this war should be over before too long. I hope the guilty receive treatment they deserve. I feel so strongly that the Nazis, fascist, or whatever moniker they use, should all be dealt with severely. The leaders — those responsible for murder, famine, treachery, etc. must be killed. I hope our government and our allies act boldly and powerfully and mete out severe but just penalties. If this is not done with all leaders who have collaborated with the Nazis, whether they be recognized heads of government or quislings ruling in conquered countries, I fear these 4 years of bloodshed will have been for naught....





Ever devotedly, Pop

September 3, 1944 Dear Mother and Dad,

This will be the first letter you have gotten from me in a good long while. I wish I could tell you that as I write this I am feeling well and happy. Physically I am O.K., but I am troubled inside and with good cause. Here is the whole story at least as much of it as I am allowed to relate right now.

Yesterday was a day which will long stand in my memory. I was on a bombing hop with Delaney as my radioman and Lt. (j.g.) Ted White as my gunner. He did not usually fly, but I asked him if he would like to go with me and he wanted to. We had the usual joking around in the ready room about having to bail out etc. — at that time it all seemed so friendly and innocent but now it seems awful and sinister.

I will have to skip all the details of the attack as they would not pass the censorship, but the fact remains that we got hit. The cockpit filled with smoke and I told the boys in back to get their parachutes on. They didn't answer at all, but I looked around and couldn't see Ted in the turret so I assumed he had gone below to get his chute fastened on. I headed the plane out to sea and put on the throttle so as we could get away from the land as much as possible. I am not too clear about the next parts. I told them to bail out, and then I called up the skipper and told him I was bailing out. My crewmen never acknowledged either transmission, and yet the radio gear was working — at least mine was and unless they had been hit back there theirs should have been, as we had talked not long before. I heard the skipper say something but things were happening so fast that I don't quite remember what it was. I turned the plane up in an attitude so as to take pressure off the back hatch so the boys could get out. After that I straightened up and started to get out myself. At that time I felt certain that they had bailed out. The cockpit was full of smoke and I was choking from it. I glanced at the wings and noticed that they were on fire. I still do not know where we got hit and never will. I am now beginning to think that perhaps some of the fragments may have either killed the two in back, or possibly knocked out their communications.

Fortunately I had fastened all my straps before the dive and also I had left my hatch open, something I hadn't been doing before. Just the day before I had asked the skipper and he advised leaving it open in a dive. The jump itself wasn't too bad. I stuck my head out first and the old wind really blew me the rest of the way out. I do remember tugging at my radio cord which I had forgotten to unplug. As I left the plane my head struck the tail. I now have a cut head and bruised eye but it is far from serious. After jumping, I must have pulled the ripcord too soon for when I was floating down, I looked up at the canopy and several of the panels were all ripped out. Just as I got floating down, I saw the plane strike the water. In the meantime, I noticed there was a liferaft down in the water. Not until later did I discover that it was mine that was supposed to be attached to my lifejacket. I had forgotten to hook it on, and when I left the plane it had come loose and had fallen into the water. Fortunately, the wind didn't carry me too far away from the raft. The entrance into the water was not too bad. I had unloosened several of my chute straps so that when it came to getting out of the harness I wouldn't have too many buckles to undo under the water. I went fairly deep under when I hit, but not deep enough to notice any pressure or anything. I shook the harness and the wind carried the chute away on the water. The wind was blowing towards shore, so I made every effort to head the other way. The skipper saw me and he saw my raft, so he made a pass over it to point it out to me. I had inflated my mae west and then started swimming towards the raft. Fortunately, the fall hadn't injured the boat, so it inflated easily and I struggled into it. I then realized that I had overexerted myself swimming, because suddenly I felt quite tired. I was still afraid that the wind would take me in closer so I began paddling. It was a hell of a job to keep the water out of the raft. In fact I never did get it bailed out completely. At first I was scared that perhaps a boat would put out from the shore which was very close by, but I guess our planes made them think twice about that. A few fighter planes stayed nearby the whole time until I was rescued and you can imagine how comfortable that was. One of them came right over me and dropped me some medical supplies which were most welcome, since I had no idea how badly cut up I was. It turned out to be slight, but did use the iodine anyway. I had some dye marker attached to my life jacket and also there was some in the raft so I sprinkled a bit of that on the water so the planes could see me easily. I took inventory of my supplies and discovered that I had no water. The water had broken open when the raft fell from the plane I imagine. I had a mirror and some other equipment, and also was wearing my own gun and knife.

There was no sign of Del or Ted anywhere around. I looked as I floated down and afterwards kept my eye open from the raft, but to no avail. The fact that our planes didn't seem to be searching anymore showed me pretty clearly that they had not gotten out. I'm afraid I was pretty much of a sissy about it cause I sat in my raft and sobbed for awhile. It bothers me so very much. I did tell them and when I bailed out I felt that they must have gone, and yet now I feel so terribly responsible for their fate, Oh so much right now. Perhaps as the days go by it will all change and I will be able to look upon it in a different light.

I floated around for a couple of hours during which time I was violently sick to my stomach. and then the planes started zooming me, pointing out my position to my rescuers. You can imagine how happy I was when I saw this submarine hove into view. They pulled me out of the raft and took me below where they fixed me up in grand style. As I write this I am aboard the sub — don't know how long I will be here, or when I will get back to the squadron.

As I said physically I am o.k. The food aboard here is unequaled anywhere I have ever seen. I am getting plenty of sleep and am even standing watches so that I will get the air occasionally. My back ached as did my leg last nite, and also my seat was a bit sore from the chute straps, but the pharmacist mate rubbed me down and today I feel much better. Last nite I rolled and tossed. I kept reliving the whole experience. My heart aches for the families of those two boys with me. Delaney had always been a fine loyal crewman. His devotion to duty was at all times highly commendable and his personality most pleasing. I shall most certainly write to his family after I am sure they have been notified by the Bureau.

As for Ted White, I have spoken of him several times in my letters before. He was the fellow from Yale, one class ahead of Stu Clement. He comes from St. Paul Minn. White Bear Lake to be exact. Perhaps Dad, you know the family. If so do not write them until you get the word from me or elsewhere that the family has been officially notified. There is a possibility that they parachuted and I didn't see them, but I am afraid it is quite remote as we received a message aboard here last nite saying that only one chute opened. All in all it is terribly discouraging and frankly it bothers me a good deal.

As time goes by I shall add bits to this letter and will mail it at my earliest possible convenience. I shall do the same by Bar, but shall not go into detail like this over my experience so please read her the parts of this letter which might interest her. It's a funny thing how much I thought about Bar during the whole experience. What I wouldn't give to be with her right now. Just to see that lovely face and those beautiful eyes and to know she was by my side. Right now I long to be with you so much. To be with you both and to be with Bar is my main desire — at least it won't be too long, the time is going by quite rapidly.

Please excuse all my misspellings — they are caused not from ignorance but from carelessness in operating this machine.





much much love to you all, your ever devoted and loving son,

Pop





[I was shot down off the island of Chichi Jima, in the Bonins, and rescued by the USS Finback. I am still humbled by how lucky and blessed I was that an American submarine was patrolling the area and picked me up before the Japanese. I will also always be grateful to fellow pilot Doug West, who stuck with me as long as he could, strafing the Japanese boats and pointing his wing at my life raft so the Finback could find me. Years later we learned from the Japanese report of the incident that two parachutes were seen leaving the plane. That means a great deal to me — that at least one of my crewmates made it out of the plane — although he was never found. Right after the war, the Japanese commander in charge of Chichi Jima was tried and executed for eating the livers of captured American pilots. I like to tease Barbara that I almost ended up becoming an hors d'oeuvre.]

Sept. 5th Dear Mum and Dad,

I have just finished writing Bar a long letter so I will add a bit more to this one for you. I did tell Bar all about what happened, so disregard the part I wrote in the first part of this.

I am now standing Junior officer of the Deck watches and I really love them. I am not in any way a qualified submariner as you can well imagine, but armed with a pair of binoculars and dark glasses if I need them I can sweep the sea and skies pretty well. After my griping about the security watches aboard the ship it may seem funny my enjoying any watches, but here it is different. These watches afford me a good chance to get up topside and grab some of that fresh air. When we are submerged, I am utterly useless to them, but when on the surface I stand two watches a day — 6-8PM and 4-6AM. just a nice length.

The food continues to be excellent, with steaks, ice cream, chicken etc. in abundance. You actually can't believe how good the chow is. Of course they have a much smaller complement of officers to prepare for, but still the food is so much better that there is no comparison. As for sleep, I have been ""claiming more than my fair share"". I usually sleep all morning and also all nite until my watch comes up. The sacks are comfortable and so darn inviting. I'd love to see 'The Big One' trying to get in and out of some of them. Dad, you just couldn't do it. All the beds are fine once you get in — that is until you have to get out. I sort of get half way in and then have to pull the rest of me in like a worm. The boat is now overcrowded, having three extra officers aboard. But since two men are on watch all the time there is always a bed for everyone. The fellow coming off watch just crawls into the bed which his relief had been sleeping in....

So far diving and submerging haven't hurt my ears at all, and everything about this life agrees with me. I think I would still prefer flying, since you are out in the open so much more, but this would be my second choice.

All the officers, and crew too, are just as nice as they can be. The Captain is a peach. He eats his meals with us in the wardroom and is just as good a guy as you'd want to meet. Yesterday I got a hunk of liferaft and stamped the name of the ship and the date on it and then all the officers signed it. They also took some pictures the day they brought me aboard which I will try to get hold of to bring. Will quit now.





much love, Pop

September 8th Dear Mum and Dad,

...Haven't been doing a great deal out of the ordinary — just daydreaming the time away. It is such fun to think about getting home, the wedding and all that. I find myself bursting forth into song up on the bridge. I am not sure the others up there appreciate my efforts too much, but if they ever complain I am going to tell them that my mother feels I am potentially a second Caruso — and I don't mean Frank Caruso either....

One thing I do miss aboard here is my daily shower which I loved aboard the ship. Water cannot be produced as abundantly aboard this boat, so naturally we have to conserve whenever and wherever possible. One shower per week is the ration. Tomorrow I can take mine — wow do I need it (unattractive)....The clothes situation is far from serious since all we wear is sandals, undies and pants — no shirts, just undershirts for meals.

I hope you have not been worrying up till the time you received these letters. This may be the first you have heard of my experience, I don't know. I try to think about it as little as possible, yet I cannot get the thought of those two boys out of my mind. It is so different, reading about people getting killed etc. Even when Jim and Dick Houle were lost, though I did feel it deeply, it did not affect me as this has. Oh, I am O.K. — I do want to fly again and I shall not be scared of it, but I know I shall never be able to shake the memory of this incident, and I don't believe I want to completely. They were both such fine people....

I spent thirty days aboard the Finback while she completed her war patrol, getting off at Midway and flying to Pearl Harbor where I spent a couple of days on R&R. I could have rotated home, but I wanted to get back with my squadron. So eight weeks after being shot down, and after hitchhiking on various planes, I finally rejoined the San Jac at Ulithi in the Caroline Islands.

Nov. 3rd Dear Mum and Dad,

I have so much to write about that I hardly know where to start.

Yesterday I arrived back aboard, and it was one of the happiest moments of my life — I really mean that. The first guy I saw in the squadron was the skipper — He came down to the quarterdeck and greeted me. After that all the boys came around. I was so glad to see them — they are a good bunch alright. Lately (since I've been away) they have been thru hell. Almost everyone has been decorated for some deed or other and believe me they deserve it. They have had it tough and I am sorry I wasn't here to do my part....

The only sad part was to find that Tom Waters has been killed in action — a bombing attack. Tom roomed with Doug West, Jack, and I and we all liked him a lot....

First of all about the accident. It seems that someone else did get out of the plane, but his chute didn't open. I am sorry over that, but am glad that someone at least got out of the plane besides myself. I wrote Delaney's sister (Mary J. Delaney 34 Somerset St. Providence R.I.) and also Ted White's parents. I am afraid the letters weren't very good but I do hope they know how I feel about the accident. Bush Daniels told me about how bravely the Whites received the news and I must say I do admire them, even though I don't know them.

...I am a little anxious over my first flight off the ship. I have flown so little lately that I will probably be rusty as can be.

I'm afraid you are wrong about my not having to come out again, though I hope you are right. This war is so big and so damn hard that you can never realize it fully unless you have actually studied it or been out here a while.





Your ever loving, Pop

Nov. 9th Dear Mum and Dad,

Quite a few days have elapsed since my first letter written from here upon my return. Since that first letter I have gotten back into the swing of things pretty much, having had 2 hops so far. Both went off o.k., and it was a relief to me, as I had been a bit anxious about landing aboard again after such a long lay-off.

...Everyone talks of only one thing and that is getting home. We are supposed to be relieved soon, but no one knows when; and then after we are relieved it will take a few weeks to actually get home....The vagueness must be hard on Bar. She has been so good about waiting and has never complained

...The election has come and gone and we now face 4 more years of FDR. There was hardly any talk of it on the 7th, probably cause most have felt that Dewey didn't have much of a chance. I know how discouraged you must be about it, and I feel the same way. My knowledge of the campaign etc. is not extensive, but from all reports it was not a pleasant one.





Much love, Pop

Dean Spratlin was one of my crewmates aboard the USS Finback.





Friday, Nov. 17th Dear Dean,

Just a note to let you know I finally did get back here to my original squadron and to thank you for everything you did for me aboard the Finback

Since my return I have been flying quite a bit — seems the boys want me to catch up with them.

We are heading home shortly — when exactly we don't know, but we're hoping it will be within the next couple of weeks at the most.

I still have a ""SPRAT"" undershirt and one mouldy ""SPRAT"" sock which you may receive thru the mail some day. Thanks again, Dean, for all you did for me. I really do appreciate it. Hope the new job is a good one and has gotten you back to the States --

Best of luck from a Goddamned zoomie —





very sincerely, George

Nov. 23rd Dear Mum and Dad,

...This morning we had a combination Thanksgiving & Memorial service. The memorial part was for all the fellows who have lost their lives — They read off all their names, and had several prayers. It was a nice service and I am glad they had it before we leave.

...I hope you all had a wonderful Thanksgiving day — I can picture each of you at the table now — John, Buck, and Nance. I hope Pres got home, but I have my doubts about this.

...This year Thanksgiving has more significance for me than ever; for heavens knows I have more to be thankful for than ever before — mainly all of you, my loving family and my own precious Bar and the happiness which will soon be ours; and then too my own life which has been guarded and protected during these last few months.

So long, Mum & Dad. I love you both so deeply and am ever thankful that God gave me two such wonderful parents.





Your ever loving and middle-sized, Pop

Dec. 1st Dear Mum and Dad,

This is the letter I have wanted to write to you for a long long time. At last I can tell you that we're coming home. I am all thru flying, combat complete, off the ship, and ready for a nice long leave. After you get this letter, it will still be quite a while before I reach the states and can call you up; but, nevertheless, I feel pretty damned happy. I wrote Bar this A.M., but in case her letter got waylaid, please call her and tell her.

Mum, when I do get back I shall call up both you & Bar. I'll give her a safe date when I'll definitely be in Greenwich, and she can set the wedding date...





Much, much love, Pop

Barbara had wedding invitations printed for December 17, but she had to scratch out that date as I did not make it home until Christmas Eve. We were married January 6, 1945, and after a short honeymoon, I went back into training. We jumped from base to base, among them Grosse Ile Air Station in Michigan. You will notice that after I got married, my letters home became rather sparse.





Dear Mum,

...Bar probably told you we had one room...It is a nice room and we were lucky to get it the first day; but it costs $14 per week and we don't get kitchen privileges, so now that we have time we are looking around for something else. Out at the base they help us find places....It's about 4 1/2 miles to the base and about 1é2 mile to the center of town. Bar walks in for lunch and then we walk in together for supper. They have one small-townish restaurant, but it's not too bad. It is sort of a lonely existence for poor Bar, but she doesn't complain at all, and I am just in heaven having her here.

...Bar has returned from the laundering and is now sitting at this table making a puzzle. Tomorrow she is going out to check on a new place to live.

...Our landlady has a electric massager which I love — I have had a sore shoulder for a week now, but it's well on its way to recovery. Bar is in good health, and is a perfect wife. It is such fun to come home and find her here — She always is in a good humor and when worryin' Pop appears on the scene she always cheers him up....





Your ever loving, Pop





------





Monday Dear Mum,

...Our landlady is funny — nice and friendly and I feel fine having Bar with her all day, but she is so odd. She thinks she is being so patriotic having these 2 rooms for rent, when actually she is making a mint on us. She even thinks she's making a huge sacrifice when she lets Bar use the laundry.

...Bar is quite the wife — launders, irons, cleans well etc. The only thing she hasn't tried is cooking but perhaps she'll get a chance at that soon....





Much love, Pop

Monday — 2/26/ Dear Mum and Dad,

Time seems to be whipping right by, but still no orders....There are rumors going around that a big nite Torpedo outfit is forming — may get stuck in that. I wouldn't like it too much, since I find it enough work flying off a carrier during the day. Worse than the nite part though is the possibility that it may form way down in the Florida Keys where you can't take wives. That would be too much to take....

Yesterday was my day off. Bar and I stayed in the whole day — just rested and read the papers and Newsweek.

...Bar had a little cold a few days ago but she is now completely cured. She is really a good cook now. The other day we had fancy shirred eggs. She is good on vegetables, too. Yesterday we had sausage, beets, and mashed potatoes, a real good lunch. She always has the ice box full of milk. We drink about 3 1/2 quarts a day, and that counts my eating lunch out here....





Your ever loving, Pop

On that rather dramatic statement about Barbara's cooking, the World War II letters end. My mother did not have any other letters in her collection.

Barbara and I bounced around the country for eight months, finally landing back at the Navy base in Norfolk, Virginia. My squadron had received orders to ship back out to the South Pacific, to participate in the invasion of Japan, when Japan surrendered and World War II ended on August 14, 1945. (Germany had surrendered in May.) Suddenly, it was over, and along with it, my three-year Navy career. Because I had flown fifty-eight combat missions and won the Distinguished Flying Cross, I had enough ""points"" to get an early discharge from the Navy.

As I look back on these letters, I realize how protected my life had been until I joined the Navy. In addition, although my childhood was very happy, my upbringing was also strict — indeed, puritanical. As a result, my vision of the world was narrow, and I was a little judgmental at age eighteen. Like most young people, my horizon needed expanding.

Most troubling, of course, was what happened to me on September 2, 1944. Although I am confident that I followed all the procedures necessary for getting my crew and myself out of my burning plane, it still haunts me today that I lived and my two crewmen died. Both John's and Ted's sisters visited me in the White House nearly fifty years later and were very kind to me. Unfortunately, my letters written to their families in 1944 have been lost.

All in all these are letters written from the heart from a loving son to his parents -- letters from a kid sometimes homesick, sometimes scared; and certainly from a kid who was madly in love with the woman who has now been his wife for nearly fifty-five years.",1,https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/first/b/bush-best.html?scp=25&sq=days%2520like%2520this&st=Search
82,Bush,George W.,newsone,"NewsOne Featured Video CLOSE

George H. W. Bush, the 41st president of the United States, died at the age of 94 on Friday in his beloved Texas. But while some news outlets remembered the former vice president, former director of the Central Intelligence Agency and father to the 43rd president as a devoted family man and war hero, others on social media said they still felt the lingering pain from one of the lower points of Bush’s political career.

The single term president won the White House in 1988, but not before his campaign put out a political ad that rubbed many the wrong way, especially African-Americans. At the time of a contentious election season, Republicans released the now-infamous TV commercial about a man named Willie Horton in order to explicitly exploit white fear of Black men.

Horton was a convicted murderer who raped a white woman while out of prison under a weekend furlough program in Massachusetts. His “scowling mug shot became a shorthand for out-of-control crime, dog-whistle racial politics, and who partly brought down Gov. Mike Dukakis’s presidential campaign,” Boston.com reminded readers in 2015.

As of early Saturday morning, “Willie Horton” was a top trending topic on Twitter, showing that news of Bush’s death was evoking not-so-fond memories of the 53-second ad intended to send white voters flocking to the polls to vote for the then-vice president in theoretical exchange for protection from the alleged hoards of Black criminals.

The ad falsely depicted Dukakis’ Massachusetts as the only place with a furlough program, as more than 40 states had similar programs, the Washington Post pointed out in 1988. The federal government also had a furlough program in the 1980s.

“I’m not this picture they paint – dumb nigger. You follow?’’ Horton said in 2015 interview with The Marshall Project. “I hate to use that word, but that’s the picture they painted. ‘He’s uneducated, he’s this, he’s that.’ I never lived up to that name that they painted with that picture, which was ‘Willie.’ My name is William. No one has ever called me ‘Willie.’’’

Despite the commercial (or, because of it), Bush and his vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle, who famously misspelled the word “potato,” beat Dukakis and his running mate Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen.

The commercial was widely seen by liberals and humanitarians alike as an effort to continue the nation’s tradition of white supremacy that has continued up until the current president, who recently released his own political ad that many people said was simply an updated version of the Willie Horton spot from three decades earlier.

Donald Trump tweeted the video on Halloween Day that blamed Democrats for allowing an undocumented Mexican immigrant to kill two California deputies in a sign that the president said meant that liberals would allow hoards of Hispanic migrants into the country to do more of the same.

The video showed deputies removing Luis Bracamontes from a courtroom in February because of his outbursts about killing more cops, during his sentencing.

“Illegal immigrant, Luis Bracamontes, killed our people!” reads the opening text of the ad. “Democrats let him stay.”

Watch the Willie Horton ad below to fully understand the still-simmering rage of Twitter users, in particular, who were resolute Friday evening and into Saturday morning in reminding the world of the hurt, pain and overall damage the commercial caused.",1,https://newsone.com/playlist/george-hw-bush-dies-willie-horton-ad/

No. 9844, , 84 F.R. 4949, provided: The current situation at the southern border presents a border security and humanitarian crisis that threatens core national security interests and constitutes a national emergency. The southern border is a major entry point for criminals, gang members, and illicit narcotics. The problem of large-scale unlawful migration through the southern border is long-standing, and despite the executive branch’s exercise of existing statutory authorities, the situation has worsened in certain respects in recent years. In particular, recent years have seen sharp increases in the number of family units entering and seeking entry to the United States and an inability to provide detention space for many of these aliens while their removal proceedings are pending. If not detained, such aliens are often released into the country and are often difficult to remove from the United States because they fail to appear for hearings, do not comply with orders of removal, or are otherwise difficult to locate. In response to the directive in my , memorandum and subsequent requests for support by the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Department of Defense has provided support and resources to the Department of Homeland Security at the southern border. Because of the gravity of the current emergency situation, it is necessary for the Armed Forces to provide additional support to address the crisis. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sections 201 and 301 of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) [50 U.S.C. 1621, 1631], hereby declare that a national emergency exists at the southern border of the United States, and that section 12302 of title 10, United States Code, is invoked and made available, according to its terms, to the Secretaries of the military departments concerned, subject to the direction of the Secretary of Defense in the case of the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. To provide additional authority to the Department of Defense to support the Federal Government’s response to the emergency at the southern border, I hereby declare that this emergency requires use of the Armed Forces and, in accordance with section 301 of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1631), that the construction authority provided in section 2808 of title 10, United States Code, is invoked and made available, according to its terms, to the Secretary of Defense and, at the discretion of the Secretary of Defense, to the Secretaries of the military departments. I hereby direct as follows: Section 1. The Secretary of Defense, or the Secretary of each relevant military department, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, shall order as many units or members of the Ready Reserve to active duty as the Secretary concerned, in the Secretary’s discretion, determines to be appropriate to assist and support the activities of the Secretary of Homeland Security at the southern border. Sec. 2. The Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and, subject to the discretion of the Secretary of Defense, the Secretaries of the military departments, shall take all appropriate actions, consistent with applicable law, to use or support the use of the authorities herein invoked, including, if necessary, the transfer and acceptance of jurisdiction over border lands. Sec. 3. This proclamation is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of February, in the year of our Lord two thousand nineteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-third. Donald J. Trump.

Continuation of National Emergency Declared by Proc. No. 9844 Notice of President of the United States, dated , 85 F.R. 8715, provided: On , by Proclamation 9844, I declared a national emergency concerning the southern border of the United States to deal with the border security and humanitarian crisis that threatens core national security interests. The ongoing border security and humanitarian crisis at the southern border of the United States continues to threaten our national security, including the security of the American people. The executive branch has taken steps to address the crisis, but further action is needed to address the humanitarian crisis and to control unlawful migration and the flow of narcotics and criminals across the southern border of the United States. For these reasons, the national emergency declared on , and the measures adopted on that date to respond to that emergency, must continue in effect beyond . Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Proclamation 9844 concerning the southern border of the United States. This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress. Donald J. Trump.

Proc. No. 9994. Declaring a National Emergency Concerning the Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Outbreak Proc. No. 9994, , 85 F.R. 15337, provided: In December 2019, a novel (new) coronavirus known as SARS–CoV–2 (“the virus”) was first detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, People’s Republic of China, causing outbreaks of the coronavirus disease COVID–19 that has now spread globally. The Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) declared a public health emergency on , under section 319 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 247d), in response to COVID–19. I have taken sweeping action to control the spread of the virus in the United States, including by suspending entry of foreign nationals seeking entry who had been physically present within the prior 14 days in certain jurisdictions where COVID–19 outbreaks have occurred, including the People’s Republic of China, the Islamic Republic of Iran, and the Schengen Area of Europe. The Federal Government, along with State and local governments, has taken preventive and proactive measures to slow the spread of the virus and treat those affected, including by instituting Federal quarantines for individuals evacuated from foreign nations, issuing a declaration pursuant to section 319F–3 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 247d–6d), and releasing policies to accelerate the acquisition of personal protective equipment and streamline bringing new diagnostic capabilities to laboratories. On , the World Health Organization announced that the COVID–19 outbreak can be characterized as a pandemic, as the rates of infection continue to rise in many locations around the world and across the United States. The spread of COVID–19 within our Nation’s communities threatens to strain our Nation’s healthcare systems. As of , 1,645 people from 47 States have been infected with the virus that causes COVID–19. It is incumbent on hospitals and medical facilities throughout the country to assess their preparedness posture and be prepared to surge capacity and capability. Additional measures, however, are needed to successfully contain and combat the virus in the United States. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sections 201 and 301 of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) [50 U.S.C. 1621, 1631] and consistent with section 1135 of the Social Security Act (SSA), as amended (42 U.S.C. 1320b–5), do hereby find and proclaim that the COVID–19 outbreak in the United States constitutes a national emergency, beginning . Pursuant to this declaration, I direct as follows: Section 1. Emergency Authority. The Secretary of HHS may exercise the authority under section 1135 of the SSA to temporarily waive or modify certain requirements of the Medicare, Medicaid, and State Children’s Health Insurance programs and of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Privacy Rule throughout the duration of the public health emergency declared in response to the COVID–19 outbreak. Sec. 2. Certification and Notice. In exercising this authority, the Secretary of HHS shall provide certification and advance written notice to the Congress as required by section 1135(d) of the SSA (42 U.S.C. 1320b–5(d)). Sec. 3. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this proclamation shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This proclamation shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This proclamation is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-fourth.

88,Bush,George W.,u,"Desert Storm

Operation Desert Storm, popularly known as the first Gulf War, was the successful U.S.-Allied response to Iraq's attempt to overwhelm neighboring Kuwait. Kuwait's liberation in 1991 brought to the battlefield a new era of military technology. Nearly all battles were aerial and ground combat within Iraq, Kuwait, and outlying areas of Saudi Arabia. Iraq inflicted little damage on the American coalition; however, they fired missiles on Israeli citizens. History At the request of the Kuwaitis, Kuwait had become a British Protectorate in 1889. British forces protected the area until 1961. Kuwait was a part of Iraq until 1923, when borders were drawn. On June 19, 1961, British protection ended and Kuwait joined the Arab League. Iraq objected strongly and claimed that Kuwait was part of their territory. Kuwait formed its own constitution on January 1963. Accordingly, the emir held the executive power, organized with a group of ministers. By January 23, a national assembly was elected. By October, 1963, Iraq gave up its claim on Kuwait. Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein wanted to regain that lost land for Iraq, and so he invaded. Leading up to war On August 2, 1990, Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait. Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein had been making threats against Kuwait for some time, but his actual invasion caught most of the world by surprise. The magnitude of the invasion also was a surprise. Those who had expected an attack, such as the commander of U.S. Central Command, Norman Schwarzkopf, expected a limited attack to seize Kuwaiti oil fields. Instead, within a number of hours, Iraqi forces had seized downtown Kuwait City and were headed south toward the Saudi Arabia border. Word of the Iraqi attack reached Washington, D.C., as Iraqi forces assembled at the Saudi border. The Pentagon had plans in place to aid the Saudis, and U.S. forces went on standby for the Saudis' request. Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney and General Schwarzkopf met with King Fahd of Saudi Arabia to brief him on the plans, which he approved. Within minutes of the meeting, orders were issued, and thus began the largest buildup of American forces since the Vietnam War. Within a short period, members of the 82nd Airborne Division, as well as 300 combat aircraft, were headed for Saudi Arabia. A deadline set for Saddam Hussein By the end of September 1990, there were nearly 200,000 American personnel in Saudi Arabia — enough to repel any Iraqi attack. The initial plan to drive Iraqi forces from Kuwait called for a direct offensive aimed at Kuwait City; but Schwarzkopf and other American commanders thought that the risk was too great against heavily armed, well-entrenched defenders. Instead, they called for additional troops to prepare for the largest military cleanup ever seen. President Bush (with Saudi approval) ordered an additional 140,000 soldiers, including the Third Armored Division with its Abrams M1A tanks. During that period, reinforcements from numerous other nations arrived, including British, French, Egyptian and even Syrian forces. On November 29, the UN Security Council passed a resolution authorizing the use of force if Iraq did not withdraw from Kuwait by January 15.

Superior U.S. air power On the morning of January 16, 1991, Allied forces began the first phase of Desert Storm, also known as Desert Shield. American forces first destroyed Iraqi border radar stations, then other key elements of the Iraqi anti-aircraft network; lastly, they began to bomb key targets in downtown Iraq, including the presidential palace, communication centers, and power stations. The Allied forces lost only two aircraft during the attacks. The assault continued day and night. Those initial air attacks constituted the first time the American military witnessed how their new arsenal performed in combat conditions. With such ground systems as the M1A1 Abrams missile and the MIM-104 Patriot missile, the Iraq military had little opportunity to defend themselves. Also, such other groundbreaking technology as the Global Positioning System (GPS), helped to pinpoint hits by the Tomahawk missile and other weapons. The damage done by U.S. air attacks was devastating to Saddam's vaunted Republican Guard. The following U.S. aircraft left ""a big hurt"" on the enemy during the war: AH-64 Apache helicopters, B-52 Stratofortress bombers, E-3 AWACS surveillance aircraft, F-117A Stealth fighters, E-8C JSTARS radar command posts, and the RPVs (drones). Overall, the coalition air campaign (consisting mostly of U.S. pilots) accumulated a total of 109,876 sorties over the 43-day air war — averaging 2,555 sorties per day. Of those, more than 27,000 sorties struck enemy Scuds, airfields, air defenses, electrical power, biological and chemical weapons caches, headquarters, intelligence assets, communications, the Iraqi army, and oil refineries. Scuds fired at Israel and the attack on Al Khafji At 3 a.m on January 17, the Iraqis fired seven Scud missiles at Israel. Israelis were awaiting the Scuds with gas masks on, thanks to Saddam's previous threats to burn half of Israel with chemical weapons. As it turned out, the Scuds bore only conventional warheads, but their terror value was high. To avoid a wider war, U.S. officials pleaded with Israeli officials to not respond to the Scud attacks. The Israelis agreed because the Americans promised to target all Scud missile sites and knock them out. On January 29, following two weeks of punishing coalition air assaults, the Iraqis mounted their one and only attack subsequent to the invasion at the Battle of Khafji. The Iraqi Fifth Mechanized Division attacked south, capturing the Saudi town of Al Khafji eight miles south of the Kuwaiti border. The Iraqis overran the first Saudi force that attempted a counterattack and, despite massive American air attacks, they held on to the town through the day and night. The next day was a different story, however, when Saudis recaptured the town, forcing the remaining Iraqis to flee to the Kuwaiti border. Operation Desert Sabre After a 38-day air campaign, Operation Desert Sabre, a massive ground attack, was launched by Americans and the coalition into both Iraq and Kuwait. Day One ground attack. On February 24th at 4 a.m., Allied troops led by U.S. Marines crossed the border into Iraq. During the days before the attack, Iraqi troops had been subjected to merciless air attacks; every imaginable target was destroyed with accuracy. The Allied offensive targeted three major offensive venues: the first aimed at Kuwait City, the second to the west aimed at the Iraqi flank, and the final one far to the west, beyond the major Iraqi lines that would totally outflank Iraqi lines. In the first day of the war the marines advanced halfway to Kuwait City and the western advances proceeded without difficulty — while capturing thousands of Iraqi deserters. The first day of ground fighting resulted in minimal American casualties. Day Two ground attack. As Day Two approached, an Iraqi Scud missile destroyed the U.S. barracks in Dhahran, killing 28 U.S. soldiers. With morale nevertheless high, American troops advanced on all fronts. The marines approached Kuwait City, while the western flank began to cut off the Iraqi Army's retreat route. Coalition casualties for Day Two were, once again, light. Day Three ground attack Day Three dawned on the largest tank battle in history. The American armored forces engaged the tank forces of the Iraqi Republican guard. Like shooting fish in a barrel, the American tanks destroyed the Iraqi heavy armor without losing a single tank. On February 26th, Iraqi troops began to retreat from Kuwait while setting fire to an estimated 700 Kuwaiti oil wells. A long convoy of Iraqi troops, as well as Iraqi and Palestinian civilians, formed along the main Iraq-Kuwait highway. That convoy was bombed so relentlessly by the Allies that it came to be known as the ""Highway of Death."" One hundred hours after the ground campaign began, President Bush declared a cease-fire — declaring the liberation of Kuwait on February 27, 1991. Postwar epilogue On April 5th, 1991, President Bush announced that U.S. relief supply airdrops would be made to Kurdish refugees in Turkey and northern Iraq. After Iraq issued its acceptance of a cease-fire, Task Force Provide Comfort was formed and deployed to assist the Kurds. The U.S. transport delivered some 72,000 pounds of supplies in the first six Operation Provide Comfort missions. By April 20, the construction of the first Provide Comfort tent city began near Zakhu, Iraq. By war's end, U.S. forces released 71,204 Iraqi prisoners to Saudi control. U.S. casualties

89,Bush,George W.,fair,"Audience Member: I was wondering if you felt there was a difference between balanced reporting and objective reporting? And the thing that kind of sticks in my mind frequently is when President Bush on the stump would frequently pull out the “global test” that John Kerry mentioned in the debate, but he would completely twist the meaning of the whole phrase around. . . . Essentially, what I feel like was a lie that the president just stated . . . was never objectively reported on. . . .

Elisabeth Bumiller (New York Times): Yeah, this was an issue we dealt with at the paper because, you know, very early on it became clear that both George Bush and John Kerry were distorting, making exaggerated and distorted statements about each other’s records. And it was very frustrating for a reporter out on the campaign, when you’ve got an hour to file and you’re in three states in one day, and you know, George Bush says this—you then get a call from the Kerry campaign, the Kerry campaign people responding, but they’re not actually addressing the charge that George Bush has made. They’re just launching a countercharge, which is also probably distorted. So it’s very difficult to actually sort it out when you’ve got an hour to file and you’re on a plane.

So what we did—and it was one of the most successful things I think we did in this campaign—we got a fact-check column going by David Rosenbaum, my colleague. And he would write, you know, whenever, periodically, but sometimes, he would just, we would just insert what he wrote into my story or anybody’s story, you know, “In fact, comma, George Bush, Mr. Bush was slightly distorting, you know, the senator’s comments. What he said was this and blah, blah, blah.”. . .

Susan Page (USA Today): One of the real challenges, I think, in daily journalism, is it’s easy to have the appearance of balance; you know, “Bush charged that Kerry was a serial murderer, Kerry denied it.” So there both sides have had their say, so it’s balanced, and it’s harder to really do a substantive analysis of charge and counter-charge, especially if it turns out that one side is right and the other is wrong.

Bumiller: That’s why it’s very hard to write those, because you can’t say George Bush is wrong here. There’s no way you can say that in the New York Times. So we contort ourselves up and say, “Actually”— I actually once wrote this sentence: “Mr. Bush’s statement did not exactly . . . ” It was some completely upside down statement that was basically saying he wasn’t telling the truth. And I got an email from somebody saying, “What’s wrong with you guys? Why can’t you just say it plainly?” But there’s just—

Loren Ghiglione (Medill School of Journalism, Moderator): Why can’t you say it plainly?

Bumiller: You can’t just say the president is lying. You don’t just say that in the . . . you just say—

Ghiglione: Well, why can’t you?

[laughter from the audience]

Bumiller: You can in an editorial, but I’m sorry, you can’t in a news column. Mr. Bush is lying? You can say Mr. Bush is, you can say. . . .

[Murmuring and laughter continue from audience.]

Bumiller [to audience]: And stop the fussing! You can say Mr. Bush’s statement was not factually accurate. You can’t say the president is lying—that’s a judgment call.

Page: I think its much more powerful to say, “However, the president’s statement did not reflect the record”—

Bumiller: Or “was not factually accurate.”

Page: “Was not factually accurate.” I think that’s more powerful than. . . .

[Audience continues to murmur.]

Bumiller [to audience]: What is wrong with that? What is your problem with that? What? Why do you all object to that? OK. . . .

Ghiglione: Well, let’s not open it up to everybody in this room.

[laughter from audience]

Bumiller: But you know, it’s like my email, people.

Page: When you do the really serious attempt at balance and accuracy, it often looks more imbalanced, because often times one side is at fault, is truly misrepresenting. It’s a tricky thing. I remember, for instance, we did a story on negative advertising and it said, “on the one hand, on the other hand”—“the Bush people had done this and then the Kerry people had done this”—and then the Times did the same story a couple days later that said, “The Bush campaign has engaged in much more negative advertising than the Kerry people—most negative campaign in the history of American politics,” or something powerful, which looked more powerful and was a better story than we did. But our story is the one you would look at and say was the balanced one. Because it had a one-hand/on-the-other-hand quality to it.

93,Bush,George W.,mediaite,"Earlier this week, the Washington Post’s Jenna Johnson wrote a piece detailing President Donald Trump’s tendency to say “people don’t realize” or “most people don’t even know” when describing historical facts. “Is Trump playing the role of educator in chief, or simply sharing historical facts he’s newly learned?” Johnson wrote in the piece.

During a Hardball panel on the topic, MSNBC host Chris Matthews obviously was in the camp that Trump was just learning about these things when he publicly speaks about them. And Matthews questioned whether the president had much of an education.

“First of all, I did know that the French were our allies in the American Revolution,” Matthews said. “And every Republican certainly knows that Lincoln was the first Republican president. ALL Republicans know that.”

The Hardball host continued, “Did Trump really go to college? I mean really. I mean really. Did he just go to business school? I think he just went to business school.”

After the panel joked a bit about Trump going to Wharton and what courses he took there, Matthews dinged the president a bit more over what Matthews felt the public was witnessing.

He’s learning it on our watch so we have to actually listen to him say ‘Guess what, I bet you didn’t know,'” Matthews stated, leading The Root’s Jason Johnson to compare Trump to a seven-year-old learning new words for the first time.

“He democratizes his ignorance,” Matthews exclaimed. “If I don’t know it, you don’t know it. Nobody knows it!”

94,Bush,George W.,mediaite,"After publicly touting a conspiracy theory that Jews control the weather last month, D.C. Council member Trayon White (D-Ward 8) did nothing to improve his image after taking off from Washington’s Holocaust Memorial Museum midway through a scheduled tour.

The tour had been planned to last 90 minutes, but White disappeared after completing half of it, claiming he was too busy to stay, The Washington Post reported.

When texted by Rabbi Batya Glazer, who had been on the tour with him and was unsure of where he went, White said he was hoping to meet her outside but that he was about to leave for a Ward 8 event, the outlet said.

During the time he actually spent on the tour, White suggested an image of a German girl being marched through the streets of Norden in 1935 as humiliation for an alleged relationship with a Jew was actually depicting her being protected by the Nazi troops surrounding her. It was at that moment that a museum expert pointed out that his interpretation of the photo was inaccurate, The Post said.

On March 16, White sparked outrage with a Facebook post claiming the snowy weather that morning was caused by the Rothschilds, a line of Jewish financiers.

“Man, it just started snowing out of nowhere this morning, man,” he wrote in the post. “Y’all better pay attention to this climate control, man, this climate manipulation. And D.C. keep talking about, ‘We a resilient city.’ And that’s a model based off the Rothschilds controlling the climate to create natural disasters they can pay for to own the cities, man. Be careful.”

Northwest Washington Rabbi Daniel Zemel spoke out against the hate speech, calling it “unacceptable in any public official,” The Post reported. “This so diminishes what America is about and adds to the oppressive feeling going on in the country right now,” he said. “We all have to be better. Public officials have to learn not to say the first ignorant thing that comes into their head.”

95,Bush,George W.,mediaite,"President Donald Trump has now reacted to the news that the Justice Department’s inspector general has sent a criminal referral on former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe to the US attorney’s office.

And it was pretty much what you expected.

James Comey just threw Andrew McCabe “under the bus.” Inspector General’s Report on McCabe is a disaster for both of them! Getting a little (lot) of their own medicine? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 19, 2018

As you can see in the tweet above, the president wrote that ex-FBI Director James Comey threw McCabe “under the bus,” likely referring to Comey’s interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper. Additionally, POTUS stated that the report was a “disaster for both of them” and that they were getting “a little (lot) of their own medicine.”

96,Bush,George W.,mediaite,"The Republican National Committee is sending out a furry costumed lion to stalk James Comey on his book tour.

The Hill reported the appearance of ‘Lyin Lion Comey’ at Comey’s tour stops, with CNN’s Jeff Zeleny tweeting out that CNN “has learned the Republican campaign to discredit the former FBI director is now turning to lions, including this fury costumed creature who will be tailing Comey on his upcoming book tour. This gives new meaning to the role of tracker.”

The furry stalker is just the GOP’s latest attempt to discredit the Trump-fired FBI director, who has been making regular rounds on the network news to promote his new book, including a much-touted appearance on ABC News.

In addition to the lion stunt, the RNC has recently launched a website that claims to set the record straight about Comey who, according to the webpage “wants to portray himself as a non-partisan, by-the-book Boy Scout rather than a politically motivated Washington insider.”

97,Bush,George W.,mediaite,"Fox Business Network anchor Lou Dobbs declared that President Donald Trump was “vindicated” after Bloomberg reported on Thursday that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein told the president he was not the target of the ongoing Robert Mueller probe.

“End the Witch Hunt Now!” Dobbs tweeted out, before stressing Rosenstein said Trump is “not a target in the Mueller probe or Cohen investigation.”

End the Witch Hunt Now!- President @realDonaldTrump is vindicated after Rosenstein tells him he’s NOT a target in the Mueller probe or Cohen investigation. Join #Dobbs on FBN7p. #MAGA #TrumpTrain #DTS — Lou Dobbs (@LouDobbs) April 19, 2018

According to Bloomberg’s report, which cites two people familiar with the matter, Rosenstein brought up the matter himself when speaking with Trump last week and after that discussion, Trump told his close advisors that he did not think it was the right time to fire either man.

Trump, likewise, seemed to signal a shift in his view of Mueller and Rosenstein when he spoke to reporters on Wednesday, noting that while people have been saying that he plans to get rid of both men, “they’re still here. We want to get the investigation over with, done with, put it behind us. And we have to get back to business.”

Yet, despite Dobbs’ glee and Trump’s softened stance, a top government official told Bloomberg that it is hardly over for Trump just yet.

“Trump may not officially be a target but Mueller hasn’t ruled out making him one at some point in the future,” the official stressed.

98,Bush,George W.,mediaite,"Former FBI Director James Comey pushed back on claims made by Democrats and Republicans that he’s partisan, reasoning that supporters of President Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton couldn’t argue he was taking sides.

“They both can’t be right that I’m in the other team’s pocket,” he told CNN’s Jake Tapper Thursday.

Facing a tough line of questioning from Tapper, who called Comey “reviled by the Hillary Clinton partisans and the Donald Trump partisans,” the ousted FBI head said he was warned long ago.

“It means mostly that my deputy was right when he told me in the summer of 2015 that I’m totally screwed as this investigation began, but…doesn’t mean that I’m right that everybody hates me,” he admitted. “I could still be wrong.”

Comey added that he felt the job of an FBI employee, by its nature, does not involve adopting partisan stances.

“The challenge of being the FBI in today’s political environment is you’re not on anybody’s side,” he said. “That confuses people, which I get, and it angers people, which I also get, and there’s only so much you can do about it except constantly try to show transparency. Show people your work so that fair-minded people can make a judgment, and that’s what I’ve tried to do in this book.”

Comey’s CNN appearance was the second in a round of promotional interviews for his new book, A Higher Loyalty, which details his experiences in the Trump administration as well as the time leading up to the 2016 election.

99,Bush,George W.,mediaite,"Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein assured President Donald Trump he is not being targeted in any way by Special Counsel Robert Mueller‘s probe, sources told Bloomberg.

Rosenstein gave the guarantee in a White House meeting with the president last Thursday, raising the discussion of the Mueller investigation on his own. Following the meeting’s conclusion, Trump reportedly told his advisers he’s not interested in firing Rosenstein or Mueller, since he isn’t being targeted. One person told Bloomberg that the president wanted to avoid making any moves that would prolong the investigation.

It’s an about-face for Trump, who previously railed against the investigation with such force that it was widely believed Mueller and Rosenstein would be ousted. Growing concerns over possible terminations even led certain lawmakers to argue for the passing of protective legislation for Mueller to safeguard his position.

While Rosenstein says Trump isn’t a focus of the investigation, it’s possible Mueller could make him one later on, one U.S. official familiar with the probe said, according to Bloomberg.

Likewise, Trump hasn’t totally nixed the idea of firing the duo in the future. However, Attorney General Jeff Sessions has already openly stated he would be shocked if the president removed Mueller.

100,Bush,George W.,mediaite,"﻿

Dr. Ronny L. Jackson, the White House physician who President Donald Trump has tapped to lead the Veterans Affairs administration, is about to embark on one of the biggest challenges of his life — leading a team of 375,000 employees at one of the nation’s largest federal agencies.

One must wonder whether that challenge is more daunting for the expert doctor than another he endured years prior, and later told stories about to the likes of former President George W. Bush, the Washington Post reported on Thursday.

Apparently, Jackson once stitched his own genitals after suffering an accident. The doctor told Bush that performing the mini-operation on himself made him someone Bush could put his confidence in — after the president his leg open at his Texas ranch.

Via the Post:

One trait universally cited is Jackson’s storytelling ability. He has regaled colleagues with one particular tale about administering stitches on an intimate part of his body. He even recounted it for Bush after cutting himself with a hoe at the president’s ranch in Texas. As he prepared to stitch up his leg, Bush protested. “It’s okay, I’ve sewn myself up before,” Jackson replied, then told the president about his earlier injury, according to people familiar with the episode. That earned him an admiring nickname from Bush: Scrote.

There are so many fascinating points to this revelation, included in an exceptional profile about the future VA secretary. For starters, Jackson appears comfortable with the fact that he stitched his own balls — so much so, he told a president about the experience as a means of relaxing him before stitching the commander in chief.

Perhaps even more exceptional is that Bush went on to affectionately refer to his own White House physician — one hailed across party lines as a professional in every way — as “Scrote.”

Now, “Scrote” will go on to lead Trump’s Veterans Affairs administration after former Secretary David Shulkin was fired via Twitter. Whether his new position in Trump’s Cabinet comes with an updated nickname remains unclear — at least for the time being.

101,Bush,George W.,abc,"Strap yourselves in for a massive 24 hours of great songs, stories and discussions from female-identifying artists, music programmers and presenters.

As Gemma Pike, our Assistant Music Director who’s programming the day said, it’ll be “very similar to a normal triple j day, but with even more female musicians!”

“It’s amazing that something so simple can instil such a sense of power and positivity. It’s great that at any time of the day a young girl can turn on the radio and be inspired by women just like her. Basically it’s a big warm fuzzy.”

A big inspiration for how we’ve chosen to celebrate the day, not just in name but in spirit, is a phrase that became synonymous with punk rockers Bikini Kill. The band became known for inviting female punters to stand at the front of the stage to avoid the particularly hectic mosh typical of the 90s punk scene. “We do encourage girls to the front,” said bassist Kathi Wilcox. “Sometimes when shows have gotten really violent we had to ask boys to move to the side or the back because it was just too fucking scary for us, after several attacks and threats, to face another sea of hostile boy-faces right in the front. Especially when it was at the expense of the girl who really wanted to see us.”

This was not a read on every male in existence, it was a reflection of the reality they were living. It was a genuine issue of safety but it was also a matter of them having the back of the people who were passionate about their music. The music industry can be an inhospitable place when you’re vastly outnumbered, for female fans and musicians alike. Women are not going to ever stop wanting to make music but between endemic sexual harassment, a canon of music comprising almost entirely of male musicians as decided by male critics, and unfunny dudes, there’s a lot of shit that’s only starting to be addressed in earnest this year. (Take, for instance, #MeNoMore).

As part of our now yearly female celebration situation, Hack has sought to get a clearer understanding of how women are tracking in the music industry today. They previously found that 1 in 5 artists registered with APRA in Australia are women and that of 120 independent Australian record labels registered with AIR, 80% are managed by men.

Dr Catherine Strong, a senior lecturer at RMIT who has done extensive research on gender in Australian music, says “we’re still really focused on a particular type of music and a particular set of musicians that were enshrined at a point in time when men really did dominate the industry.” This was both in terms of the musicians considered to be the best of the best — think The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan et cetera — but also when it came to the people writing about music and the people in control of music distribution.

“People think about taste as something that is really personal and really innate – like it just comes from within,” says Dr Catherine, “but it’s something that is very much socially constructed.” In Rolling Stone’s list of ‘100 Greatest Artists of All Time’ there are a total of eight acts which are either female solo artists or are a band with a female member. Strong continues: “The idea that there is something innate or genetic in men that women don’t have, that means they’re better at playing music or being creative is something that, I think, we can agree is just patently ridiculous.”

“So, if we don’t agree that there is something genetic that makes men better at these things, then the reason that there are more men out there being given opportunities and having their music played and being successful in the music industry has got to be something with the way that society is structured.”

What this kind of imbalance leads to, says Dr Catherine, is the much-discussed ‘Boys Club’ mentality coming out to play. Whilst she doesn’t see it all as some giant conspiracy to melt female resolve by George Bush , she believes it can be both deliberate and not. “Some guys really don’t like having women around, other guys are fine with women but they still engage with some of this exclusionary behaviour without realising they’re doing it.”

Dr Catherine believes there is a lot to be positive about, though, and that things are changing for the better. “We’re really seeing people recognising that these imbalances exist and actively trying to do something about it, instead of just saying ‘I’m sure it will fix itself over time.’”

For what it’s worth, the guys of triple j are nothing but supportive of Girls To The Front and the girls could not be prouder of what the day has become. Mostly, though, we’re playing back-to-back female musicians for International Women’s Day because we’re passionate about the music they’re making. It’s a real kick in the clit when, during conversations surrounding gender parity on line-ups, there’s a comment about there not being enough female acts to be found. Let Girls To The Front be a day of great music and of music discovery, so that less and less people are inclined to believe that we don’t have enough amazing talented female musicians in Australia to get behind.

It seems like a very long time ago that Kurt Cobain, good mate of Bikini Kill’s Kathleen Hanna and singer in a band you’ve definitely heard of, famously wrote, “I like the comfort in knowing that women are the only future in rock'n'roll”. Well, welcome to the world of tomorrow, music fans. There’s more than enough beats and bars in the world for everyone to play.

102,Bush,George W.,historynet,"Gerald Ford was angry. He had just barely beaten back a challenge from his bitter political rival, former California Governor Ronald Reagan, in the midst of perhaps the most divided Republican National Convention ever. Now, his two top aides, White House Chief of Staff Dick Cheney and Political Director Stuart Spencer, were challenging his judgment and resisting his idea to kick off the campaign in Russell, Kansas, the hometown of Sen. Bob Dole, who Ford selected to be his running mate.

“Bullshit!” blurted out Cheney and Spencer when Ford broached the idea of going to Russell. The men protested that staff members had worked for three days straight with no sleep and needed a rest. They argued back and forth, the president growing visibly irate, until his aides relented. When Spencer sighed and said “if that’s what you want, we’ll do it,” Ford grabbed the younger man by the arm and said: “Dammit, I know what I’m doing. I know a little bit about politics.”

From the start, Ford seemed an underdog president, and he endured several such moments of doubts about his judgment and challenges to his leadership during his term and the ensuing 1976 election campaign. He was the only chief executive not to have won election to the presidency or vice presidency. In October 1973, acting under the provisions of the 25th Amendment, President Richard M. Nixon nominated House minority leader Ford to be vice president after Spiro Agnew stepped down amid corruption charges. Then, in August 1974, when Nixon resigned because of his role in the Watergate cover-up, Ford took office. In his first address to the people as president, Ford assured Americans that the Watergate scandal had ended, proclaiming, “Our long national nightmare is over.”

Yet the unprecedented scandal’s stains still darkened the White House. On September 8, when Ford shocked the nation and issued Nixon a full and unconditional pardon for any crimes he may have committed against the United States while president, his approval ratings plunged. Other setbacks followed. In late 1974, the nation slipped into a deep recession, forcing Ford to abandon his much-touted anti-inflation initiatives and instead move to stimulate the economy. Meanwhile, the Cold War raged on and, when Communist North Vietnam overran South Vietnam in April 1975, Ford ordered all Americans in Saigon evacuated. The last sad chapter of the American war in Vietnam appeared to be a superpower in retreat.

Then, as attention turned to the 1976 presidential contest, the challenges came from within Ford’s party. Since his first election as a Michigan congressman in 1949, Ford had built solid credentials as a conservative Republican, yet as president, when he chose liberal Republican Nelson Rockefeller as vice president, conservatives were outraged, and some prepared to rebel. They supported Ronald Reagan, and both Cheney and Spencer recognized the threat that the former California governor posed. “Reagan had a major following in the party,” recalled Cheney, and he “had been shooting for the ’76 presidential campaign for probably eight years,” ever since an abortive run at the nomination in 1968. Spencer, who had been close to Reagan and helped engineer the former actor’s 1966 election as California governor, remembered Reagan “felt that he was the heir-apparent after Watergate,” with Ford just an appointed interim president. After the Nixon presidency collapsed, Reagan stoked his supporters with regular radio addresses and a newspaper column.

The Ford White House watched Reagan nervously, even after July 1975, when Ford said that he would seek a full term. Just four months later, on November 4, Ford announced that Rockefeller requested to be dropped from the 1976 ticket. The president dissembled about the move, later admitting that he asked the vice president to step aside to placate conservatives. Along with the Rockefeller announcement, on that same day Ford unveiled a massive administration overhaul, including the appointment of Donald Rumsfeld as defense secretary, George H.W. Bush as CIA director, and Cheney as White House chief of staff.

Rockefeller’s dismissal failed to deter Reagan who, on November 19, 1975, telephoned the Oval Office to tell Ford personally he would challenge him for the nomination. With that call, Ford’s political world changed. Instead of cruising to his party’s nomination as the sitting president, he would have to hit the campaign trail. The first primary in New Hampshire was critical, because if an incumbent were to lose that contest, the wound could be fatal.

Working for the president’s campaign, Spencer was in a unique position, since he knew both candidates and understood Reagan’s strengths and weaknesses. The former governor, Spencer said, was a “rhythm candidate.” Once he got into a campaign speaking rhythm, he was nearly impossible to beat. But “when you knock him out of that rhythm, all of a sudden he’s not the Ronald Reagan anymore,” Spencer observed. The Ford campaign had to throw Reagan off-balance, and the key was to dig up the hundreds of speeches that Reagan had made as he prepared to run for president. Making that many speeches, Spencer predicted, a presidential hopeful would get sloppy and say something outlandish.

And Reagan had. In September 1975, he proposed transferring $90 billion in federal programs to the states. Such a move would place a huge tax burden on states—political poison, the Ford campaign knew, in tax-averse New Hampshire. Just ahead of the primary, Ford staffers fed Reagan’s proposal to reporters, who then peppered him with questions and forced him on the defensive. “Reagan got out of rhythm,” Spencer recalled, and was “stumbling through New Hampshire, trying to answer questions that he couldn’t answer.” On primary day, by only 1,317 votes, the president scored a slim but crucial victory, proving Ford could compete at the national level. When news of the victory came, speechwriter Robert Orben recalled the president striding into the White House mess and declaring with satisfaction, “I hope that’s the last time I hear that the only elections I ever won were in my congressional district.”

When Ford won the next primaries in Massachusetts, Vermont and Florida, White House political operatives urged Reagan to quit. Even his own aides were privately suggesting that he consider bowing out. After all, the Republicans had enough problems already following Watergate without a divisive primary fight, and Ford and Reagan were close on most issues, including tax cuts, smaller government and a strong national defense. The entreaties only served to stir Reagan’s competitive juices. He told his aides that he would “run in every single primary from here to the convention even if I lose every single one,” and then managed to pull off a surprise victory in North Carolina.

Reagan was gaining traction with the fictitious charge that Ford had let U.S. military power slip behind the Soviet Union’s. Coming on the heels of the humiliating end of the Vietnam War, the accusation struck a responsive chord among conservatives, and for the rest of the primary season, Ford and Reagan traded blows. Ultimately, Ford won 15 state primaries to Reagan’s 12, but neither candidate won enough delegates to sew up the nomination before the August convention in Kansas City. For the first time in half a century, a political party headed into the summer uncertain of its nominee.

By contrast, Democrats were united as Jimmy Carter beat out a crowded field of presidential aspirants to emerge as the nominee. He was an unlikely candidate, a former one-term governor of Georgia with virtually no national name recognition. But he turned his inexperience into an asset, capitalizing on the post-Watergate distaste for Washington and saying, “I’ll never lie to you,” a promise that resonated with scandal-weary Americans. Carter forged a balanced ticket by picking a Midwest senator, Walter Mondale of Minnesota, as his running mate, and by July the Democrats were well prepared to take on whomever the GOP advanced as its candidate.

Until Ford became president, Cheney recalled, Reagan “was much better known….And the president had never run outside of Grand Rapids in his congressional races.” But as the incumbent, Ford enjoyed enormous advantages. Celebrating the country’s bicentennial in July 1976, the president functioned as the nation’s master of ceremonies, leading events in Washington, New York and Philadelphia. During these observances, Ford used the power of incumbency to woo uncommitted delegates, enjoying photo opportunities and a majesty that Reagan’s team could not summon. “We’d arrive in Air Force One, they’d arrive in charter. We’d have Secret Service, we’d have the trappings,” Spencer remembered. “All of those things we milked as much as we could.”

A major political blunder by Reagan also greatly aided Ford. The challenger took an unprecedented step by naming his running mate before the convention. In an effort to attract moderates, Reagan chose liberal Republican Sen. Richard Schweiker of Pennsylvania, a pick that infuriated loyal conservatives. Making matters worse, at the convention, the Reagan camp tried unsuccessfully to change procedural rules to force Ford to name his running mate early, a tactic that Ford’s staff dubbed “misery loves company.” In Kansas City, the momentum shifted toward the president, who won the nomination on the first ballot. In doing so, Ford thus became the only man ever to beat Reagan in a head-to-head political race.

A Ford-Reagan ticket might have quickly unified the party. But Reagan had declared himself out of consideration, and given the bruising battles and the poor personal chemistry between the men, they would have had trouble patching up their differences. “Ford wasn’t eager to have Reagan on the ticket. Reagan wasn’t eager to be on the ticket,” Cheney said. “There was a belief that that would have been the best combination we could have come up with. But they had been so competitive with one another through the course of the primaries,” Cheney remembered, that a Ford-Reagan combination was nearly impossible.

Instead, Ford chose Dole, who could help the ticket in the typically Republican farm states, which, in 1976, were trending toward Carter, a peanut farmer. Dole’s conservative reputation could also help in mending fences with Reagan’s supporters, an idea that Reagan seemed to confirm when he met alone with the president after Ford clinched the nomination. After Ford mentioned six possible running mates, Reagan singled out Dole, saying he would be excellent.

The first campaign stop in Kansas—which Ford, Cheney and Spencer had so vigorously argued over—proved a political boon. As Air Force One descended into Russell, Ford gleefully pointed out the window, showing aides that the roads were clogged with vehicles for miles. Dole gave an emotional speech in front of his hometown crowd, weeping as he thanked supporters. The heavy media coverage gave the Ford-Dole ticket a shot in the arm.

Ford desperately needed such drama. Trailing Carter by 33 points in the polls, he looked doomed to lose. In his nomination acceptance speech, he took a gamble, challenging Carter to debate on national television—something no sitting president had ever done. Ford had more to lose by giving Carter television exposure, and a poor performance—such as Vice President Nixon suffered in his 1960 face-off against Sen. John Kennedy—could do inestimable damage. Still, with Carter so far out front, the president needed to convert millions of voters to his side within just two months. “Shaking hands wasn’t going to get you there,” Cheney believed. “You had to come up with something far bolder…that would let you reach out and touch a lot more people. And that’s why the debates were attractive.”

Ford’s campaign team took another strategic gamble. They noticed that when Ford hit the hustings, his popularity in the polls took a dive. Even though people who met the president personally came away impressed with his warmth, his oratory was wooden. In a confidential memo, White House photographer David Kennerly boldly criticized the president: “Your speeches are usually long, boring, and filled with rhetoric that turns people off.” Ford’s strategists decided to keep him at the White House to act presidential, leaving the heavy hitting on the campaign trail to Dole.

Thus Ford adhered to a “Rose Garden strategy,” which one staffer dubbed the “no-campaign campaign.” By tending to economic policy and diplomacy, he remained above the fray. He did practice hard for the debates, rehearsing responses to questions and closing statements, and when the first debate took place in Philadelphia on September 23, Ford was ready. As he strode onto the stage wearing a three-piece suit, the executive image was clear, and at 6 feet 1 inch tall with a football player’s build, Ford cut a more impressive figure than his slender, 5-foot-10 opponent. Carter seemed tentative during the debate while Ford appeared in command, criticizing the former Georgia governor for vacillation and vagueness. He set the tone with his opening line: “I don’t believe that Mr. Carter has been any more specific in this case than he has been in many other instances.”

Polls showed that viewers considered Ford the narrow winner and—more important—his strong performance sliced into Carter’s lead. Carter further damaged his campaign with an embarrassing interview in Playboy. The venue was unusual enough—a magazine featuring nude women—but Carter’s revelations raised even more eyebrows. Though deeply religious, Carter displayed an odd tendency to mix crude language with pious pronouncements. After openly discussing his faith, he used terms like “screw” and “shack up” to discuss sex and then admitted: “I’ve looked on a lot of women with lust. I’ve committed adultery in my heart many times.”

Many Americans were shocked. While Carter had built his campaign around the post-Watergate yearning for honesty, this was too much. His words helped cast doubt upon the very character virtues that had brought him from political anonymity to his party’s nomination. He faltered in the polls, with one survey even showing him lagging behind Ford. Momentum—a critical factor in presidential races—was now on Ford’s side as he prepared for the second debate, focused on foreign policy, in San Francisco.

On paper, Ford seemed poised to dominate that contest. Whereas the former Georgia governor had no diplomatic experience, the president had traveled extensively overseas and could boast of arms-control negotiations with the Soviet Union, a first-ever presidential trip to Japan and the 1975 Helsinki Accords, which promoted human rights and greater freedom in the Soviet Union’s Eastern European satellites. But it was precisely that breakthrough that got Ford into trouble. Conservatives and Americans of Eastern European descent denounced the accords for allegedly ratifying the postwar Iron Curtain boundaries. Ford had grown defensive about those charges. When a debate panelist asked him about the Helsinki Accords, he reflexively hit back hard, proclaiming, “There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe, and there never will be under a Ford administration.” Ford had meant to say that he “does not accept” Soviet domination over Eastern Europe, but he flubbed the line and overstated his case. After four agonizing days of media criticism, Ford apologized and retracted the remark.

The mistake proved costly. Cheney remembered the fallout began just after the debate, when he faced reporters. As he walked to a podium, journalist Lou Cannon of the Washington Post “hollered at me from the back of the room. He said, ‘Hey, Cheney, how many Soviet divisions are there in Poland?’ And I knew right then we were in trouble.” Whereas Ford had built a head of steam after the first debate, he stalled in the polls after the second.

The next contest—a historic first-ever debate between vice presidential candidates—also hurt. Dole the campaigner showed a slashing wit that earned him epithets such as “hatchet man” and “Doberman Dole.” He lived up to the billing in his October 15 debate with Mondale, coming across as caustic and making an unfortunate remark about 20th-century “Democrat wars,” implying that the two world wars and other conflicts were partisan. Dole’s poll numbers fell, and Carter began reminding audiences of the “Ford-Dole” ticket to stimulate growing doubts about the president’s running mate.

As Election Day neared, perhaps the biggest blow to Ford’s prospects came from the faltering economy. Late in the summer, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the president’s Council of Economic Advisers, warned Ford that the economy would “pause” in rebounding from the recession, a normal economic hiccup but one that would slow the rate of recovery. By early fall, the pause had arrived, and in October, when September’s jobless statistics came out, the news was bleak, with unemployment at 7.8 percent. During the third and final presidential debate in Williamsburg, Va., Carter pounded away at economic themes, blaming Ford for “the highest unemployment rate since the Great Depression.” Still, the president pointed to the nation’s overall economic recovery, including substantially lower inflation.

During the last 10 days before the election, the Ford campaign unleashed a massive advertising blitz and, by November 2, Ford had pulled even with Carter in the polls. It was one of the greatest political comebacks in history.

But, on Election Day, as Cheney flew home with the president, “All the way across the country, there wasn’t a cloud in the sky,” he recalled. “I mean, it was just brilliant sunshine. And that meant we were going to get high voter turnout in a lot of the cities in the Democratic areas. So by the time we landed, I was concerned.” After watching returns late into the evening, Ford went to bed at 2 a.m., knowing Carter’s position was better than his.

Ford awoke the next morning to find he had lost to Carter by just 57 electoral votes and two points in the popular vote, 50 to 48 percent. He had won more states than Carter, 27 to 23, but, in addition to capturing the Democratic Northeast, Carter swept his native South, which Republicans had started to count as a stronghold during the 1960s. Carter also won more than 90 percent of African-American ballots, which proved a decisive margin.

Ford’s comeback effort “came very, very close—almost pulled it out,” Cheney later said. “I always felt good about the campaign because I felt like we gave it our best shot and that it was an uphill climb from the very beginning—partly because you had the Nixon pardon in the background and it was the first presidential campaign after Watergate. We were carrying all that baggage.”

The 1976 election reflected the country’s disillusionment after Watergate and telegraphed a trend. The scandal was the sword hanging over the election, and polls showed that by a 2-to-1 margin, Americans considered Ford’s pardon of Nixon wrong. That especially hurt Ford in Republican areas. Spencer reported “post-election studies showed that basically 7 percent of the Republicans in America couldn’t forgive Ford for pardoning Dick Nixon. That’s a big hunk of your base.” Watergate also made voters more leery of Washington’s professional politicians. In every election since Watergate, except for George H.W. Bush in 1988, the winner has come from outside the Beltway, typically a governor touting executive experience.

After leaving office, Ford often pointed to the Nixon pardon as the decisive factor in his defeat. However, had he not pardoned Nixon, he might have faltered sooner. A Nixon trial would have certainly stretched into 1976, keeping the disgraced president in the headlines and reminding Americans of Ford’s association with him—which might have tipped the balance in Reagan’s favor for the GOP nomination. Instead, the more moderate Ford prevailed, and in doing so helped rehabilitate the party. During Watergate’s darkest days, just 18 percent of voters identified themselves as Republicans, prompting Newsweek to wonder whether the GOP was “slowly and painfully dying.” By healing the party’s wounds and showing it was viable, Ford’s strong comeback and election performance breathed life back into the nation’s two-party system.

During retirement, when asked about his life’s greatest regret, Ford said that it was seeing little playing time until his senior year on the University of Michigan football team. Only after being reminded did he mention losing the 1976 election.

That response spoke volumes about Ford. He kept politics in perspective, never letting it loom too large, placing it behind his great loves, his family and sports. Ford especially showed pride in his family, and in 1976 his four children—Mike, Jack, Steve and Susan—campaigned for him. In later years, though, they expressed some relief that he lost the race, for it represented a trade-off. Steve Ford believed his father “lived probably 10 years longer because he didn’t win, because it takes so much off your life, that second term as president. Selfishly, I’m glad we had him around more as a father.”

Exactly three decades after that loss, Ford set a new record. In November 2006, at 93 years and four months, he became the oldest former president in history, beating the mark set by Ronald Reagan. Just weeks before he died in December, Ford once again had the satisfaction of besting his old rival.

103,Bush,George W.,alchetron,"George Walker Bush (born July 6, 1946) is an American politician who served as the 43rd President of the United States from 2001 to 2009. He was also the 46th Governor of Texas from 1995 to 2000. After graduating from Yale University in 1968 and Harvard Business School in 1975, he worked in the oil industry. Bush married Laura Welch in 1977 and ran unsuccessfully for the House of Representatives shortly thereafter. He later co-owned the Texas Rangers baseball team before defeating Ann Richards in the 1994 Texas gubernatorial election. Bush was elected president in 2000 after a close and controversial win over Democratic rival Al Gore, becoming the fourth president to be elected while receiving fewer popular votes than his opponent.

From a prominent political family, he is the eldest son of Barbara and George H. W. Bush, the 41st President of the United States, making him only the second president to assume the nation's highest office after his father, following the lead of John Quincy Adams. His brother, Jeb Bush, a former Governor of Florida, was a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in the 2016 presidential election. His paternal grandfather, Prescott Bush, was a United States Senator from Connecticut.

The September 11 terrorist attacks occurred eight months into Bush's first term as president. Bush responded with what became known as the Bush Doctrine: launching a ""War on Terror"", an international military campaign that included the war in Afghanistan in 2001 and the Iraq War in 2003. He also promoted policies on the economy, health care, education, Social Security reform, and amending the Constitution to prohibit same-sex marriage. He signed into law broad tax cuts, the Patriot Act, the No Child Left Behind Act, the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, Medicare prescription drug benefits for seniors, and funding for the AIDS relief program known as PEPFAR. His tenure included national debates on immigration, Social Security, electronic surveillance, and torture.

In the 2004 Presidential race, Bush defeated Democratic Senator John Kerry in another relatively close election. After his re-election, Bush received increasingly heated criticism from across the political spectrum for his handling of the Iraq War, Hurricane Katrina, and other challenges. Amid this criticism, the Democratic Party regained control of Congress in the 2006 elections. In December 2007, the United States entered its longest post-World War II recession, often referred to as the ""Great Recession"", prompting the Bush administration to obtain congressional passage of multiple economic programs intended to preserve the country's financial system. Nationally, Bush was both one of the most popular and unpopular presidents in history, having received the highest recorded presidential approval ratings in the wake of the September 11 attacks, as well as one of the lowest approval ratings during the 2008 financial crisis.

Bush left office in 2009, returning to Texas where he purchased a home in Dallas. In 2010, he published his memoir, Decision Points. His presidential library was opened in 2013. His presidency has been ranked among the worst in historians' polls published in the late 2000s and 2010s.

Early life and career

George Walker Bush was born on July 6, 1946, at Grace-New Haven Hospital (now Yale–New Haven Hospital) in New Haven, Connecticut, as the first child of George Herbert Walker Bush and his wife, the former Barbara Pierce. He was raised in Midland and Houston, Texas, with four siblings, Jeb, Neil, Marvin and Dorothy. Another younger sister, Robin, died from leukemia at the age of three in 1953. His grandfather, Prescott Bush, was a U.S. Senator from Connecticut. His father, George H.W. Bush, was Ronald Reagan's Vice President from 1981 to 1989 and the 41st U.S. President from 1989 to 1993. Bush has English and some German ancestry, along with more distant Dutch, Welsh, Irish, French, and Scottish roots.

Education

Bush attended public schools in Midland, Texas, until the family moved to Houston after he had completed seventh grade. He then spent two years at The Kinkaid School, a prep school in Houston.

Bush attended high school at Phillips Academy, a boarding school (then all-male) in Andover, Massachusetts, where he played baseball and was the head cheerleader during his senior year. He attended Yale University from 1964 to 1968, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history. During this time, he was a cheerleader and a member of the Delta Kappa Epsilon, serving as the president of the fraternity during his senior year. Bush became a member of the Skull and Bones society as a senior. Bush was a rugby union player and was on Yale's 1st XV. He characterized himself as an average student. His GPA during his first three years at Yale was 77, and he had a similar average under a nonnumeric rating system in his final year.

Beginning in the fall of 1973, Bush attended Harvard Business School. He graduated in 1975 with an MBA degree. He is the only U.S. president to have earned an MBA.

Family and personal life

At a backyard barbecue in 1977, friends introduced him to Laura Welch, a school teacher and librarian. After a three-month courtship, she accepted his marriage proposal and they wed on November 5 of that year. The couple settled in Midland, Texas. Bush left his family's Episcopal Church to join his wife's United Methodist Church. On November 25, 1981, Laura Bush gave birth to fraternal twin daughters, Barbara and Jenna.

Prior to his marriage, Bush had multiple episodes of alcohol abuse. In one instance on September 4, 1976, he was arrested near his family's summer home in Kennebunkport, Maine for driving under the influence of alcohol. He pleaded guilty, was fined $150, and had his Maine driver's license briefly suspended. Bush said his wife has had a stabilizing effect on his life, and attributes his 1986 decision to give up alcohol to her influence. While Governor of Texas, Bush said of his wife, ""I saw an elegant, beautiful woman who turned out not only to be elegant and beautiful, but very smart and willing to put up with my rough edges, and I must confess has smoothed them off over time.""

Bush has been an avid reader throughout his adult life, preferring biographies and histories. During his time as president, Bush read the Bible daily. He also read 14 Lincoln biographies, and during the last three years of his presidency, he reportedly read 186 books. Walt Harrington, a journalist, recalled seeing ""books by John Fowles, F. Scott Fitzgerald, James Joyce, and Gore Vidal lying about, as well as biographies of Willa Cather and Queen Victoria"" in his home when Bush was a Texas oilman. Other activities include cigar smoking and golf. Since leaving the White House, Bush has also taken up oil painting.

Military career

In May 1968, Bush was commissioned into the Texas Air National Guard. After two years of active-duty service while training, he was assigned to Houston, flying Convair F-102s with the 147th Reconnaissance Wing out of the Ellington Field Joint Reserve Base. Critics, including former Democratic National Committee Chairman Terry McAuliffe, have alleged that Bush was favorably treated due to his father's political standing as a member of the House of Representatives, citing his selection as a pilot despite his low pilot aptitude test scores and his irregular attendance. In June 2005, the United States Department of Defense released all the records of Bush's Texas Air National Guard service, which remain in its official archives.

In late 1972 and early 1973, he drilled with the 187th Fighter Wing of the Alabama Air National Guard. He had moved to Montgomery, Alabama, to work on the unsuccessful U.S. Senate campaign of Republican Winton M. Blount. In 1972, Bush was suspended from flying for failure to take a scheduled physical exam. He was honorably discharged from the Air Force Reserve on November 21, 1974.

Business career

In 1977, Bush established Arbusto Energy, a small oil exploration company, although it did not begin operations until the following year. He later changed the name to Bush Exploration. In 1984, his company merged with the larger Spectrum 7, and Bush became chairman. The company was hurt by decreased oil prices, and it folded into HKN, Inc., with Bush becoming a member of HKN's board of directors. Questions of possible insider trading involving HKN arose, but a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation concluded that the information Bush had at the time of his stock sale was not sufficient to constitute insider trading.

In April 1989, Bush arranged for a group of investors to purchase a controlling interest in the Texas Rangers baseball franchise for $89M and invested $500K himself to start. He then served as managing general partner for five years. He actively led the team's projects and regularly attended its games, often choosing to sit in the open stands with fans. Bush's sale of his shares in the Rangers in 1998 brought him over $15 million from his initial $800,000 investment.

Early political involvement

In 1978, Bush ran for the House of Representatives from Texas's 19th congressional district. The retiring member, George H. Mahon, had held the district for the Democratic Party since 1935. Bush's opponent, Kent Hance, portrayed him as out of touch with rural Texans, and Bush lost the election with 46.8 percent of the vote to Hance's 53.2 percent.

Bush and his family moved to Washington, D.C., in 1988 to work on his father's campaign for the U.S. presidency. He served as a campaign advisor and liaison to the media, and assisted his father by campaigning across the country. In December 1991, Bush was one of seven people named by his father to run his father's 1992 presidential re-election campaign, as a ""campaign advisor"". The previous month, his father had asked him to tell White House chief of staff John H. Sununu that he should resign.

Governor of Texas (1995–2000)

Bush declared his candidacy for the 1994 Texas gubernatorial election at the same time that his brother Jeb sought the governorship of Florida. His campaign focused on four themes: welfare reform, tort reform, crime reduction, and education improvement. Bush's campaign advisers were Karen Hughes, Joe Allbaugh, and Karl Rove.

After easily winning the Republican primary, Bush faced popular Democratic incumbent Governor Ann Richards. In the course of the campaign, Bush pledged to sign a bill allowing Texans to obtain permits to carry concealed weapons. Richards had vetoed the bill, but Bush signed it into law after he became governor. According to The Atlantic Monthly, the race ""featured a rumor that she was a lesbian, along with a rare instance of such a tactic's making it into the public record – when a regional chairman of the Bush campaign allowed himself, perhaps inadvertently, to be quoted criticizing Richards for 'appointing avowed homosexual activists' to state jobs"". The Atlantic, and others, connected the lesbian rumor to Karl Rove, but Rove denied being involved. Bush won the general election with 53.5 percent against Richards' 45.9 percent.

Bush used a budget surplus to push through Texas's largest tax-cut, $2 billion. He extended government funding for organizations providing education of the dangers of alcohol and drug use and abuse, and helping to reduce domestic violence. Critics contended that during his tenure, Texas ranked near the bottom in environmental evaluations. Supporters pointed to his efforts to raise the salaries of teachers and improve educational test scores.

In 1999, Bush signed a law that required electric retailers to buy a certain amount of energy from renewable sources (RPS), which helped Texas eventually become the leading producer of wind powered electricity in the U.S.

In 1998, Bush won re-election with a record 69 percent of the vote. He became the first governor in Texas history to be elected to two consecutive four-year terms. For most of Texas history, governors served two-year terms; a constitutional amendment extended those terms to four years starting in 1975. In his second term, Bush promoted faith-based organizations and enjoyed high approval ratings. He proclaimed June 10, 2000 to be Jesus Day in Texas, a day on which he ""urge[d] all Texans to answer the call to serve those in need"".

Throughout Bush's first term, national attention focused on him as a potential future presidential candidate. Following his re-election, speculation soared. Within a year, he decided to seek the 2000 Republican presidential nomination.

Primary

Lame duck incumbent president Bill Clinton was a Democrat, and the field for nomination for President of both parties was wide open. Bush was governor of Texas in June 1999 when he announced his candidacy for President of the United States. He entered a large field of hopefuls for the Republican Party presidential nomination that included John McCain, Alan Keyes, Steve Forbes, Gary Bauer, Orrin Hatch, Elizabeth Dole, Dan Quayle, Pat Buchanan, Lamar Alexander, John Kasich, and Bob Smith.

Bush portrayed himself as a compassionate conservative, implying he was more centrist than other Republicans. He campaigned on a platform that included bringing integrity and honor back to the White House, increasing the size of the United States Armed Forces, cutting taxes, improving education, and aiding minorities. By early 2000, the race had centered on Bush and McCain.

Bush won the Iowa caucuses, and although he was heavily favored to win the New Hampshire primary, he trailed McCain by 19 percent and lost that primary. Despite this, Bush regained momentum, and according to political observers, he effectively became the front runner after the South Carolina primary—which according to The Boston Globe—made history for his campaign's negativity. The New York Times described it as a smear campaign.

General election

On July 25, 2000, Bush surprised some observers when he selected Dick Cheney—a former White House Chief of Staff, U.S. Representative, and Secretary of Defense—to be his running mate. At the time, Cheney was serving as head of Bush's Vice-Presidential search committee. Soon after at the 2000 Republican National Convention, Bush and Cheney were officially nominated by the Republican Party.

Bush continued to campaign across the country and touted his record as governor of Texas. During his campaign, Bush criticized his Democratic opponent, incumbent Vice President Al Gore, over gun control and taxation.

When the election returns were tallied on November 7, Bush had won 29 states, including Florida. The closeness of the Florida outcome led to a recount. The initial recount also went to Bush, but the outcome was tied up in lower courts for a month until eventually reaching the U.S. Supreme Court. On December 9, in the controversial Bush v. Gore ruling, the Court reversed a Florida Supreme Court decision that had ordered a third count, and stopped an ordered statewide hand recount based on the argument that the use of different standards among Florida's counties violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The machine recount showed that Bush had won the Florida vote by a margin of 537 votes out of six million cast. Although he had received 543,895 fewer individual nationwide votes than Gore, Bush won the election, receiving 271 electoral votes to Gore's 266 (Gore's statewide victories had electoral votes tallying 267; however, one of Gore's pledged electors abstained, rendering the official tally at 266). Bush was the first person to win an American presidential election with fewer popular votes than another candidate since Benjamin Harrison in 1888.

2004 presidential candidacy

In his 2004 bid for re-election, Bush commanded broad support in the Republican Party and did not encounter a primary challenge. He appointed Ken Mehlman as campaign manager, and Karl Rove devised a political strategy . Bush and the Republican platform emphasized a strong commitment to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, support for the USA PATRIOT Act, a renewed shift in policy for constitutional amendments banning abortion and same-sex marriage, reforming Social Security to create private investment accounts, creation of an ownership society, and opposing mandatory carbon emissions controls. Bush also called for the implementation of a guest worker program for immigrants, which was criticized by conservatives.

The Bush campaign advertised across the U.S. against Democratic candidates, including Bush's emerging opponent, Massachusetts Senator John Kerry. Kerry and other Democrats attacked Bush on the Iraq War, and accused him of failing to stimulate the economy and job growth. The Bush campaign portrayed Kerry as a staunch liberal who would raise taxes and increase the size of government. The Bush campaign continuously criticized Kerry's seemingly contradictory statements on the war in Iraq, and argued that Kerry lacked the decisiveness and vision necessary for success in the War on Terror.

In the election, Bush carried 31 of 50 states, receiving a total of 286 electoral votes. He won an absolute majority of the popular vote (50.7 percent to his opponent's 48.3 percent). Bush's father George H.W. Bush was the previous president who won an absolute majority of the popular vote; he accomplished that feat in the 1988 election. Additionally, it was the first time since Herbert Hoover's election in 1928 that a Republican president was elected alongside re-elected Republican majorities in both Houses of Congress.

Presidency (2001–2009)

Bush had originally outlined an ambitious domestic agenda, but his priorities were significantly altered following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Wars were waged in Afghanistan and Iraq, and there were significant domestic debates regarding immigration, healthcare, Social Security, economic policy, and treatment of terrorist detainees. Over an eight-year period, Bush's once-high approval ratings steadily declined, while his disapproval numbers increased significantly. In 2007, the United States entered the longest post-World War II recession.

Economic policy

Bush took office during a period of economic recession in the wake of the bursting of the dot-com bubble. The terrorist attacks also impacted the economy. His administration increased federal government spending from $1.789 trillion to $2.983 trillion (60 percent) while revenues increased from $2.025 trillion to $2.524 trillion (from 2000 to 2008). Individual income tax revenues increased by 14 percent, corporate tax revenues by 50 percent, customs and duties by 40 percent. Discretionary defense spending was increased by 107 percent, discretionary domestic spending by 62 percent, Medicare spending by 131 percent, social security by 51 percent, and income security spending by 130 percent. Cyclically adjusted, revenues rose by 35 percent and spending by 65 percent.

The increase in spending was more than under any predecessor since Lyndon B. Johnson. The number of economic regulation governmental workers increased by 91,196.

The surplus in fiscal year 2000 was $237 billion—the third consecutive surplus and the largest surplus ever. In 2001, Bush's budget estimated that there would be a $5.6 trillion surplus over the next ten years. Facing congressional opposition, Bush held townhall style meetings across the U.S. in order to increase public support for his plan for a $1.35 trillion tax cut program—one of the largest tax cuts in U.S. history. Bush argued that unspent government funds should be returned to taxpayers, saying ""the surplus is not the government's money. The surplus is the people's money."" Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan warned of a recession and Bush stated that a tax cut would stimulate the economy and create jobs. Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill, opposed some of the tax cuts on the basis that they would contribute to budget deficits and undermine Social Security. O'Neill disputes the claim, made in Bush's book Decision Points, that he never openly disagreed with him on planned tax cuts. By 2003, the economy showed signs of improvement, though job growth remained stagnant. Another tax cut program was passed that year.

During the 2001 to 2008 years, GDP grew at an average annual rate of 2.125 percent, less than for past business cycles.

Bush entered office with the Dow Jones Industrial Average at 10,587, and the average peaked in October 2007 at over 14,000. When Bush left office, the average was at 7,949, one of the lowest levels of his presidency.

Unemployment originally rose from 4.2 percent in January 2001 to 6.3 percent in June 2003, but subsequently dropped to 4.5 percent as of July 2007. Adjusted for inflation, median household income dropped by $1,175 between 2000 and 2007, while Professor Ken Homa of Georgetown University has noted that ""Median real after-tax household income went up 2 percent"". The poverty rate increased from 11.3 percent in 2000 to 12.3 percent in 2006 after peaking at 12.7 percent in 2004. By October 2008, due to increases in spending, the national debt had risen to $11.3 trillion, an increase of over 100 percent from 2000 when the debt was only $5.6 trillion. Most debt was accumulated as a result of what became known as the ""Bush tax cuts"" and increased national security spending. In March 2006, then-Senator Barack Obama said when he voted against raising the debt ceiling: ""The fact that we are here today to debate raising America's debt limit is a sign of leadership failure."" By the end of Bush's presidency, unemployment climbed to 7.2 percent.

In December 2007, the United States entered the longest post–World War II recession, which included a housing market correction, a subprime mortgage crisis, soaring oil prices, and a declining dollar value. In February, 63,000 jobs were lost, a five-year record. To aid with the situation, Bush signed a $170 billion economic stimulus package which was intended to improve the economic situation by sending tax rebate checks to many Americans and providing tax breaks for struggling businesses. The Bush administration pushed for significantly increased regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2003, and after two years, the regulations passed the House but died in the Senate. Many Republican senators, as well as influential members of the Bush Administration, feared that the agency created by these regulations would merely be mimicking the private sector's risky practices. In September 2008, the crisis became much more serious beginning with the government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac followed by the collapse of Lehman Brothers and a federal bailout of American International Group for $85 billion.

Many economists and world governments determined that the situation became the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Additional regulation over the housing market would have been beneficial, according to former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan. Bush, meanwhile, proposed a financial rescue plan to buy back a large portion of the U.S. mortgage market. Vince Reinhardt, a former Federal Reserve economist now at the American Enterprise Institute, said ""it would have helped for the Bush administration to empower the folks at Treasury and the Federal Reserve and the comptroller of the currency and the FDIC to look at these issues more closely"", and additionally, that it would have helped ""for Congress to have held hearings"".

In November 2008, over 500,000 jobs were lost, which marked the largest loss of jobs in the United States in 34 years. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that in the last four months of 2008, 1.9 million jobs were lost. By the end of 2008, the U.S. had lost a total of 2.6 million jobs.

Education and health

Bush undertook a number of educational agendas, such as increasing the funding for the National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health in his first years of office, and creating education programs to strengthen the grounding in science and mathematics for American high school students. Funding for the NIH was cut in 2006, the first such cut in 36 years, due to rising inflation.

One of the administration's early major initiatives was the No Child Left Behind Act, which aimed to measure and close the gap between rich and poor student performance, provide options to parents with students in low-performing schools, and target more federal funding to low-income schools. This landmark education initiative passed with broad bipartisan support, including that of Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts. It was signed into law by Bush in early 2002. Many contend that the initiative has been successful, as cited by the fact that students in the U.S. have performed significantly better on state reading and math tests since Bush signed ""No Child Left Behind"" into law. Critics argue that it is underfunded and that NCLBA's focus on ""high-stakes testing"" and quantitative outcomes is counterproductive.

After being re-elected, Bush signed into law a Medicare drug benefit program that, according to Jan Crawford, resulted in ""the greatest expansion in America's welfare state in forty years;"" the bill's costs approached $7 trillion. In 2007, Bush opposed and vetoed State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) legislation, which was added by the Democrats onto a war funding bill and passed by Congress. The SCHIP legislation would have significantly expanded federally funded health care benefits and plans to children of some low-income families from about six million to ten million children. It was to be funded by an increase in the cigarette tax. Bush viewed the legislation as a move toward socialized health care, and asserted that the program could benefit families making as much as $83,000 per year who did not need the help.

Social services and Social Security

Following Republican efforts to pass the Medicare Act of 2003, Bush signed the bill, which included major changes to the Medicare program by providing beneficiaries with some assistance in paying for prescription drugs, while relying on private insurance for the delivery of benefits. The retired persons lobby group AARP worked with the Bush Administration on the program and gave their endorsement. Bush said the law, estimated to cost $400 billion over the first ten years, would give the elderly ""better choices and more control over their health care"".

Bush began his second term by outlining a major initiative to ""reform"" Social Security, which was facing record deficit projections beginning in 2005. Bush made it the centerpiece of his domestic agenda despite opposition from some in the U.S. Congress. In his 2005 State of the Union Address, Bush discussed the potential impending bankruptcy of the program and outlined his new program, which included partial privatization of the system, personal Social Security accounts, and options to permit Americans to divert a portion of their Social Security tax (FICA) into secured investments. Democrats opposed the proposal to partially privatize the system.

Bush embarked on a 60-day national tour, campaigning for his initiative in media events known as ""Conversations on Social Security"", in an attempt to gain public support. Nevertheless, public support for the proposal declined and the House Republican leadership decided not to put Social Security reform on the priority list for the remainder of their 2005 legislative agenda. The proposal's legislative prospects were further diminished by the fall of 2005 political fallout from Hurricane Katrina. After the Democrats gained control of both houses of Congress as a result of the 2006 midterm elections, there was no prospect of further congressional action on the Bush proposal for the remainder of his term in office.

Environmental policies

Upon taking office in 2001, Bush stated his opposition to the Kyoto Protocol, an amendment to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change which seeks to impose mandatory targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, citing that the treaty exempted 80 percent of the world's population and would have cost tens of billions of dollars per year. He also cited that the Senate had voted 95–0 in 1997 on a resolution expressing its disapproval of the protocol.

In May 2001, Bush signed an executive order to create an inter-agency task force to streamline energy projects, and later signed two other executive orders to tackle environmental issues.

In 2002, Bush announced the Clear Skies Act of 2003, aimed at amending the Clean Air Act to reduce air pollution through the use of emissions trading programs. Many experts argued that this legislation would have weakened the original legislation by allowing higher emission rates of pollutants than were previously legal. The initiative was introduced to Congress, but failed to make it out of committee.

Later in 2006, Bush declared the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands a national monument, creating the largest marine reserve to date. The Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument comprises 84 million acres (340,000 km2) and is home to 7,000 species of fish, birds, and other marine animals, many of which are specific to only those islands. The move was hailed by conservationists for ""its foresight and leadership in protecting this incredible area"".

Bush has said that he believes that global warming is real and has noted that it is a serious problem, but he asserted there is a ""debate over whether it's man-made or naturally caused"". The Bush Administration's stance on global warming remained controversial in the scientific and environmental communities. Critics have alleged that the administration misinformed the public and did not do enough to reduce carbon emissions and deter global warming.

Energy policies

In his 2006 State of the Union Address, Bush declared, ""America is addicted to oil"" and announced his Advanced Energy Initiative to increase energy development research.

In his 2007 State of the Union Address, Bush renewed his pledge to work toward diminished reliance on foreign oil by reducing fossil fuel consumption and increasing alternative fuel production. Amid high gasoline prices in 2008, Bush lifted a ban on offshore drilling. However, the move was largely symbolic because there was still a federal law banning offshore drilling. Bush said, ""This means that the only thing standing between the American people and these vast oil reserves is action from the U.S. Congress."" Bush had said in June 2008, ""In the long run, the solution is to reduce demand for oil by promoting alternative energy technologies. My administration has worked with Congress to invest in gas-saving technologies like advanced batteries and hydrogen fuel cells... In the short run, the American economy will continue to rely largely on oil. And that means we need to increase supply, especially here at home. So my administration has repeatedly called on Congress to expand domestic oil production.""

In his 2008 State of the Union Address, Bush announced that the U.S. would commit $2 billion over the next three years to a new international fund to promote clean energy technologies and fight climate change, saying, ""Along with contributions from other countries, this fund will increase and accelerate the deployment of all forms of cleaner, more efficient technologies in developing nations like India and China, and help leverage substantial private-sector capital by making clean energy projects more financially attractive."" He also announced plans to reaffirm the United States' commitment to work with major economies, and, through the UN, to complete an international agreement that will slow, stop, and eventually reverse the growth of greenhouse gases; he stated, ""This agreement will be effective only if it includes commitments by every major economy and gives none a free ride.""

Stem cell research and first veto

Federal funding for medical research involving the creation or destruction of human embryos through the Department of Health and Human Services and the National Institutes of Health has been forbidden by law since the passage in 1995 of the Dickey-Wicker Amendment by Congress and the signature of President Bill Clinton. Bush has said that he supports adult stem cell research and has supported federal legislation that finances adult stem cell research. However, Bush did not support embryonic stem cell research. On August 9, 2001, Bush signed an executive order lifting the ban on federal funding for the 71 existing ""lines"" of stem cells, but the ability of these existing lines to provide an adequate medium for testing has been questioned. Testing can be done on only 12 of the original lines, and all approved lines have been cultured in contact with mouse cells, which creates safety issues that complicate development and approval of therapies from these lines. On July 19, 2006, Bush used his veto power for the first time in his presidency to veto the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. The bill would have repealed the Dickey-Wicker Amendment, thereby permitting federal money to be used for research where stem cells are derived from the destruction of an embryo.

Genetic Nondiscrimination

On May 21, 2008 President George W. Bush signed into law the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA). The bill aims to protect Americans against discrimination based on their genetic information when it comes to health insurance and employment. The issue had been debated for 13 years before becoming law. It is designed to protect citizens while not hindering genetic research.

Immigration

Nearly 8 million immigrants came to the United States from 2000 to 2005, more than in any other five-year period in the nation's history. Almost half entered illegally. In 2006, Bush urged Congress to allow more than 12 million illegal immigrants to work in the United States with the creation of a ""temporary guest-worker program"". Bush also urged Congress to provide additional funds for border security and committed to deploying 6,000 National Guard troops to the Mexico–United States border. From May to June 2007, Bush strongly supported the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007, which was written by a bipartisan group of Senators with the active participation of the Bush administration. The bill envisioned a legalization program for illegal immigrants, with an eventual path to citizenship; establishing a guest worker program; a series of border and work site enforcement measures; a reform of the green card application process and the introduction of a point-based ""merit"" system for green cards; elimination of ""chain migration"" and of the Diversity Immigrant Visa; and other measures. Bush argued that the lack of legal status denies the protections of U.S. laws to millions of people who face dangers of poverty and exploitation, and penalizes employers despite a demand for immigrant labor. Bush contended that the proposed bill did not amount to amnesty.

A heated public debate followed, which resulted in a substantial rift within the Republican Party, most conservatives opposed it because of its legalization or amnesty provisions. The bill was eventually defeated in the Senate on June 28, 2007, when a cloture motion failed on a 46–53 vote. Bush expressed disappointment upon the defeat of one of his signature domestic initiatives. The Bush administration later proposed a series of immigration enforcement measures that do not require a change in law.

On September 19, 2010, former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said that Bush offered to accept 100,000 Palestinian refugees as American citizens if a permanent settlement had been reached between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.

Hurricane Katrina

Hurricane Katrina, one of the most damaging natural disasters in U.S. history, struck early in Bush's second term. Katrina formed in late August during the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season and devastated much of the north-central Gulf Coast of the United States, particularly New Orleans.

Bush declared a state of emergency in Louisiana on August 27, and in Mississippi and Alabama the following day; he authorized the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to manage the disaster, but his announcement failed to spur these agencies to action. The eye of the hurricane made landfall on August 29, and New Orleans began to flood due to levee breaches; later that day, Bush declared that a major disaster existed in Louisiana, officially authorizing FEMA to start using federal funds to assist in the recovery effort.

On August 30, DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff declared it ""an incident of national significance"", triggering the first use of the newly created National Response Plan. Three days later, on September 2, National Guard troops first entered the city of New Orleans. The same day, Bush toured parts of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama and declared that the success of the recovery effort up to that point was ""not enough"".

As the disaster in New Orleans intensified, critics charged that Bush was misrepresenting his administration's role in what they saw as a flawed response. Leaders attacked Bush for having appointed apparently incompetent leaders to positions of power at FEMA, notably Michael D. Brown; it was also argued that the federal response was limited as a result of the Iraq War and Bush himself did not act upon warnings of floods. Bush responded to mounting criticism by accepting full responsibility for the federal government's failures in its handling of the emergency. It has been argued that with Katrina, Bush passed a political tipping point from which he would not recover.

Midterm dismissal of U.S. attorneys

During Bush's second term, a controversy arose over the Justice Department's midterm dismissal of seven United States Attorneys. The White House maintained that the U.S. attorneys were fired for poor performance. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales later resigned over the issue, along with other senior members of the Justice Department. The House Judiciary Committee issued subpoenas for advisers Harriet Miers and Josh Bolten to testify regarding this matter, but Bush directed Miers and Bolten to not comply with those subpoenas, invoking his right of executive privilege. Bush maintained that all of his advisers were protected under a broad executive privilege protection to receive candid advice. The Justice Department determined that the President's order was legal.

Although Congressional investigations focused on whether the Justice Department and the White House were using the U.S. Attorney positions for political advantage, no official findings have been released. On March 10, 2008, the Congress filed a federal lawsuit to enforce their issued subpoenas. On July 31, 2008, a United States district court judge ruled that Bush's top advisers were not immune from Congressional subpoenas.

In all, twelve Justice Department officials resigned rather than testify under oath before Congress. They included Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and his chief of staff Kyle Sampson, Gonzales' liaison to the White House Monica Goodling, aide to the president Karl Rove and his senior aide Sara Taylor. In addition, legal counsel to the president Harriet Miers and deputy chief of staff to the president Joshua Bolten were both found in contempt of Congress.

In 2010, the Justice Department investigator concluded that though political considerations did play a part in as many as four of the attorney firings, the firings were ""inappropriately political"", but not criminal. According to the prosecutors, there was insufficient evidence to pursue prosecution for any criminal offense.

Purge of the Central Intelligence Agency

Following the resignation of CIA director George Tenet in 2004, Bush nominated Porter Goss to head the agency. The White House ordered Goss to purge agency officers who were disloyal to the administration. After Goss' appointment, many of the CIA's senior agents were fired or quit. The CIA has been accused of deliberately leaking classified information to undermine the 2004 election.

Foreign policy

In July 2001, Bush visited Pope John Paul II at Castel Gandolfo. During his Presidential campaign, Bush's foreign policy platform included support for stronger economic and political relationship with Latin America, especially Mexico, and a reduction of involvement in ""nation-building"" and other small-scale military engagements. The administration pursued a national missile defense. Bush was an advocate of China's entry into the World Trade Organization.

In his 2002 State of the Union Address, Bush referred to an axis of evil including Iraq, Iran and North Korea. After the September 11 attacks on New York, Bush launched the War on Terror, in which the United States military and a small international coalition invaded Afghanistan. In 2003, Bush then launched the invasion of Iraq, searching for Weapons of Mass Destruction, which he described as being part of the War on Terrorism. Those invasions led to the toppling of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and the removal of Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq.

Bush began his second term with an emphasis on improving strained relations with European nations. He appointed long-time adviser Karen Hughes to oversee a global public relations campaign. Bush lauded the pro-democracy struggles in Georgia and Ukraine.

In March 2006, a visit to India led to renewed ties between the two countries, reversing decades of U.S. policy. The visit focused particularly on areas of nuclear energy and counter-terrorism cooperation, discussions that would lead eventually to the India–United States Civil Nuclear Agreement.

This is in stark contrast to the stance taken by his predecessor, Clinton, whose approach and response to India after the 1998 nuclear tests was that of sanctions and hectoring. The relationship between India and the United States was one that dramatically improved during Bush's tenure.

Midway through Bush's second term, it was questioned whether Bush was retreating from his freedom and democracy agenda, highlighted in policy changes toward some oil-rich former Soviet republics in central Asia.

In an address before both Houses of Congress on September 20, 2001, Bush thanked the nations of the world for their support following the September 11 attacks. He specifically thanked UK Prime Minister Tony Blair for traveling to Washington to show ""unity of purpose with America"", and said ""America has no truer friend than Great Britain.""

September 11 attacks

The September 11 terrorist attacks were a major turning point in Bush's presidency. That evening, he addressed the nation from the Oval Office, promising a strong response to the attacks. He also emphasized the need for the nation to come together and comfort the families of the victims. On September 14, he visited Ground Zero, meeting with Mayor Rudy Giuliani, firefighters, police officers, and volunteers. Bush addressed the gathering via a megaphone while standing on a heap of rubble, to much applause: ""I can hear you. The rest of the world hears you. And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon.""

In a September 20 speech, Bush condemned Osama bin Laden and his organization Al-Qaeda, and issued an ultimatum to the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, where bin Laden was operating, to ""hand over the terrorists, or ... share in their fate"".

War on Terrorism

After September 11, Bush announced a global War on Terror. The Afghan Taliban regime was not forthcoming with Osama bin Laden, so Bush ordered the invasion of Afghanistan to overthrow the Taliban regime. In his January 29, 2002 State of the Union Address, he asserted that an ""axis of evil"" consisting of North Korea, Iran, and Iraq was ""arming to threaten the peace of the world"" and ""pose[d] a grave and growing danger"". The Bush Administration asserted both a right and the intention to wage preemptive war, or preventive war. This became the basis for the Bush Doctrine which weakened the unprecedented levels of international and domestic support for the United States which had followed the September 11 attacks.

Dissent and criticism of Bush's leadership in the War on Terror increased as the war in Iraq continued. In 2006, a National Intelligence Estimate concluded that the Iraq War had become the ""cause célèbre for jihadists"".

Afghanistan invasion

On October 7, 2001, U.S. and British forces initiated bombing campaigns that led to the arrival of Northern Alliance troops in Kabul on November 13. The main goals of the war were to defeat the Taliban, drive al-Qaeda out of Afghanistan, and capture key al-Qaeda leaders. In December 2001, the Pentagon reported that the Taliban had been defeated, but cautioned that the war would go on to continue weakening Taliban and al-Qaeda leaders. Later that month the UN had installed the Afghan Transitional Administration chaired by Hamid Karzai. In 2002, based on UNICEF figures, Nicholas Kristof reported that ""our invasion of Afghanistan may end up saving one million lives over the next decade"" as the result of improved healthcare and greater access to humanitarian aid.

Efforts to kill or capture al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden failed as he escaped a battle in December 2001 in the mountainous region of Tora Bora, which the Bush Administration later acknowledged to have resulted from a failure to commit enough U.S. ground troops. It was not until May 2011, two years after Bush left office, that bin Laden was killed by U.S. forces under the Obama administration. Bin Laden's successor, Ayman al-Zawahiri, remains at large.

Despite the initial success in driving the Taliban from power in Kabul, by early 2003 the Taliban was regrouping, amassing new funds and recruits. The 2005 failure of Operation Red Wings showed that the Taliban had returned. In 2006, the Taliban insurgency appeared larger, fiercer and better organized than expected, with large-scale allied offensives such as Operation Mountain Thrust attaining limited success. As a result, Bush commissioned 3,500 additional troops to the country in March 2007.

Iraq invasion

Beginning with his January 29, 2002 State of the Union address, Bush began publicly focusing attention on Iraq, which he labeled as part of an ""axis of evil"" allied with terrorists and posing ""a grave and growing danger"" to U.S. interests through possession of weapons of mass destruction.

In the latter half of 2002, CIA reports contained assertions of Saddam Hussein's intent of reconstituting nuclear weapons programs, not properly accounting for Iraqi biological and chemical weapons, and that some Iraqi missiles had a range greater than allowed by the UN sanctions. Contentions that the Bush Administration manipulated or exaggerated the threat and evidence of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction capabilities would eventually become a major point of criticism for the president.

In late 2002 and early 2003, Bush urged the United Nations to enforce Iraqi disarmament mandates, precipitating a diplomatic crisis. In November 2002, Hans Blix and Mohamed ElBaradei led UN weapons inspectors in Iraq, but were advised by the U.S. to depart the country four days prior to the U.S. invasion, despite their requests for more time to complete their tasks. The U.S. initially sought a UN Security Council resolution authorizing the use of military force but dropped the bid for UN approval due to vigorous opposition from several countries.

More than 20 nations (most notably the United Kingdom), designated the ""coalition of the willing"" joined the United States in invading Iraq. They launched the invasion on March 20, 2003. The Iraqi military was quickly defeated. The capital, Baghdad, fell on April 9, 2003. On May 1, Bush declared the end of major combat operations in Iraq. The initial success of U.S. operations increased his popularity, but the U.S. and allied forces faced a growing insurgency led by sectarian groups; Bush's ""Mission Accomplished"" speech was later criticized as premature. From 2004 until 2007, the situation in Iraq deteriorated further, with some observers arguing that there was a full-scale civil war in Iraq. Bush's policies met with criticism, including demands domestically to set a timetable to withdraw troops from Iraq. The 2006 report of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group, led by James Baker, concluded that the situation in Iraq was ""grave and deteriorating"". While Bush admitted that there were strategic mistakes made in regards to the stability of Iraq, he maintained he would not change the overall Iraq strategy. According to Iraq Body Count, some 251,000 Iraqis have been killed in the civil war following the U.S.-led invasion, including at least 163,841 civilians.

In January 2005, free, democratic elections were held in Iraq for the first time in 50 years. According to Iraqi National Security Advisor Mowaffak al-Rubaie, ""This is the greatest day in the history of this country."" Bush praised the event as well, saying that the Iraqis ""have taken rightful control of their country's destiny"". This led to the election of Jalal Talabani as President and Nouri al-Maliki as Prime Minister of Iraq. A referendum to approve a constitution in Iraq was held in October 2005, supported by most Shiites and many Kurds.

On January 10, 2007, Bush announced a surge of 21,500 more troops for Iraq, as well as a job program for Iraqis, more reconstruction proposals, and $1.2 billion for these programs. On May 1, 2007, Bush used his second-ever veto to reject a bill setting a deadline for the withdrawal of U.S. troops, saying the debate over the conflict was ""understandable"" but insisting that a continued U.S. presence there was crucial.

In March 2008, Bush praised the Iraqi government's ""bold decision"" to launch the Battle of Basra against the Mahdi Army, calling it ""a defining moment in the history of a free Iraq"". He said he would carefully weigh recommendations from his commanding General David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker about how to proceed after the end of the military buildup in the summer of 2008. He also praised the Iraqis' legislative achievements, including a pension law, a revised de-Baathification law, a new budget, an amnesty law, and a provincial powers measure that, he said, set the stage for the Iraqi elections. By July 2008, American troop deaths had reached their lowest number since the war began, and due to increased stability in Iraq, Bush announced the withdrawal of additional American forces.

Surveillance

Following the events of September 11, Bush issued an executive order authorizing the President's Surveillance Program which included allowing the NSA to monitor communications between suspected terrorists outside the U.S and parties within the U.S. without obtaining a warrant as required by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. As of 2009, the other provisions of the program remained highly classified. Once the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel questioned its original legal opinion that FISA did not apply in a time of war, the program was subsequently re-authorized by the President on the basis that the warrant requirements of FISA were implicitly superseded by the subsequent passage of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists. The program proved to be controversial, as critics of the administration, as well as organizations such as the American Bar Association, argued that it was illegal. In August 2006, a U.S. district court judge ruled that the NSA electronic surveillance program was unconstitutional, but on July 6, 2007, that ruling was vacated by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit on the grounds that the plaintiffs lacked standing. On January 17, 2007, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales informed U.S. Senate leaders that the program would not be reauthorized by the President, but would be subjected to judicial oversight. Later in 2007, the NSA launched a replacement for the program, referred to as PRISM, that was subject to the oversight of the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. This program was not publicly revealed until reports by The Washington Post and The Guardian emerged in June 2013.

Interrogation policies

Bush authorized the CIA to use waterboarding and several other ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" that several critics, including Barack Obama, would label as torture. Between 2002 and 2003 the CIA considered certain enhanced interrogation techniques, such as waterboarding, to be legal based on a secret Justice Department legal opinion arguing that terror detainees were not protected by the Geneva Conventions' ban on torture and Vice President Cheney said enhanced interrogation including waterboarding was not torture or illegal. The CIA had exercised the technique on certain key terrorist suspects under authority given to it in the Bybee Memo from the Attorney General, though that memo was later withdrawn. While not permitted by the U.S. Army Field Manuals which assert ""that harsh interrogation tactics elicit unreliable information"", the Bush administration believed these enhanced interrogations ""provided critical information"" to preserve American lives. Critics, such as former CIA officer Bob Baer, have stated that information was suspect, ""you can get anyone to confess to anything if the torture's bad enough.""

On October 17, 2006, Bush signed into law the Military Commissions Act of 2006, a law enacted in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 548 U.S. 557 (2006), which allows the U.S. government to prosecute unlawful enemy combatants by military commission rather than a standard trial. The law also denies them access to habeas corpus and bars the torture of detainees, but allows the president to determine what constitutes torture.

On March 8, 2008, Bush vetoed H.R. 2082, a bill that would have expanded congressional oversight over the intelligence community and banned the use of waterboarding as well as other forms of interrogation not permitted under the United States Army Field Manual on Human Intelligence Collector Operations, saying that ""the bill Congress sent me would take away one of the most valuable tools in the War on Terror"". In April 2009, the ACLU sued and won release of the secret memos that had authorized the Bush administration's interrogation tactics. One memo detailed specific interrogation tactics including a footnote that described waterboarding as torture as well as that the form of waterboarding used by the CIA was far more intense than authorized by the Justice Department.

North Korea condemnation

Bush publicly condemned Kim Jong-il of North Korea, naming North Korea one of three states in an ""axis of evil"", and saying that ""the United States of America will not permit the world's most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world's most destructive weapons."" Within months, ""both countries had walked away from their respective commitments under the U.S.–DPRK Agreed Framework of October 1994."" North Korea's October 9, 2006, detonation of a nuclear device further complicated Bush's foreign policy, which centered for both terms of his presidency on ""[preventing] the terrorists and regimes who seek chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons from threatening the United States and the world"". Bush condemned North Korea's position, reaffirmed his commitment to ""a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula"", and stated that ""transfer of nuclear weapons or material by North Korea to states or non-state entities would be considered a grave threat to the United States"", for which North Korea would be held accountable. On May 7, 2007, North Korea agreed to shut down its nuclear reactors immediately pending the release of frozen funds held in a foreign bank account. This was a result of a series of three-way talks initiated by the United States and including China. On September 2, 2007, North Korea agreed to disclose and dismantle all of its nuclear programs by the end of 2007. By May 2009, North Korea had restarted its nuclear program and threatened to attack South Korea.

On June 22, 2010, ""While South Korea prospers, the people of North Korea have suffered profoundly,"" he said, adding that, ""communism had resulted in dire poverty, mass starvation and brutal suppression. ""In recent years,"" he went on to say, ""the suffering has been compounded by the leader who wasted North Korea's precious few resources on personal luxuries and nuclear weapons programs.""

Syria sanctions

Bush expanded economic sanctions on Syria. In early 2007, the Treasury Department, acting on a June 2005 executive order, froze American bank accounts of Syria's Higher Institute of Applied Science and Technology, Electronics Institute, and National Standards and Calibration Laboratory. Bush's order prohibits Americans from doing business with these institutions suspected of helping spread weapons of mass destruction and being supportive of terrorism. Under separate executive orders signed by Bush in 2004 and later 2007, the Treasury Department froze the assets of two Lebanese and two Syrians, accusing them of activities to ""undermine the legitimate political process in Lebanon"" in November 2007. Those designated included: Assaad Halim Hardan, a member of Lebanon's parliament and current leader of the Syrian Socialist National Party; Wi'am Wahhab, a former member of Lebanon's government (Minister of the Environment) under Prime Minister Omar Karami (2004–2005); Hafiz Makhluf, a colonel and senior official in the Syrian General Intelligence Directorate and a cousin of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad; and Muhammad Nasif Khayrbik, identified as a close adviser to Assad.

Africa

Bush initiated the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief Program (PEPFAR). The U.S. government has spent some $44 billion on the project since 2003 (a figure that includes $7 billion contributed to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, a multilateral organization), saving an estimated 5 million lives. According to The New York Times correspondent Peter Baker, ""Bush did more to stop AIDS and more to help Africa than any president before or since.""

Assassination attempt

On May 10, 2005, Vladimir Arutyunian, a native Georgian who was born to a family of ethnic Armenians, threw a live hand grenade toward a podium where Bush was speaking at Freedom Square in Tbilisi, Georgia. Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili was seated nearby. It landed in the crowd about 65 feet (20 m) from the podium after hitting a girl, but it did not detonate. Arutyunian was arrested in July 2005, confessed, was convicted and was given a life sentence in January 2006.

Other issues

Bush withdrew U.S. support for several international agreements, including the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM) with Russia. He also signed the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty with Russia.

Bush emphasized a careful approach to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians; he denounced Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat for his support of violence, but sponsored dialogues between Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Palestinian National Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. Bush supported Sharon's unilateral disengagement plan, and lauded the democratic elections held in Palestine after Arafat's death.

Bush also expressed U.S. support for the defense of Taiwan following the stand-off in April 2001 with the People's Republic of China over the Hainan Island incident, when an EP-3E Aries II surveillance aircraft collided with a People's Liberation Army Air Force jet, leading to the detention of U.S. personnel. From 2003 to 2004, Bush authorized U.S. military intervention in Haiti and Liberia to protect U.S. interests. Bush condemned the militia attacks Darfur and denounced the killings in Sudan as genocide. Bush said that an international peacekeeping presence was critical in Darfur, but opposed referring the situation to the International Criminal Court.

In the State of the Union address in January 2003, Bush outlined a five-year strategy for global emergency AIDS relief, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. Bush announced $15 billion for this effort which directly supported life-saving antiretroviral treatment for more than 3.2 million men, women and children worldwide.

On June 10, 2007, Bush met with Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha and became the first president to visit Albania. Bush has voiced his support for the independence of Kosovo. Bush opposed South Ossetia's independence. On August 15, 2008, Bush said of Russia's invasion of the country of Georgia: ""Bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century.""

Bush opened the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah. Departing from previous practice, he stood among a group of U.S. athletes rather than from a ceremonial stand or box, saying: ""On behalf of a proud, determined, and grateful nation, I declare open the Games of Salt Lake City, celebrating the Olympic Winter Games."" In 2008, in the course of a good-will trip to Asia, he attended the Summer Olympics in Beijing.

Bush twice invoked Section 3 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment, which allows a President to temporarily transfer the powers and duties of his office to the Vice President who then becomes Acting President. On June 29, 2002, Bush underwent a colonoscopy and chose to invoke Section 3 of the amendment, making Vice President Dick Cheney the Acting President. The medical procedure began at 7:09 am. EDT and ended at 7:29 am. EDT. Bush woke up twenty minutes later, but did not resume his presidential powers and duties until 9:24 am. EDT after the president's doctor, Richard Tubb, conducted an overall examination. Tubb said he recommended the additional time to make sure the sedative had no after effects. On July 21, 2007, Bush again invoked Section 3 in response to having to undergo a colonoscopy, again making Vice President Cheney the Acting President. Bush invoked Section 3 at 7:16 am. EDT. He reclaimed his powers at 9:21 am. EDT. In both cases, Bush specifically cited Section 3 when he transferred the Presidential powers to the Vice President and when he reclaimed those powers.

Supreme Court

Following the announcement of Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's retirement on July 1, 2005, Bush nominated John Roberts to succeed her. On September 5, following the death of Chief Justice William Rehnquist, this nomination was withdrawn and Bush instead nominated Roberts for Chief Justice to succeed Rehnquist. Roberts was confirmed by the Senate as the 17th Chief Justice on September 29, 2005.

On October 3, 2005, Bush nominated long time White House Counsel Harriet Miers for O'Connor's position. After facing significant opposition from both parties, who found her to be ill-prepared and uninformed on the law, Miers asked that her name be withdrawn on October 27. Four days later, on October 31, Bush nominated federal appellate judge Samuel Alito. Alito was confirmed as the 110th Supreme Court Justice on January 31, 2006.

Other courts

In addition to his two Supreme Court appointments, Bush appointed 61 judges to the United States courts of appeals and 261 judges to the United States district courts. Each of these numbers, along with his total of 324 judicial appointments, is third in American history, behind both Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton. Bush experienced a number of judicial appointment controversies. Debate during one confirmation session lasted ""39 stupefying hours"" according to The New York Times. On August 3, 2001, the Senate did not consent to keep existing nominations in status quo, returning 40 judicial nominations, and 164 total nominations.

At the outset, Judicature magazine noted that the ""Senate Democrats were gearing up for the approaching confirmation hearings"" before the first set of nominees were sent to the Senate. It then cites The New York Times as saying ""Senate Democrats have pledged they will not automatically vote to confirm Mr. Bush's judicial nominees and will subject them to intense scrutiny.""

The Senate confirmed only 8 out of 60 judicial nominations by October 2001. In February 2003, the Democrats successfully filibustered the nomination of Miguel Estrada.

Domestic

Image

Bush's upbringing in West Texas, his accent, his vacations on his Texas ranch, and his penchant for country metaphors contribute to his folksy, American cowboy image. ""I think people look at him and think John Wayne,"" said Piers Morgan, editor of the British Daily Mirror. It has been suggested that Bush's accent was an active choice, as a way of distinguishing himself from Northeastern intellectuals and anchoring himself to his Texas roots. Both supporters and detractors have pointed to his country persona as reasons for their support or criticism.

Bush has been parodied by the media, comedians, and other politicians. Detractors tended to cite linguistic errors made by Bush during his public speeches, which are colloquially referred to as Bushisms. Some pundits labeled Bush ""the worst president ever"". In contrast to his father, who was perceived as having troubles with an overarching unifying theme, Bush embraced larger visions and was seen as a man of larger ideas and associated huge risks. Tony Blair wrote in 2010 that the caricature of Bush as being dumb is ""ludicrous"" and that Bush is ""very smart"". In an interview with Playboy, New York Times columnist David Brooks said George W. Bush ""was 60 IQ points smarter in private than he was in public. He doesn't want anybody to think he's smarter than they are, so puts on a Texas act.""

Job approval

Bush began his presidency with approval ratings near 50 percent. After the September 11 attacks, Bush gained an approval rating of 90 percent, maintaining 80 to 90 percent approval for four months after the attacks. It remained over 50 percent during most of his first term and then fell to as low as 19 percent in his second term.

In 2000 and again in 2004, Time magazine named George W. Bush as its Person of the Year, a title awarded to someone who the editors believe ""has done the most to influence the events of the year"". In May 2004, Gallup reported that 89 percent of the Republican electorate approved of Bush. However, the support waned due mostly to a minority of Republicans' frustration with him on issues of spending, illegal immigration, and Middle Eastern affairs.

Within the United States armed forces, according to an unscientific survey, the president was strongly supported in the 2004 presidential elections. While 73 percent of military personnel said that they would vote for Bush, 18 percent preferred his Democratic rival, John Kerry. According to Peter Feaver, a Duke University political scientist who has studied the political leanings of the U.S. military, members of the armed services supported Bush because they found him more likely than Kerry to complete the War in Iraq.

Bush's approval rating went below the 50 percent mark in AP-Ipsos polling in December 2004. Thereafter, his approval ratings and approval of his handling of domestic and foreign policy issues steadily dropped. Bush received heavy criticism for his handling of the Iraq War, his response to Hurricane Katrina and to the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse, NSA warrantless surveillance, the Plame affair, and Guantanamo Bay detention camp controversies. There were calls for Bush's impeachment, though most polls showed a plurality of Americans would not support such an action. The arguments offered for impeachment usually centered on the NSA warrantless surveillance controversy, the Bush administration's justification for the war in Iraq, and alleged violations of the Geneva Conventions. Representative Dennis Kucinich (D-OH), who had run against Bush during the 2004 presidential campaign, introduced 35 articles of impeachment on the floor of the House of Representatives against Bush on June 9, 2008, but Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) declared that impeachment was ""off the table"".

Polls conducted in 2006 showed an average of 37 percent approval ratings for Bush, the lowest for any second-term president at that point of his term since Harry S. Truman in March 1951 (when Truman's approval rating was 28 percent), which contributed to what Bush called the ""thumping"" of the Republican Party in the 2006 mid-term elections. Throughout most of 2007, Bush's approval rating hovered in the mid-thirties; the average for his entire second term was 37 percent, according to Gallup.

By the beginning of 2008, his final year in office, Bush's approval rating had dropped to a low of just 19 percent, largely from the loss of support among Republicans. Commenting on his low poll numbers and accusations of being ""the worst president,"" Bush would say, ""I make decisions on what I think is right for the United States based upon principles. I frankly don't give a damn about the polls.""

In the spring of that year, Bush's disapproval ratings reached the highest ever recorded for any president in the 70-year history of the Gallup poll, with 69 percent of those polled in April 2008 disapproving of the job Bush was doing as president and 28 percent approving—although the majority (66 percent) of Republicans still approved of his job performance.

In polls conducted in the fall, just before the 2008 election, his approval ratings remained at record lows of 19 to 20 percent, while his disapproval ratings ranged from 67 percent to as high as 75 percent. In polling conducted January 9–11, 2009, his final job approval rating by Gallup was 34 percent, which placed him on par with Jimmy Carter and Harry S. Truman, the other presidents whose final Gallup ratings measured in the low 30s (Richard Nixon's final Gallup approval rating was even lower, at 24 percent). According to a CBS News/New York Times poll conducted January 11–15, 2009, Bush's final approval rating in office was 22 percent, the lowest in American history.

Foreign perceptions

Bush was criticized internationally and targeted by the global anti-war and anti-globalization campaigns for his administration's foreign policy. Views of him within the international community—even in France, a close ally of the United States—were more negative than those of most previous American presidents in history.

Bush was described as having especially close personal relationships with Tony Blair of Great Britain and Vicente Fox of Mexico, although formal relations were sometimes strained. Other leaders, such as Afghan president Hamid Karzai, Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni, Spanish prime minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, and Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez, openly criticized the president. Later in Bush's presidency, tensions arose between him and Vladimir Putin, which led to a cooling of their relationship.

In 2006, most respondents in 18 of 21 countries surveyed around the world were found to hold an unfavorable opinion of Bush. Respondents indicated that they judged his administration as negative for world security. In 2007, the Pew Global Attitudes Project reported that during the Bush presidency, attitudes towards the United States, and towards Americans, became less favorable around the world.

A March 2007 survey of Arab opinion conducted by Zogby International and the University of Maryland found that Bush was the most disliked leader in the Arab world.

The Pew Research Center's 2007 Global Attitudes poll found that out of 47 countries, in only nine countries did most respondents express ""a lot of confidence"" or ""some confidence"" in Bush: Ethiopia, Ghana, India, Israel, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Mali, Nigeria, and Uganda.

During a June 2007 visit to the predominantly Muslim Albania, Bush was greeted enthusiastically. Albania has a population of 2.8 million, has troops in both Iraq and Afghanistan, and the country's government is highly supportive of American foreign policy. A huge image of the President was hung in the middle of the capital city of Tirana flanked by Albanian and American flags while a local street was named after him. A shirt-sleeved statue of Bush was unveiled in Fushë-Krujë, a few kilometers northwest of Tirana. The Bush administration's support for the independence of Albanian-majority Kosovo, while endearing him to the Albanians, has troubled U.S. relations with Serbia, leading to the February 2008 torching of the U.S. embassy in Belgrade.

Acknowledgments and dedications

On May 7, 2005, during an official state visit to Latvia, Bush was awarded the Order of the Three Stars presented to him by President Vaira Vīķe-Freiberga. A few places outside the United States bear Bush's name. In 2005, the Tbilisi City Council voted to rename a street in honor of the U.S. president. Previously known as Melaani Drive, the street links the Georgian capital's airport with the city center and was used by Bush's motorcade during his visit four months earlier. A street in Tirana, formerly known as Rruga Puntorët e Rilendjes, situated directly outside the Albanian Parliament, was renamed after Bush a few days before he made the first-ever visit by an American president to Albania in June 2007. In Jerusalem, a small plaza with a monument bearing his name is also dedicated to Bush.

In 2012, Estonian President Toomas Hendrik Ilves awarded Bush the Order of the Cross of Terra Mariana for his work in expanding NATO.

Reception

The George W. Bush presidency has been ranked among the worst in surveys of presidential scholars published in the late 2000s and 2010s.

After his re-election in 2004, Bush received increasingly heated criticism from across the political spectrum for his handling of the Iraq War, Hurricane Katrina, and other challenges. Amid this criticism, the Democratic Party regained control of Congress in the 2006 elections. In December 2007, the United States entered its longest post-World War II recession, often referred to as the ""Great Recession"", prompting the Bush administration to obtain congressional passage of multiple economic programs intended to preserve the country's financial system. Nationally, Bush was both one of the most popular and unpopular presidents in history, having received the highest recorded presidential approval ratings in the wake of the September 11 attacks, as well as one of the lowest approval ratings during the 2008 financial crisis.

For his part, Bush said in 2013, ""Ultimately history will judge the decisions I made, and I won't be around because it will take time for the objective historians to show up. So I am pretty comfortable with it. I did what I did.""

Residence (2009–present)

Following the inauguration of Barack Obama, Bush and his family flew from Andrews Air Force Base to a homecoming celebration in Midland, Texas, following which they returned to their ranch in Crawford, Texas. They bought a home in the Preston Hollow neighborhood of Dallas, Texas, where they settled down.

He makes regular appearances at various events throughout the Dallas/Fort Worth area, most notably when he conducted the opening coin toss at the Dallas Cowboys first game in the team's new stadium in Arlington and an April 2009 visit to a Texas Rangers game, where he thanked the people of Dallas for helping him settle in and was met with a standing ovation. He also attended every home playoff game for the Texas Rangers 2010 season and, accompanied by his father, threw out the ceremonial first pitch at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington for Game 4 of the 2010 World Series on October 31, 2010.

On August 6, 2013, Bush was successfully treated for a coronary artery blockage with a stent. The blockage had been found during an annual medical examination.

In reaction to the 2016 shooting of Dallas police officers, Bush stated: ""Laura and I are heartbroken by the heinous acts of violence in our city last night. Murdering the innocent is always evil, never more so than when the lives taken belong to those who protect our families and communities.""

Publications and appearances

Since leaving office, Bush has kept a relatively low profile though he has made public appearances, most notably after the release of his memoirs in 2010 and for the 10th anniversary of the September 11 attacks in 2011. In March 2009, he delivered his first post-presidency speech in Calgary, Alberta, appeared via video on The Colbert Report during which he praised U.S. troops for earning a ""special place in American history,"" and attended the funeral of Senator Ted Kennedy. Bush made his debut as a motivational speaker on October 26 at the ""Get Motivated"" seminar in Dallas. In the aftermath of the Fort Hood shooting that took place on November 5, 2009, in Texas, the Bushes paid an undisclosed visit to the survivors and victims' families the day following the shooting, having contacted the base commander requesting that the visit be private and not involve press coverage.

Bush released his memoirs, Decision Points, on November 9, 2010. During a pre-release appearance promoting the book, Bush said he considered his biggest accomplishment to be keeping ""the country safe amid a real danger"", and his greatest failure to be his inability to secure the passage of Social Security reform. He also made news defending his administration's enhanced interrogation techniques, specifically the waterboarding of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, saying, ""I'd do it again to save lives.""

In 2012, he wrote the foreword of The 4% Solution: Unleashing the Economic Growth America Needs, an economics book published by the George W. Bush Presidential Center. He also presented the book at the Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas, Texas.

Bush appeared on NBC's The Tonight Show with Jay Leno on November 19, 2013, along with the former First Lady, Laura Bush. When asked by Leno why he does not comment publicly about the Obama administration, Bush said, ""I don't think it's good for the country to have a former president criticize his successor."" Despite this statement, on Saturday, April 25, 2015, Bush criticized President Barack Obama at a meeting of the Republican Jewish Coalition at the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas. Bush criticized Obama's handling of Iran, specifically with respect to sanctions and a nuclear deal, saying: ""You think the Middle East is chaotic now? Imagine what it looks like for our grandchildren. That's how Americans should view the deal."" Bush also attacked Obama's withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq in 2011, calling it a ""strategic blunder"", borrowing a term that had been used by South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham.

Alongside the 2014 United States–Africa Leaders Summit, Bush, Michelle Obama, the State Department, and the George W. Bush Institute hosted a daylong forum on education and health with the spouses of the African leaders attending the summit. Bush urged African leaders to avoid discriminatory laws that make the treatment of HIV/AIDS more difficult.

Bush has spoken in favor of increased global participation of women in politics and societal matters in foreign countries.

On November 2, 2014, Bush spoke at an event to 200 business and civic leaders at the George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum to raise awareness for the upcoming Museum of the Bible in Washington D.C.

Bush published a biography of his father, George Bush, called 41: A Portrait of My Father. It was released on November 11, 2014.

In an interview published by Israel Hayom magazine on June 12, 2015, Bush said that ""boots on the ground"" would be needed in order to defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS). He added that people had said during his Presidency that he should withdraw American troops from Iraq, but he chose the opposite, sending 30,000 more troops in order to defeat Al Qaeda in Iraq, and that Al Qaeda in Iraq was defeated. Bush was also asked about Iran but declined to answer, stating that any answer he gives would be interpreted as undermining President Barack Obama.

In February 2016, George W. Bush spoke and campaigned for his brother Jeb Bush in South Carolina during a rally for the Jeb Bush presidential campaign in the 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries.

While Bush endorsed the Republican Party's 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney, he declined to endorse the 2016 Republican nominee Donald Trump and he did not attend the 2016 Republican National Convention, which formally nominated Trump. On the eve of Trump's nomination, it was reported that Bush had privately expressed concern about the current direction of the Republican Party and told a group of his former aides and advisors, ""I'm worried that I will be the last Republican president."" Bush and his wife Laura did not vote for Trump in the 2016 presidential election according to a spokesperson for the Bush family, instead choosing to leave their presidential ballots blank. After the election, Bush, his father, and his brother Jeb called Trump on the phone to congratulate him on his victory. Both he and Laura attended Trump's inauguration, and images of Bush struggling to put on a rain poncho during the ceremony became an internet meme.

In February 2017, Bush released a book of his own portraits of veterans called Portraits of Courage (full title: Portraits of Courage: A Commander in Chief's Tribute to America's Warriors.

Collaborations

In January 2010, at President Obama's request, Bush and Bill Clinton established the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund to raise contributions for relief and recovery efforts following the 2010 Haiti earthquake earlier that month.

On May 2, 2011, President Obama called Bush, who was at a restaurant with his wife, to inform him that Osama bin Laden had been killed. The Bushes joined the Obamas in New York City to mark the tenth anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. At the Ground Zero memorial, Bush read a letter that President Abraham Lincoln wrote to a widow who lost five sons during the Civil War.

Art

After serving as president, Bush began painting as a hobby after reading Winston Churchill's essay ""Painting as a Pastime"". Subjects have included people, dogs, and still life. He has also painted self-portraits and portraits of world leaders, including Vladimir Putin and Tony Blair. In February 2017, Bush released a book of portraits of veterans, Portraits of Courage. The net proceeds from his book are donated to the George W. Bush Presidential Center.

Bill Arning, director of the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston, called his portraits ""thickly painted in what I would call 'high-amateur' mode"" and wrote, ""I would say they need to be less based on photographic reproduction. You can tell when someone is taking a found photograph and making a painting out of it [...] I think he'd be well advised to work from other, multiple photographic sources or the real person to get a little bit more liveliness going on.""

Legacy

President Bush's legacy continues to develop today. Supporters credit Bush's counterterrorism policies with preventing another major terrorist attack from occurring in the US after 9/11 and also praise individual policies such as the Medicare prescription drug benefit and the AIDS relief program known as PEPFAR. Critics often point to his handling of the Iraq War, specifically the failure to find weapons of mass destruction, that were the main rationale behind the initial invasion—as well as his handling of tax policy, Hurricane Katrina, climate change and the 2008 financial crisis—as proof that George W. Bush was unfit to be president.

Several historians and commentators hold the view that Bush was one of the most consequential presidents in American history. Princeton University scholar Julian Zelizer described Bush's presidency as a ""transformative"" one, and said that ""some people hate him, some people love him, but I do think he'll have a much more substantive perception as time goes on"". Bryon Williams of The Huffington Post referred to Bush as ""the most noteworthy president since FDR"" and said that the Patriot Act ""increased authority of the executive branch at the expense of judicial opinions about when searches and seizures are reasonable"" as evidence. Bush's administration presided over the largest tax cuts since the Reagan administration, and his homeland security reforms proved to be the most significant expansion of the federal government since the Great Society. Much of these policies have endured in the administrations of his two immediate successors, Barack Obama and Donald Trump. A 2010 Siena Research Institute survey of the opinions of historians, political scientists, and presidential scholars ranked him 39th out of 43 presidents. The survey respondents gave President Bush low ratings on his handling of the U.S. economy, communication, ability to compromise, foreign policy accomplishments, and intelligence.

Among the public, his reputation has improved somewhat since his presidency ended in 2009. In February 2012, Gallup reported that ""Americans still rate George W. Bush among the worst presidents, though their views have become more positive in the three years since he left office."" Gallup had earlier noted that Bush's favorability ratings in public opinion surveys had begun to rise a year after he had left office, from 40 percent in January 2009 and 35 percent in March 2009, to 45 percent in July 2010, a period during which he had remained largely out of the news. Other pollsters have noted similar trends of slight improvement in Bush's personal favorability since the end of his presidency. In April 2013, Bush's approval rating stood at 47 percent approval and 50 percent disapproval in a poll jointly conducted for The Washington Post and ABC, his highest approval rating since December 2005. Bush had achieved notable gains among seniors, non-college whites, and moderate and conservative Democrats since leaving office, although majorities disapproved of his handling of the economy (53 percent) and the Iraq War (57 percent). His 47 percent approval rating was equal to that of President Obama's in the same polling period. A CNN poll conducted that same month found that 55 percent of Americans said Bush's presidency had been a failure, with opinions divided along party lines, and 43 percent of independents calling it a success.",1,https://alchetron.com/George-W-Bush

105,Bush,George W.,fair,"Media Make Excuses for Bush Sr.’s ‘Cop-a-Feel’ Assaults Tegan Jones

In the flurry of career-ending sexual assault claims coming out of Hollywood, it may seem natural for the media to overlook a little awkward groping from an aging former president. But there’s something unnerving about the assumptions surrounding the non-coverage of the Bush Sr. “Cop-a-Feel” story.

On their own, the facts are simple enough. Five women have accused President George H.W. Bush of grabbing their behinds and making lewd jokes during staged photo ops over the past few years. In each woman’s account, the former president said something along the lines of, “Do you know who my favorite magician is? David Cop-a-Feel!” while squeezing their rear ends in a sexual way.

After the second accusation came out, the Bush team released a brief fauxpology to anyone who he may have “offended”:

At age 93, President Bush has been confined to a wheelchair for roughly five years, so his arm falls on the lower waist of people with whom he takes pictures. To try to put people at ease, the president routinely tells the same joke — and on occasion, he has patted women’s rears in what he intended to be a good-natured manner. Some have seen it as innocent; others clearly view it as inappropriate. To anyone he has offended, President Bush apologizes most sincerely.

The media dutifully reported this canned response, and most outlets took it at face value. None noted that when the press release uses the term “people,” it’s not actually referring to all people. It’s referring to women.

If the 41st president’s arm had fallen “on the lower waist” of a man during a picture, the story would have been told differently. If he had joked about “copping a feel” while cupping a man’s glute, few reporters would entertain the idea that the man was being put “at ease.”

But the victims are women, and many stories have searched for ways to explain away the former president’s behavior.

For instance, at the end of “George H.W. Bush Apologizes After Women Accuse Him of Grabbing Them” (New York Times, 10/27/17), (male) writers Jonah Engel Bromwich and Matt Stevens offer a possible explanation for the former president’s behavior:

Mr. Bush is the oldest living president and has a relatively rare form of Parkinson’s disease called vascular Parkinsonism, a disease in which a stroke or series of strokes damage nerve cells in the brain. Generally, the disease can lead to abnormal and out-of-character behavior, as well as depression or memory problems.

This otherwise unattributed generalization links to a USA Today article (“Medical Condition May Factor Into George H.W. Bush’s Recent Lapses,” 10/26/17) that quotes a (male) professor of neurology from the University of Cincinnati: “Any damage to the frontal lobes, the part of the brain right behind the forehead, can cause personality changes, executive function problems and a loss of self-control,” Dr. Alberto Espay, who does not treat the former president, told USA Today.

CNN (10/28/17) similarly positioned the controversy as a debate between those who see Bush’s actions as sexual assault and those who think they’re the “good-natured” jokes of an infirm old man. Dr. Daniel Amen, a (male) neuroscience and brain-imaging expert, who does not treat the former president, shared his thoughts on the potential side effects of vascular Parkinsonism. “It can also affect the front part of your brain—things like judgment, forethought, impulse control and people who have never acted badly or inappropriately their whole life, all of the sudden they start to do things that are out of character,” he told CNN.

But if these are just the ill-advised outbreaks of an infirm old man, why is this the specific way his judgment falters? And why doesn’t his staff and family take steps to curb this behavior?

The Washington Post (10/27/17) was one of the few outlets to shine a light on the complacency of those around the former president. In “Another Woman Accuses George H.W. Bush of Groping and Making a ‘David Cop-a-Feel’ Joke,” (female) writers Marwa Eltagouri and Kristine Phillips highlight the tepid response of those who witnessed the assault of Jordana Grolnick:

The other women posing for the photo laughed uncomfortably, Grolnick said, while Barbara Bush made a remark along the lines of “He’s going to get himself put into jail!” Grolnick, who posted a photo of the moment on her Instagram account, said she had been warned by other actors not to stand next to Bush.

The piece also recounts how “a friend of the Bush family” asked novelist Christina Baker Kline to be “discreet” after President Bush Sr. groped her in 2014. In this way, it touched briefly on the real issue at hand—which isn’t the former president’s morals or his mental state. The real story is about everyone else in the picture.

The fact that when the elder President Bush sexually grabs women, people laugh but then warn women away is why his behavior continues. And lukewarm, almost begrudging media coverage is not helping the situation. It tells women everywhere that being groped, even by a former world leader, is barely news.

That’s not good enough for Jordana Grolnick and the countless women who have stories just like hers. The only way to stop sexual assault is to stop enabling offenders, she told CNN:",1,http://fair.org/home/media-make-excuses-for-bush-sr-s-cop-a-feel-assaults/

107,Bush,George W.,outsidethebeltway,"Don’t Expect Other Republicans To Speak Out Against Trump Like McCain, Corker, And Flake Have

Due mostly to cowardice and naked self-interest, you shouldn't expect many other Republicans to speak out against Trump in the near future.

Doug Mataconis · · 20 comments

In the past week alone, a series of senior Republicans such as John McCain, Bob Corker, and George W. Bush have taken the opportunity to denounce the state of American politics today and, at least implicitly, the Presidency of Donald Trump. Yesterday, Arizona Senator Jeff Flake joined them with an announcement that he would not stand for re-election due largely to what Trump has done to the Republican Party, a position he followed up on in a Washington Post Op-Ed this morning and numerous morning show appearances on television. In doing so, they’ve revealed a fault line that has been rumored and hinted at for several months now by reports of Senators and Congressman behind the scenes talking about the problems that President Trump’s tirades on Twitter and other outbursts, as well as the rhetoric coming from some of the top people in the White House, have diverted both the Administration and Congress from anything approaching a coherent agenda while at the same time creating domestic political chaos and growing doubts about the reliability of the United States among allies and other foreign nations that look to the United States for leadership and, in many cases, protection from threats ranging from Russia and ISIS to North Korea. In some cases, the doubts have even come from inside the Administration, such as when Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was reported to have referred to the President as a “moron” after a briefing on Afghanistan.

Inevitably, this has raised questions about whether or not other Republicans might follow the lead of Flake and the others and become more vocal in voicing criticism of the Administration:

WASHINGTON — A former Republican president. A senior Republican senator with a critical illness. A retiring Republican senator. And now an independent-minded Republican senator who faced a difficult, if not impossible, path to re-election. George W. Bush. John McCain. Bob Corker. And now Jeff Flake of Arizona, who delivered a stinging indictment of President Trump and his own party on the Senate floor on Tuesday afternoon as he announced that he would not seek another term. His stirring call to arms came minutes after Mr. Trump concluded a private session with Senate Republicans meant to unite them over their shared agenda. The four men represent a new type of freedom caucus, one whose members are free to speak their minds about the president and how they see his words and actions diminishing the United States and its standing in the world without fear of the political backlash from hard-right conservatives. But who — if anyone — will follow? Well aware of the mercurial nature of the president, most congressional Republicans are loath to do or say anything that could upset Mr. Trump and risk provoking an early-morning Twitter tirade from the White House when they are trying to delicately piece together a complex tax agreement. One can practically sense Republicans tiptoeing around the Capitol, taking extra care not to awaken the president to their presence in a way that could draw a scolding or rebuke. They are equally wary of raising the ire of hard-right activists who already had Mr. Flake in their sights, contributing to his decision. Those activists celebrated Mr. Flake’s decision, claiming a Republican scalp.

Ross Douthat, meanwhile, uses the occasion of Flake decision not to run for re-election to call on Republicans to take action:

To the extent that there’s a plausible theory behind all of these halfhearted efforts, it’s that resisting Trump too vigorously only strengthens his hold on the party’s base, by vindicating his claim to have all the establishment arrayed against him. But the problem with this logic is that it offers a permanent excuse for doing nothing, no matter how bad Trump’s reign becomes. (“I’d criticize him for accidentally nuking Manila, but you know, then Fox News would just make it all about me …”) In the end, if you want Republican voters to reject Trumpism, you need to give them clear electoral opportunities to do so — even if you expect defeat, even if it’s all but certain. And an anti-Trump movement that gives high-minded speeches but never mounts candidates confirms Trump’s claim to face establishment opposition while alsoconfirming his judgment of the establishment’s guts and stamina — proving that they’re all low-energy, all “liddle” men, all unwilling to fight him man to man. If Corker really means what he keeps saying about the danger posed by Trump’s effective incapacity, he should call openly for impeachment or for 25th Amendment proceedings — and other anti-Trump Republicans should join him. If Flake really means what he said in his impassioned speech, and he doesn’t want to waste time and energy on a foredoomed Senate primary campaign, then he should choose a different hopeless-seeming cause and primary Trump in 2020. George W. Bush should endorse him. So should McCain, and Corker, and Romney, and Kasich, and Sasse, and the rest of the anti-Trump list. They should expect to lose, and badly, but they should make Trump actually defeat them, instead of just clearing the field for his second nomination. The president’s G.O.P. critics should engage in electoral battle because the act of campaigning, the work of actually trying to persuade voters, is the only way anti-Trump Republicans will come to grips with the legitimate reasons that their ideas had become so unpopular that voters opted for demagoguery instead. A speechifying anti-Trumpism, distant from the fray, will always be self-regarding and self-deceiving — unwilling to see how the Iraq War discredited both the Bushist and McCainian styles of right-wing internationalism, incapable of addressing the economic disappointments that turned voters against Flake’s Goldwaterite libertarianism and Romney’s “trust me, I’m a businessman” promises. Only in actual political competition can the Republican elite reckon with why it lost its party, and how it might win again without succumbing to Trumpian indecency.

Daniel Larison, meanwhile, is skeptical about the idea of a Republican uprising against Trump:

Almost all of Trump’s loudest intra-party critics are incapable or unwilling to “come to grips” with the reasons why they lost their party. They couldn’t come to grips with any of the reasons for the 2006 and 2008 defeats, and they absolutely refused to come to grips with them after losing in 2012. On foreign policy in particular, they are stubbornly committed as a party to much the same mindless aggressiveness and interventionism that contributed to their defeats in the past. Bush and McCain don’t reckon with how their preferred policies abroad have led to multiple disasters because they will never acknowledge that those policies were wrong from the start. McCain conveniently declares that he stands for American ideals, pats himself on the back for how high-minded he is, and then urges the U.S. to pursue the same costly, dangerous foreign policy that he has advocated for at least the last twenty years. Other Trump critics cheer him on for this self-serving, myopic rhetoric. (…) This is not a party that is interested in rethinking assumptions or learning from catastrophic errors. On the contrary, it is a party in which most Trumpists and anti-Trumpists seem to find common ground in their desire to create new disasters abroad. On the issues where Republican resistance to Trump is most needed and would be most constructive, instead we see almost all Trump critics inside the party fall in line and applaud. Until Trump’s elected Republican critics are able to offer something other than reheated Bushism, they may as well quit.

Unfortunately, I find myself agreeing with Larison and concluding that Republicans will not stand up to Trump notwithstanding his increasingly irrational Twitter outbursts and the other divisive statements that he has made in press appearances, speeches, and comments through his White House spokespersons. As with the reaction last year when the Access Hollywood tape was made public or over the summer when Trump made comments about the events in Charlottesville, Virginia that he later doubled-down on on more than one occasion, there will be some times when Trump does something that causes Republicans to be forced to speak publicly. As we did on those occasions, we’ll get the same denunciations and statements of regret from Republican leadership and others on Capitol Hill. In the end, though, it will all amount to nothing, because these same Senators, Congressmen, and Republican Party representatives will continue to dutifully line up behind a President that shows no signs of having the maturity or judgment to do his job and who continues to suffer from the worst job approval ratings of any newly American President in modern history. This will be especially true of House members, and of those Senators facing re-election in 2018 and beyond. Even those denunciations will be rare, though, and the overwhelming response of Republicans who might actually have the ability to make a difference will be to cowardly respond “No comment” or simply remain silent against the overwhelming evidence of this President’s mendacity, dishonesty, and overall incompetence.

The main reason for this silence are two-fold.

First, there are some Republicans who continue to believe that remaining silent in the face of Trump’s outrages is in their interest because it is the best way to get their agenda enacted in areas such as tax reform, spending cuts, and other legislative issues. To these people, chief among who are most likely the members of the Republican leadership in the House and Senate such as Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell, Trump is seen as just a guy with a pen who will sign whatever they put in front of him. To some extent, this strategy makes sense. Republicans in Congress have been telling their base for years now that the only way they can accomplish anything is if they control the levers of government not just in the Legislative Branch but also in the White House. Now that the voters have given them exactly that, they have the opportunity to enact into law ideas that they’ve only been able to talk about in theory for the past decade or more. In reality, though, this position ignores several important facts that call the entire strategy into question.

First of all, this idea underestimates the extent to which Trump can undermine that agenda either via his own Tweets and the inevitable controversies they cause — such as those over the past two weeks over calls to a soldiers family after he died and Trump’s irrational fight with Senator Bob Corker — only serves to detour the attention of both the public and Congress from what Congress is trying to accomplish. Second, this argument forgets the extent to which Trump himself has already acted to undermine his own party’s legislative efforts even in areas that he supposedly campaigned on. The best example of this, of course, came during the health care debate over the spring and summer when Trump first praised the House GOP for passing an Obamacare ‘repeal and replace’ bill in a Rose Garden statement and then turned around within a month and called the very same bill “mean.” Similarly, Trump arguably contributed to the inability of the Senate to pass any kind of health care reform bill when he publicly attacked Senators who were expressing doubts about the various proposals even while McConnell was seeking to solicit their votes. This argument also ignores the possibility that Trump could ultimately go behind the backs of GOP leadership and cut deals with the Democrats like he did with the temporary budget measure and DACA, thereby presenting Republicans in Congress with a fait accompli that they have little choice but to accept. Finally, of course, this strategy ignores the extent to which remaining silent in the fact of Trumpian idiocy does long-term damage to the Republican brand that could have a real impact on the elections in 2018 and beyond, election outcomes that could have a serious impact on their ability to get anything done at all.

The second reason for silence among most Republicans is entirely self-serving, and it makes that silence even more cowardly. Elected Republicans, especially those up for re-election next year and in 2020, will remain silent because they fear the wrath of Trump and of his supporters in primary battles. In this way, they are acting in much the same way they did during the Obama Presidency when Republicans on Capitol Hill declined to take action on issues such as immigration reform or gun control and maintained irrational hardline positions on issues such as the debt ceiling and budget negotiations. Back then, it was Tea Party organizations and groups such as FreedomWorks and The Club For Growth that they were afraid they would become the target of in a primary. Today, it’s a combination of those groups and the Trumpian base of the party as well as Steve Bannon, Breitbart and others that they are kowtowing to in order to protect their own political futures. It is a cowardly position to take, of course, but for politicians with an inherent sense of self-preservation, it is, I suppose, understandable.

As for the pundits, while there are many strong voices in the “Never Trump” crowd out there, there are just as many conservative and Republican talking heads who have dutifully adopted the Trumpian line. For many of them, I suspect, it’s because they actually believe the nonsense they’re spouting, but given the extent to which the GOP in general and conservatism in particular have become perverted by irrational populism due to trends that began with the rise of talk-radio in the1990s and the often irrational anti-Clinton rhetoric that it thrived on, it’s not very surprising that there are a large number of self-proclaimed “conservatives” who actually believe what they’re saying about Donald Trump. In other cases, there are those who have no doubt become obsequious supporters of the President because its in their financial and professional interests to do so. Being a slavish supporter of this President, after all, is generally the only way to get on Fox News Channel or to get the clicks from conservative web surfers that these types of people crave. For these people, personal gain and popularity are obviously more important than integrity and the good of the country. Consider it the political equivalent of Judas betraying Jesus for thirty piees of silver.

In any case, to get back to the title of this post, it’s quite clear that we won’t see many Republicans to follow in the footsteps of McCain, Corker, and Flake. The vast majorty of Republicans on Capitol Hill will continue to stand behind this President no matter what he says or does, and the pundits will be right there with them cheering along. Meanwhile, the rest of us will have to figure out some other way to counter the damage that this President is doing to the country because his own party isn’t going to do a damn thing.",1,http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/dont-expect-other-republicans-to-speak-out-against-trump-like-mccain-corker-flake-have/

On Saturday, former presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush and Jimmy Carter attended “Deep from the Heart: The One America Appeal,” a benefit concert held in Texas to raise money for hurricane relief efforts. Meanwhile, Trump was reportedly playing golf. Oh, but he did make sure to send a recorded message.

“To Presidents Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W.

Over 30 women have reportedly come forward accusing director James Toback of sexual harassment. Toback sexually harassed women looking for work for decades, presenting his actions as “all part of the process,” according to the testimonies of 38 women interviewed by The Los Angeles Times.

“The way he presented it, it was like, ‘This is how things are done,’” actress Adrienne LaValley told The Times of a 2008 hotel room encounter that ended with Toback attempting to rub himself on her leg. “I felt like a prostitute, an utter disappointment to myself, my parents, my friends. And I deserved not to tell anyone.”

Former aspiring actress Starr Rinaldi recalled Toback’s tactics as “a test of whether I’m a real artist and serious about acting.”

“He always wanted me to read for him in a hotel or come back to his apartment,” Rinaldi said. “Like, ‘How serious are you about your craft?’”

109,Bush,George W.,dailycaller,"As a precinct chairman, I walked neighborhoods in the blazing Florida sun, heat and humidity; sweating like crazy, campaigning for George W. Bush. I hated knocking on stranger’s doors, but I did it anyway.

Hearing Bush include “white supremacy” in his trash-Trump-speech was horrifying; extremely disappointing. Why on earth would a former Republican president play along with America-hating Leftists? President Bush gave credibility to the despicable Leftist’s lie that white supremacy is such a big problem in our country that he had to denounce it in his speech. There are barely enough white supremacists in America to fill a phone booth. And yet, Bush joined Leftists in dissing and lying on Trump supporters by inferring that they are a bunch of bigots.

President Bush that was a horrible thing to do. Despite my best efforts to educate my black relatives to the truth that Trump is not a racist and is actually helping blacks, young family members firmly believe Trump and his white supremacist voters hate them.

President Bush, haven’t you been watching the news; witnessing the devastating consequences of the Leftists’ lie which claims white supremacists are running the country since Trump was elected? President Bush, cops are being assassinated. Trump supporters are physically assaulted. The NFL is absurdly discussing launching a white-cops-stop-murdering- blacks month.

White guilt and fear has caused politicians to allow paid George Soros thugs to drag down historical monuments in the name of social justice. Soros has spent $18 billion hiring operatives to bring down America via racial division, hate, destruction of property and violence in our streets.

Eighteen billion dollars buys tons of political mercenaries. Soros’ paid army of anarchists probably far outnumber the handful of white supremacists in America. Soros’ Antifa is planning a Nov. 4th civil war to overthrow the Trump Administration. We are hearing talk of a impending race war. The last thing our country needs is a former president joining Leftists in promoting their lie that hate America groups have a legit beef. America is the greatest land of opportunity on the planet for all who choose to go for it. Anything else is an evil lie.

I get it President Bush. You hate Trump. You and your Washington DC establishment elites are still fuming that a commoner, an everyday Joe like Trump kicked ya’ll butts; winning the White House. I suspect it was pretty humiliating seeing Trump who in comparison spent a nickle on his presidential campaign defeat your brother Jeb who spent $130 million.

But President Bush, how could you throw our country under the bus by furthering Leftists’ lie which has ignited racial division, hate and violence? Read my lips, white supremacy is not an issue in America! President Bush, by furthering Leftists’ Trump-voters-are-racist narrative you have placed cops and white American lives at risk. Are you so out of touch with real America that you do not realize the evil and dire consequences of furthering Leftists’ bogus narrative about Trump, cops and his supporters? Or, have you and your establishment buddies joined Leftists in deeming national race relations and American lives acceptable collateral damage in your demented quest to get Trump out of the Oval Office. Wow!

With America’s airways filled with talking heads badgering everyday Americans about how much black lives matter, Washington elites and Leftists are sacrificing black lives in their vendetta against Trump. By falsely portraying Trump supporters and cops as threats to black lives, Washington elites and Leftists are ignoring the elephants in the room of black-on-black homicide and disproportionate black abortions.

While spreading their fake concerns for social justice and racial equality, Washington elites and Leftists refuse to tackle real issues plaguing American blacks. Leftists seek to destroy anyone who suggest common sense changes blacks can make to help themselves. Blacks are mere useful idiots in Washington elite’s and Leftists’ mission to kick Trump out of the White House.

President Bush, I campaigned hard for you. You truly disappoint me bro.

112,Bush,George W.,themoderatevoice,"

By KATHLEEN PARKER

Washington Post Writers Group Columnmist

WASHINGTON — George W. Bush’s speech last week at a forum hosted by his eponymous institute might as well have been titled “Dear Donald.” The 43rd president all but called out the current president by name as he lamented the tone and character of today’s political rhetoric.

“Bigotry seems emboldened,” said Bush. “Our politics seems more vulnerable to conspiracy theories and outright fabrication.”

Indeed.

Trump likes to label these theories and fabrications “fake news,” but “fake news” is Trump’s own invention — and his greatest fabrication to date. Now the rallying cry for millions of Trump supporters, “fake news” is a deflection, a decoy floated on the human sea of credulity to distract people from coverage he finds unflattering. The truth is, what Trump says and does is so often unflattering without embellishment that adjectives and adverbs needn’t apply.

One need look no further than last Tuesday when, attempting to comfort the widow of a slain soldier, Trump reportedly couldn’t bother to use the deceased’s name and reminded the grieving woman that her husband had known what he was signing up for, but “it hurts anyway.” You could say that. Or not.

By contrast, Bush’s suffering on behalf of the injured and killed whom he sent into harm’s way as president is apparent in his visage, in the portraits of wounded soldiers he has painted, and in his ongoing work with troops and military families. Such actions don’t alter the pain of a deadly mistake, but they at least indicate a profound empathy that is utterly lacking in the current president.

No stranger to media criticism — crushing criticism — Bush never attacked the fourth estate. He also obviously recognizes that worse than a reporter’s or editor’s error is the undermining of public faith in a free press. Once the government succeeds in eliminating a country’s watchdogs, the government becomes the only source of information. Most people know, or should know, how that ends.

The irony is that the very people who curse the media also tend to curse government overreach.

Trump’s “fake news” charge is very much in the vein of propaganda. He has created a false narrative to clear obstacles — such as questioning reporters or the hindrance of accountability — from his path.

Russians are also very good at this. Recent revelations about fake Twitter accounts tied to Russia through which genuinely fake news was posted and distributed to influence the 2016 election remind us of how vulnerable we are to (BEG ITAL)real(END ITAL) fake news. Unfortunately, Trump has helped blur the line between propaganda and what is otherwise known simply as news.

The fact that members of Trump’s campaign and family retweeted some of these real-fake news items demonstrates how difficult it can be to recognize what’s real and what’s not. This may be the greatest challenge of our times. Disinformation combined with generalized antipathy toward the traditional press may be the toxic combination that poisons unity and condemns democratic principles to the hazardous-waste dump. One cannot overemphasize the importance of these developments or of the president’s contributions to the undermining of institutions created by our Constitution to monitor government power.

Recall that a president’s primary duty, in addition to defending the country, is to protect the Constitution. Yet, in just nine months in office, Trump has done more to challenge the integrity of the First Amendment than any other president in history, including expressing interest in making it easier to sue journalists for libel.

He would never actually push such a measure because Trump (BEG ITAL)is(END ITAL) smart and knows he’d get nowhere. But he also knows that many among his base don’t know this. No matter. He’s rallied the base with rhetoric and re-enforced the infrastructure of his greatest deception. Talk about fake news.

In other remarks clearly aimed at Trump, Bush addressed bullying and prejudice in public life that “sets a national tone, provides permission for cruelty and bigotry, and compromises the moral education of children.” And: “We can’t wish globalization away, any more than we could wish away the agricultural revolution or the industrial revolution.”

One needn’t be a sleuth to infer that Bush was speaking to the man oft-referred to as our bully-in-chief, as well as to Trump-the-salesman, who convinced working-class Americans that he would bring back all those jobs lost to globalization. As Bush suggested, globalization is the new age and the old one isn’t coming back.

A Republican president needed to say these things — and his name wasn’t Trump.

114,Bush,George W.,dallasnews,"The following is the text of a speech that George W. Bush gave on October 19, 2017:

We are gathered in the cause of liberty; this is a unique moment. The great democracies face new and serious threats, yet seem to be losing confidence in their own calling and competence. Economic, political and national security challenges proliferate, and they are made worse by the tendency to turn inward. The health of the democratic spirit itself is at issue. And the renewal of that spirit is the urgent task at hand.

Since World War II, America has encouraged and benefited from the global advance of free markets, from the strength of democratic alliances, and from the advance of free societies. At one level, this has been a raw calculation of interest. The 20th century featured some of the worst horrors of history because dictators committed them. Free nations are less likely to threaten and fight each other.

And free trade helped make America into a global economic power.

For more than 70 years, the presidents of both parties believed that American security and prosperity were directly tied to the success of freedom in the world. And they knew that the success depended, in large part, on U.S. leadership. This mission came naturally, because it expressed the DNA of American idealism.

We know, deep down, that repression is not the wave of the future. We know that the desire for freedom is not confined to, or owned by, any culture; it is the inborn hope of our humanity. We know that free governments are the only way to ensure that the strong are just and the weak are valued. And we know that when we lose sight of our ideals, it is not democracy that has failed. It is the failure of those charged with preserving and protecting democracy.

This is not to underestimate the historical obstacles to the development of democratic institutions and a democratic culture. Such problems nearly destroyed our country — and that should encourage a spirit of humility and a patience with others. Freedom is not merely a political menu option, or a foreign policy fad; it should be the defining commitment of our country, and the hope of the world.

That appeal is proved not just by the content of people's hopes, but a noteworthy hypocrisy: No democracy pretends to be a tyranny. Most tyrannies pretend they are democracies. Democracy remains the definition of political legitimacy. That has not changed, and that will not change.

Yet for years, challenges have been gathering to the principles we hold dear. And, we must take them seriously. Some of these problems are external and obvious. Here in New York City, you know the threat of terrorism all too well. It is being fought even now on distant frontiers and in the hidden world of intelligence and surveillance. There is the frightening, evolving threat of nuclear proliferation and outlaw regimes. And there is an aggressive challenge by Russia and China to the norms and rules of the global order — proposed revisions that always seem to involve less respect for the rights of free nations and less freedom for the individual.

These matters would be difficult under any circumstances. They are further complicated by a trend in western countries away from global engagement and democratic confidence. Parts of Europe have developed an identity crisis. We have seen insolvency, economic stagnation, youth unemployment, anger about immigration, resurgent ethno-nationalism, and deep questions about the meaning and durability of the European Union.

America is not immune from these trends. In recent decades, public confidence in our institutions has declined. Our governing class has often been paralyzed in the face of obvious and pressing needs. The American dream of upward mobility seems out of reach for some who feel left behind in a changing economy. Discontent deepened and sharpened partisan conflicts. Bigotry seems emboldened. Our politics seems more vulnerable to conspiracy theories and outright fabrication.

There are some signs that the intensity of support for democracy itself has waned, especially among the young, who never experienced the galvanizing moral clarity of the Cold War, or never focused on the ruin of entire nations by socialist central planning. Some have called this ""democratic deconsolidation."" Really, it seems to be a combination of weariness, frayed tempers, and forgetfulness.

We have seen our discourse degraded by casual cruelty. At times, it can seem like the forces pulling us apart are stronger than the forces binding us together. Argument turns too easily into animosity. Disagreement escalates into dehumanization. Too often, we judge other groups by their worst examples while judging ourselves by our best intentions — forgetting the image of God we should see in each other.

We've seen nationalism distorted into nativism — forgotten the dynamism that immigration has always brought to America. We see a fading confidence in the value of free markets and international trade — forgetting that conflict, instability, and poverty follow in the wake of protectionism.

We have seen the return of isolationist sentiments — forgetting that American security is directly threatened by the chaos and despair of distant places, where threats such as terrorism, infectious disease, criminal gangs and drug trafficking tend to emerge.

In all these ways, we need to recall and recover our own identity. Americans have a great advantage: To renew our country, we only need to remember our values.

This is part of the reason we meet here today. How do we begin to encourage a new, 21st century American consensus on behalf of democratic freedom and free markets? That's the question I posed to scholars at the Bush Institute. That is what Pete Wehner and Tom Melia, who are with us today, have answered with ""The Spirit of Liberty: At Home, In The World,"" a Call to Action paper.

The recommendations come in broad categories. Here they are: First, America must harden its own defenses. Our country must show resolve and resilience in the face of external attacks on our democracy. And that begins with confronting a new era of cyber threats.

America is experiencing the sustained attempt by a hostile power to feed and exploit our country's divisions. According to our intelligence services, the Russian government has made a project of turning Americans against each other. This effort is broad, systematic and stealthy, it's conducted across a range of social media platforms. Ultimately, this assault won't succeed. But foreign aggressions — including cyber-attacks, disinformation and financial influence — should not be downplayed or tolerated. This is a clear case where the strength of our democracy begins at home. We must secure our electoral infrastructure and protect our electoral system from subversion.

The second category of recommendations concerns the projection of American leadership — maintaining America's role in sustaining and defending an international order rooted in freedom and free markets.

Our security and prosperity are only found in wise, sustained, global engagement: In the cultivation of new markets for American goods. In the confrontation of security challenges before they fully materialize and arrive on our shores. In the fostering of global health and development as alternatives to suffering and resentment. In the attraction of talent, energy and enterprise from all over the world. In serving as a shining hope for refugees and a voice for dissidents, human rights defenders, and the oppressed.

We should not be blind to the economic and social dislocations caused by globalization. People are hurting. They are angry. And, they are frustrated. We must hear them and help them. But we can't wish globalization away, any more than we could wish away the agricultural revolution or the industrial revolution. One strength of free societies is their ability to adapt to economic and social disruptions.

And that should be our goal: to prepare American workers for new opportunities, to care in practical, empowering ways for those who may feel left behind. The first step should be to enact policies that encourage robust economic growth by unlocking the potential of the private sector, and for unleashing the creativity and compassion of this country.

A third focus of this document is strengthening democratic citizenship. And here we must put particular emphasis on the values and views of the young.

Our identity as a nation — unlike many other nations — is not determined by geography or ethnicity, by soil or blood. Being an American involves the embrace of high ideals and civic responsibility. We become the heirs of Thomas Jefferson by accepting the ideal of human dignity found in the Declaration of Independence. We become the heirs of James Madison by understanding the genius and values of the U.S. Constitution. We become the heirs of Martin Luther King, Jr., by recognizing one another not by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.

This means that people of every race, religion, and ethnicity can be fully and equally American. It means that bigotry or white supremacy in any form is blasphemy against the American creed.

And it means that the very identity of our nation depends on the passing of civic ideals to the next generation.

We need a renewed emphasis on civic learning in schools. And our young people need positive role models. Bullying and prejudice in our public life sets a national tone, provides permission for cruelty and bigotry, and compromises the moral education of children. The only way to pass along civic values is to first live up to them.

Finally, the Call to Action calls on the major institutions of our democracy, public and private, to consciously and urgently attend to the problem of declining trust.

For example, our democracy needs a media that is transparent, accurate and fair. Our democracy needs religious institutions that demonstrate integrity and champion civil discourse. Our democracy needs institutions of higher learning that are examples of truth and free expression.

In short, it is time for American institutions to step up and provide cultural and moral leadership for this nation.

Ten years ago, I attended a Conference on Democracy and Security in Prague. The goal was to put human rights and human freedom at the center of our relationships with repressive governments. The Prague Charter, signed by champions of liberty Vaclav Havel, Natan Sharansky, Jose Maria Aznar, called for the isolation and ostracism of regimes that suppress peaceful opponents by threats or violence.

Little did we know that, a decade later, a crisis of confidence would be developing within the core democracies, making the message of freedom more inhibited and wavering. Little did we know that repressive governments would be undertaking a major effort to encourage division in western societies and to undermine the legitimacy of elections.

Repressive rivals, along with skeptics here at home, misunderstand something important. It is the great advantage of free societies that we creatively adapt to challenges, without the direction of some central authority. Self-correction is the secret strength of freedom. We are a nation with a history of resilience and a genius for renewal.

Right now, one of our worst national problems is a deficit of confidence. But the cause of freedom justifies all our faith and effort. It still inspires men and women in the darkest corners of the world, and it will inspire a rising generation. The American spirit does not say, ""We shall manage,"" or ""We shall make the best of it."" It says, ""We shall overcome."" And that is exactly what we will do, with the help of God and one another.

115,Bush,George W.,outsidethebeltway,"Without Mentioning Trump, George W. Bush Rebukes Trumpism

Without mentioning his successor by name, former President Bush delivered a stinging rebuke to Trump and Trumpism.

Doug Mataconis · · 19 comments

Former President George W. Bush was mostly silent during the eight years of the Obama Presidency, but this afternoon in a speech in New York City he stood up and clearly rebuked the politics of Donald Trump:

Former President George W. Bush never mentioned his name but delivered what sounded like a sustained rebuke to President Trump on Thursday, decrying nationalism, protectionism and the coarsening of public debate while calling for a robust response to Russian interference in American democracy. In a speech in New York, Mr. Bush defended free trade, globalization and immigration even as Mr. Trump seeks to raise barriers to international commerce and newcomers from overseas. He condemned the “casual cruelty” he sees in public discourse and denounced white supremacy two months after Mr. Trump suggested that ”both sides” were to blame at a neo-Nazi rally that turned violent in Virginia. “We’ve seen nationalism distorted into nativism, forgotten the dynamism that immigration has always brought to America,” Mr. Bush said. “We see a fading confidence in the value of free markets and international trade, forgetting that conflict, instability and poverty follow in the wake of protectionism. We’ve seen the return of isolationist sentiments, forgetting that American security is directly threatened by the chaos and despair of distant places.” The former president said these afflictions have created a crisis of confidence in the United States that has endangered its historic ideals. “In all these ways, we need to recall and recover our own identity,” he said. “Americans have great advantage. To renew our country we only need to remember our values.” Mr. Bush addressed these issues at a bipartisan conference that his presidential center sponsored in New York to promote democracy and freedom. Since leaving office in January 2009, he has largely sought to avoid engaging in current-day political struggles, even as he promotes issues he has long cared about like the spread of democracy around the world. His speech on Thursday seemed a clear rejoinder to Mr. Trump in various ways. Asked by a reporter as he left the hall whether his message would be heard in the White House, Mr. Bush smiled, nodded slightly and said, “I think it will.” The Bush family has never been fond of Mr. Trump, who beat former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida for the Republican presidential nomination last year. Neither the former president nor his father, former President George Bush, voted for Mr. Trump last November. But advisers said the younger Mr. Bush has been deeply troubled by the state of the national debate under a president who routinely demonizes his adversaries on Twitter. “Bullying and prejudice in our public life sets a national tone, provides permission for cruelty and bigotry and compromises the moral education of children,” Mr. Bush said in his speech. “The only way to pass along civic values is to first live up to them.” Mr. Bush, who issued a statement with his father condemning white supremacists after the violence in Charlottesville, Va., in August, returned to the theme. “Bigotry or white supremacy in any form is blasphemy against the American creed,” he said.

Bush also made apparent note of the issues regarding apparent Russian attempts to interfere in the 2016 election:

”America has experienced a sustained attempt by a hostile power to feed and exploit our country’s divisions,” he said. “According to our intelligence services, the Russian government has made a project of turning Americans against each other.” He added: “We must secure our electoral infrastructure and protect our election system from subversion.” The former president acknowledged the forces of discontent that have given rise to Mr. Trump. “We should not be blind to the economic and social dislocations caused by globalization,” he said. “People are hurting. They’re angry and they’re frustrated. We must hear and help them. But we cannot wish globalization away any more than we could wish away the agricultural revolution or the industrial revolution.”

In some respects, Bush’s speech was reminiscent of the takedown that Mitt Romney delivered to Trump during the Presidential campaign, although the main difference between the two is that Bush did not mention Trump by name. Nonetheless, from the context of the speech it was quite clear who and what Bush was talking about in his attacks on leadership and bigotry. And that’s certainly the way that the media is interpreting the speech and the way that it is being received by the public at large. In that regard, Bush should be applauded for choosing to speak out even in these more guarded words than we might expect from a hardcore Trump critic, especially given the fact that it’s unusual for a former President to speak negatively about a successor except under extraordinary circumstances. It also provides a marked contrast and demonstrates that, for all of his political faults, Bush was a far more decent person that Trump can ever hope to be, something also demonstrated by his interaction with the troops that were injured under his command and the family members of the fallen. As I’ve said elsewhere, I have many problems with George W. Bush and the decisions that he made, just as I did with his father, President Clinton, and President Obama, but I’ve always believed that he was a fundamentally decent and kind person. That fact could not be more apparent now that we have a narcissist apparently incapable of feeling empathy for his fellow human beings sitting in the Oval Office.

Not everyone is cheering Bush on, though.

Over at Slate, Ben Mathis-Lilly criticizes the former President for, well, I guess for not going far enough:

For this speech be a “takedown,” though, someone would have to get taken down, and oblique remarks about being tolerant and elevating the discourse—given more than a year after Bush stayed quiet while his party nominated a candidate who openly cultivated the support of white supremacists and belittled his brother Jeb in personal terms on a daily basis—are not going to move the needle. To be cynical, and to put it in orotund, indirect terms like George W. Bush might, you could even suggest that, for many powerful figures in Republican politics and the business community, rejecting alt-right white supremacism is more of a matter of maintaining one’s personal reputation in polite society than it is an actual political goal. Actual opposition takes time, money, and effort; saving face only requires a microphone, a few clichés about American values, and a cable news camera.

On some level, I suppose Mathis-Lilly has a point here, but I don’t think it amounts to nearly as much as he apparently thinks it does. Yes, it’s more than appropriate for Republican politicians and others on the right to speak out against Trump and the naked appeals to bigotry, white supremacists, and xenophobia that encompasses both his campaign for the White House and his Presidency today. George W. Bush isn’t the person to fight that battle, though. He’s a retired politician who hasn’t spoken about national politics much since leaving office more than eight years ago now. While his words will have at least some resonance, they aren’t going to become the rallying cry for an internal Republican revolt against Trump and what he represents, assuming that such a rebuke ever comes. If that role is to be played, it’s going to be others, such as Senators Jeff Flake or Ben Sasse, Governor John Kasich, or other Republican and conservative thought leaders who are going to have to lead it. What one can hope is that Bush’s words will resonate within that portion of the Republican Party that remains sane and that they will spur others to speak out against Trump more forcefully and to stand up against him, against Steve Bannon, and against the forces that seek to turn the entire party in a direction that can only mean bad news for not just the GOP, but for the nation as a whole. For my part, at least, I welcome Bush’s remarks and hope others are willing to join him.

Why didn’t I know about this?

—George W. Bush

Jim Young/Reuters Vice President Dick Cheney and Press Secretary Scott McClellan in the Oval Office,

March 2006

Almost exactly a decade ago, Vice President Dick Cheney greeted President George W. Bush one morning in the Oval Office with the news that his administration was about to implode. Or not quite: Cheney let the president know that something was deeply wrong, though it would take Bush two more days of increasingly surprising revelations, and the near mass resignation of his senior Justice Department and law enforcement officials, to figure out exactly what it was. “On the morning of March 10, 2004,” as the former president recounts the story in his memoirs,

Dick Cheney and Andy Card greeted me with a startling announcement: The Terrorist Surveillance Program would expire at the end of the day.

“How can it possibly end?” I asked. “It’s vital to protecting the country.”

The Terrorist Surveillance Program, then known to the handful who were aware of it only as “the Program” or by its code name, “Stellar Wind,” was a highly secret National Security Agency effort—eventually revealed by The New York Times in December 2005 and then in much greater detail by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden last June. Among other things, Stellar Wind empowered the agency to assemble a vast collection of “metadata,” including on the telephone calls and e-mails of millions of Americans, that its analysts could search and “mine” for information.

Though the program would appear on its face to violate the Fourth Amendment and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, President Bush had approved it three weeks after the September 11 attacks, securing the signature of Attorney General John Ashcroft after the fact. To remain in force the program had to be recertified by the president and the attorney general every forty-five days.

And now, two and a half years later, Cheney and White House chief of staff Andrew Card told Bush, Justice Department lawyers “had raised a legal objection to one component of the program.” Unless that “component”—apparently, the sweeping up of Internet metadata—was eliminated or modified, they told the president, the lawyers would refuse to certify that the program was legal.

“Why didn’t I know about this?” I asked. Andy shared my disbelief. He told me he had just learned about the objection the previous night.

What did the third member of the triumvirate, Vice President Cheney—who had known about the conflict for weeks—say at this moment? Did he profess to share the disbelief of the president and his chief of staff? Or did he, as so often, say nothing at all? President Bush does not say but as we read his account—a remarkable two-and-a-half-page aria on what the president knew, what he didn’t, and, even as the crisis that threatened his administration was breaking all around him, what he still doesn’t—the president’s painfully protracted series of discoveries makes sense only if we assume Dick Cheney’s persistent and stubborn silence.

Bush knows he has a crisis on his hands—confronting him with a “decision point,” as the title of his memoirs has it. By his account, before flying off to deliver a speech in Cleveland, the president orders Card and his White House counsel Alberto Gonzales “to work with” the attorney general “to solve the problem.” On his return, however, he finds that “little progress had been made.”

“Where the hell is Ashcroft?” I asked.

“He’s in the hospital,” Andy replied.

That was news to me.

The second revelation: John Ashcroft has been in intensive care for nearly a week. Though Ashcroft is the chief law enforcement officer of the United States—and though it is the attorney general’s signature that is required to recertify Stellar Wind—no one seems to have thought it relevant to tell the commander in chief. No matter; Bush telephones intensive care, insists on speaking to the heavily sedated Ashcroft, and tells him he is sending over his chief of staff and White House counsel “to talk to him about an urgent matter.” What follows is the famous Hospital Room Showdown, the great melodramatic set piece of the Bush administration, which features, as Barton Gellman describes it in the superb Angler: The Cheney Vice Presidency, “men in their forties and fifties, stamping on the brakes, abandoning double-parked vehicles, and running up a hospital stairwell as fast as their legs could pump.”

The White House men were clutching the paper they were determined to persuade the attorney general to sign, and the Justice Department lawyers, led by James Comey, Ashcroft’s deputy, were determined to prevent him from signing it. They converged in a hospital room around the IV -festooned body of the ailing attorney general, who “looked half dead.” Nonetheless, Gellman tells us, in the midst of this coven of lawyers, like some unvanquishable horror movie character, Ashcroft “raised himself up stiffly” off the bed.

He glared at his visitors and said they had no business coming. He gave a lucid account of the reasons that Justice had decided to withhold support. And then he went beyond that. Ashcroft said he never should have certified the program.

…If it were up to him now, he would refuse to approve. But it was not up to him. Gesturing at his deputy, Ashcroft said, “There is the attorney general.” Spent and pale, Ashcroft sank back down.

In the face of this defiance, the White House chief of staff and counsel ignore Comey and stride from the room and then race back to the White House where, Bush informs us rather laconically, “they told me Ashcroft hadn’t signed.” Why not? Apparently they didn’t say and the president doesn’t ask. Instead, he decides to overrule the objections of the Department of Justice and sign “an order keeping the TSP alive based on my authority as head of the executive branch.”

It is, as will soon become clear, a momentous decision, though there is no sign he realizes quite how momentous. Still, the president isn’t happy. “I went to bed irritated,” Bush tells us, “and had a feeling I didn’t know the full story.”

The following morning, when Bush arrives at the Oval Office, his chief of staff confirms these suspicions. “Mr. President,” Card tells him, “we’ve got a major problem.”

“Jim Comey is the acting attorney general, and he’s going to resign…. So are a bunch of other Justice Department officials.”

I was stunned. Nobody had told me that Comey, John Ashcroft’s deputy, had taken over Ashcroft’s responsibilities when he went in for surgery.

Revelation Three: it is Comey who is now in charge at Justice. After that morning’s FBI briefing, where Comey is sitting in for Ashcroft, the president takes the deputy attorney general aside:

I started by explaining that I had an obligation to do what was necessary to protect the country…. He explained his concerns about the problematic aspect of the program. “I just don’t understand why you are raising this at the last minute,” I said.

He looked shocked. “Mr. President,” he said, “your staff has known about this for weeks.”

Revelation Four: what Bush had believed, had been led to believe, was a last-minute disagreement was in fact a policy conflict that had been raging for weeks between the White House and the Department of Justice. And that is not all:

Then [Comey] dropped another bomb. He wasn’t the only one planning to resign. So was FBI Director Bob Mueller. I was about to witness the largest mass resignation in modern presidential history, and we were in the middle of a war.

“Witness” is, alas, the appropriate word. Bush has finally reached the innermost Russian doll: a score or more of top lawyers in the Justice Department, including the deputy attorney general and possibly the attorney general himself, and the director of the FBI , and perhaps other attorneys at the CIA and elsewhere in the national security bureaucracy, are about to resign en masse over a secret, highly intrusive, warrantless surveillance program less than eight months before Bush will have to face the voters. And it is all going to happen today—and Bush has up until this moment known nothing about it. It will be an enormous scandal with George W. Bush playing hapless witness to his own destruction.

2.

I basically would have let them resign….

—Dick Cheney

Bush, the self-described “decider,” author of Decision Points, knows, he tells us, he has “to make a big decision, and fast.” He can agree to modify Stellar Wind as Comey and Ashcroft demand and thus avert their resignations, and allow it to continue; but this would mean reversing his decision of the day before, something Bush simply does not do. Or, as “some in the White House believed,” he could “stand on my powers under Article II of the Constitution and suffer the walkout.”

Who are these “some in the White House” who go so conspicuously unnamed in Bush’s account? “I had little patience with what I saw happening,” Dick Cheney tells us his memoirs, In My Time. “The program had been in place more than two years and the attorney general had approved it some twenty times.” Speaking to R.J. Cutler for his film The World According to Dick Cheney, the former vice-president is rather more explicit:

I basically would have let them resign because I thought the program was perfectly legitimate, it was totally necessary, and it had been totally approved and signed up to twenty separate occasions by the Attorney General of the United States….

On its face this argument seems sophistical: Ashcroft, as he suggested from his hospital bed, had been able to do little if any legal research or consultation before he first certified the program, and in any event the requirement that it be recertified every forty-five days was meant to allow for reevaluation of it and the emergency conditions that supposedly required it. Cheney’s refusal to accept the lawyers’ refusal was in effect an admission that he believed the president hadn’t needed the lawyers to begin with; their approval of the program was so much decoration draped over the bedrock of the president’s “Article II powers.”

Cheney believed in a “unitary executive,” believed quite literally that “the executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America.” He believed that the various post-Watergate hearings of the mid-1970s, the Church and Pike committees and others—he had watched their progress as the thirty-four-year-old chief of staff in President Gerald Ford’s White House—and the laws that had followed their exposé—had “neutered” the intelligence agencies, had “put the gloves on,” and that a vital part of the Bush administration’s post–September 11 mission, his mission, was to take those gloves off.

One of those “gloves” was the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978—the law Comey and now Ashcroft believed that Stellar Wind’s sweeping warrantless metadata collections violated. The president had approved Stellar Wind on October 4, 2001, a few weeks after the September 11 attack, and given the temper in Washington and in the country at that time he likely could simply and easily have amended the law. “We could have gone to Congress, hat in hand, the judicial branch and the executive together,” Royce Lamberth, then the chief FISA court judge, tells Gellman, “and gotten any statutory change we wanted…. But they wanted to demonstrate that the president’s power was supreme, and the judiciary was just a tagalong when necessary, but not appreciated.” They didn’t want to change the law, that is; they wanted to circumvent it, and so demonstrate that, in the face of the president’s wartime powers, the law didn’t matter.

Cheney and his allies—most prominently the vice-president’s formidable counsel, David Addington—seem to have had a similar attitude toward the Department of Justice. The lawyers worked for the president; if they forgot that, let them go ahead and resign. Yet in the end the Stellar Wind confrontation—with whose consequences, in the form of the Snowden revelations, among other things, we are still living—serves as a kind of reductio ad absurdum of this particular position. Bush himself summarizes it rather eloquently: “I was willing to defend the powers of the presidency under Article II,” he writes in Decision Points, “But not at any cost.”

I thought about the Saturday Night Massacre in October 1973, when President Richard Nixon’s firing of Watergate prosecutor Archibald Cox led his attorney general and deputy attorney general to resign. That was not a historical crisis I was eager to replicate. It wouldn’t give me much satisfaction to know I was right on the legal principles while my administration imploded and our key programs in the war on terror were exposed in the media firestorm that would inevitably follow.

This is the mundane, pragmatic truth. Such a mass resignation would certainly have led immediately to high-profile hearings on Capitol Hill, though the intense press coverage probably would have exposed Stellar Wind before they could be convened—exposed it and likely severely curtailed or ended it, given the circumstances: senior Justice Department lawyers, who resigned rather than violate the law, criticizing advocates of a secret program that snooped on Americans’ telephone calls and e-mails without a warrant.

Cheney, no less able a politician than Bush, could certainly see this. And yet, at the end of the day, standing on principle—making the “tough decision” and taking the political hit for it—was more important to him than the survival of the program itself. Principle trumped pragmatism, even when “these programs and keeping them secret,” as he tells us in his memoirs, “are critical for the defense of the nation.” Gellman claims that this makes Cheney “the nearest thing there was to an antipolitician in elected office.”

The statement is provocative, the word alluring; but if he means by “antipolitician” that Cheney was “above politics,” as he seems to (“A vice president…could afford to be. Bush could not”), then the term seems hardly adequate. In this vital instance Cheney would choose purity and toughness even though such a course would have led to the exposure and destruction of the program itself. Perhaps the word “ideologue”—“an adherent of an ideology, especially one who is uncompromising or dogmatic”—better captures the cold sterility of such a choice, where dead “principle” is deemed more important than a living, supposedly vital program. But if Cheney is better described as an ideologue, what precisely was his ideology?

3.

It is a truism and a quite inadequate one to say that Richard Bruce Cheney was the most powerful vice-president in American history. It was Cheney’s singular genius to take an oddly archaic constitutional office that had at best been regarded as a useful if perilous stepping stone to a presidential run and at worst as “not worth a bucket of warm piss” (in the imperishable words of James Nance Garner), and to reshape it, by force of will, quiet audacity, and a peculiar institutional brilliance, into the most powerful position in the American government. In doing this he doubly benefited from that vital attribute of the successful politician: luck.

Cheney was lucky to be vice-president during the attacks of September 11, a national security crisis that drew on precisely the encyclopedic knowledge and bureaucratic skills he had cultivated in a quarter-century spent at the heights of power in Washington, from White House chief of staff in the 1970s to leading member of the House Intelligence Committee in the 1980s to wartime secretary of defense in the 1990s. And he was particularly lucky in serving an untested president who, while intelligent and strong-willed, found himself at the apex of a government suddenly under attack, a government that he knew he lacked the experience and knowledge and confidence to effectively lead.

While the caricature of George W. Bush as his vice-president’s puppet is plainly false—“The alpha male in the White House was the president,” as former Joint Chiefs Chairman General Richard Myers put it—after September 11 Bush clearly needed Cheney, and he knew it. He needed Cheney’s knowledge of foreign and security policy, particularly his familiarity with “the dark side” where Cheney proclaimed, less than a week after the attacks, a major part of the war on terror would be fought, and even more he needed Cheney’s deep knowledge of the government and his unique ability to push forward effectively what was a truly radical transformation. These changes could not have been imposed without experience, dedication, and ruthlessness. For as Gellman remarks, while the death and destruction of September 11 were horrible, “decisions made in the White House, in response, had incomparably greater impact on American interests and society.”

It is an astute point, all the more so for seeming obvious: the unique policies put into effect by Bush and Cheney were not consequences of the September 11 attacks but calculated responses to them. There was nothing fated about Stellar Wind, or “black sites” and the “enhanced interrogation techniques” that were practiced in them, or Guantánamo and military commissions; these and the other distinctive post–September 11 policies that still cast their shadows over us were born of choices made by government officials and, in the event, by a vanishingly small number of them. Cheney, Gellman writes, “freed Bush to fight the ‘war on terror’ as he saw fit, driven by a shared belief that the government had to shake off old habits of self-restraint.” As noted, some of these “habits” Cheney, as President Ford’s chief of staff, had seen inscribed in law during the post-Vietnam revolution of the 1970s, when government misdeeds, not only those by the White House but by the FBI , CIA , and NSA , were exposed, and Congress acted to restrain those institutions, and the president’s power to make use of them, with new legislation. September 11 offered the opportunity for a counterrevolution, which Gellman neatly summarizes:

With Bush’s consent, Cheney unleashed foreign intelligence agencies to spy at home. He gave them legal cover to conduct what he called “robust interrogation” of captured enemies, using calculated cruelty to break their will. At Cheney’s initiative, the United States stripped terror suspects of long-established rights under domestic and international law, building a new legal edifice under exclusive White House ownership. Everything from capture and confinement to questioning, trial, and punishment would proceed by rules invented on the fly.

The depth of this transformation is truly breathtaking and its surface signs are still visible all around us, if we take the trouble to look: in the detainees still languishing at Guantánamo, in the unpiloted drones tracking and killing thousands of people, and indeed in the sweeping up of our telephone and Internet metadata by the four programs that have been the successors of Stellar Wind. These revolutionary changes in our government’s policies toward holding prisoners, toward waging war, and toward surveilling its citizens could never have been effected without the imagination, experience, and audacity of Dick Cheney.

The “interagency process” embodied in the National Security Council system, whereby policies are carefully developed and evaluated across the bureaucracy, rising stepwise through the assistant secretary, deputy secretary, and finally principle levels, is inherently conservative, making substantive systemic changes slow and cumbersome. As Gellman shows in detail, Cheney made use of secrecy and a cadre of dedicated and ruthless allies that he, as chief of Bush’s transition—unprecedented for a vice-president elect—had seeded at strategic points throughout the government. This enabled Bush to circumvent that process and instead make policy in tiny, highly secret groups. And it was Cheney who urged Bush to impose those policies unilaterally, relying on his own asserted authority as commander in chief—even policies like Stellar Wind that appeared to violate express provisions of the law.

4.

In the end, perhaps inevitably, Bush would disappoint Cheney, bowing, in the steely unforgiving view of the older man, to the shoddy demands of politics and the fear of “negative press stories.” As Cheney describes the end of the Stellar Wind confrontation in his memoirs, one can almost hear the condescending disappointment in the former vice-president’s voice:

Faced with threats of resignation, the president decided to alter the NSA program, even though he and his advisors were confident of his constitutional authority to continue the program unchanged.

Talking to Cutler for his film, Cheney is more explicit and in his typically precise phrases lets peep through more than a hint of a sneer:

If you’re a man of principle, compromise is a bit of a dirty word. The President made the decision that he wanted to avoid major controversy. It was his call so that’s what we did.

It is clear who is the man of principle and who is not. There is a hint here of the complicated emotional strains of mutual dependency inherent in this relationship. Cheney needed Bush, of course, for without him his high title would have been what it had been for so many of his predecessors: empty words. Bush alone had the power to give Cheney power—and because Cheney’s power came from him personally the president could expect loyalty and discretion in return. But in Cheney’s recollections of Bush one also senses resentment and a kind of moral trumping that is none too subtle. “If you’re a man of principle, compromise is a bit of a dirty word.”

We see a more obvious sign of the instability built into this mutual dependency in Bush’s own account of the Stellar Wind crisis, where Cheney, strikingly, is hardly mentioned. Behind the scenes the vice-president is very much the lead actor in the drama—the conflict is inconceivable without the central part he played in pushing forward Stellar Wind, in maintaining that it could be recertified without Department of Justice approval, and in insisting that the resulting high-profile resignations could be survived. But the reader is left to puzzle out who exactly Bush is referring to when he writes that “some in the White House” wanted him to let Comey, Muller, and their colleagues, and perhaps Ashcroft himself, resign. Even writing his memoirs years after leaving office Bush is loath to identify Cheney as the antagonist who almost scuttled his presidency—though had he done so, his account, which portrays an incurious president very much out of touch, might have been less embarrassing to him personally.

“I made clear to my advisers that I never wanted to be blindsided like that again,” he writes in Decision Points. In the film Gellman tells Cutler that with that confrontation the high water mark of Cheney’s power had passed, that Bush understood that the incident had been “a mortal threat to his presidency. He understood…that Cheney had walked him right to the edge of a cliff and it changed their relationship forever.” Perhaps; but is it resentment, embarrassment, or even lingering gratitude, or a mixture of the three, that leaves Bush unable to mention Cheney by name?

The final irony is that Stellar Wind survived because Bush, when faced with a political crisis that would have exposed it, was willing to compromise, while Cheney, “the antipolitician,” preferred to hold to principles that would have meant watching Stellar Wind collapse into controversy. If there had been a mass resignation, there can be no doubt that the principled objections of the high Justice Department officials would have been widely heard. It is quite possible that had Bush followed the chosen course of “the man of principle”—and had the Justice Department officials resigned while their objections were leaked to the public—the metadata collection would have ended in the spring of 2004, and eight months later, very possibly, the presidency of George W. Bush.

Instead, Stellar Wind lived on, first without the Internet metadata collection that Ashcroft, Comey, and other Justice Department lawyers had refused to approve, and then, three months later, in its original form but according to a different legal theory under the authority of the FISA court. Meanwhile a lawyer farther down the hierarchy in the Justice Department who found himself deeply troubled by the program, and who was warned, after raising his concerns with a superior, “not to go there,” put in a call to Eric Lichtblau and James Risen of The New York Times. After the Times, under heavy administration pressure, held their story for a year, the paper finally revealed Stellar Wind to Americans in December 2005.

The story brought shock and controversy but in the event there were no high Justice Department officials who had resigned their posts rather than approve warrantless surveillance; there was just the Times and its unnamed sources. The controversy cooled, the collection of metadata went on under Stellar Wind’s successor programs, only to be revealed again, thanks to Edward Snowden, by Glenn Greenwald of The Guardian and Gellman himself in The Washington Post in June 2013.

It goes on still. This is the way of the post–September 11 world, where whistleblowers and news organizations reveal what would have once been considered illegal and then, years later, find themselves “revealing” it yet again, and then again. So it has been with torture and extrajudicial killing and warrantless wiretapping. We might call these frozen scandals, which begin in revelation and white-hot controversy and end with our learning to live with secret wrongdoing that is in fact no secret at all. This is our new normal—and a vital attribute of the world Dick Cheney bequeathed us.

118,Bush,George W.,dallasnews,"Editor's note: The following is an excerpt of George H.W. Bush's speech before a joint session of Congress on Sept. 11, 1990, in which he describes his vision of a new world order amid the Persian Gulf crisis. Read the full speech here.

We stand today at a unique and extraordinary moment. The crisis in the Persian Gulf, as grave as it is, also offers a rare opportunity to move toward an historic period of cooperation. Out of these troubled times, our fifth objective — a new world order — can emerge: a new era — freer from the threat of terror, stronger in the pursuit of justice, and more secure in the quest for peace. An era in which the nations of the world, East and West, North and South, can prosper and live in harmony.

A hundred generations have searched for this elusive path to peace, while a thousand wars raged across the span of human endeavor. Today that new world is struggling to be born, a world quite different from the one we've known. A world where the rule of law supplants the rule of the jungle. A world in which nations recognize the shared responsibility for freedom and justice. A world where the strong respect the rights of the weak. This is the vision that I shared with President Gorbachev in Helsinki. He and other leaders from Europe, the Gulf, and around the world understand that how we manage this crisis today could shape the future for generations to come.

The test we face is great, and so are the stakes. This is the first assault on the new world that we seek, the first test of our mettle. Had we not responded to this first provocation with clarity of purpose, if we do not continue to demonstrate our determination, it would be a signal to actual and potential despots around the world. America and the world must defend common vital interests — and we will. America and the world must support the rule of law — and we will. America and the world must stand up to aggression — and we will. And one thing more: In the pursuit of these goals, America will not be intimidated.

Vital issues of principle are at stake. Saddam Hussein is literally trying to wipe a country off the face of the Earth. We do not exaggerate. Nor do we exaggerate when we say Saddam Hussein will fail. Vital economic interests are at risk as well. Iraq itself controls some 10 percent of the world's proven oil reserves. Iraq plus Kuwait controls twice that. An Iraq permitted to swallow Kuwait would have the economic and military power, as well as the arrogance, to intimidate and coerce its neighbors — neighbors who control the lion's share of the world's remaining oil reserves. We cannot permit a resource so vital to be dominated by one so ruthless. And we won't.

Recent events have surely proven that there is no substitute for American leadership. In the face of tyranny, let no one doubt American credibility and reliability. Let no one doubt our staying power. We will stand by our friends. One way or another, the leader of Iraq must learn this fundamental truth. From the outset, acting hand in hand with others, we've sought to fashion the broadest possible international response to Iraq's aggression. The level of world cooperation and condemnation of Iraq is unprecedented. Armed forces from countries spanning four continents are there at the request of King Fahd of Saudi Arabia to deter and, if need be, to defend against attack. Moslems and non-Moslems, Arabs and non-Arabs, soldiers from many nations stand shoulder to shoulder, resolute against Saddam Hussein's ambitions. ...

I cannot predict just how long it will take to convince Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait. Sanctions will take time to have their full intended effect. We will continue to review all options with our allies, but let it be clear: We will not let this aggression stand.

119,Bush,George W.,fair,"On September 8, 1988, Washington Jewish Week (with a circulation of 20,000) disclosed that Vice President George Bush had appointed an ethnic coalition for his campaign that included a number of outspoken antisemites with Nazi and fascist affiliations. The article prompted the resignation of six leaders of the GOP’s ethnic outreach division. Although the resignations were widely reported, few major media investigated the actual charges or explored their implications.

The New York Times, in particular, downplayed the significance of the Nazi/GOP connection, burying the news that six Republican ethnic leaders had quit the campaign on page 24 of the D Section (9/13/88) under the headline “A Decisive Baker Puts His Mark on Bush Race.” The article by Gerald M. Boyd treated the resignation of the discredited ethnic officials less as a scandal than as evidence of Jim Baker’s “authority” in running the Bush campaign.

Unlike most media, the Philadelphia Inquirer featured a series of investigative pieces which documented the Nazi link. A front-page lead story (9/10/88) detailed the sordid past of men like Florian Galdau, the national chairman of Rumanians for Bush, who defended convicted war criminal Valerian Trifa; Radi Slavoff, co-chairman of Bulgarians for Bush, who arranged a 1983 event in Washington that honored Austin App, author of several texts denying the existence of the Holocaust; Phillip Guarino, chairman of the Italian-American National Republican Federation, who belonged to a neofascist masonic lodge implicated in terrorist attacks in Italy and Latin America; Bohdan Fedorak, vice chairman of Ukrainians for Bush, who was also a leader of a Nazi collaborationist organization involved in anti-Polish and anti-Jewish wartime pogroms; and Croatian fascist Jerome Brentar, co-chairman of the GOP ethnic coalition, who acknowledged that as an International Refugee Organization officer he helped hundreds of Nazis emigrate to the US after World War II. Brentar was the principal financial backer for the defense of convicted war criminal John Demjanjuk.

A spokesperson for Vice President Bush dismissed the charges against the six ethnic leaders as “politically inspired garbage,” claiming that the GOP looked into the allegations and “was unable to substantiate them” (Philadelphia Inquirer, 9/13/88). Most media printed this denial unchallenged.

A follow-up story in the Inquirer (9/18/88) summarized the findings of a recent report by Russ Bellant, titled Old Nazis, the New Right and the Reagan Administration: The Role of Domestic Fascist Networks in the Republican Party and Their Effect on US Cold War Politics. Published by the Cambridge-based Political Research Associates, the report shows how the Bush campaign’s ethnic outreach program is rooted in a pro-Nazi emigré network dating back to the late 1940s. The GOP’s ethnic leaders were among thousands of extremists from Eastern Europe who were welcomed by the US government during the Cold War because of their vociferous anti-communism.

Boosted by CIA subsidies, these “captive nations” exiles succeeded in creating a genuine power base on the far right of the American political landscape. According to Bellant, some are still active in the Bush campaign. But this doesn’t seem to bother the US media, which are more interested in Bush’s repeated invocation of the Pledge of Allegiance as a campaign issue than in those GOP leaders who pledge their allegiance to other flags.",1,http://fair.org/extra/the-gop-nazi-connection/

Though their successful careers are in vastly different genres, both Bono and George W. Bush share a passion for saving lives in Africa.

The lead singer of U2, 57, visited the former president’s Prairie Chapel Ranch in Crawford, Texas on Friday, ahead of the band’s sold-out Joshua Tree Tour concert at AT&T Stadium.

“More than 11 million people are alive today thanks to this man’s creation of PEPFAR, the U.S. AIDS program that has been saving lives and preventing new HIV infections for over 10 years, with strong support from political leaders right, left, and center,” the musician captioned a photo of the activists on Instagram. “That progress is all at risk now with President Trump’s budget cuts, which will mean needless infections and lives lost.”

Since leaving office in 2008, the former commander-in-chief and his Bush Center have worked to address the HIV/AIDS pandemic that threatened to wipe out an entire generation on the continent of Africa through PEPFAR, the AIDS relief program which was created in 2003.

“Bono is the real deal. He has a huge heart and a selfless soul, not to mention a decent voice. @laurawbush and I are grateful he came to the ranch to talk about the work of @thebushcenter, @onecampaign, @PEPFAR, and our shared commitment to saving lives in Africa,” Bush captioned the same photo.

In April, Bush wrote a Washington Post op-ed in which he urged readers to keep PEPFAR fully funded because approximately “12 million lives have been saved.”

“Nearly 15 years later, the program has achieved remarkable results in the fight against disease,” he wrote.",1,http://people.com/politics/bono-george-w-bush-commitment-to-fighting-aids/

128,Bush,George W.,twincities,"Last week in Gaborone, Botswana, Laura and I sat in a small room in Tlokweng Main Clinic, a facility that recently started screening and treating women for cervical cancer. Seated with us was Leithailwe Wale, a 40-year-old woman who was diagnosed with the disease. Thanks to early detection and access to treatment, she told us, today she is alive, healthy and able to raise her son.

Good news like Leithailwe’s is becoming increasingly common in five African countries where Pink Ribbon Red Ribbon is operating. Since leaving the White House, Laura and I have been heartbroken to learn that because women with HIV are more likely to have cervical cancer, people who had been saved from AIDS were needlessly dying from another treatable, preventable disease. So at the Bush Institute, we formed this global public-private partnership to fight women’s cancers.

In the past six years, more than 370,000 women have been screened for cervical cancer and 24,000 for breast cancer through Pink Ribbon Red Ribbon. More than 119,000 girls have been vaccinated against the human papillomavirus (HPV), which can lead to cervical and other cancers. Nearly 1,000 health workers have been trained. With the proper resources and international commitment, we could end cervical cancer deaths on the continent in 30 years.

Critical to this effort is our Pink Ribbon Red Ribbon partner, the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). My administration launched PEPFAR in 2003 to address the HIV/AIDS pandemic that threatened to wipe out an entire generation on the continent of Africa. Nearly 15 years later, the program has achieved remarkable results in the fight against disease. Today, because of the commitment of many foreign governments, investments by partners, the resilience of the African people and the generosity of the American people, nearly 12 million lives have been saved. And nearly 2 million babies have been born HIV-free to infected mothers.

In Windhoek, Namibia — where we introduced a partnership with the government, UNAIDS, the Global Fund and Pink Ribbon Red Ribbon — Laura, the first lady of Namibia and I met some of those newborns and their moms. Almost all the mothers had AIDS, but the babies were disease-free. It was so heartwarming to see those hopeful young lives and their proud, relieved mothers — and it was a powerful reminder that we need to not only keep this effort alive, but also do more.

It is clear that the generosity of the American people has had a huge impact — one that reflects the view that all lives are precious, and to whom much is given, much is required. This lifesaving work also has a practical purpose for Americans. Societies mired in disease breed hopelessness and despair, leaving people ripe for recruitment by extremists. When we confront suffering — when we save lives — we breathe hope into devastated populations, strengthen and stabilize society, and make our country and the world safer.

As the executive and legislative branches review the federal budget, they will have vigorous debates about how best to spend taxpayers’ money — and they should. Some will argue that we have enough problems at home and shouldn’t spend money overseas. I argue that we shouldn’t spend money on programs that don’t work, whether at home or abroad. But they should fully fund programs that have proven to be efficient, effective and results-oriented. Saving nearly 12 million lives is proof that PEPFAR works, and I urge our government to fully fund it. We are on the verge of an AIDS-free generation, but the people of Africa still need our help. The American people deserve credit for this tremendous success and should keep going until the job is done.

About the Book

From #1 New York Times bestselling author Thomas E. Ricks, a dual biography of Winston Churchill and George Orwell, whose farsighted vision and inspired action preserved democracy from the threats of authoritarianism, from the left and right alike

Both George Orwell and Winston Churchill came close to death in the mid-1930’s—Orwell shot in the neck in a trench line in the Spanish Civil War, and Churchill struck by a car in New York City. If they’d died then, history would scarcely remember them. At the time, Churchill was a politician on the outs, his loyalty to his class and party suspect. Orwell was a mildly successful novelist, to put it generously. No one would have predicted that by the end of the 20th century they would be considered two of the most important people in British history for having the vision and courage to campaign tirelessly, in words and in deeds, against the totalitarian threat from both the left and the right. In a crucial moment, they responded first by seeking the facts of the matter, seeing through the lies and obfuscations, and then they acted on their beliefs. Together, to an extent not sufficiently appreciated, they kept the West’s compass set toward freedom as its due north.

It’s not easy to recall now how lonely a position both men once occupied. By the late 1930’s, democracy was discredited in many circles, and authoritarian rulers were everywhere in the ascent. There were some who decried the scourge of communism, but saw in Hitler and Mussolini “men we could do business with,” if not in fact saviors. And there were others who saw the Nazi and fascist threat as malign, but tended to view communism as the path to salvation. Churchill and Orwell, on the other hand, had the foresight to see clearly that the issue was human freedom—that whatever its coloration, a government that denied its people basic freedoms was a totalitarian menace and had to be resisted.

In the end, Churchill and Orwell proved their age’s necessary men. The glorious climax of Churchill and Orwell is the work they both did in the decade of the 1940’s to triumph over freedom’s enemies. And though Churchill played the larger role in the defeat of Hitler and the Axis, Orwell’s reckoning with the menace of authoritarian rule in Animal Farm and 1984 would define the stakes of the Cold War for its 50-year course, and continues to give inspiration to fighters for freedom to this day. Taken together, in Thomas E. Ricks’s masterful hands, their lives are a beautiful testament to the power of moral conviction, and to the courage it can take to stay true to it, through thick and thin.",1,http://www.hughhewitt.com/hewitt-book-club/churchill-orwell-fight-freedom/

This lifesaving work also has a practical purpose for Americans. Societies mired in disease breed hopelessness and despair, leaving people ripe for recruitment by extremists. When we confront suffering — when we save lives — we breathe hope into devastated populations, strengthen and stabilize society, and make our country and the world safer.

As the executive and legislative branches review the federal budget, they will have vigorous debates about how best to spend taxpayers’ money — and they should. Some will argue that we have enough problems at home and shouldn’t spend money overseas. I argue that we shouldn’t spend money on programs that don’t work, whether at home or abroad. But they should fully fund programs that have proven to be efficient, effective and results-oriented. Saving nearly 12 million lives is proof that PEPFAR works, and I urge our government to fully fund it. We are on the verge of an AIDS-free generation, but the people of Africa still need our help. The American people deserve credit for this tremendous success and should keep going until the job is done.",1,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/george-w-bush-pepfar-saves-millions-of-lives-in-africa-keep-it-fully-funded/2017/04/07/2089fa46-1ba7-11e7-9887-1a5314b56a08_story.html

136,Bush,George W.,themoderatevoice,"As he sat there fumbling with his pancho at Donald Trump’s presidential inauguration in January, some pundits on TV wondered what was really on former President George W. Bush’s mind as he heard what some say was the darkest toned inaugural address in American history.

Now we know, via New York Magazine:

Bush’s endearing struggle with his poncho at the event quickly became a meme, prompting many Democrats on social media to admit that they already pined for the relative normalcy of his administration. Following Trump’s short and dire speech, Bush departed the scene and never offered public comment on the ceremony. But, according to three people who were present, Bush gave a brief assessment of Trump’s inaugural after leaving the dais: “That was some weird shit.” All three heard him say it.

And it has gotten weirder ever since.

Today’s quote of the day comes from our nation’s 43rd President:

The inauguration of Donald Trump was a surreal experience for pretty much everyone who witnessed it, whether or not they were at the event and regardless of who they supported in the election. On the dais, the stoic presence of Hillary Clinton — whom candidate Trump had said he would send to prison if he took office — underlined the strangeness of the moment. George W. Bush, also savaged by Trump during the campaign, was there too. He gave the same reason for attending that Bill and Hillary Clinton did: to honor the peaceful transfer of power.

About the Book

The past comes back to haunt game warden Joe Pickett and his family with devastating effect in the thrilling new novel from #1 New York Times–bestselling author C. J. Box.

The plane circled in the dark. Joe Pickett could just make out down below a figure in the snow and timber, and then three other figures closing in. There was nothing he could do about it. And Joe knew that he might be their next target.

The Cates family had always been a bad lot. Game warden Joe Pickett had been able to strike a fierce blow against them when the life of his daughter April had been endangered, but he’d always wondered if there’d be a day of reckoning. He’s not wondering any longer. Joe knows they’re coming after him and his family now. He has his friend Nate by his side, but will that be enough this time? All he can do is prepare…and wait for them to make the first move.",1,http://www.hughhewitt.com/hewitt-book-club/vicious-circle-joe-pickett-novel/
140,Bush,George W.,spokesman,"By Philip Kennicott The Washington Post

George W. Bush is getting better as a painter. It has been four years since a Romanian hacker named Marcel Lehel Lazar (aka Guccifer) hacked into Bush family email accounts and exposed to the world the former president’s early paintings, including two self-portraits made in the bathroom. Guccifer is now in jail, but Bush is still at the easel and has released a volume of his recent work, portraits of military personnel and veterans who have served the country since Sept. 11, 2001.

“Portraits of Courage,” currently No. 1 on the Washington Post best-seller list, includes 66 individual portraits and a foldout reproduction of a four-panel mural. Most of the images are made from photographs, focused on the face and thickly painted with a limited but generally bright palette of colors. Highlights and shadows are strongly emphasized, and Bush lavishes particular attention on the eyes and exaggerates bone structure. A few of the paintings capture their subjects in motion – including Staff Sgt. Scott P. Lilley (who lost a part of his skull in a roadside bomb attack) holding his daughter, and Sgt. Saul Martinez (who lost both legs in Iraq) playing golf. But most of them show the head and face full size, seemingly bursting out of the frame with genuine presence and considerable expressive energy.

They are the work of an amateur painter who is focused on his craft. In the introduction, Bush writes: “I’m not sure how the art in this volume will hold up to critical eyes. After all, I’m a novice. What I am sure of is that each painting was done with a lot of care and respect.” He also cites some major 20th-century figures as personal exemplars: Lucian Freud, Wayne Thiebaud, Jamie Wyeth, Ray Turner, Fairfield Porter and Joaqumn Sorolla. In the use of heavy impasto, the reduction of the face to a rough topography of color, and the particular love of sharp and sometime jarring contrasts, the work of Turner is perhaps the closest fit for comparison. But you can see what he has taken from Freud, Thiebaud and (the sadly neglected) Porter as well. The presence of Sorolla (a Spanish artist who died in 1923) suggests that underneath Bush’s modernist expressionism is an as yet unrealized hankering after old-fashioned Impressionist nuance.

Bush’s opening essay and the capsule biographies he writes about each subject are charming. He lightly ribs his mother in this account of his first experience with the paintbrush: “For the first time in my sixty-six years, I picked up a paintbrush that wasn’t meant for drywall. I selected a tube of white paint and another labeled Burnt Umber. While I wasn’t aware at the time that it was a color, I liked the name, which reminded me of Mother’s cooking.”

In his descriptions of the men and women he paints, he cites their struggles with grievous war wounds, post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury and the myriad difficulties of reintegrating into civilian life. Although there is increasing concern in the medical community about whether we are over-diagnosing PTSD and including too many disparate psychological issues under its label, there is genuine empathy in Bush’s embrace of the stories told by these soldiers.

Those who bristled at the former president’s displays of machismo while in office (his infamous landing on an aircraft carrier and premature declaration of victory in Iraq, or his 2003 invitation to Iraqi militants to “bring ’em on”) may be surprised by the fluency of his embrace of the importance of therapy, talking things through, turning to others for help, confronting pain and finding meaning. Describing Cpl. David Smith’s recovery from a suicide attempt, Bush writes: “Dave sought professional counseling and got prescription medication for his anxiety, depression, and nightmares. Having confronted his trauma and learned to understand and accept it, he began building a new life.”

About the PTSD of Petty Officer 3rd Class Chris Goehner, Bush writes: “Little by little, Chris started to recover. He got down from twelve medications to zero. He realized alcohol didn’t numb the memories but exacerbated them. He started to participate in marathons and triathlons as therapy.” A recurring narrative of hitting bottom, reaching out, then rebirth and the embrace of things like sport, travel or helping others echoes Bush’s Christian understanding of redemption.

Cynics will see a familiar, guy’s-guy tribalism in these accounts – many key episodes in Bush’s relationship with these people happen on the mountain bike trail – but his sympathy and understanding ring true. Those who think what now seems to be the case, that the war in Iraq was the most catastrophic foreign policy mistake this country ever made, will not find these paintings sufficient absolution for the cost, the trauma (here and in Iraq) and what will probably be decades of regional destabilization wrought by the war.

But that doesn’t seem to be Bush’s intent, or the purpose of this book, the profits from which will be donated to a military and veterans’ initiative run by the George W. Bush Presidential Center. There is nothing in this volume to support the thesis that Bush is using painting to work through his demons or any regrets he may have about the wars he initiated.

There is, however, ample evidence that the former president is more humble and curious than the Swaggering President Bush he enacted while in office. And his curiosity about art is not only genuine but relatively sophisticated.

It’s worth making some distinctions. There is the presidency, the president and the man who is or was the president. Since the rise of Donald Trump, Bush’s respect for the institution of the presidency – especially the way he has honored the unwritten rules of conduct for how a president retires and the respect he shows his successors – has been seen in sharp relief. And while many may still strongly disagree with what he did as president – as a partisan political actor – that is now being tempered by a better understanding of who he is as a man. This a naturally occurring phenomenon in American political life, which is particularly susceptible to sentimentality.

So, set aside doubts about whether this is just more posturing. Many of the things that trouble people about our new president, and the precedents he is setting, have nothing to do with the presidency or the president. They are about the character of the man. No matter what you think of George W. Bush, he demonstrates in this book and in these paintings virtues that are sadly lacking at the top of the American political pyramid today: curiosity, compassion, the commitment to learn something new and the humility to learn it in public.",1,http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2017/mar/18/books-bush-showcases-art-of-empathy-in-portraits-o/

Michael Rodriguez is both a military man and a muse. Years after President George W. Bush sent him into war, the two men now call each other friends.

Rodriguez was a U.S. Army Special Forces Green Beret who served from 1992 to 2013. He's featured in President Bush's book of portraits of more than 60 soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines who served in wars under his watch. It's called Portraits of Courage: A Commander in Chief's Tribute to America's Warriors.

Rodriguez says the likeness is pretty good: ""I'm blown away that my former commander in chief would actually take the time to paint those that served under him,"" Rodriguez says. ""And I'm humbled that he selected me as one of them. I think it's a pretty good representation of me. ... I'm still kind of processing the whole thing.""

Rodriguez, who served nine deployments in 21 years, says he has big hopes for the former president's project.

""My hope for this, for his book, is that it bridges that civilian-military divide that Americans feel,"" he says.

Interview Highlights

On whether he was ever angry with a president for sending him into conflict

No. I've never been upset. You know, growing up I was a patriotic American. Heck, my wife's still active duty serving in the Army. She's a combat veteran. ... My oldest son is stationed here in the 82nd Airborne division. I've worked under all the presidents, you know, from President [George H. W.] Bush to President Obama and I've never, I've never been angry at my commander in chief. The burden of command is something that is something you'll never really fully understand unless you're that guy in that position.

On the day he had to retire

I'll never forget it. You know, it was like 17 different diagnoses, 17 things that were wrong with me. ... I knew there were some issues but I had no idea how extensive they were. ... They said: ""We're initiating medical retirement proceedings because you can no longer perform your duties as Special Forces Green Beret."" And that's a quote ... I'll never forget that. That was probably the hardest sentence I ever had to hear.

On how retirement affected his identity

I think [in] the military ... we identify ourselves by our job position or duty position. And after 21 years of service, I identified myself: I was a soldier. I was Special Forces Green Beret. That was my job. Yes, I was a father, I was a husband, a brother, a friend. But when I heard those words it was just difficult for me to process because it was almost like I was losing my identity. ...

I was dealing with not just the multiple traumatic brain injuries and neurological issues that come with that, but, you know, I had severe post-traumatic stress. I was ... finally having to face and deal with memories and things that I carried around from my first deployment as an 18-year-old in Somalia to my last deployments to Afghanistan. So it was very difficult for me. And unfortunately I was dealing with it through alcohol. ... I was self-medicating.

On his own art

During my hospitalization I was exposed to art therapy. ... You tell any Green Beret: ""Hey, we're going to do some art,"" and I'm like, ""What are you talking about. Art? ... I don't do any of this stuff."" ... But I was like, ""All right, I'll give it a try.""

And, you know, I found the gift of art. I'm not saying I'm a gifted artist by any means. But I think art is a gift. ... Art allows us to express ourselves where words fall short. And it's not only an expression, but it's open to interpretation as well. It's a beautiful thing and I think everyone has an artist inside them.

I got into metalworking, blacksmithing, and I found the beauty in taking an unforgiving material or medium-like metal. I want to make something out of it, but the material wants to become something as well — and we kind of meet in the middle. ... It's more of a physical art and, me being a physical guy, I really enjoy the freedoms of expression that it provides to me.

On his hope that Bush's book will help bridge the divide between military and civilians

Joining the military is a personal choice. But you know what? Before any one of us joined the military we were Americans. Whether you serve or not ... that's the commonality we all share — we love our country. And I really hope that people when they read this book and see this ... they see we're just normal people. Veterans aren't that different. ...

My hope is that this book bridges that gap, because we all need to come together. ... The onus is on both communities. But at the end of the day, we're all Americans and I really think that this book will illustrate that.

According to the “Semáforo Anti-Corrupción,” (an observatory implemented by the National Institute for Competitiveness (IMCO)), Mexican Transparency and Coparmex, there are 25 states that have not yet enacted the SLA.

“Some states are waiting for a Constitutional Reform, since they cannot work towards the bill without it,” said IMCO’s Max Kaiser.

Satisfactory reforms have been implemented in only 10 states (Aguascalientes, Baja California Sur, Chiapas, Querétaro, Nayarit, Puebla, Nuevo León, San Luis Potosí, Sonora, and Yucatán) while three others posses Regular Reforms (Mexico City, Guanajuato, and Michoacán) and three more have Deficient Reforms (Jalisco, Morelos, and Veracruz).

Campeche, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Durango, Guerrero, Hidalgo, Oaxaca, Tabasco and Tamaulipas don’t yet have the bill. The deadline for the implementation of the reforms in on July 18, 2017.

146,Bush,George W.,thenews,"MEXICO CITY –A defiant Mexico said on Tuesday it would only stay in NAFTA if it suited it and rejected the imposition of any tariffs or quotas when renegotiating the trade deal U.S President Donald Trump wants to recast to benefit the United States.

Trump has vowed to exit the North American Free Trade Agreement, the 1994 accord which also includes Canada, if he cannot get better terms. For its part, Mexico would not accept changes that restricted free trade, Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray said at a session of Mexico’s Senate.

“We will remain if it suits Mexico,” Videgaray said. “(NAFTA) is not an act of faith, or a dogmatic position, it is an instrument to generate jobs.”

He was speaking days after a visit to Mexico by U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly in which Mexican officials hardened their position against trade and immigration policies under Trump.

The Republican president has angered Mexicans with calls for U.S. firms not to invest south of the border, hard line immigration policies and plans to make Mexico finance a border wall.

Trump spoke positively about a 20 percent border tax on imports being pushed by Republicans in Congress during a Reuters interview last week. He had previously sent mixed signals about the proposal.

Mexico has expressed confidence Trump will not be able to impose harsh barriers on imports anytime soon and vowed to retaliate if the United States imposed a border tax.

Videgaray, who is leading Mexico’s diplomacy with Trump, said trade talks would begin in June or later and would not be quick.

“The executive branch, via the economy ministry, will not accept any modification that implies damage or doesn’t benefit the national economy,” he said.

The country also shouldn’t turn its back on China or the possibility of strengthening that relationship, he said.

DEPORTEES’ SAVINGS

One point of tension between the two countries has been the treatment of undocumented Mexican immigrants in the United States. Videgaray said he had asked the United Nations and the Organization of American States to be on a state of alert on the issue.

Videgaray said he had emphasized to Tillerson and Kelly last week the importance of a “Totalization Agreement” – signed in 2004 but never ratified – that he said allowed Mexican deportees to access social security payments and savings made while in the United States",1,http://www.thenews.mx/mexico/videgaray-mexico-will-only-stay-in-nafta-if-it-suits-it/
147,Bush,George W.,thenews,"ROME — Mount Etna has erupted in a fiery show of lava in eastern Sicily.

The volcano’s latest eruptions, which can last days and even weeks, began on Monday evening. The giant orange fountains of lava, spewing toward the sky, could be seen in the city of Catania and the resort town of Taormina.

Although volcanic ash clouds can cause flight disruptions, the nearby Catania airport was operating normally Tuesday. Authorities reported no danger to the towns that dot the mountain’s slopes.",1,http://www.thenews.mx/world/etna-volcano-erupts-in-fiery-show-of-lava-in-eastern-sicily/
148,Bush,George W.,thenews,"GENEVA – Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Gennady Gatilov said on Tuesday a U.N. Security Council resolution put forward by Western powers to punish Syria’s government over its alleged use of chemical weapons would harm peace talks in Geneva.

The resolution, vetoed by Russia and China, amid U.N.-led peace talks between the warring Syrian parties, had aimed to ban the supply of helicopters to the Syrian government and to blacklist Syrian military commanders.

“It is counter-constructive,” Gatilov told reporters. “The climate will be negative, not because we veto it, but because this resolution was put forward.”

Salem al-Muslet, a spokesman for the High Negotiations Committee, said that the opposition regretted Russia’s seventh veto on Syria, but planned to meet Gatilov and hoped that Russia would pressure its ally, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

“We hope that they come here having something in mind to push the political process here in Geneva, because with this regime, we will reach nowhere unless there is a pressure and the only country that can deliver pressure on the regime is Russia,” Muslet told Reuters Television.

The Geneva peace process has barely reached first gear, with five days of discussion solely on how to arrange the talks.

The negotiations would only begin in earnest when the Syrian government started discussing a transitional governing body and “the real transitional process in Syria”, Muslet said.

Russia is seen playing a key role because of its influence with Assad and because it has driven a new diplomatic push since December, when its air force helped defeat rebels in Aleppo, Assad’s biggest victory in six years of war.

The opposition has long distrusted Russia as a peace broker, and a ceasefire backed by Russia, Iran and Turkey has not entirely stopped the fighting.

“It’s complicated to talk to the Russians. We need to talk to them, but we risk being accused at any moment of being traitors, especially after what happened at the U.N. today,” a member of the opposition delegation said.

Gatilov said he would meet the opposition on Wednesday. Opposition sources had said they expected to meet the Middle East director at Russia’s foreign ministry, Sergei Vershinin, later on Tuesday.

However, those meetings appeared in doubt after the Russian veto.

149,Bush,George W.,thenews,"MILAN –Napoli were left fuming after Juventus were awarded two penalties early in the second half on their way to a 3-1 win in the first leg of their Italian Cup semi-final on Tuesday.

To add insult to injury, Napoli had their own penalty appeal turned down immediately before Juventus were awarded their second.

Paulo Dybala converted both spot kicks for Juve and his fellow Argentine Gonzalo Higuain scored in between after Jose Callejon had given the visitors a halftime lead.

It was Higuain’s second goal in as many meetings against Napoli since he left them to join Juventus in July after scoring a record 36 Serie A goals last season.

Higuain had two years to run on his contract with Napoli, who did not want to sell him, but moved after the Turin club agreed to pay a 90 million euro ($98.83 million) buyout clause in his contract.

“This evening, we suffered a defeat because of decisions which were not debatable, but were shameful and harmed the whole of Italian football,” said Napoli director Cristiano Giuntoli.

Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri, however, said that the two penalties awarded to his team appeared to be correct. “In any case, we can’t reduce our performance to just the two penalty episodes,” he said.

Poland forward Arkadiusz Milik made his first start for Napoli since suffering a knee ligament injury in October and was involved in the move which ended with Callejon turning the ball in from a narrow angle in the 36th minute.

Juventus levelled within a minute of the restart when Kalidou Koulibaly mis-timed a tackle on Dybala who converted the penalty himself.

Higuain then scored from the acutest of angles in the 64th minute when the ball fell to him after Pepe Reina completely missed Juan Cuadrado’s cross.

Napoli had their own appeal turned down, claiming Raul Albiol had been tripped. Juventus immediately broke upfield before Reina dived at the feet of Cuadrado, who went tumbling over.

Replays showed that Reina got a hand to the ball before making contact with the Colombian but referee Paolo Valeri pointed to the spot and Dybala converted again.

“What am I supposed to do, disappear?” said Reina. “This evening, the result was decided by the refereeing decisions, the whole of Italy saw it.”",1,http://www.thenews.mx/sports/napoli-fuming-after-juve-awarded-two-penalties-in-3-1-win/
150,Bush,George W.,thenews,"LIMA – Prosecutors in Peru asked a federal judge on Tuesday to hand down a life sentence to Abimael Guzmán, the founder of the Maoist-inspired rebel group the Shining Path, for allegedly ordering a bombing in Lima that killed 25 people in 1992.

Guzmán is already serving a life sentence for having led the Shining Path’s attempt to overthrow the state.

The 1992 car-bomb attack on Tarata Street in the upscale district of Miraflores was part of the Shining Path’s bid to take its militancy to the capital from rural Peru and helped build support for a crackdown on suspected rebels by former President Alberto Fujimori.

At the start of a public trial on the bombing on Tuesday, Guzmán, now gray-haired and bearded at 82, spoke to the court only to request medical care, a sharp contrast to his shouted praise for communism at a trial more than a decade ago, when he was convicted of terrorism and sentenced to life in prison.

Guzmán’s attorney Alfredo Crespo said that lower-ranking Shining Path leaders in Lima ordered Tarata Street bombing and denied that Guzman was involved.

The bombing was the Shining Path’s bloodiest attack in Lima and followed massacres in indigenous villages in the Andes and Amazon that resisted the group’s control.

Prosecutors said Guzmán and other former Shining Path leaders, all of whom are already in prison, should receive life sentences and pay reparations for the Tarata Street bombing.

Fujimori is also in prison, convicted of corruption and human rights abuses linked to his attempt to quash leftist rebel groups during his decade-long authoritarian rule.

The Shining Path launched one of the deadliest internal conflicts in Latin America in the 1980s. An estimated 69,000 people were killed in the conflict, according to a truth commission",1,http://www.thenews.mx/world/shining-path-founder-guzman-faces-second-life-sentence-in-peru/

154,Bush,George W.,outsidethebeltway,"George W. Bush Speaks Out Against President Trump

Well, at least someone has a backbone.

Doug Mataconis · · 24 comments

Former President George W. Bush was seemingly critical of President Trump on a number of fronts in an interview yesterday that is certainly raising some eyebrows:

WASHINGTON — Former President George W. Bush implicitly criticized President Trump on Monday, taking issue with his approach to immigration and the news media, and suggested that any ties between the new president’s team and Russia should be investigated. In a television interview to promote a new book of his paintings, Mr. Bush indicated that important questions were raised by reported contacts between Russian officials and Mr. Trump’s associates during last year’s election campaign. Mr. Trump forced out his national security adviser for withholding information about a call with Russia’s ambassador. “I think we all need answers,” Mr. Bush said on the “Today” show on NBC. He said he would defer to Senator Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina and chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, about how such an investigation should be conducted. He is a “really good guy, and an independent thinker,” Mr. Bush said of Mr. Burr, “and if he were to recommend a special prosecutor, then it would have a lot more credibility with me.” Like other members of his family, Mr. Bush did not support Mr. Trump during last year’s campaign against Hillary Clinton, although in public he largely kept his views to himself. Mr. Bush congratulated Mr. Trump after his victory and attended the inauguration last month, but the interview on Monday made clear that the most recent Republican president still had serious disagreements with his party’s incumbent commander in chief. Although he did not mention Mr. Trump by name, Mr. Bush expressed disapproval of the president’s assertion that “fake news media” organizations are the “enemy of the American people.” “I consider the media to be indispensable to democracy,” Mr. Bush told Matt Lauer, the “Today” host. “We need the media to hold people like me to account. I mean, power can be very addictive and it can be corrosive and it’s important for the media to call to account people who abuse their power, whether it be here or elsewhere.” He seemed to suggest that language like Mr. Trump’s made it more difficult to press authoritarian leaders like President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to tolerate a free press. “It’s kind of hard to, you know, tell others to have an independent free press when we’re not willing to have one ourselves,” he said. Mr. Bush also urged tolerance when asked about Mr. Trump’s efforts to temporarily ban travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries. As president, Mr. Bush made a point of visiting a mosque after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and regularly insisted that the United States was not at war with Islam. “It’s very important for all of us to recognize one of our great strengths is for people to worship the way they want to or not worship at all,” Mr. Bush said. “I mean the bedrock of our freedom — a bedrock of our freedom is the right to worship freely.” Asked if he supported a ban on Muslim visitors to the United States, the former president said, “I am for an immigration policy that’s welcoming and upholds the law.”

While Bush stopped short of criticizing Trump directly by name, it doesn’t take much to figure out who or what he was talking about, and the fact that this is essentially the first time he’s spoken out at all about the policies of either of his successors is certainly significant. It’s also not a secret that there’s no real love lost between Trump and the Bush family in general, especially after last year’s campaign for the Republican nomination during which Trump directly attacked not only his opponent former Florida Governor Jeb Bush’s, but also Bush’s wife, the 43rd President, and family patriarch George H.W. Bush. Additionally, the Bush clan was noticeably absent from 2016 Republican National Convention despite the fact that at least one of the former Presidents has attended or delivered a message to the event each of the previous years it has occurred. To cap it all off, the public statements from Texas made it clear that not only were the last two Republican Presidents not supporting Trump in the General Election but that they were voting against him. Given this history, it seems that the grudges from the campaign trail still exist and that the younger Bush is taking no small degree of satisfaction in the fact that Trump is largely proving the family right in his first month in office.

In reality, of course, this is unlikely to change the opinion of Donald Trump very much inside the Republican Party where it counts. For the most part, the corners of the GOP where the Bush name still carries some influence are already largely opposed to the Trump agenda. Among the Trump supporters that, unfortunately, are seemingly taking over the party to a greater and greater extent every day, Bush is viewed even worse than he is by many Democrats. Nonetheless, it’s good to have someone speaking out against the current occupant of the White House and, at least to some extent, Bush has seemingly redeemed himself by being willing to speak truth to power, something that is sadly lacking in the Republican Party at the moment.",1,http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/george-w-bush-speaks-out-against-president-trump/
155,Bush,George W.,thenews,"BRUSSELS – European Union lawmakers “overwhelmingly” voted on Tuesday to lift the EU parliamentary immunity of French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen for tweeting pictures of Islamic State group (I.S.) violence.

Le Pen, a member of the European parliament, is under investigation in France for posting three graphic images of I.S. executions on Twitter in 2015, including the beheading of the United States journalist James Foley.

Responding to a request from the French judiciary, the EU lawmakers in the legal affairs committee voted to lift her immunity, EU officials said. The committee’s decision will have to be backed by the whole parliament in a second vote, possibly this week.

Le Pen’s immunity shields her from prosecution; lifting it would permit legal action against her. The offence being considered is “publishing violent images,” which under certain circumstances can carry a penalty of three years in prison and a fine of 75,000 euros ($79,650).

Members of the European Parliment (MEPs) “overwhelmingly voted to lift Le Pen’s immunity,” said eurosceptic 5 Star Movement lawmaker Laura Ferrara. A Parliament official said 18 lawmakers voted in favor of removing Le Pen’s immunity and three voted against.

Le Pen could not immediately be reached for comment.

“Showing and naming the horror of Islamism allow us to fight against it,” Florian Philippot, the vice president of Le Pen’s far-right National Front party, told reporters.

Le Pen, locked in an increasingly tight three-way race to succeed François Hollande this spring, has already seen her earnings as MEP cut for a different case involving alleged misuse of EU funds.

She has denounced the legal proceedings against her as political interference in the campaign, where she is the lead candidate, and called for a moratorium on judicial investigations until the election period has passed.

Polls say Le Pen should win the first of the two election rounds but lose in the runoff. They also show that her legal battles seem to have little effect on her supporters.

Le Pen’s immunity has been lifted before, in 2013. She was then prosecuted in 2015 with “incitement to discrimination over people’s religious beliefs”, for comparing Muslims praying in public to the Nazi occupation of France during World War Two. Prosecutors eventually recommended the charges be dropped.

156,Bush,George W.,thenews,"Global stock markets traded in fairly narrow ranges Tuesday as investors awaited a speech by President Donald Trump to both houses of Congress that could have a major bearing on the outlook for all types of financial assets in the near-term.

KEEPING SCORE: In Europe, the FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was flat at 7,253 while the CAC 40 in France fell 0.1 percent to 4,840. Germany’s DAX was 0.3 percent lower at 11,789. U.S. stocks were poised for modest declines at the open following another day of gains â Dow futures and the broader S&P 500 futures were 0.1 percent.

BIG SPEECH: Investors are anxiously awaiting Trump’s first speech to a joint session of Congress later Tuesday and in particular will be seeking more clarity on tax cuts, infrastructure spending and other business friendly policies. On Monday the president told a group of governors, “We’re going to start spending on infrastructure big.” He also said his budget would propose increasing defense spending by $54 billion while cutting domestic programs and foreign aid by the same amount.

ANALYST TAKE: “A day after the Dow extended its winning streak to 12 straight session â the longest in 30 years â U.S. futures look a little flat ahead of the open with all eyes firmly on Donald Trump’s first appearance before Congress this evening,” said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA. “The sustainability of this rally in the near term may well rest on how Trump performs this evening and whether promises of big spending and phenomenal tax reforms are accompanied by any insight into what they will entail.”

CHINA CONGRESS: Though Trump remains the key driver in markets at the moment, investors are keeping a close watch on developments in China, as the national legislature and a parallel advisory body begin meetings that could signal the direction for the region’s largest economy.

157,Bush,George W.,thenews,"Major U.S. corporations are going to war in Washington over a Republican “border adjustment” tax proposal meant to boost exports over imports, with lawmakers in Congress coming under pressure from some of the nation’s biggest employers.

The political split that is opening, most pronounced in the narrowly divided Senate, could doom the proposal. If it dies, prospects for a thorough tax code reform, a top 2017 goal for President Donald Trump’s Republicans, would be diminished.

Trump, who has vowed to produce a “phenomenal” tax reform package, without recently offering many specifics, has not taken a clear stand on border adjustment. He spoke favorably about it in an interview on Thursday.

The main thrust of border adjustment is to exempt companies from having to pay federal income tax on export revenues, while ending the deductibility of import costs from taxable income.

Border adjustment is a core part of a broad tax reform “blueprint” being pushed by House of Representatives Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan and tax panel chairman Kevin Brady. The blueprint has not been put into formal legislation, but border adjustment is already a sticking point.

At least eight Republicans in the Senate have expressed concern about it. Several are from Republican-leaning states where Wal-Mart Stores Inc is a major employer.

Wal-Mart is a member of Americans for Affordable Products, a business coalition working against border adjustment. Other members include Best Buy, Costco, Gap Inc , Macy’s Inc, Nike Inc and Target.

If the Republican-dominated House approves the blueprint and moves it to the 100-seat Senate, Republicans could lose only a handful of votes and still be able to pass the blueprint.

REPUBLICANS HAVE CONCERNS

“If it came up today, I couldn’t support it,” Arkansas Republican Senator John Boozman told journalists. “That’s not to say I couldn’t [support it] in the future with modifications.”

Boozman said he was concerned that border adjustment would raise prices for consumer goods such as cars and gasoline. He said he worried that Arkansas farmers could be hurt, too, if border adjustment triggered a global trade war.

Boozman’s state is home to Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer. Wal-Mart and its employees have been among Boozman’s biggest backers in 2011-2016, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics, a campaign finance watchdog.

Wal-Mart Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs, on a conference call with reporters a week ago, said, “The things that are being discussed about the border adjustment tax pose a concern.”

Republican Senator Tom Cotton, Boozman’s Arkansas colleague, has also expressed concerns on border adjustment. “He supports the goals of tax reform and job growth. But he believes that a new tax on working-class Americans is not the best way to achieve those goals,” said Cotton spokeswoman Caroline Rabbitt.

Perhaps border adjustment’s most outspoken Senate critic is Georgia Republican David Perdue. He has called the House proposal “a bad idea” and urged colleagues not to support it.

One of Perdue’s top backers in 2013-2016, according to data from the center on its website, has been the Club for Growth, a conservative group that donates large sums to like-minded politicians. Club for Growth opposes border adjustment.

EXPORTS AND IMPORTS

Border adjustment has attracted opposition not only from retailers, but also from oil refiners and automakers.

Texas Republican John Cornyn, a senior senator whose constituents include oil and gas firms, as well as companies that do business with Mexico, told journalists: “If you’re talking about disrupting business models that people have come to depend on, there’s a lot in play and a lot at stake.”

Border adjustment has support from U.S. multinational exporters organized in another group, the American Made Coalition. Its members include Boeing Co, Caterpillar Inc, Dow Chemical Co., General Electric Co, Honeywell International Inc <HON.N, Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer Inc and United Technologies Corp.

Chief executives of 16 big companies sent a letter this month to lawmakers urging tax reform including border adjustment. In it, the CEOs said border adjustment would make U.S.-manufactured products more competitive abroad and at home.

Since Trump’s interview last week, the White House has sent mixed signals on border adjustment. Trump is scheduled to make a major speech to Congress on Tuesday.

“We would be surprised if Trump specifically mentions [border adjustment] on Tuesday night,” said Chris Krueger, analyst at financial firm Cowen & Co. in a research report.

The proposal “is a 15-round heavyweight fight and we are only in the 3rd round … It can all end with a single uppercut from Trump in opposition, though that does not seem to be the direction the White House is headed,” Krueger said.",1,http://www.thenews.mx/world/with-businesses-split-on-u-s-border-tax-wider-reform-looks-shaky/
158,Bush,George W.,thenews,"MOGADISHU, Somalia — Somalia’s new president declared a national disaster Tuesday for a drought that threatens millions of people and is creating fears of a full-blown famine.

The statement from the office of President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed said he has appealed for help from the international community and Somalia’s diaspora of 2 million.

Combating the drought is a priority for Mohamed, who was elected this month to lead this fragile Horn of Africa nation also coping with attacks by the Islamic extremist group al-Shabab.

The United Nations humanitarian office estimates that 5 million people in Somalia, or nearly half the country’s population, need aid.

About 363,000 acutely malnourished children “need urgent treatment and nutrition support, including 71,000 who are severely malnourished,” says the U.S. Agency for International Development’s Famine Early Warning Systems Network.

Thousands have been streaming into Somalia’s capital, Mogadishu, in search of food aid, overwhelming local and international aid agencies. Over 7,000 internally displaced people checked into one feeding center recently.

Because of a lack of clean water in many areas, there is the additional threat of cholera and other diseases, U.N. experts say.

The government earlier this month said the widespread hunger “makes people vulnerable to exploitation, human rights abuses and to criminal and terrorist networks.”

The U.N. humanitarian appeal for 2017 for Somalia is $864 million to provide assistance to 3.9 million people. But last month, the U.N. World Food Program requested an additional $26 million plan to respond to the drought.

Somalia was one of four regions singled out by the U.N. secretary-general this month in a $4.4 billion aid appeal to avert catastrophic hunger and famine, along with northeast Nigeria, South Sudan and Yemen. All are connected by a thread of violent conflict, the U.N. chief said.

159,Bush,George W.,thenews,"BOGOTÁ, Colombia — A retired journalist who joined the criminal underworld while researching a book on South America’s drug cartels became the first Colombian, and possibly the first Latin American, to be executed in China for drug offenses.

The execution Monday of Ismael Arciniegas occurred amid a last-ditch diplomatic effort by Colombia’s government to save the 72-year-old’s life. Arciniegas was arrested in 2010 arriving by plane to the southern port city of Guangzhou trying to smuggle almost four kilograms of cocaine in exchange for $5,000.

But his downfall came decades earlier, in the 1980s, when he began researching a book on drug cartels in his native Cali, according to his son, Juan José Herrera, who described to local media the heart-breaking, 20-minute phone conversation he and family members had with his father shortly before he was taken to a room to be killed by lethal injection.

“God has opened his gates for me,” a calm Arciniegas said in the tear-filled conversation, an excerpt of which was broadcast by Blu Radio. “Remember me warmly, with love. I’m going very tranquil, very relaxed. Nothing worries me.”

Colombia’s government expressed its condolences to Arciniegas’ family and reiterated its objection to China’s use of capital punishment. Since November, China has repatriated two convicted Colombian drug traffickers for humanitarian reasons so they could complete their sentences back home.

“We fought until the last minute to save his life,” the foreign ministry said in a statement.

The execution threatens to strain relations between the two important commercial partners because, according to Colombian officials, there are 15 more people from the South American country on death row in China and an equal number sentenced to life imprisonment. Both punishments are illegal in Colombia.

But while news of Arciniegas’ death dominated social media in Colombia on Tuesday an online survey by Blu of almost 5,000 people showed 52 percent were in agreement with the harsh punishment.

China is the world’s top executioner, although it’s unclear how many foreigners have been sentenced to death in China for drugs or other offenses. A Chinese state media report said in 2015 that a dozen foreign people had been sentenced to death after being convicted of drug dealing. Most were from Japan, South Korea and Southeast Asia, the report said.

Chinese law states that anyone convicted of smuggling, selling, transporting or producing more than 1 kilogram of opium, or 50 grams of methamphetamine or heroin, or a large amount of other drugs, could face the death penalty.

“Chinese judicial authorities have been cracking down in accordance with law,” Geng Shuang, a spokesman for China’s foreign ministry, said at a briefing Tuesday when asked about Arciniegas’ execution. “China always attaches importance to the protection of human rights and the right of life. The legitimate right and interest of the individual involved in the case has been guaranteed.”

Colombia is the world’s largest producer of cocaine, a phenomenon that since the days of Pablo Escobar has generated eye-popping fortunes but also afflicted countless numbers of poor families drawn to the drug trade with the promise of easy money.

Herrera said his family was especially cursed.

His father was imprisoned for drug offenses when he was born, his mother died of an overdose when he was 2 years old and a brother was killed a few years ago by unknown assassins in Cali, one of the cities that is most-ravaged by drug trafficking. His uncle, Arciniegas’ brother, was also arrested trying to sneak drugs into China and died in jail there of a stroke in 2013.

Herrera said his father’s bookish background — he spoke several foreign languages and was an obsessive writer — made him an attractive drug mule to criminals he met in the 1980s while researching a never-published book, to be called “Satanic War,” about the damage caused Colombia by the drug war. Shortly after, he amassed a small fortune but later saw his riches and contact with his family all but disappear when he was jailed in Colombia.

When he traveled to China in 2010, he had fallen on hard times and was trying to rebuild.

“They filled him with greed and led him to make a mistake that cost him his life,” Herrera, who has a tattoo of his father’s face on his chest, told Blu. “He was only a pawn in the game.”

160,Bush,George W.,thenews,"LONDON – Safe haven currency bets including the yen, the Swiss franc and to a lesser extent the Swedish crown rose on Tuesday as investors braced for a tensely-awaited speech to Congress by U.S. President Donald Trump.

Indications that Trump would use the set-piece in front of both U.S. houses to preview elements of his plans to cut taxes for the middle class and make companies more globally competitive helped the dollar bounce late on Monday.

Added to a promise from another Federal Reserve policymaker that interest rates would rise “soon,” that returned markets to the assumptions of a reflating of the U.S. economy that have swirled since last November, prodding short-term U.S. market interest rates higher overnight.

But the lack of details in Trump’s public promises, his ability to deliver legislation in the months ahead and protectionist rhetoric on trade, also worry markets at a time when nerves are growing around politics in Europe.

That has left investors often seeking the security of the yen and safe haven assets including Treasuries and German Bunds in the past month.

“There were a whole list of things on the table and at the moment we have a market that is looking for greater clarity on those topics,” said Simon Derrick, head of global market research with Bank of New York Mellon in London.

“If I had to call it, I think the dollar weakens because I think that, not withstanding the signals, it is probably beyond March before the Fed will hike. I also think the downward pressure on yields [globally] will continue.”

The yen rose a half a percent on the day to 112.14 yen per dollar and 118.80 yen per euro. The franc gained around 0.4 percent against both the euro and dollar, while the Swedish crown rose just over a third of a percent, helped by solid growth numbers.

“Forex looks to be trading a little bit risk off today,” said Sam Lynton-Brown, a strategist with BNP Paribas in London.

“While equities are pretty stable, commodities are off on the day and the commodity currencies like the Australian dollar are a little bit off, while the yen and the franc have gained.”

The dollar index rallied to a 14-year high soon after Trump won the U.S. election in November, boosted by hopes that he would introduce large fiscal stimulus and reflationary plans.

But the greenback sagged in January and the first half of this month in the absence of specifics on tax reform. Barring any drama later on Tuesday, it will end February with a gain of around 1.5 percent against the basket of currencies that measures its broader strength.

Despite that, the two currencies long seen as most exposed to Trump’s intent to reorder U.S. trade relations, the peso and China’s yuan, are both up. The peso is on course for its best calendar month since last March and the onshore yuan for its second straight monthly gain.

That might be undone if the president, for example, indicates he will make good on his earlier promises to label China a currency manipulator. Some dealers in Asia said the yen might also be exposed.

“Obviously, if Trump mentions any specific countries, their currencies will be affected. Countries likely to attract his attention are China, Germany, Japan and Mexico, which all have large trade surpluses versus the United States,” said Daisuke Karakama, market economist at Mizuho Bank.

“He has mentioned China and Japan quite often as of late, so dollar/yen is likely to be affected the most if he speaks about these countries.”

George H.W. Bush has been released from a Houston hospital:

Former president George H.W. Bush was released from the hospital Monday, after spending 12 days at Houston Methodist Hospital due to pneumonia.

The former president, 92, was in the ICU for five days after suffering a respiratory problem caused by pneumonia. Former first lady Barbara Bush, 91, was also admitted to the hospital earlier this month, mostly as precaution. She was discharged Jan. 23.

Bush spokesman Jim McGrath said in a message on Twitter that Bush is thankful for the prayers and kind messages he received during his hospitalization, as well as the “world-class care” from the hospital staff.

He spent two months in the hospital in 2012 with bronchitis and was also hospitalized in 2014 for shortness of breath.",1,http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/george-h-w-bush-released-from-hospital-2/
163,Bush,George W.,nytimes,"But Texas is not the only beneficiary of the economic benefits of the trade agreement. Other governors know the growing importance of trade between their states and Mexico. Across our country, Mexico is proving to be a strong economic friend.

Our economic bond with Mexico carries with it some very positive long-term results. An isolated United States will not be able to compete successfully in a world economy where Europe and Asia are united into common-market partnerships. The trade agreement wisely affords our country the opportunity to join forces with Canada and our neighbors to the south -- first Mexico, then Chile, then other emerging capitalist countries in Latin America. Within a united alliance, America will be economically stronger. We must not allow isolationist rhetoric or bad trade policy to alienate our trading partners.

Not only will free trade help us, it provides a much-needed boost for Mexico. As capitalism takes hold in that country, wages will begin to climb. As wages begin to climb, Mexico will strengthen its middle class. Then, and only then, will the problem of illegal immigration subside. Most people who cross the border are hoping to make a living and provide for their families. The more economic opportunity and growth inside of Mexico, the less of an incentive to enter our country illegally.

The United States has immigration laws in place. I strongly support them. Every nation has a right and responsibility to secure its borders. The Government simply must do a better job of enforcing ours. All of my fellow border governors have called for more equipment and more personnel.

We must expand projects such as Operation Hold the Line, a highly successful program in El Paso, Tex. Under this innovative operation, Border Patrol officers regularly patrol known crossing points so that illegal immigrants are deterred or apprehended before they disappear into our communities. Even though it has been successful, it has not been carried out at other high-traffic corridors along the border.",1,http://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/20/opinion/no-cheap-shots-at-mexico-please.html
164,Bush,George W.,fair,"George W. Bush celebrated his first working day in office–and the 28th anniversary of Roe v. Wade (1/22/01)–by reinstating the Mexico City Policy, a Reagan-era rule that bans U.S. family planning aid to overseas groups that provide abortions or referrals–even if they do so with private, non-U.S. funds. Under the rule (lifted in 1993 by Bill Clinton), U.S. aid recipients cannot use their own money to discuss abortion as a medical option, lobby their own governments for legal reforms, or conduct “public information campaigns” about the procedure.

Long condemned in family-planning circles as the “global gag rule,” the ban has wide-ranging implications for the health and free speech of women from Albania to Zimbabwe, 78,000 of whom die annually from unsafe abortions, according to the World Health Organization. In countries where abortion is legal, organizations that receive U.S. aid must refuse to advise women about their reproductive rights or relinquish the U.S. population funds they rely on to provide contraceptive programs, maternal care, AIDS prevention and other crucial services. Where abortion is illegal, recipients must give up the right to encourage democratic reforms that would save thousands of women’s lives.

Since this speech-squelching policy isn’t exactly soundbite-friendly, the White House employed a careful misinformation strategy when discussing the gag rule with the press. In a memo to the U.S. Agency for International Development (U.S. AID), Bush justified his move by saying, “It is my conviction that taxpayer funds should not be used to pay for abortions or advocate or actively promote abortion.” That is a concept for which “there’s, frankly, widespread bipartisan support,” press secretary Ari Fleischer insisted. These quotes dominated news coverage on the first two days after the administration announced the ban.

Irrelevant rationale

But the White House rationale hasn’t been relevant since 1973, when Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) passed an amendment preventing U.S. aid from directly financing foreign abortion-related services. Though not one U.S. dollar has been spent on such purposes for 28 years, outlets across the country uncritically repeated Bush and Fleischer’s mischaracterizations in front-page stories, with headlines such as “Bush Halts Funding Used for Abortions” (Houston Chronicle, 1/23/01).

Many initial reports either failed to correct Bush’s error or repeated it in their own words (e.g., CNN, 1/22/01; Washington Post, 1/23/01). What corrective information there was often appeared in passing near the end of the story or came in the form of quotes or paraphrases from reproductive rights activists: Three paragraphs from the end of its front-page story, the Boston Herald (1/23/01) reported that “U.S. Rep. Martin T. Meehan (D.-Lowell) asserted that U.S. funds are not directly used for abortions,” presenting the fact as an assertion of opinion rather than a matter of public record.

Not every outlet made those mistakes. Some, like the Los Angeles Times (1/23/01), got the facts right from day one, reporting in two front-page stories that the gag rule restricts how foreign groups spend their own money.

But few news reporters made the effort to substantively examine the gag rule’s international implications, preferring to focus on how imposing ban might affect Bush’s image as a “uniter, not a divider” (St. Louis Post-Dispatch, 1/23/01). This tendency to view abortion from the standpoint of Washington politics was typified in the Washington Post (1/23/01), where three prominent stories examined reactions of American abortion rights supporters and opponents, but gave no insights into the rule’s impact abroad.

More news in editorials

While the gag rule was reported primarily as a political football, editorials and opinion pieces dissected Bush’s spin, cited UN and World Health Organization maternal mortality statistics and checked the historical record, providing a depth of information missing from most news sections. Many newspapers noted that the U.S. has not funded abortions abroad since 1973; several branded Bush “disingenuous” for implying otherwise (e.g., New York Times, 1/24/01).

And where reporters didn’t spill much ink on the gag rule’s anti-democratic underpinnings, the Washington Post (1/25/01) editorialized that it “would be unconstitutional on free-speech grounds in this country.” The Baltimore Sun (1/24/01) called it “an attempt to legislate for other sovereign countries.”

Some editorials drew connections with other administrative priorities, questioning how Bush reconciled the gag rule with his initiative to give taxpayer funds to American religious charities. Perhaps, the Wisconsin State Journal (1/24/01) pondered, Bush should “demand that they never mention God, even on their own dime.” (In fact, as the Washington Post reported on February 1, Bush privately linked “the executive order I signed about Mexico City”–i.e., the gag rule–to his Office of Faith-Based Social Services, referring to both as part of “a larger calling…about changing the culture of the country” against abortion rights.)

First impressions

Despite the corrective editorials, subsequent news coverage of the gag rule was only sporadically more accurate–and in-depth, analytical follow-up continued to be hard to find.

There were exceptions. The Washington Post made a particular effort to set the record straight, running a correction (1/24/01) and a detailed page-2 story (1/26/01) that noted, “the rhetoric accompanying the latest round of debate has added to confusion over what U.S. policy actually has been, and what it is now.” Finally, Post ombudsman Michael Getler acknowledged (1/28/01) that the paper “fell short…on providing the background, meaning and alternative view of what was taking place, and in critiquing the White House statement.”

Commendably, a handful of outlets filed excellent stories from Mexico (Christian Science Monitor, 1/25/01), South Africa (Philadelphia Inquirer, 1/25/01), Guyana and Cambodia (Chicago Tribune, 2/7/01, 3/14/01), exploring how the gag rule will practically affect family planning efforts and social, economic and health issues in those countries.

As strong as these pieces were, none was carried on page one, and none carried the weight of those initial news reports. Well after editorials cleaned up reporters’ shallow and misleading stories, papers like the Seattle Times (1/26/01), Baltimore Sun (1/28/01) and Christian Science Monitor (1/29/01) were still publishing letters from readers on whom the administration’s inaccurate spin left a lasting impression. “No matter what your position on abortion, it is simply wrong to use taxpayer money to fund abortion clinics or operations. A woman’s right to choose is not affected by the denial of taxpayer funding,” one Los Angeles Times reader wrote (1/25/01).

The White House knows how important first impressions are; “You only get one start,” Ari Fleischer told the San Diego Union-Tribune (1/29/01), “and the tone you set sends a strong message to the American people.”",1,http://fair.org/extra/self-gagged-on-gag-rule/

166,Bush,George W.,winknews,"Former President George H.W. Bush, wife still in hopsital

HOUSTON (AP) – Former President George H.W. Bush and his wife, Barbara, remain hospitalized in Houston, where he was in intensive care for pneumonia and she was being watched after complaining of fatigue and coughing.

The 92-year-old former president went into the ICU on Wednesday and underwent a procedure “to protect and clear his airway that required sedation,” family spokesman Jim McGrath said in a statement.

Bush was stable and resting comfortably at Houston Methodist Hospital, McGrath said.

The 41st president was placed in the ICU to address “an acute respiratory problem stemming from pneumonia,” McGrath said. He later told The Associated Press that doctors were happy with how the procedure went. Bush was first admitted to the hospital Saturday for shortness of breath.

“I don’t think there’s a whole lot of money to be gained betting against George Bush,” McGrath said. “We’re just kind of in a wait-and-see mode.”

McGrath said Barbara Bush, who is 91, had not been feeling well for a couple of weeks and decided “to take it out of committee and have the experts check it out.” He described the move as precautionary.

Physicians initially believed the former president would be released later this week following several days of treatment, but his stay has been extended, McGrath said. There is no timetable for his release.

Doctors want to see how the former first lady responds to treatment before allowing her to return home, he said.

The Bushes, who were married Jan. 6, 1945, have had the longest marriage of any presidential couple in American history. At the time of their wedding, he was a young naval aviator. She had been a student at Smith College.

After World War II, the pair moved to the Texas oil patch to seek their fortune and raise a family. It was there that George Bush began his political career, representing Houston for two terms in Congress in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

Bush, who served as president from 1989 to 1993, has a form of Parkinson’s disease and uses a motorized scooter or a wheelchair for mobility. He was hospitalized in 2015 in Maine after falling at his summer home and breaking a bone in his neck. He was also hospitalized in Houston the previous December for about a week for shortness of breath. He spent Christmas 2012 in intensive care for a bronchitis-related cough and other issues.

Despite his loss of mobility, Bush celebrated his 90th birthday by making a tandem parachute jump in Kennebunkport, Maine. Last summer, Bush led a group of 40 wounded warriors on a fishing trip at the helm of his speedboat, three days after his 92nd birthday celebration.

Bush’s office announced earlier this month that the couple would not attend Donald Trump’s inauguration because of the former president’s age and health.

“My doctor says if I sit outside in January, it likely will put me six feet under. Same for Barbara. So I guess we’re stuck in Texas,” Bush wrote in a letter to Trump.

His son George W. Bush, the 43rd president, still expects to attend the inauguration and does not plan to travel to Houston, spokesman Freddy Ford said.

Trump and President Barack Obama sent their well wishes – via Twitter and a news conference respectively. Former President Bill Clinton also tweeted: “41 and Barbara – thinking about you both and sending wishes for a speedy recovery. Love, 42.”

George Herbert Walker Bush, born June 12, 1924, in Milton, Massachusetts, also served as CIA director and Ronald Reagan’s vice president.

George W. Bush was elected president in 2000 and served two terms. Another son, Jeb, served as Florida governor and made an unsuccessful bid for the GOP nomination in 2016. Only one other U.S. president, John Adams, had a son who also became president.

167,Bush,George W.,abcnews," -- Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who has previously pointed to Dick Cheney as someone he'd like to model his vice presidency after, told ABC News' Martha Raddatz he has spent a lot of time thinking about the ""life and example"" of George H.W. Bush in the role.

""I’ve been spending a fair amount of time thinking about the life and the example of Vice President George H.W. Bush because I think then as now was a president taking office who came to Washington, D.C. to change Washington who had a bold and fresh leadership, and who had marshaled the support of millions of Americans that carried him into office,"" Pence said.

Pence previously told Raddatz that he hoped to have a ""very active vice president"" like the last Republican to hold the job: Cheney.

“Vice President Cheney had experience in Congress as I do, and he was very active in working with members of the House and the Senate,” he said in September.

Pence told Raddatz he spoke to the former president ""a few weeks back"" and had a ""wonderful conversation.""

""We talked a little bit about his years as vice president, because I think what he was able to do for President Ronald Reagan, I hope and pray to be able to do for President Donald Trump and that is simply be a support, bring whatever life experiences I can bring to bear to help communicate the president’s agenda to Capitol Hill and all across this country,"" he said.

In addition to Bush, Pence noted he has been in touch with other past vice presidents, including Cheney, who he said he mostly talked to about foreign policy issues, and Vice President Joe Biden.

""I’m just very grateful for these predecessors and the way they’ve reached out to give me the full range of their counsel and also the kind encouragement apart from politics of people who have done the job,"" he said.",1,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/pence-now-george-hw-bush/story?id=44853973

One of the great privileges of serving as land commissioner is serving our veterans. Every day, in ways large and small, our office provides help and hope to our heroes. And we’re grateful we’ve been tasked with this work. It’s our way of making a small payment on a debt we can never fully repay.

The story of the General Land Office honoring veterans started with the founding of the Republic of Texas. Nearly 200 years ago, the republic began recording the names of heroes who fought for Texas so that they could be awarded land grants. Today, our state’s obligation remains the same; we honor our veterans not by what we say about them, but by how we treat them.

In 2015 I met a veteran named Gary Webb at the VFW in Abilene. He served in the Air Force for over 20 years and is hard working and direct. He spent most of his life elsewhere, but moved his family to an unfamiliar place because Texas provides additional benefits and honors our veterans.

Our visit reminded me of just how important our work at the GLO is as just one part of a vast network that cares for Texas’ veterans. That’s why this became the Year of the Veteran.

At the start of the year, our data said less than 20 percent of Texas veterans knew about the benefits they’ve earned, and it was past time for that to change.

We set out to raise awareness by touring the state on the way to 100 meetings with Veterans advocates, tours of VFW Posts and military instillations, VA medical centers, DAV and American Legion conventions, and businesses who have made it part of their mission to hire former soldiers, sailors, Marines and airmen.

From my own experience in the military, I have seen selfless displays of bravery from the men and women I was privileged to serve with. I’ve have seen the quiet courage and iron hands of brave young Americans. I was humbled to be in their presence.

This year I’ve had the chance to meet some of these men and women and I’ve been inspired by what I have seen and heard from them.

In October I visited the amazing El Paso veterans and spouses who live in the VLB’s Ambrosio Guillen Texas State Veterans Home. I also toured Fort Bliss and met with senior leadership.

At the VLB we’re committed to making sure our veterans know the benefits they’ve earned before they leave the service and teaming with transition centers on military instillations is a big part of that goal.

While on post I also visited the William Beaumont Army Medical Center and witnessed the good work they do providing primary and specialized ambulatory care services.

These are the folks we’re going to keep fighting for every day at the GLO and VLB.

Even though the Year of the Veteran may be ending, every year is dedicated to our Veterans here at the GLO and in our great state, and I had a special reminder of that this Memorial Day.

This year I had the chance to speak to veterans, active duty military, Gold Star Families and Texans of all stripes at our Coastal Bend Veterans Cemetery in Corpus Christi.

About halfway through, it started to rain, hard.

When I finished my remarks, I was amazed to see that not one person had left. Everyone stayed in the pouring rain to honor the men and women who paid the ultimate price and made the ultimate sacrifice.

I was reminded that day what it is to be a Texan, and what is required of us.

My fellow veterans, we are with you, and we are for you.

Rain or shine.

The attack on Pearl Harbor 75 years ago drew a staggered, reluctant America headlong into the global struggle against the Axis powers. I was still in high school walking across the campus at Andover in Massachusetts when we heard the news.

Like everyone, I was stunned that someone would attack our country. In the preceding years, President Roosevelt had tried to steer a course of neutrality, attempting to keep America out of the building conflagration that was consuming both Europe and Asia.

Pearl Harbor settled that debate with horrific clarity.

The inherent treachery of that raid not only galvanized what needed to be done in the minds of policymakers, it united Americans from all walks of life who were determined to defend our way of life.

As for me, I remember thinking, “We gotta do something about this one.” Given my love of the sea, I was determined to become a naval aviator — and the sooner I could enlist, the better.

There wasn’t anything unusual about this decision, mind you. Millions of Americans put their lives on hold to serve their country and help the war effort. In Victory Gardens and factories here on the homefront — as in the various theaters of conflict across Asia, Africa and Europe — virtually every American wanted to do their part, no matter how big or small, to help secure freedom’s victory over tyranny.

It was one of our nation’s finest hours.

As we pause to reflect on the shock of Pearl Harbor and its aftermath, the ultimate outcome of World War II might seem as if it was foreordained. It was not.

Before Pearl Harbor, many believed the tide of democracy, which had lifted and sustained our republic for 160 years, was ebbing. Totalitarianism was on the march, and the widespread misery of the Great Depression had some declaring capitalism dead — and seeking to concentrate vast new powers in the hands of federal government. They felt the United States was a nation in decline and needed to follow a new path to the future.

Instead, it was America who, after vanquishing the dictatorial despots and their legions, reached out to make those erstwhile enemies our friends. We helped heal their wounds, rebuild their societies and give birth to new democracies and free-market economies.

Today, we can take heart that the United States and Japan are not only friends but sworn allies. The bitter rancor of that bygone era has yielded to decades of international cooperation and collaboration. Looking forward, it is absolutely vital that Japan and the world can count on America to continue leading —working together for peace, democracy, freedom and justice around the world.

Only then can we count ourselves worthy of the selfless sacrifices born by our fellow countrymen — and consecrated in the waters of Pearl Harbor.

180,Bush,George W.,legalinsurrection,"Donald Trump is claiming in his recent speeches that the election is “rigged.”

It’s unclear what he means by “rigged” — is it physical tampering (for which there is no proof) or a bias in the media to unfairly sway public opinion (for which there is plenty of proof), or both.

Regardless, the claim of “rigging” is being treated as one of the worst threats to our democracy ever!

The two most dangerous accusations that can be made in an election in one tweet. Trump is literally threatening American democracy. https://t.co/CbRbmxtene — Ryan Lizza (@RyanLizza) October 15, 2016

I did some searching, and it seems that presidential election fraud claims were made against George W. Bush in 2000 (mostly related to the Florida recount) and 2004.

Were those claims a threat to democracy?

That doesn’t excuse Trump making false accusations of physical rigging (if that’s what he means by “rigged”), but don’t act like claims of rigging are something new.

As we approach the fifteenth anniversary of the September 11th attacks on Sunday, Politico is up with a fascinating first-person account of the attack from the point of view of White House aides, military officers, and members of the traveling press corps who were with President Bush the day everything changed. It follows the story from the early morning hours of September 11th in Florida right up until the President’s return to Washington that evening to address the nation from the Oval Office. It’s far too long and detailed to excerpt, so I’ll just recommend you read it because it tells a part of the story of that day that we’ve never really heard before.",1,http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/were-the-only-plane-in-the-sky/
185,Bush,George W.,inquisitr,"For months, YG Entertainment teased the K-pop fans of an upcoming new K-pop girl group they were about to debut. Such news was monumental in the K-pop community because it has been almost seven years since YG Entertainment debuted a K-pop girl group. The last time they did was back in 2009 when they introduced the world to 2NE1, a four-member group consisting of CL, Dara, Bom, and Minzy.

Even though the new YG Entertainment K-pop girl group was a big deal, the entertainment label did its best to help build hype. Over the course of 2016, YG Entertainment released numerous teaser pictures of the group's members, Jennie, Lisa, Jisoo, and Rosé. Eventually, we would learn the four-member group was officially called Black Pink in which the two colors represent that they are the very pretty (pink), but there is more to them than what meets the eye (black). Needless to say, K-pop fans were hyped, wondering when Black Pink would make their debut in which some thought it would happen right after Red Velvet's comeback.

Black Pink is the new K-pop girl group developed under YG Entertainment. They consist of four members -- Jennie, Lisa, Jisoo, and Rosé. [Image via YG Entertainment Promotions for Black Pink]YG Entertainment eventually revealed Black Pink's debut through a series of teaser images which led up to today, August 8. As part of their debut, Black Pink released two songs, ""Whistle"" and ""Boombayah."" From what K-pop fans are saying, Black Pink slayed with their debut. Yet, if we were to look closely at the music videos for the two songs, did Black Pink call out their competition in them?

Before analyzing the music videos, it is best to show them right? According to AllKpop, the two songs, ""Whistle"" and ""Boombayah,"" were produced by Teddy Park with Future Bounce also producing on the former. Both Teddy and Bekuh Boom wrote for the two songs too.

Anyways, the music videos for ""Whistle"" and ""Boombayah"" are attached below. ""Whistle"" is on the top, ""Boombayah"" is on the bottom. Without really detailing all that is happening in both music videos, the vibe and feel Black Pink is showing is almost identical to 2NE1. This was technically done on purpose as the vibe and feel 2NE1 had is not exclusive to them but considered just a part of the whole that makes YG Entertainment different from other K-pop artists signed under other labels. Even Yang Hyun Suk, the CEO of YG Entertainment, made it known that he did not try to distinguish a difference between 2NE1 and Black Pink, as reported by Korean news outlet Naver.

""We didn't try too hard to create a difference between Black Pink and 2NE1. It was the same when we created 2NE1. YG has its own unique sound so we focused on making the music sound the most like us.""

If one were to analyze Black Pink's music videos, they might have indirectly ""called out"" Red Velvet (Yeri not pictured). As a matter of fact, they might have indirectly called out a lot of new K-pop girl groups in them. [Photo by Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images]Though the vibe and sound of Black Pink is very similar to 2NE1, their music video's stylistic content seems to borrow from other K-pop girl groups, ones who might be considered competition. This might be YG Entertainment's way of having Black Pink ""call out"" their competition, specifically Red Velvet, Twice, and GFriend. The music video for ""Whistle"" seems to utilize a lot of stylistic elements from Red Velvet music videos especially ""Dumb Dumb"" and ""One Of These Nights."" As for ""Boombayah,"" not only does it have stylistic elements from Red Velvet's ""Happiness,"" but uses stylistic elements from Twice music videos, ""Like OHH-AHH"" and ""Cheer Up,"" and GFriend's ""Navillera.""

The aforementioned, however, is stipulation but the fact both of Black Pink's music videos seems to use stylistic elements prominently featured in other K-pop girl groups' music videos cannot be ignored. If this is a means to start a healthy dose of competition, then, by all means, it should happen. However, if doing such is inconsiderate business conduct, it seems YG Entertainment might be heading in such a direction already.

186,Bush,George W.,inquisitr,"Randy Orton has accomplished quite a bit in his WWE career - 12-time WWE World Heavyweight Champion, Intercontinental Champion, 2009 Royal Rumble winner - and he'll unquestionably be going into the WWE Hall of Fame someday. But while Orton's career accomplishments are quite impressive, there's one person who isn't impressed by them, and that's Orton's opponent at SummerSlam, Brock Lesnar.

WWE has spent the majority of this afternoon promoting the upcoming bout between Lesnar and Orton on their official Twitter page by posting short interview clips of both men talking about the match, and in one of the clips, Lesnar mocks Orton's WWE accomplishments, saying that his own accomplishments - NCAA Division 1 Heavyweight Champion, 4-time WWE World Heavyweight Champion, 2002 King of the Ring, 2003 Royal Rumble winner, and 1-time UFC Heavyweight Champion - far supersede anything that Orton has ever done.

[embed]https://twitter.com/WWE/status/762703807914487808[/embed]

""Everything that I've accomplished far supersedes anything that Randy Orton could ever dream about. We're not on the same parallel. I'm on another universe.""

Just a few minutes later, WWE posted a video of Randy Orton responding to Brock Lesnar, where Orton talked about Lesnar's decision to leave WWE in 2004.

[embed]https://twitter.com/WWE/status/762746223476387840[/embed]

""He had the whole world by the tail. He was running things, and then he decided to leave because he didn't like people? S**t, I don't like people, and I'm still here. I'd say that became the moment where I realized, 'well this Lesnar isn't the guy I thought he was.'""

It seems that WWE is really pushing the idea that these two have real-life heat with one another. Back at WWE's Battleground pay-per-view, which saw Randy Orton return from injury during Chris Jericho's Highlight Reel, Orton referenced Lesnar's two USADA failures. After the show, Jericho took credit for Orton's ""no enhancement needed"" line on his podcast, claiming that he was the one who wrote it.

WWE is billing the Orton vs. Lesnar match as ""15 years in the making."" Of course, Lesnar and Orton have faced each other in the past, but that was long before Orton became a main-event level star in WWE, and by the time he did in the summer of 2004, Lesnar had left for the NFL.

[embed]https://twitter.com/WWE/status/762626932416454656[/embed]

There are a lot of similarities between Orton and Lesnar, one of which is that they were both the youngest ever World Heavyweight Champion when they won their first world Title. Lesnar won his first World Title at the age of 25 after he defeated WWE legend Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson at SummerSlam in 2002. Then, just two years later, Orton won the World Title at the age of 24 after he defeated Chris Benoit at SummerSlam in 2004.

Chances are that this will be the final one-on-one match between Orton and Lesnar due to them being on separate brands, and if that's the case, then Lesnar will probably pick up the win on August 21. The booking of this match does seem a bit strange, however, because it will be Orton's first high-profile match since returning from injury, and typically you'd want a star at the level of Orton to win his first big match back. But, as previously mentioned, it doesn't look like ""The Viper"" will be picking up the win at WWE's biggest event of the summer.

We'll likely see the interview clips that WWE posted on their Twitter page on tonight's Raw, because neither Orton or Lesnar are advertised for tonight's show in Anaheim, California. Of course, the Lesnar vs. Orton situation will likely also be addressed by Mick Foley and Daniel Bryan. who are both scheduled to be on tonight's show.

Lesnar is scheduled to return to Raw next week, and it's unclear if Randy Orton will make yet another surprise appearance on the program.

187,Bush,George W.,inquisitr,"Powerwall batteries manufactured by Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) were installed by 450 U.S. and 1,000 European homeowners last year, according to the Wall Street Journal. One-hundred U.S. industrial Powerpack system installations were also reported.

When Tesla CEO Elon Musk first launched the home energy solution in April, 2015, customers appeared to enthusiastically cheer its arrival. Within days, Tesla reported that 38,000 no-deposit reservations for the Powerwall had been received by the electric car and energy company, as reported by Clean Technica.

Perhaps noteworthy is the current Tesla Powerwall Wikipedia page, which includes two seemingly relevant passages.

""Announced in 2015, with a pilot demonstration of 500 units built and installed during 2015,"" the second paragraph of the Wikipedia Powerwall page reads, giving a Tesla-hosted file as a source that contains no mention of a 500-unit pilot.

At the unveiling of the Powerwall in April, 2015. [Photo by Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images]""Shipments of 500 pilot units were planned to begin in the late summer of 2015,"" the first paragraph under the ""Market"" heading of the Wikipedia page reads, giving an Information Week source that also contains no mention of a 500-unit pilot.

At the time the Powerwall was released, Musk was optimistic about the potential of the product and the interest Tesla had been receiving from consumers.

""In the course of less than a week, we've had 38,000 reservations for the Powerwall,"" Elon Musk was quoted. Thirty-thousand ""reservations is more like 50,000 or 60,000 actual Powerwalls... We're basically, like, sold out through the middle of next year… in the first week. It's crazy.""

Musk's May-2015 words appear to be in stark contrast to GTM analyst Ravi Manghani who spoke with the Wall Street Journal recently.

""It's still a relatively tiny market, compared to solar or wind today, and minuscule if you look at the complete electricity infrastructure.""

On August 3, Tesla reported its second-quarter 2016 financial results, which included a per share earnings loss of $1.06, missing the already reduced Wall Street analyst estimate consensus of $0.52 by 103.8 percent, as reported by Yahoo Finance.

Over the past 90 days, the full-year 2016 EPS consensus estimate has been reduced from a profit of $0.90 to a loss of $0.24, or 126.6 percent. The full-year 2017 view has been reduced from a profit of $3.32 to $2.10, or 36.7 percent.

The market for power storage is expected to grow by 700 percent from 1,000 megawatts in 2015 to 7,000 megawatts in 2025. The Wall Street Journal described the market for home-energy storage solutions like the Powerwall as being ""slow to materialize"" and of ""getting off to a slower start"" than Elon Musk expected.

Auckland, New Zealand's The Rongomai School Tesla Powerwall installation. [Photo by Hannah Peters/Getty Images]During the Tesla analyst conference call on August 3, Musk stated that he expects 2016 Powerwall sales to be ""heavily concentrated"" in the later part of the fourth quarter, in November and December. A Tesla representative stated that management had decided to wait until more progress had been made in the construction of the Nevada Gigafactory, where Tesla batteries are produced. The Gigafactory is reported to be now close to being ""fully operational.""

Powerwall and Powerpack revenue figures are said not to be available from Tesla. Analysts who follow the company reportedly describe the situation as one where Tesla is selling ""far less"" Powerwalls than it had originally estimated.

Despite the second-quarter EPS miss, TSLA stock has remained relatively steady, though it lost $3.87, or 1.6 percent, today on lighter-than-average volume, as reported by Yahoo Finance. Over the past 12 months, TSLA stock has lost 6.2 percent of its value, compared with a gain of 5.2 percent for the broad market, as measured by the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI). Over the past six months, TSLA shares have gained 57.4 percent, compared with a gain of 16.4 percent for the Dow.

Jeb Bush's son spoke to a gathering of Texas Republican activist on Sunday, where he encouraged the group that it was time to back the Republican Presidential nominee Donald Trump.

Bush didn't attend the Republican Party Convention last month in Cleveland, Ohio. Jeb Bush also refuses to vote for the GOP nominee in November.While Jeb Bush's son went ahead and endorsed Donald Trump, Jeb Bush continues to adamantly speak against the GOP nominee. In July, Jeb said that Republicans voting for Donald Trump would ultimately feel ""betrayed,"" when they would discover that what he's campaigning for would never be fulfilled. During an interview with MSNBC, Jeb Bush discussed how Trump's promises are ridiculous.Donald Trump didn't necessarily stop insulting Jeb Bush once he got out of the presidential race. In June, when Trump was still the presumptive Republican nominee, he accused Jeb Bush of encouraging GOP delegates to block Trump from gaining the presidential nomination in Cleveland.Jeb Bush's son still ended up supporting Donald Trump, despite the Republican presidential nominee not having evidence to back the claim that Jeb was supposedly encouraging delegates not to support Trump.

Jeb Bush's son seems to be the odd one out, by supporting Republican Presidential nominee Donald Trump. One of Jeb Bush's longtime advisors, Sally Bradshaw publicly announced that she was now registered as a member of the Independent Party. She also added that she would be voting for Democratic Presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, come November.

Before endorsing Donald Trump, George P. Bush had previously been criticized for not throwing his support behind the Republican nominee earlier in the election. While Bush had initially accepted the position of overseeing Texas' statewide campaign in November, he had been criticized for not choosing a presidential candidate first.

Though Jeb Bush's son initially ended up endorsing Donald Trump, Jeb was the favorite Republican presidential candidate for a period of time. According to Vanity Fair, Jeb Bush was perfect for the position because of his family name, his connection with the Latino community, the fact that he could speak Spanish, and how he had super-PAC funds worth $11o million. Though, it seems the Republican party wasn't looking for a traditional candidate in the 2016 presidential election. Party voters have been drawn to Donald Trump's anti-establishment ways. Trump's beliefs on anti-immigration and lack of money in politics have made him appealing to Republican voters.

189,Bush,George W.,inquisitr,"Is Hillary Clinton in good health? Is she healthy enough for the Oval Office? There's growing concern over Hillary Clinton's health after several videos, photos and comments appeared online.There's also rumored speculation that the media is downplaying Hillary Clinton's health concerns.

One video making rounds has been dubbed the ""Hillary Clinton Seizure Video."" Conspiracy theorists have slowed the video speed to watch the apparent seizure in slow motion. For many, the video is undeniable proof that Hillary Clinton is in no condition to be president. The possible seizure video isn't the only reason people are concerned about the 68-year-old Democratic nominee's health. A photo recently surfaced showing Hillary Clinton climbing stairs with assistance. Is the photo recent or old? According to CNN, the photo is from a campaign stop in February. Hillary reportedly slipped and was helped up. This is in contrast to those who say Clinton is old, frail and has difficulty walking alone. Those who believe Hillary Clinton is in ill health, are calling for her medical records to be made public. They also contend there is a media blackout surrounding the truth regarding Hillary's health. Those against Clinton's campaign are convinced proof of her poor health is evident in her speeches. There is a compilation video of Hillary Clinton's alleged health moments that many are pointing too as proof she is ill. Clips are included of Hillary Clinton repeatedly coughing.

Hillary Clinton is unfit to be President: Photographic proof she has seizures.

""She is lucky being Hillary Clinton and had a follow-up MRI -- lucky that her team thought to do it. It could have potentially serious complications. Imagine this vein, where all the cerebral spinal fluid inside the head and spine no longer flows through this area. You get a big back up and that itself could cause a stroke. In the long-term … the venous system can't get the blood out of the brain. It's like a Lincoln Tunnel back up.""

Some conspiracy theorists believe she is in dire need of medical attention at all times. One conspiracy theory circulating is that Clinton needs Diazepam because she's at constant risk of seizures.The fears stem from reported brain injuries Hillary Clinton suffered in the past. In 2012, Clinton was diagnosed with cerebral venous thrombosis. ABC reported on Clinton's condition which was described as life-threatening JFK Johnson Rehabilitation Center for Head Injuries medical director Dr. Brian Greenwald spoke about Clinton's brain injury.Many fear that Clinton is suffering long term seizures following her brain injury. A comment Clinton made herself is also sparking controversy. According to the Washington Post, recent remarks Hillary Clinton made on Fox News regarding her email server hearing were not completely truthful. You can read the full fact checking article on Hillary's statements at the Washington Post.

When Hilary Clinton was called out for the untruths, she stated that she did ""short-circuit"" the truth. The term ""short-circuit"" has caused many conspiracy theorists to believe she's suffering brain damage. Pharmaceutical executive Martin Shkreli, who's embroiled in his own controversy, chose Twitter to weigh in on Clinton's health. As someone familiar with drugs, his expertise leads him to believe Clinton has Parkinson's disease. Shkreli shared his findings in an interview with InfoWars. Even Wikileaks, the whistleblower site that released thousands of documents regarding Clinton and the DNC is tweeting about Clinton's behavior. In the tweet, Wikileaks referred to Hillary Clinton as having a liberal nervous breakdown.

In recent months, Miranda Lambert and Anderson East have been faced with rumors regarding a possible split, as well as reports of plans for marriage and children, but days ago, it was perfectly clear that the breakup rumors were far from true.

""[Miranda Lambert] performed at the Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre in Irvine, California, on Friday, donning a black T-shirt with her rhythm and blues musician beau's name emblazoned in a bold, white font,"" Entertainment Tonight revealed to readers on August 7. ""She styled the top with denim cut-off shorts, bedazzled silver belt, sexy fishnet stockings and her signature cowgirl boots.""

Also during her weekend concert, Miranda Lambert was heckled by a fan who reportedly yelled out Gwen Stefani's name during her show. Although Miranda Lambert did kick someone out of the concert after labeling them a ""d****e bag,"" Entertainment Tonight didn't confirm whether or not the man removed from the show was the same person who had yelled Blake Shelton's girlfriend's name.

Miranda Lambert and Anderson East began their relationship at the end of last year, and while they haven't said much publicly about their love, they have confirmed their attraction to one another with several outings, one of which took place on Valentine's Day. As East performed a show, Miranda Lambert joined him on stage along with a friend and engaged in a duet of ""My Girl."" Months later, Miranda Lambert and Anderson East walked the red carpet together at the 2016 Academy of Country Music Awards, which were also attended by her ex-husband, Shelton, and held in Las Vegas.

A short time after Miranda Lambert and Anderson East made their relationship debut at the Academy of Country Music Awards, a source told E! News that East ""was a little nervous"" to walk the red carpet with Lambert but also ""so happy"" to be by her side.

Although Miranda Lambert's ex-husband was at the event as well, the country singer ""did not avoid"" a run-in with her former partner. Instead, the source explained, ""she just did not go out of her way to bump into him. If they did, she would [have said] hi.""

Miranda Lambert ""was not nervous at all"" about seeing Shelton. ""She is in a totally different space than [she was] months ago. She has no issues with Blake and is happy that he is in a good place in his life and also in love,"" the source revealed.

As for her relationship with Anderson East, the source continued on, revealing that Miranda Lambert and her partner have an intense connection to one another.

""Whenever they are together they act like two free spirits…[Miranda Lambert] adores Anderson,"" the E! News source said. ""They understand each other. Anderson has given Miranda this confidence she hasn't felt in some time. They are very supportive with each other and their careers.""

""Anderson and [Miranda Lambert] are serious,"" the source continued. ""They have met both sides of their families. Both their families love what they have. They seem like they are in such a great place. They spend so much time together. They are also very involved with Miranda's animals. That's a big part of her life and Anderson is a huge animal lover.""

Miranda Lambert will return to her Keeper of the Flame Tour later this week in Sturgis.

191,Bush,George W.,inquisitr,"The electric vehicle known as the Tesla Model X with the doors that look like ""X"" wings is being credited with saving the life of a man named Joshua Neally. Joshua recently purchased his Tesla Model X -- and now the autopilot of Neally's Tesla might have been the best purchase that the Springfield, Missouri-based attorney from Branson ever purchased.

As reported by KY3, which has a video of Joshua driving the Tesla Model X that Neally bought only two week ago, Joshua was driving his usual route on Highway 65 when he began to experience health problems. Neally called it the worst kind of pain he'd ever felt, but he trusted his Tesla Model X to get him to the emergency room without swerving off the side of the road.

Joshua didn't want to waste precious time by pulling over to the side of the road and waiting for an ambulance to find him and transport him to the hospital. In the video, Neally is shown opening the hood of the Tesla Model X to reveal the fact that the SUV doesn't have the usual things seen in non-electric cars, like gas engines. Joshua especially appreciated the autopilot feature of the Tesla Model X, which lets drivers go for as long as four-minute periods without touching the steering wheel.

Joshua found it necessary when he found himself driving home to celebrate his daughter's birthday. Neally ended up feeling pain from a pulmonary embolism, which blocks the arteries in the lungs, according to the Mayo Clinic. It is a condition that could have killed Joshua, right inside his Tesla Model X.

[Photo by Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP Images]The autopilot feature kept Neally on the road while Joshua drove the final two blocks to the hospital himself. Joshua shudders to imagine how his health conditions might have played out if Neally were driving a vehicle that didn't have the same autopilot features as his Tesla Model X.

Neally remarked that even if he had fainted at the wheel of his Tesla, the Model X with the autopilot is designed to pull the driver safely to the side of the road. Despite the feature, Tesla warns drivers to stay attentive with their hands on the wheel.

""It's the ultimate gadget. It's the coolest technology I've ever seen I would say, let alone owned. I would characterize it as the ultimate cruise control. I'm very thankful I had it for this experience. If something like that happens where I become unconscious or incapacitated while I'm driving, I'm not going to cross over the interstate and slam into somebody or slam into one of the big rock walls. It's not going to be perfect, there's no technology thats perfect, but I think the measure is that it's better and safer. ""A little past Highlandville it just hit where it was the most excruciating pain I've ever had. It was kinda getting scary. I called my wife and just said 'something's wrong' and I couldn't breathe, I was gasping, kind of hyperventilating. I just knew I had to get there, to the ER.""

The Tesla Model X has the autopilot mode isn't considered a ""self-driving"" car.

[Photo by Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP Images]As seen in the top photo above, a man who donned a face mask got out of a Tesla Model X at the Beijing International Automotive Exhibition.

With the Missouri man possibly owing his life to the Tesla Model X's autopilot feature, the SUV is getting more attention online. One sample comment from social media can be seen below.

195,Bush,George W.,thenews,"South Korean special prosecutors indicted Samsung’s de facto chief Tuesday on bribery, embezzlement and other charges linked to a political scandal that has toppled President Park Geun-hye.

The indictment of Samsung Electronics vice chairman Lee Jae-yong is a huge hit for the largest and most successful of the big businesses that dominate the South Korean economy. It also signals the still roiling state of South Korea’s political and economic circles after weeks of massive demonstrations that led to Park’s impeachment.

The announcement of the indictment came after a three-month investigation by a special prosecution team that ended Tuesday after the country’s acting leader refused a request for an extension.

Shortly after the announcement, Samsung said several top executives also facing criminal charges will resign from their positions and leave Samsung.

It did not say anything about Lee’s status, implying that the Samsung heir will likely keep his position and board membership at Samsung Electronics while he is under arrest and stands trial.

Prosecutors say Lee gave bribes worth $36 million to Park and her confidante to help win government support for a smooth leadership transfer from Lee’s ailing father to Lee.

Lee also allegedly hid assets overseas, concealed proceeds from criminal activities and committed perjury. The 48-year-old billionaire was arrested Feb. 17. Samsung has denied wrongdoing.

Prosecutors also said they planned to indict four other Samsung executives on charges of offering bribes, embezzlement, hiding assets overseas and concealing proceeds from criminal activities.

The indictments mean that key figures at a powerful yet secretive Samsung office that wielded influence over dozens of Samsung affiliates face trial. Lee promised in December to disband the secretive office, called the Corporate Strategy Office, which allegedly orchestrated bribery schemes centered on Choi Soon-sil, Park’s confidante.

The office consists of close Lee family aides who worked to help ensure the father to son leadership transition. Some say the contentious merger of Samsung C&T and Cheil Industries in 2015 was also overseen by the office, not by the board of directors at the two Samsung companies. The merger, a crucial step for Lee to strengthen his grip on Samsung Electronics, was a key benefit that Samsung sought from the government by offering millions of dollars to Choi’s various entities, according to the prosecutors.

The merger, despite opposition from some shareholders who argued that it unfairly benefited the Lee family, was approved by shareholders thanks to the support of a state-controlled national pension fund, a key Samsung investor.

The special prosecution team said it also plans to pursue additional charges of bribery and concealing proceedings from criminal activities against Choi, who allegedly exploited her presidential ties to extort money and favors from companies and manipulate state affairs from the shadows.

The team finished its inquiry without questioning Park, after she backed off from a Feb. 9 interview. The country’s acting leader, Hwang Kyo-ahn, refused to extend the investigation past Tuesday’s deadline.

Lee was once the face of the new Samsung, but now follows in the footsteps of his father, Samsung Electronics chairman Lee Kun-hee. The senior Lee was indicted in 2008 on charges of tax evasion and breach of trust. He was later convicted and then pardoned by a former president.

Corruption has dogged many other business leaders in South Korea’s family-controlled conglomerates, which are known as chaebol.

When the elder Lee was indicted, Samsung vowed a series of measures to improve transparency.

After the prosecutors’ announcement Tuesday, Samsung said it would disband the secretive office.

Since Lee’s father fell ill in May 2014, the younger Lee has stepped up his leadership role. Samsung appeared to be trying to change its top-down, hierarchical, authoritarian corporate culture under Lee.

Fluent in foreign languages, educated overseas and linked to Silicon Valley luminaries, Lee was seen as the new face of Samsung. Samsung promised to remove obstacles to creativity and innovation in recent years by introducing a nimble, startup-like attitude. It has increased returns to shareholders and acquired several companies outside South Korea.",1,http://www.thenews.mx/world/south-korean-prosecutors-indict-samsungs-de-facto-chief/
196,Bush,George W.,thenews,"BRUSSELS – A European Parliament panel chastised European authorities and automakers on Tuesday for failing to ensure that laws on diesel emissions were upheld, and called for much-improved oversight in the future.

The investigating committee was set up after it emerged in late 2015 that Germany’s Volkswagen had installed software that allowed cars to cheat on emissions tests — something that turned out to not have been isolated to the U.S., where the cheating was first detected.

“One of the main conclusions is that “Dieselgate” could have been avoided if member states and the European Commission had simply followed the European law,” panel member Gerben-Jan Gerbrandy said after the committee wrapped up its work. He said that much stronger oversight of the approval of car types at European level “is the only way forward to avoid a next scandal.”

The committee has already accused France, Italy and Spain among others of trying to slow down the introduction of tougher emissions tests. Gerbrandy, a Dutch lawmaker, said it was “shocking that so little has changed” as far as national authorities and the industry are concerned, complaining that “the Italian supervisor still lets Fiat off the hook, the German authorities are still failing to issue fines to Volkswagen.”

The panel’s conclusions aren’t binding but increase pressure on the EU’s executive Commission to improve oversight. The committee faulted the fact that different departments in Brussels were in charge of air quality and car emissions.

It voted narrowly to call for a new EU agency to enforce European law properly, said panel member Jens Gieseke, a German conservative. He stressed that “the thing that we invent has to work.”

The panel’s vice-chairwoman, Green lawmaker Karima Delli of France, backed such an agency in light of what she said was “consistent evidence of a responsibility vacuum.”",1,http://www.thenews.mx/world/european-parliament-panel-urges-improved-diesel-oversight/
197,Bush,George W.,spokesman,"Dana Milbank The Washington Post

I had a twinge of nostalgia watching George W. Bush campaign for his little brother in South Carolina on Monday night.

He was earthy. He recalled a previous visit to a South Carolina breakfast spot, where an animal-rights demonstrator dressed as a pig interrupted Bush’s meal by dumping a “steaming pile of manure” in the parking lot to block his exit.

Bush was corny. He spoke about how, in his presidential “afterlife,” he has become a tree farmer – “gives me a chance to practice my stump speech.”

He was also self-deprecating. “I’ve written two books, which has surprised a lot of people, particularly up east who didn’t think I could read, much less write,” he said.

But mostly, W’s cameo in the 2016 campaign served as a reminder that, not too long ago, conservative politics wasn’t so beastly. Bush, wading into the manure pile that is the 2016 Republican primary fight, was pleasant, civil and decent.

“If serving as president of the United States makes me a part of the so-called establishment, I proudly carry that label,” he said, responding to the “outsider” fury fueled by Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. “There seems to be a lot of name-calling going on, but I want to remind you what our good dad told me one time. Labels are for soup cans. The presidency is a serious job that requires sound judgment and good ideas.”

Without mentioning Trump’s name, Bush belittled the bombastic billionaire. “These are tough times, and I understand that Americans are angry and frustrated, but we do not need someone in the Oval Office who mirrors and inflames our anger and frustration,” Bush said.

Then he made his best case for Jeb: “Strength is not empty rhetoric. It is not bluster. It is not theatrics. Real strength, strength of purpose, comes from integrity and character. And in my experience, the strongest person usually isn’t the loudest one in the room.”

This isn’t to idealize Bush, who did his share to coarsen political discourse: impugning his opponents’ patriotism, exaggerating intelligence to lead the country to war, and building the false case that Iraq was behind the 9/11 attacks. But even Karl Rove’s underhandedness seems almost quaint compared with today’s brutality.

The party isn’t necessarily more conservative; Trump is less a conservative than a purveyor of insults, nationalism and conspiracy theories. Trump and Cruz are making the Republican Party into a rage-filled movement, as the dueling demagogues chew up opponents and each other. Some excerpts from Saturday night’s debate:

“They lied!”

“He lies.”

“This guy lied.”

“That’s a lot of lies.”

“Why do you lie?”

“You are the single biggest liar.”

“It’s a disgrace and an embarrassment.”

“Give me a break.”

“This country is dying.”

“I don’t know how he knows what I said on Univision because he doesn’t speak Spanish.”

“He is so weak on illegal immigration it’s laughable.”

“You want to talk about weakness? It’s weak to disparage women. It’s weak to denigrate the disabled.”

“He said he would take his pants off and moon everybody.”

“He called him pathological and compared him to a child molester.”

“Nasty guy.”

Trump took particular aim at the 43rd president, saying: “They lied. They said there were weapons of mass destruction. There were none, and they knew there were none.”

At a news conference on Monday – the same event where Trump repeatedly called Cruz “unstable” and said he would file a lawsuit to disqualify Cruz from the presidency because of his Canadian birth – Trump flirted with the “truther” accusation that Bush had advance knowledge of the 9/11 attacks. “They knew some bad things were going to happen,” Trump alleged. “They could have stopped it.”

Bush responded mildly to Trump’s provocations, recalling the child’s face he looked into when he first learned of the 9/11 attacks. The former president answered the Bible-bungling Trump with a passage on hypocrisy from Matthew about removing the speck from your brother’s eye when there is a log in your own.

“We need someone who can take a positive message across the entire country, someone who can inspire and appeal to people from all walks of life, not just one party or one class of people,” he said. Jeb “will rise above the petty name-calling.”

Maybe, or maybe W’s appearance will serve only to remind voters of Jeb’s inferior political skills. Either way, the 43rd president’s re-emergence offered Republicans a chance to reflect on how Bush’s party of conservatism so quickly became Trump’s party of rage.

198,Bush,George W.,audible,"MacArthur Genius Grant winner Lynsey Addario's relentless pursuit of complex truths drive this heart-pounding and inspirational memoir of a photographer's life.

Lynsey Addario is just finding her way as a young photographer when the events of September 11, 2001, change the world. One of the few photojournalists with experience in Afghanistan, she gets the call to return and cover the American invasion. She makes a decision she will often find herself making--not to stay home, not to lead a quiet or predictable life, but to set out across the world, face the chaos of crisis, and make a name for herself.

Addario finds in photography a way to travel with a purpose, and It's What I Do is the story of that singular calling--how it shapes and drives her life and how it changes the lives of others. She captures virtually every major theater of war of the twenty-first century and from it creates a historical document of truth on the international conflicts that have made and remade our world. She photographs the Afghan people before and after Taliban reign, the civilian casualties and misunderstood insurgents of the Iraq War, and the burned villages and the countless dead in Darfur. She exposes a culture of violence against women in the Congo and tells the riveting inside story of her headline-making kidnapping by pro-Qaddafi forces in the Libyan civil war.

As a woman photojournalist determined to be taken as seriously as her male peers, Addario fights her way into a boys' club of a profession. Rather than choose between her personal life and profession, Addario learns to strike a necessary balance. In the man who will become her husband, she finds at last a real love to complement her work, not take away from it, and as a new mother she gains an even more intensely personal understanding of the fragility of life.

Watching uprisings unfold and people fight to the death for their freedom, Addario understands she is documenting not only news but also the fate of society.

It's What I Do is more than just a snapshot of life on the front lines--it is witness to the human cost of war.",1,http://www.audible.com/pd/Bios-Memoirs/Its-What-I-Do-Audiobook/B00STXAX16
199,Bush,George W.,theintercept,"Koch money is helping finance advertisements across the state of Pennsylvania calling for judges to hand out tougher sentences, like this one:

It’s a story political journalists couldn’t resist. Reporters at the New York Times , Politico , Yahoo News , and other outlets have been rhapsodizing lately about how the ultra-conservative billionaire Koch brothers are “braving the spotlight” and joining forces with “tree-hugging liberals” to dedicate themselves to the cause of ending America’s over-incarceration crisis.

In Louisiana, Koch money is supporting the gubernatorial bid of Republican David Vitter, who is now campaigning explicitly against criminal justice reform with a new ad that warns that President Obama’s clemency project will release “dangerous thugs”:

Koch Industries has been widely hailed for donating to the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers and partnering with groups such as Families Against Mandatory Minimums. Earlier this year, the Kochs helped launch the Coalition for Public Safety, a bipartisan group focused on educational events on the issue of criminal justice that now provides funding to the Center for American Progress and other left-leaning groups.

“We have in the past and will in the future have criticism of the policy agenda of the Koch brother companies, but where we can find common ground on issues, we will go forward,” Neera Tanden, CAP’s president, told the New York Times.

But there is little evidence to show that the Koch political network has made criminal justice a litmus test for candidates or a priority for their vast political machinery.

The Koch political network does a great deal to publicly evaluate politicians on a narrow set of issues, including legislative score cards and pledges signed by candidates.

Those efforts are all still largely centered on climate change, tax and regulatory policies, with no mention of criminal justice reform.

Out of 38 federal lobbyists employed by Koch, only one is registered to work on criminal justice issues. Most work on projects important to Koch Industries’ bottom line, such as rolling back Environmental Protection Agency rules.

Koch’s interest in criminal justice reform was sparked not by the plight of overcrowded prisons or racial disparities in law enforcement, but by the company’s own environmental crimes. In 2000, Koch was indicted over claims that it had polluted huge amounts of benzene, a known carcinogen, from a Texas refinery and then attempted to cover up the crime. The indictment came on the heels of a series of state and federal probes that had forced the company to pay what was then the largest civil penalty for violations of environmental law for allowing hundreds of oil spills across six states.

By the time the benzene case went to trial, George W. Bush, with Koch support, had been elected president, and his Department of Justice reduced the indictment to seven counts, finally settling the case for only $20 million in what reporters called a “sweetheart deal.”

Koch Industries’ Senior Vice President Mark Holden, the public face of the Koch effort on criminal justice reform, did not respond to a request for comment.

One dynamic driving the over-incarceration problem, most experts agree, is the fear of “soft on crime”-style political attacks, made famous through the “Willie Horton” campaign commercial in 1988. Judges and politicians on both sides of the aisle have responded by looking “tough on crime” — by throwing more people in prison for longer.

Research by Emory Law School professors Joanna Shepherd and Michael Kang found that the more ads that are run attacking a judge for being “soft on crime,” the likelihood that the judge will rule in favor of criminal defendants decreases, leading to longer prison sentences regardless of the alleged crime.

Koch Industries provided $100,000 to a political committee airing an ad that claims that a Democratic judge in Pennsylvania failed to “keep our children safe” by allowing a “young girl to be placed in the custody of a convicted murderer.” The committee is also sponsoring ads that ask voters to support Republican judges because they “deliver on keeping violent criminals behind bars.”

The Republican State Leadership Committee, which is sponsoring the group behind the pro-Republican judicial ads, is funded this year by Koch Industries, General Electric, General Motors, Eli Lilly and other large corporations that have lobbied to minimize awards against them in class-action suits.

“What they’re all concerned about is money,” says Matthew Menendez, counsel for the Brennan Center’s Democracy Program, which tracks judicial elections. But class-action issues don’t sell well in 30-second campaign commercials, Menendez noted. So donors fund ads “that say judge so-and-so is soft on child molesters.”

“The collateral damage is to criminal justice reform,” Menendez said.

In the race for Louisiana governor this year, Sen. David Vitter, R-La., sponsored an advertisement last week that explicitly criticizes his opponent, Democrat John Bel Edwards, for supporting President Obama’s clemency effort to allow reduced sentences for some nonviolent drug offenders.

Charles Koch has applauded the initiative the ad criticizes. He’s even faulted the program for not acting quickly enough to release thousands from prison.

But that hasn’t stopped Koch Industries from donating to Vitter, who has championed environmental and tax policies in line with Koch Industries’ lobbying operation. Vitter, a strong opponent of the clemency project and other criminal justice reforms, has received thousands of dollars in donations from the Koch PAC, in addition to support from Koch Industries in his race for governor. The Super PAC supporting Vitter’s bid also received $25,000 from Koch Industries.

“Edwards calls for letting 5,500 Louisiana convicts go free,” the Vitter commercial claims. “Fifty-five hundred dangerous thugs,” the narrator grimly continues, as the camera pans over an African-American man wearing a do-rag.",1,https://theintercept.com/2015/11/03/soft-on-crime-ads/

“Do you realize now what you have done?”

So Vladimir Putin in his U.N. address summarized his indictment of a U.S. foreign policy that has produced a series of disasters in the Middle East that we did not need the Russian leader to describe for us.

Fourteen years after we invaded Afghanistan, Afghan troops are once again fighting Taliban forces for control of Kunduz. Only 10,000 U.S. troops still in that ravaged country prevent the Taliban’s triumphal return to power.

A dozen years after George W. Bush invaded Iraq, ISIS occupies its second city, Mosul, controls its largest province, Anbar, and holds Anbar’s capital, Ramadi, as Baghdad turns away from us â€” to Tehran.

The cost to Iraqis of their “liberation”? A hundred thousand dead, half a million widows and fatherless children, millions gone from the country and, still, unending war.

How has Libya fared since we “liberated” that land? A failed state, it is torn apart by a civil war between an Islamist “Libya Dawn” in Tripoli and a Tobruk regime backed by Egypt’s dictator.

Then there is Yemen. Since March, when Houthi rebels chased a Saudi sock puppet from power, Riyadh, backed by U.S. ordinance and intel, has been bombing that poorest of nations in the Arab world.

Five thousand are dead and 25,000 wounded since March. And as the 25 million Yemeni depend on imports for food, which have been largely cut off, what is happening is described by one U.N. official as a “humanitarian catastrophe.”

“Yemen after five months looks like Syria after five years,” said the international head of the Red Cross on his return.

On Monday, the wedding party of a Houthi fighter was struck by air-launched missiles with 130 guests dead. Did we help to produce that?

What does Putin see as the ideological root of these disasters?

“After the end of the Cold War, a single center of domination emerged in the world, and then those who found themselves at the top of the pyramid were tempted to think they were strong and exceptional, they knew better.”

Then, adopting policies “based on self-conceit and belief in one’s exceptionality and impunity,” this “single center of domination,” the United States, began to export “so-called democratic” revolutions.

How did it all turn out? Says Putin:

“An aggressive foreign interference has resulted in a brazen destruction of national institutions. … Instead of the triumph of democracy and progress, we got violence, poverty and social disaster.

Nobody cares a bit about human rights, including the right to life.”

Is Putin wrong in his depiction of what happened to the Middle East after we plunged in? Or does his summary of what American interventions have wrought echo the warnings made against them for years by American dissenters?

Putin concept of “state sovereignty” is this: “We are all different, and we should respect that. No one has to conform to a single development model that someone has once and for all recognized as the right one.”

The Soviet Union tried that way, said Putin, and failed. Now the Americans are trying the same thing, and they will reach the same end.

Unlike most U.N. speeches, Putin’s merits study. For he not only identifies the U.S. mindset that helped to produce the new world disorder, he identifies a primary cause of the emerging second Cold War.

To Putin, the West’s exploitation of its Cold War victory to move NATO onto Russia’s doorstep caused the visceral Russian recoil. The U.S.-backed coup in Ukraine that overthrew the elected pro-Russian government led straight to the violent reaction in the pro-Russian Donbas.

What Putin seems to be saying to us is this:

If America’s elites continue to assert their right to intervene in the internal affairs of nations, to make them conform to a U.S. ideal of what is a good society and legitimate government, then we are headed for endless conflict. And, one day, this will inevitably result in war, as more and more nations resist America’s moral imperialism.

Nations have a right to be themselves, Putin is saying.

They have the right to reflect in their institutions their own histories, beliefs, values and traditions, even if that results in what Americans regard as illiberal democracies or authoritarian capitalism or even Muslim theocracies.

There was a time, not so long ago, when Americans had no problem with this, when Americans accepted a diversity of regimes abroad. Indeed, a belief in nonintervention abroad was once the very cornerstone of American foreign policy.

Wednesday and Thursday, Putin’s forces in Syria bombed the camps of U.S.-backed rebels seeking to overthrow Assad. Putin is sending a signal: Russia is willing to ride the escalator up to a collision with the United States to prevent us and our Sunni Arab and Turkish allies from dumping over Assad, which could bring ISIS to power in Damascus.

Perhaps it is time to climb down off our ideological high horse and start respecting the vital interests of other sovereign nations, even as we protect and defend our own.

His mother said her son had a love of music, God and his family.

Man freed after killing Tulsa postal carrier

A man who gunned down a postal carrier in 2001 walked out of federal court a free man. U.S. Senior District Judge Terence Kern said the law does not allow him to keep Jason Weed under continued supervision without any evidence that he needs further psychiatric treatment or presents a continuing threat to public safety. Weed was found not guilty by reason of insanity in the 2001 killing of Robert W. Jenkins. He had remained under federal supervision for eight years after his release from a secure medical facility in 2005. Jenkins, 30, was shot to death Dec. 12, 2001, while delivering mail at a midtown apartment complex. In 2002, Weed agreed with prosecutors that he committed second-degree murder when he shot Jenkins. Federal Public Defender Julia O’Connell told the court that Weed suffered from a “brief psychotic episode” that led to an “extremely unfortunate and tragic series of events.” Weed has since gotten married and holds a steady job, O’Connell said, contending he does not require continued psychiatric treatment.",1,http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/waybackwhen/way-back-when-today-in-history/article_1236655f-1007-5462-9366-0c8fb15e0fa5.html
