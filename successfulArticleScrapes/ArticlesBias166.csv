0,Williams,Juan,thehill,"In the current world of racial politics, a prize-winning Dutch author lost a job translating a Black American poet, Amanda Gorman. Why? There was an uproar because the publisher had chosen a white translator.

In 2021 racial politics, the actor Daniel Kaluuya, who recently played 1960s Black radical Fred Hampton, introduced himself to a “Saturday Night Live” audience this way: “I know you’re hearing my accent and thinking ‘Oh no, he’s not Black — he’s British.’ I’m here to reassure you that I am Black. I’m Black. And I’m British.”

And in today’s world of racial niche media, a white TV host recently dismissed me from appearing on his show to discuss race relations by telling me I didn’t qualify because I was born in Panama.

ADVERTISEMENT

He thinks I’m not Black enough. Seriously.

The white host of the PBS-affiliated show, “This is America & the World,” flatly said despite my black skin — and award-winning books on race relations — my place of birth made me a bad fit for a discussion on the racial unrest following the murder of George Floyd.

I’m a big boy. To live as a Black man in America for the last 63 years requires tough skin.

I already have to deal with the fact that a lot of people can’t find the right box for a black Democrat who works for Fox News.

But rejecting me over where I was born is a new one.

I wouldn’t have known why the invitation was revoked if the host had not been so confident in his racial calculation that he sent me a note to share his thinking.

He opened a window on the kind of thinking once used to keep Blacks, women, Latinos, Asians — basically anyone but white men — out of public debates.

For most of American history, no one blinked at the absence of those voices in dialogue about economics, foreign policy, scientific innovation. It was simply assumed that they lacked expertise and their point of view was marginal.

But as a Black American author of several best-selling books on civil rights history, it is new ground for me to be segregated out of a discussion about race relations.

What if I was white? In the TV host’s twisted sense of racial identity, are all white people also disqualified from a discussion about race?

If that’s the case, why was he hosting a show on race relations?

In any case, he is right that I was born in Panama.

But there’s more to the story.

I have lived in the United States since age four in Black skin.

I grew up in a low-income, Black neighborhood in Brooklyn.

In fact, according to an Ancestry.com survey I did a few years back, I am not, as he said his research determined, “100 percent Panamanian.”



I’m actually 50 percent African, 30 percent Indian and a 20 percent hodgepodge of Irish, Scottish and Norwegian genes.



There’s a lot of mixing in there — no doubt due to slavery and rape of Black women by slave holders over the centuries. But in a nation with a deep history of racial division, I’m definitely a Black man.

Genetically speaking, I’m more closely related to Vice President Harris — her father is from Jamaica and her mother from India — than I am to former Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega.

As a matter of family history, my dad is Black. He was born in Jamaica. My mom was born in Panama to a father from India. Her mother, a Black woman of African descent, was born in Grenada.

All this personal history is a very common story for descendants of the Black diaspora. Our ancestors were taken from Africa by the millions in the transatlantic slave trade and brought to the Caribbean, Latin America and the United States.

But not only did the PBS host ignore my personal background, he was also blind to my professional background.

As an author and journalist at The Washington Post, NPR and Fox News, I’ve covered race relations in America for more than 40 years.

My book on the history of the civil rights movement, “Eyes on the Prize,” won awards. My biography of the first black Supreme Court Justice, “Thurgood Marshall: American Revolutionary,” was named one of the best biographies of all time in 2018.

My most recent book, ""What the Hell Do You Have to Lose?,” was an indictment of Trump’s abysmal civil rights record and the damage he did by reviving white supremacist politics.

I have been fired by white liberals.

Far-left Black thinkers point to my work at Fox and mistakenly label me a Black conservative.

Meanwhile, white conservatives have dismissed me as a Black liberal.

Former President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE has attacked me as “always nasty and wrong.”

My purpose in recounting these attempts at putting me in racial and ideological categories is to shine a light on current walls impeding honest debate about race in America.



There is now an idea that only pre-approved Black, Latino and white people are allowed to speak about race.



That’s dangerous.



There is no way to judge someone’s ideas and heart unless you hear them out.



The sin here is arrogance. It is an unspoken bias that causes too many gatekeepers in American media, business and academia to put people in boxes so they can dismiss or ignore their point of view.



It needs to be called out. So I’m calling out. Let’s all try to do better.

1,Williams,Juan,thehill,"William F. Buckley once interviewed me. And I covered President Reagan for The Washington Post.

Now imagine how those conservative heroes might react to the latest news about today’s Republican leaders.

First, the Trump 2020 campaign ripped off its small donors last year by nudging them into authorizing repeat donations from their credit cards, according to The New York Times.

Then the main Republican House campaign group followed up by brazenly threatening any small donor who wanted to just make a one-time donation.

“If you UNCHECK this box [for recurring donations], we will have to tell Trump you’re a DEFECTOR & sided with the Dems,” says the National Republican Congressional Committee’s donation page on WinRed, the key platform for conservative online fundraising.

Also last week, conservatives who thought they were sending money to support Second Amendment gun rights found out they, too, had been ripped off.

According to depositions made public at a National Rifle Association (NRA) bankruptcy hearing last week, NRA President Wayne LaPierre hid on a 108-foot yacht after school children died in mass shootings. The boat’s owner is tied to a fundraising firm paid $11.5 million by the NRA in 2019.

LaPierre said he thought to himself: “Thank God I’m safe, nobody can get me here.”

What hypocrisy for a man who raised hundreds of millions by telling conservatives to buy lots of guns to be safe. Despite an endless gun supply, he fled to sea for safety.

He previously admitted to using his donors’ money to buy expensive suits. He is also alleged to have given no-show contracts to his pals and written a $17 million post-employment contract for himself.

At this point, Buckley and Reagan must realize their conservative movement has become a circus of grifters and con men.

But don’t take my word on their disgust.

Former Speaker John Boehner John Andrew BoehnerGOP struggles to rein in nativism Former GOP lawmaker calls idea of 'America First' caucus 'racism in a jar' The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Facebook - All US adults can get vaccine; decision Friday on J&J vax MORE (R-Ohio) agrees.

The best known Republicans on Capitol Hill today, Boehner John Andrew BoehnerGOP struggles to rein in nativism Former GOP lawmaker calls idea of 'America First' caucus 'racism in a jar' The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Facebook - All US adults can get vaccine; decision Friday on J&J vax MORE writes in a new book, are not conservatives. Instead, the front rank of the party is filled by loudmouths willing to voice the wildest conspiracy theories.

These pretend conservatives rake in money by being stars in what Boehner calls “Looneyville,” the echo chamber of right-wing radio hosts and even further right websites.

In “On the House: A Washington Memoir,” Boehner said the conservative heritage of the Republican Party has been sunk by the power of “fawning right-wing media and outrage-driven fundraising.”

As for actually working to pass legislation in the tradition of Reagan, today’s Republicans dismiss such efforts. They get more attention by slamming anyone on their side of the aisle trying to make deals with Democrats as a “traitor,” Boehner said.

“Reagan used to say something to the effect that if I get 80 or 90 percent of what I want, that’s a win. These guys [the ‘Tea Party’ vintage Republicans who came to Congress after the 2010 midterm elections] ... didn’t really want legislative victories. They wanted wedge issues and conspiracies and crusades,” Boehner writes.

The former Speaker’s description of the Tea Party class of 2010 is even more true of Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene Marjorie Taylor GreeneRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene says she's meeting with Trump 'soon' in Florida QAnon site shutters after reports identifying developer Republicans head to runoff in GA-14 MORE (R-Ga.) and Lauren Boebert Lauren BoebertHouse Republicans ask Pelosi to reschedule Biden's address to Congress Missouri Republicans eying Senate bids to hold fundraisers at Mar-a-Lago Overnight Health: NIH reverses Trump's ban on fetal tissue research | Biden investing .7B to fight virus variants | CDC panel to meet again Friday on J&J MORE (R-Colo.), the best-known of what might be called the Trump/QAnon class of 2020.

Boehner’s conclusion is that Republicans in Congress are now in the grips of “the crazy caucus,” a group he defines as encompassing “garden-variety whack jobs to insurrectionists.”

Their lack of conservative principles, Boehner explains, led to the acceptance of Trump’s endless conspiracy theories, beginning with the lie that former President Obama was not born in the United States.

And that led to acceptance of the “Big Lie” about the 2020 election being stolen from Trump and, incredibly, Trump’s supporters rioting at the Capitol.

Trump “incited that bloody insurrection for nothing more than selfish reasons, perpetuated by the bullshit he’d been shoveling since he lost a fair election,” Boehner explained.

The riot should have been “a wake-up call for a return to Republican sanity,” Boehner warns. He wants conservatives to revolt and take control of the GOP away from self-promoters who stop both parties from getting anything done in Congress.

The Biden White House has concluded — correctly, I believe — that there is no longer anything to be gained from trying to reason and negotiate with what remains of conservative Republicans.

The right-wing media that Boehner describes as controlling the GOP give Republicans no incentive to work with Biden and applauds them every time they obstruct him.

So why bother wasting time and energy and political capital trying to reason with them when Biden already knows the outcome?

Full stop.

So Biden is going it alone on the business of governing from COVID-19 relief to infrastructure to voting rights.

Back in February, I wrote in this column that America needs two healthy political parties:

“In fact, it pains me to see the cancerous gang of grifters, white supremacists and conspiracy-theory mad hatters who are killing the party of conservative principles.”

The grifters will always find suckers to give them money.

But when it comes to the GOP as a legitimate conservative, governing party, well, the party’s over.

2,Williams,Juan,thehill,"America’s top Black business leaders took out a full-page advertisement in the New York Times last week calling on white corporate leaders to take a stand against new Georgia election laws that “make it harder for Black voters, in particular, to exercise their right to vote.”

The ad is a stunner — a big switch from the day when Michael Jordan, the basketball star and now billionaire businessman, was quoted as saying “Republicans buy sneakers, too.”

That kind of thinking led generations of Black business leaders to say nothing about racist politics.

To be a Black executive trying to move up in the white-male-dominated ranks of American corporations is a tough enough road without the risk of being privately labeled as a racial troublemaker. High earners among Black athletes and entertainers face similar challenges.

If you have any doubt, keep in mind that Colin Kaepernick recently lost his football career for kneeling to protest police brutality against Black people.

That’s why Black business leaders usually keep their distance from activists being put in handcuffs for protesting racist politics.

So to see today’s Black business leaders, including people who have run American Express, Xerox and Merck, willing to stand with a Black woman in handcuffs is a game-changer.

That woman is Georgia state Rep. Park Cannon (D).

She kept knocking on Gov. Brian Kemp Brian KempTrump: GOP candidates need to embrace 'make America great' agenda if they want to win Rick Scott warns 'woke corporate leaders' of 'massive backlash' 'Black Panther' director condemns Georgia voting law but says sequel will film in state MORE’s (R) door as he privately signed the voter suppression law surrounded by a group of all-white, all-male Republicans. Two policemen arrested her and put her in a squad car.

Until now, Republicans in Georgia and copycat Republicans in 42 other state legislatures around the nation have been counting on protests from Cannon and others to quickly blow over.

They are betting there is not enough staying power among opponents to deny Republican majorities in state legislatures the power to overrule future elections in which Democrats get the most votes.

But Black corporate leaders have countered that move by putting white corporate leaders on the spot to do something.

Their letter has the same power found in Dr. Martin Luther King’s “Letter from Birmingham Jail.” King called out white ministers for dismissing his protests as “unwise and untimely.”

King wrote that no protest is ever “‘well timed’…according to the timetable of those who have not suffered unduly from the disease of segregation…‘Wait’ has almost always meant ‘Never.’”

In 2021, Black corporate leaders are finally finding their ‘King’ voice.

“We’re calling on corporate America to publicly oppose any discriminatory legislation and all measures designed to limit Americans’ ability to vote,” said Ken Chenault, the former American Express executive who is one of the leaders behind the open letter.

“American companies need to take a stand,” he told Reuters.

Ed Bastian, a white man and CEO of Delta Airlines, based in Georgia, is hearing the message:

“The entire rationale for this [Georgia] bill was based on a lie: that there was widespread voter fraud in Georgia in the 2020 elections,” he wrote in a statement. “This is simply not true. Unfortunately, that excuse is being used in states across the nation that are attempting to pass similar legislation to restrict voting rights.”

The challenge to white corporate leaders has added weight because some have recently backed out of a pledge to withhold political donations from congressional Republicans who voted against certifying the results of the November presidential election.

As The Hill’s Alex Gangitano reported last week, “recent financial disclosures show some are now making direct contributions to the House and Senate GOP campaign arms that dole out funds to those same lawmakers.”

That’s why Republicans in state legislatures figured they could count on big companies to quickly forget their effort to undermine democratic elections.

So, when will Georgia’s business leaders announce they are withholding campaign contributions to Kemp and every Republican member of the state legislature who voted to end free elections in Georgia?

ADVERTISEMENT

When will Coca Cola, Home Depot and UPS, firms also based in Georgia, force Georgia Republicans to pay a price in loss of political donations?

“Why is it that corporations that could speak so powerfully and unequivocally in opposition to discrimination against the L.G.B.T.Q. community and immigrants are not speaking as clearly about the disenfranchisement of Black people?” Sherilyn Ifill, president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, told the New York Times last week. “This is a race issue.”

Some are doing the right thing. Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred announced on Friday that the 2021 All-Star Game will no longer take place in Atlanta, as previously scheduled.

“Major League Baseball fundamentally supports voting rights for all Americans and opposes restrictions to the ballot box,” Manfred said.

Now how about some strong action from the owners of professional sports teams based in Atlanta: the Atlanta Braves, Atlanta Falcons and Atlanta Hawks, among others?

Is the new Georgia Jim Crow law consistent with their team's values? If not, what are they going to do about it?

Unless the business community puts its money where its mouth is and punishes Georgia Republicans, other states will accurately conclude that there is no consequence for stripping poor and minority voters of their rights.

This is an outrage that cannot stand.

Now she says it was just a joke.

Well then, who is going to tell Republicans?

Last week, lawyers for Sidney Powell, a leading voice claiming November's election was stolen from former President Trump, said ""reasonable people would not accept such statements as fact.""

But polls show most Republicans didn't get the memo - they still think the election was stolen.

In an 'Alice In Wonderland' moment of truth falling through a rabbit hole into a twisted fantasy, Republican politicians now claim that because so many Republicans did take Powell's joke seriously, they need to act to restore confidence in elections.

To get back to reality, there is no evidence of any election fraud.

But nonsense about restoring trust among people who fell for a joke is being cited in eight states where Republicans hold the majority in legislatures and are pushing new laws to give them control of vote counting.

In the real world, that is called a brazen, partisan power grab to give the GOP the edge in every future election.

The same inane claim to be fixing elections to reassure Republican voters is also being used in 43 states where Republican politicians are acting to cut down on absentee and early voting, and to limit hours for voting on Election Day itself, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.

Those efforts are based on what Powell's lawyers now dismiss as a joke. And her joke is based on Trump continuing to spout the ""Big Lie"" that he didn't lose the presidential election - it was stolen as a result of ""large scale election fraud,"" after he won by ""historic numbers.""

The voter suppression efforts in these state legislatures is ""fueled by the Big Lie of widespread voter fraud and often discriminatory in design,"" according to the Brennan Center. The attempts ""have the potential to dramatically reduce voting access, especially for Black and brown voters.""

In Georgia, the Republican governor signed a bill last week to allow the Republican majority in the legislature to take control of local election boards. It even makes it illegal for a stranger to hand a bottle of water to a person waiting in line to vote.

This sad joke can be heard echoing in Congress, too.

In the Senate, Republicans are fighting to stop a new bill from Democrats that would provide national protection for mail-in voting, early voting and same-day voter registration. The bill would also introduce automatic voter registration across the country.

Sen. Roy Blunt (R- Mo.) told the Senate Rules Committee that the proposals to protect voting rights will allow ""chaos to reign in the next election and voters will have less confidence than they currently do.""

Todd Rokita, Indiana's attorney general, who supported a request for the Supreme Court to throw out President Biden's victory, told the Senate panel last week that Democrats want to ""open our elections up to increased voter fraud"" that will lead to more distrust in election results.

Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.) told Rokita that doubts about the election result are rooted in a ""deliberate and sustained misinformation campaign led by a vain former president unwilling to accept his own defeat.""

In the aftermath of the election, Trump's lawyers lost more than 50 court cases with their false claims of fraud. Governors, secretaries of state and election officials all confirmed that Trump lost fair and square.

An Economist/YouGov poll released last week found 58 percent of Americans recognizing that Biden was the legitimate victor in the election.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) once agreed. Before the Jan. 6 mob attack on the Capitol, he said it was clear that Biden had won a fair election.

""The voters, the courts, and the states have all spoken,"" McConnell said. ""If this election were overturned by mere allegations from the losing side, our democracy would enter a death spiral.""

But now McConnell is accusing Democrats of a ""partisan power grab"" with their efforts to preempt Republican state legislatures intent on rolling back voting rights.

He may be leaping down the rabbit hole to be with other Republicans. The Economist poll indicated that 80 percent of Republican voters do not accept that Biden won legitimately.

Again, there is no evidence of fraud.

""This is not a usual political argument. This goes to the core of our democracy,"" Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in dramatic testimony at a Senate hearing last week.

""Shame,"" Schumer added. ""I would like to ask my Republican colleagues: Why are you so afraid of democracy? Why instead of trying to win voters over that you lost in the last election, are you trying to prevent them from voting?""

Trump's lie and Powell's joke took a violent turn on Jan. 6. Trump fired up his supporters by telling them ""we will stop the steal,"" before a mob attacked the Capitol to try to stop Congress from certifying Biden as the winner. People died.

Again, Republicans argue they are taking these steps to protect the integrity of elections without mentioning that those Republicans believe a twisted, baseless message from Trump and his allies, including Powell.

Now Powell is saying in court that ""reasonable people"" knew it was not true.

That's the real election fraud.

Now it is President Biden Joe BidenObama, Clinton reflect on Mondale's legacy Biden, Harris commend Mondale in paving the way for female VP Mondale in last message to staff: 'Joe in the White House certainly helps' MORE’s turn on the hot seat.

And if the GOP picks up just five House seats and one Senate seat, Biden loses all control of Congress.

Biden knows the history because he witnessed the Clinton and Obama midterm collapses as a senator and vice president, respectively.

Here is the wisdom he learned.

He can’t play Charlie Brown and let the GOP play Lucy.

For those of you unfamiliar with the comic strip, every time Charlie Brown trusted Lucy to hold the football for him so he could kick it, she yanked it away. He was left to look like a fool while falling flat on his back.

With that in mind, Biden has figured out that it is a waste of time to act as if Republicans in Congress are serious about holding the ball. In other words, they aren’t sincere about working with him on the COVID relief deal or anything else.

His experience tells him to assume the Republicans’ only goal is to make him look like a fool before voters go to the polls in the midterms.

That’s what happened with Clinton’s effort to work with Republicans on a plan to cut the deficit and grow the economy. For all his effort to work with the GOP, he got zero Republican votes in the House and Senate on his 1993 budget reconciliation plan.

Biden saw the sequel to this horror movie as vice president.

This time, Obama played Charlie Brown to the GOP’s Lucy on the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.

Obama negotiated with the Republicans. To please them, he cut the size of the bailout.

What did he get in return? Zero. They again yanked away the football.

Not a single Republican in the House voted for the Obama plan. Only three Republicans backed it in the Senate.

History tells us that both the Clinton and Obama plans succeeded in stimulating the economy and saving jobs.

History also tells us that Republicans succeeded in punishing Clinton and Obama by shouting about “big government” and “tax-and-spend liberals.” Clinton and Obama lost big in the next midterms.

And in Obama’s case, even as the economy came back to life, the Republicans shamelessly lashed out at him for the slow pace of the recovery — even though they had refused to spend the money for a faster rebound.

Now Biden has passed an economic stimulus plan without GOP support in the Senate or the House. Once again, the economy looks ready to take off.

And once again, Republicans are looking to punish the Democratic president in the midterms.

But there are some differences in this new version of the old story.

The biggest point of contrast is the overwhelming public support for the Biden plan.

Biden’s plan has support from 70 percent of Americans, including 41 percent of Republicans, according to a recent Pew Research Center poll.

Biden’s presidential approval rating last week was 54 percent, according to the polling average from data site fivethirtyeight.

Biden won that high level of public support despite the lack of help from congressional Republicans.

Part of the problem for the GOP is they’ve been busy with former President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE’s false claim that the last election was stolen.

Another problem for Republicans is that their accusation that Biden’s plan is too expensive is not gaining traction. That argument lacks weight after the GOP’s recent support for a Trump tax cut that drove up the deficit.

Meanwhile, the Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable, representing the chief executives of the nation’s biggest companies, joined the public in backing the Biden plan.

The GOP is also losing public trust. A recent Morning Consult poll found registered voters trust Democrats more than Republicans to handle the economy (45 percent to 39 percent), as well as to produce jobs (46 percent to 37 percent). Republicans used to dominate on those issues.

So, looking ahead to the midterms, Republicans are quietly hoping the Biden plan fails. But they have also moved on to trying to pin blame on Biden for the broken immigration system.

They are counting on voters to forget surges of immigrants at the border while Trump was president. They don’t mention that Trump made the situation worse by separating children from their parents. They skip over Trump’s failure to pass comprehensive immigration reform while he controlled the House and Senate.

They speak of Trump’s much-trumpeted wall on the southern border as if it was a solution and Mexico paid for it.

The biggest change from the midterm doom that hit Clinton and Obama is that Biden is selling the public on the benefits of his COVID relief bill. From the $1400 checks to the expansion of the child tax credit, there is a lot of concrete help for Americans coming.

Just over halfway through his first 100 days, Biden is showing that he has no interest in a three-peat of the horror show that sank Clinton and Obama in their first midterms.

He is flipping the script on the Republicans.

Since Biden’s inauguration, the COVID-19 infection rate has been cut by well over half.

ADVERTISEMENT

And last week congressional Democrats passed Biden’s popular COVID-19 relief bill. The economy is rebounding, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up about 19 percent since Election Day.

Poor Trump. All he can do is put out a whiny statement.

“I hope everyone remembers when they’re getting the COVID-19 (often referred to as the China Virus) Vaccine, that if I wasn’t President, you would be getting that beautiful ‘shot’ for 5 years, at best, and probably wouldn’t be getting it at all. I hope everyone remembers!”

We remember the shortage of vaccine when he left office.

We remember there was no plan for getting Americans vaccinated.

And who can forget that Trump lied from the start about the severity of the virus and later promoted a quack, phony cure?

The bottom line is that he produced the greatest failure of presidential leadership in history.

In January, Trump’s last month in the White House, the nation had the highest number of COVID-19 deaths since the pandemic began. Shortly after he left office, the virus death toll topped 500,000.

With Biden in the White House, the nation has turned that around in 50 days.

COVID-19 infection rates and deaths are sharply down while the number of people getting shots has more than doubled to over 2 million a day.

Biden promised 100 million vaccinations in his first 100 days in office. He is on track to do it.

And now Biden says there will be enough vaccine for all Americans by the end of May.

Trump and his aides are reduced to complaining that Biden’s team is “using our playbook every step of the way.” They correctly note that Trump got vaccine production started. But people outside of politics say there is no comparing the administrations.

“Corporate, state and federal officials agree Mr. Biden’s White House has been more active than his predecessor’s in trying to build up the nation’s vaccine stock,” The New York Times reported last week.

The American public agrees.

Biden’s approval rate was 60 percent last week in both a CBS poll and a Morning Consult-Politico poll.

Trump left office in January with a 34 percent approval rating, according to Gallup. He is the only president who never reached a 50 percent approval rating in a Gallup poll.

Biden’s COVID-19 aid bill is also a winner with public opinion.

Despite not a single Republican in Congress supporting the bill, the Biden coronavirus relief package won approval from both Republican and Democratic voters.

In the Morning Consult poll, 75 percent of the nation supported Biden’s $1.9 trillion package. Even 59 percent of Republicans supported the bill, the poll found.

Just as importantly, Americans are happy with Biden’s response to the pandemic, with more than 60 percent approving, according to polling by NPR, CBS and Pew Research.

Oh, and this has to burn Trump:

In the NPR poll, Biden’s handling of the virus got the approval of 22 percent of people who say they voted for Trump. Overall, about one-third of Republicans approved.

Biden’s positive poll ratings on handling the virus are almost the exact opposite of Trump’s. In October, a month before the election, 59 percent of Americans disapproved of how Trump was dealing with it, according to a Reuters poll.

Trump’s own pollster said the negative public reaction to Trump’s approach to the virus cost him the November election.

Tony Fabrizio, his top pollster, said the coronavirus was the top issue in the presidential contest. A majority of voters who ranked the virus as the top issue disapproved of how Trump handled the crisis. Fabrizio found those voters favored Biden by a margin close to 3 to 1.

It is a rule of politics that in any crisis there is a rally-around-the-leader surge in public support. But Trump’s response to the COVID-19 crisis was so bad that his approval numbers went down.

ADVERTISEMENT

A year ago, Trump gave an Oval office speech to the nation in which he said “the risk is very, very low” that the virus was a threat to kill a large number of Americans.

Now, Trump insists on credit for starting vaccine production. But he has nothing more to contribute about dealing with the fallout from the pandemic.

At the moment, most of his statements are attacks on Republicans he views as not loyal to him.

In one statement, he ridiculed Republican political strategist Karl Rove Karl Christian RoveThe Memo: Trump battles to stay relevant House Republicans who backed Trump impeachment warn Democrats on Iowa election challenge GOP hammers Democrats over Iowa Democrat's election challenge MORE as a man who “has been losing for years, except for himself.”

In another statement, Trump trashed the conservative Wall Street Journal editorial page. He said the Journal’s editorial support for moderate Republicans had “so badly hurt the Republican Party,” adding, “Fortunately, nobody cares much about The Wall Street Journal editorial anymore.”

In yet another statement, Trump asked his supporters to send their political donations to his political action committee and not to the Republican National Committee.

Trump will get his wish to be remembered. He will be remembered for his jealous rage.

10,Williams,Juan,thehill,"Talking about race is difficult.

Talking about racial violence is more difficult.

So, let’s not talk about the racial violence that took place Jan. 6 at the Capitol.

ADVERTISEMENT

Yes, I know the rampaging crowd was just about all-white. And, yes, the huge Confederate flag carried among the Trump supporters is a defining image of the insurrection.

But Senate Republicans don’t want to talk about race and the Capitol riot that left five people dead, including a policeman.

Last week they urged Christopher Wray, the FBI director, to look away. They prefer the FBI to be focused on Black Lives Matter and left-wing anarchist protests from last summer.

Finally, Sen. Richard Durbin Dick DurbinWhite House defends 'aspirational' goal of 62,500 refugees Biden on refugee cap: 'We couldn't do two things at once' For a win on climate, let's put our best player in the game MORE (D-Ill.), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, had enough:

“Let’s stop pretending that the threat of antifa is equal to the white supremacist threat,” he said.

Without dwelling on the death and destruction that happened at the Capitol, Durbin mentioned episodes of white supremacist violence over recent years that killed black people at a church in South Carolina, Hispanics in Texas and Jews at a synagogue in Pennsylvania.

Durbin could have saved his breath.

Senate Republicans kept pushing the fiction that last summer’s racial justice protests were equal to the terror threat coming from white supremacists, even though several studies have shown that rallies and marches were overwhelmingly peaceful.

The summer protests were 93 percent peaceful, according to the US. Crisis Monitor, which tracks violent demonstrations.

But President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE played on fear of big city, black violence to fuel fear and get out his vote.

And now Senate Republicans continue to promote that lie.

Sen. Ron Johnson Ronald (Ron) Harold Johnson15 Senate Republicans pledge to oppose lifting earmark ban 'Real Housewives of the GOP' — Wannabe reality show narcissists commandeer the party Republicans fret over divisive candidates MORE (R-Wis.) has gone as far as to support conspiracy theories about the attack on the Capitol, reading from an online story in a conservative media outlet that referred to “agents provocateurs” and described the Trump supporters as “jovial, friendly” people.

At Senate hearings last week, the FBI’s Wray tried to duck the crossfire between Republicans and Democrats over the growing violence of white racists.

He carefully said the FBI’s business is halting the rise in all domestic terrorism.

But Wray did flatly note that most of the domestic terrorism is the result of “racially motivated violent extremism, specifically of the sort that advocates for the superiority of the white race.”

Oh, well that gave it away.

Also, Wray noted that arrests of white supremacists had almost tripled in the last three years.

That fit with testimony he gave last September that “racially motivated violent extremism” is the major source of domestic terrorism and “people subscribing to some kind of white supremacist-type ideology is certainly the biggest chunk of that.”

His assessment also fit with an October 2020 Homeland Security memo, written by President Trump’s acting secretary, Chad WolfChad WolfIntel heads to resume worldwide threats hearing scrapped under Trump Sunday shows preview: Democrats eye passage of infrastructure bill; health experts warn of fourth coronavirus wave Russia suspected of massive State Department email hack: report MORE.

That memo called attention to the rise of “white supremacist violent extremists who have been exceptionally lethal in their abhorrent, targeted attacks in recent years.”

But Senate Republicans don’t want to hear it.

“The party has been swiftly repositioned as an instrument of white grievance,” Michael Gerson, a conservative, wrote in a Washington Post column last week.

“Trumpism is defined by the belief that real Americans are beset by internal threats from migrants, Muslims, multiculturalists, Black Lives Matter activists, antifa militants and various thugs, gangbangers and whiners,” Gerson added.

A different version of the same racial fight took shape in the House last week as Democrats passed a police reform bill named for George Floyd, the black man who was killed when a white Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck for nearly nine minutes.

The only Republican to vote for the bill said it was a mistake and he “accidentally pressed the wrong voting button.”

Why can’t Republicans support a police reform bill — which bans choke holds, no-knock warrants and requires police to use body cameras?

ADVERTISEMENT

Could it be that it is seen as helping minorities?

Maybe it is because the vote was rushed on Wednesday night. Capitol Police warned that Thursday was targeted for a potential repeat of the January violence by the same far-right, conspiracy crowd that is mostly white.

Fortunately, there was no repeat as fencing remains around the Capitol and more than 5,000 National Guard remain on duty. Last week, it was decided that 2,200 of them will stay until May.

But inside the fencing, the Republicans in the House and Senate continue to promote the falsehood that the real domestic terror threat are minorities in big cities, far-leftists and anarchists.

Americans are not buying it. They are becoming more supportive of the racial justice protests.

As columnist Radley Balko wrote in the Washington Post last month:

“Between 2016 and 2020, the percentage of Americans who think police are more likely to use excessive force against Black people jumped nearly 25 percentage points.”

If Black Lives and Blue Lives truly mattered to Republicans on Capitol Hill, they would join with Democrats in denouncing pro-Trump white nationalists in the dark corners of the internet plotting to bring their deranged fantasies to life.

Talk about hypocrisy. Less than a month ago McConnell said Trump was “practically and morally responsible for provoking” the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol.

Graham now says Trump is going to “dominate the party for years to come…There is no way we can achieve our goals without Trump.”

Please note that Graham once voted to impeach then-President Clinton for lying about sex. But today he is willing to look away from a Republican president who fomented a violent insurrection that left five people dead.

And the hypocrisy keeps coming. ‘Law-and-order’ Republicans in Congress accused Democrats of disrespecting the police during protests for racial justice in the summer of 2020. The marches took place after several black people died at the hands of police.

Somehow those police-loving Republicans did not chant “Blue Lives Matter,” after Trump supporters left 15 police officers hospitalized and about 150 injured.

One Capitol Police officer and one District of Columbia police officer subsequently died by suicide. Another Capitol Police officer, Brian Sicknick, died after trying to ward off rioters, though the exact circumstances of his death remain unclear.

The fact is that the rioters were Trump supporters.

How do I know that?

“Sixty-one percent of Trump supporters…[and] 38 percent of Republicans, believe that Democrats are mostly bad people whose ideas would destroy the country,” William A. Galston, citing polling by the Ethics and Public Policy Center, wrote last week in the Wall Street Journal.

Where is the GOP plan?

Do Republicans have a great idea for improving healthcare?

Trump never came up with a better plan than ObamaCare. He had no idea for dealing with COVID other than to say a year ago that it would be over before Easter 2020. That was more than 400,000 deaths ago.

Did Trump have a better plan for helping hungry children get a meal? President Biden and congressional Democrats have plans to put money into feeding children and raising the minimum wage to bring more families out of poverty.

We can debate Biden’s ideas. But where are the GOP ideas and legislative plans?

Trump did deliver on more conservative judges. That was a successful political power play.

He did cut taxes in favor of the wealthy and corporations, driving the deficit to a new high. At best that is a highly debatable, divisive policy in a nation of widening income inequality.

The bottom line is that anyone looking for good ideas from Trump and his supporters in Congress is met with a void and loud silence.

Instead of offering better ideas to solve the nation’s problems, Trump created a model for Republicans in Congress by rallying his supporters with promises to obstruct “socialist” Democrats.

And even now that Trump is gone, that approach retains its power.

The absence of ideas from Republicans is evidence of a major American party caught in the grip of extremists.

The problem is that Trump addled much of the GOP base with conspiracy theories and bullying rhetoric to the point where the party can’t move past him and join the debate over ideas necessary to contribute to a productive national dialogue.

This is a concern for all Americans. Our country needs two healthy political parties providing competition and balance to one another so the voters can make an informed choice.

How do I know that?

""Sixty-one percent of Trump supporters...[and] 38 percent of Republicans, believe that Democrats are mostly bad people whose ideas would destroy the country,"" William A. Galston, citing polling by the Ethics and Public Policy Center, wrote last week in the Wall Street Journal.

If Democrats have such bad ideas, what are the good ideas held by former President Trump and his supporters?

Do they have a great idea for getting the economy out of the slowdown caused by the pandemic?

Most Americans, 68 percent according to Quinnipiac University polling, think President Biden's economic stimulus plan is the right way to go. Where is the GOP plan?

Do Republicans have a great idea for improving healthcare?

Trump never came up with a better plan than ObamaCare. He had no idea for dealing with COVID other than to say a year ago that it would be over before Easter 2020. That was more than 400,000 deaths ago.

Did Trump have a better plan for helping hungry children get a meal? President Biden and congressional Democrats have plans to put money into feeding children and raising the minimum wage to bring more families out of poverty.

We can debate Biden's ideas. But where are the GOP ideas and legislative plans?

Trump did deliver on more conservative judges. That was a successful political power play.

He did cut taxes in favor of the wealthy and corporations, driving the deficit to a new high. At best that is a highly debatable, divisive policy in a nation of widening income inequality.

The bottom line is that anyone looking for good ideas from Trump and his supporters in Congress is met with a void and loud silence.

Instead of offering better ideas to solve the nation's problems, Trump created a model for Republicans in Congress by rallying his supporters with promises to obstruct ""socialist"" Democrats.

And even now that Trump is gone, that approach retains its power.

""I don't think many Republicans are going to be for very many of the things that are coming out of this administration,"" Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), the GOP leader in the Senate, said last week.

And even now, as Trump and McConnell openly battle over control of the party's future, both sides agree the best strategy leading up to the 2022 elections is to unify Republican voters by attacking all ideas coming from Democrats or Biden.

Now she's fighting to keep the Republican Party alive.

I'm no Republican. But this time I've got her back.

You see, every American has a stake in preventing a major political party from being derailed by former President Trump's supporters who prefer lies and conspiracy theories over reality.

Everyone saw a dying party sliding off the rails last week when Republican senators ignored all facts to vote against convicting Trump on charges of inciting the riot at the Capitol.

Democrats need the balance that comes from facing an honest, credible party based on conservative principles.

That's why I can't stand on the sidelines and celebrate the civil war among Republicans.

This is a fight for everyone invested in the nation's greatest prize - political stability based on open debate of the facts and equality under the law.

In the words of Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), what is happening inside the GOP is a fight between ""conservatives"" and ""kooks.""

To put a finer point on it, this is a battle between reality and delusion.

On one side are Cheney, Romney, and a band of real Republicans, such as Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska).

Murkowski says she wants no part of the party of Trump - ""I'm looking for the Republican Party.""

Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), also in flight from the madhouse, says the idea of the GOP as a ""cult of personality"" built around Trump is simply not ""a good durable model for the future.""

Let's call this group ""Team Reality.""

On the other side of this fight are Republicans like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green (R-Ga.), Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.).

They have no problem with the lies and conspiracy theories being peddled for fast money on right-wing websites and talk radio. Let's call them ""Team Kooks.""

The kooks are backed by cynical enablers like House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.). As matter of political calculation, he thinks having the kooks voting for Republican candidates is the only way for the party to win future elections. He refused to sanction Greene for making violent threats against Democrats.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), well-known for making hard political calculations, punched back at McCarthy's logic when he said: ""Loony lies and conspiracy theories are cancer for the Republican Party and our country.""

But here is the basis for McCarthy's thinking:

According to a January Gallup poll, 82 percent of Republicans still approve of Trump.

And get this - according to a Pew poll, 64 percent of Republicans say they believe that Trump was the rightful winner of the 2020 election, despite reality and all the evidence to the contrary.

Another 64 percent of Republicans, in a January Hill-Harris X poll, said they would join a new political party started by Trump.

Those polls explain why it was only Cheney and nine other House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump for inciting the Capitol insurrection.

The insurrection ""is not something we can simply look past or pretend didn't happen,"" Cheney said on ""Fox News Sunday"" in explaining her vote for impeachment.

Trump's actions, she added, ""constituted the gravest violation of his oath of office by any president in the history of the country.""

There is a hard political calculus behind her thinking:

If Republicans fall into line with the kooks they will lose credibility with rational voters. They will lose any traction with educated and suburban voters, especially women.

And they will have no standing with Democrats because a Republican Party based on ""kooks"" is not, to quote Cheney, a ""party of truth.""

She also said in her ""Fox News Sunday"" interview that the party needed to ""convey"" to voters ""that we actually can be trusted to handle the challenges this nation faces.""

She's right.

But she is fighting for her political life.

After she was censured by the Wyoming GOP for voting to impeach Trump, Cheney punched back by saying the vote was based on people in her home state being ""mistaken.""

""They believe that BLM [Black Lives Matter] and Antifa were behind what happened here at the Capitol,"" she said on Fox. ""That's just simply not the case, not true and we're going to have a lot of work we have to do.""

And she has to keep fighting.

Trump has floated the idea of taking his fans and starting a new ""Patriot Party."" Any subtraction of voters from the current GOP will result in a diminished base, leaving both branches of the party unable to win major elections.

But the kooks are not the only ones talking about leaving the party.

Reuters revealed last week that a group of over 100 former Republican officials - members of ""Team Reality"" - had joined a Zoom call to strategize around the possibility of starting a conservative anti-Trump third party.

""Large portions of the Republican Party are radicalizing and threatening American democracy,"" said one of the call's co-hosts, Evan McMullin.

McMullin, a former Republican congressional staffer who also ran for president as an independent in 2016, added: ""The party needs to recommit to truth, reason and founding ideals or there clearly needs to be something new.""

That party and Cheney have my full support.

As an American and a Democrat, I say: ""Go, Liz.""

18,Williams,Juan,thehill,"There is no way to say this politely.

MORE (R-Mo.) is making money by telling lies.

So is Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.).

ADVERTISEMENT

Both are playing the grievance game by complaining that they are victims of “cancel culture,” and a “radical mob” seeking their “silence.”

Their lies work.

Last week, the senator announced he fooled enough people to get donations of $969,000 in January. That is more money than he has raised in any single month since coming to the Senate.

The total included about $300,000 pulled in for Hawley by the Senate Conservatives Fund, according to Axios, after the deadly attack on the Capitol.

Greene claims to have raised $325,000 in just two days last week, even as the House voted to take away her committee assignments.

So even as former President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE is impeached for telling lies about a stolen election, Hawley and Greene are stuffing their campaign pockets by pushing more lies.

Both politicians are lying to prevent people from holding them accountable for lying about the November election being stolen from Trump.

“This is all retribution because they know I still question the results of the 2020 election and I filed my bill to impeach Joe Biden last month,” Greene said in asking for donations. “This is how the swamp treats people who stand up to them, because we work for YOU.”

Hawley is pushing the same lie.

“I will never apologize for giving voice to the millions of Missourians and Americans who have concerns about the integrity of our elections,” Hawley said after the violence.

The courts, the attorney general, state and federal officials have said there is no question about the integrity of the election.

Hawley also followed Greene’s strategy of telling potential donors that he is being silenced.

He complained that in the days after five people died in the Capitol riot, a publisher decided they didn’t want to release his book and The Kansas City Star said Hawley had “blood on his hands” for supporting the attack.

The other big paper in his home state, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, also held him accountable for his actions. They hesitated to call him a liar but said he has a “substantial list of phony, smarmy and politically expedient declarations.”

Both papers called on him to resign.

To avoid accountability, Hawley is portraying himself as a right-wing martyr, being silenced by the Washington power-brokers.

Again, the same strategy is being used by Greene.

""You see, this cancel culture is real,"" said Greene in a recent townhall meeting with constituents, ""And when you are not agreeing and saying what the left wants you to say, they scream 'Twitter safety' non-stop as if they are calling the police, and try to ruin your life. And now they are targeting conservatives all over the nation.""

These bold lies prevent gullible populists from focusing on the truth that Greene and Hawley misled them about the election.

In the words of the Kansas City Star, Hawley wants people to forget that he “led the parade to the edge of a cliff,” and watched as the Capitol fell under siege.

Some on the right are not buying it.

Here is Isaac Schorr writing in the conservative outlet, National Review:

“The objective of Hawley’s statement [about being silenced] is obvious: to take this personal event, which has occurred as a direct result of his own behavior, and to make Republicans feel as if this was a personal attack on them and their beliefs. It was not.”

And Hawley is lying about being censored. His false charges won him front page coverage in one of the nation’s biggest papers, The New York Post.

Oh, and his book contract was picked up by another publisher.

Where is the silencing, senator?

Here’s the truth from President Biden Joe BidenObama, Clinton reflect on Mondale's legacy Biden, Harris commend Mondale in paving the way for female VP Mondale in last message to staff: 'Joe in the White House certainly helps' MORE:

""There is truth and there are lies,"" Biden said in his inaugural address, tying lies on social media to the violence of Jan. 6.

ADVERTISEMENT

""Lies told for power and for profit. And each of us has a duty and responsibility, as citizens, as Americans, and especially as leaders — leaders who have pledged to honor our Constitution and protect our nation — to defend the truth and defeat the lies.""

Three weeks into the Biden presidency, it is becoming clear that the biggest impediment to unifying the country is the presence of “lies told for power and profit.”

Outrageous fake news — like the QAnon conspiracy foolishness about a Satanic, left-wing cult of political pedophiles — attracts eyeballs. So, do calls for violence, mocking the weak and hate speech.

Hawley, the son of a banker, went to Stanford and Yale Law School before clerking for U.S. Chief Justice John Roberts. He is lying to present himself as a populist hero ready to be the next Trump.

Ten years ago, I wrote a book called “Muzzled: the Assault on Honest Debate” about how political correctness was stifling freedom of speech and limiting our country’s ability to solve pressing national problems.

It pains me to see that the problem is now exponentially worse.

Lies now go viral so quickly and they are difficult to quash.

But all the money flowing into their campaigns can’t stop Hawley and Greene from being judged for what they are — liars.

No, it is not. America needs two strong political parties.

In fact, it pains me to see the cancerous gang of grifters, white supremacists and conspiracy-theory mad hatters who are killing the party of conservative principles.

Healing the GOP can only begin when someone begins confronting the radical fraud, I told Wallace.

The fraud inside the party begins with the 72 percent of Republicans, according to a Monmouth poll last week, who buy the big lie that Donald Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE won the election and Democrats stole it by fraud.

But that’s not all.

A YouGov poll taken earlier this month found that 30 percent of self-described Republicans have a favorable view of QAnon — the conspiracy theory that the world is secretly controlled by a cabal of satanic pedophiles.

QAnon’s adherents believe Trump was working to expose the satanists.

That thinking belongs in an insane asylum, not a major political party.

The YouGov poll was conducted after the Jan. 6 riot where QAnon supporters joined in an invasion of the U.S. Capitol.

Once relegated to the fringes of politics, QAnon now has two supporters in Congress, Reps. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) and Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.).

Both women were endorsed by Trump.

Separately, Trump has described QAnon followers as “people who love our country.”

To understand the poison in Trump’s words, take a look at Greene’s social media comments.

She liked a Facebook post that stated “a bullet to the head” would be the quickest way to remove Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiWhite House readies for Chauvin verdict House GOP's McClain responds to Pelosi calling her 'that woman' GOP struggles to rein in nativism MORE (D-Calif.) from office.

In a photo she posted for her campaign on Facebook, Green could be seen holding a gun next to images of three Democrats — Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Alexandria Ocasio-CortezOvernight Energy: Treasury creates hub to fight climate change through finance | Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez introduce 'Green New Deal for Public Housing' | White House defends 'aspirational' goal of 62,500 refugees Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez introduce 'Green New Deal for Public Housing' MORE (N.Y.), Ilhan Omar Ilhan OmarBiden on refugee cap: 'We couldn't do two things at once' McCarthy: GOP not the party of 'nativist dog whistles' White House reverses course on refugee cap after Democratic eruption MORE (Minn.) and Rashida Tlaib Rashida Harbi TlaibCan policing be reformed? GOP believes Democrats handing them winning 2022 campaign McCarthy: GOP not the party of 'nativist dog whistles' MORE (Mich.).

The threatening words and images prompted Pelosi to say last week the House needs added security for its members because “the enemy is within the House of Representatives. ... We have members of Congress who want to bring guns on the floor and have threatened violence on other members of Congress.”

Greene was also seen on tape harassing David Hogg, a survivor of the Parkland, Fla., high school shooting. At one point she tells him that she carries “a gun for protection.”

Incredibly, Greene has supported the conspiracy theory that the shooting at Hogg’s school, which resulted in 17 deaths, was staged.

She similarly argues that the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in which 20 children and 6 adults were killed, was staged.

“What I’m concerned about is the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives, who are willing to overlook, ignore those statements, assigning her to the Education Committee when she has mocked the killing of little children,” Pelosi said of Greene.

“What could they be thinking?” the Speaker added. “It is absolutely appalling.”

There are Republicans standing up to the madness.

After the violent attack on the Capitol by QAnon supporters and other extremists, Sen. Ben Sasse Ben Sasse15 Senate Republicans pledge to oppose lifting earmark ban Toomey warns GOP colleagues to stay away from earmarks Bipartisan lawmakers signal support for Biden cybersecurity picks MORE (R-Neb.) wrote an essay for The Atlantic headlined, “QAnon is destroying the GOP from within.”

The radical violence against Congress was “the blossoming of a rotten seed that took root in the Republican Party some time ago and has been nourished by treachery, poor political judgment, and cowardice,” Sasse wrote.

Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel, a staunch defender of Trump, last week condemned QAnon as “dangerous” and “beyond fringe.”

QAnon has been a danger for some time.

In May 2019, the FBI labeled QAnon and other conspiracy theories as a domestic terrorist threat and warned:

“The FBI assesses these conspiracy theories very likely will emerge, spread, and evolve ... occasionally driving both groups and individual extremists to carry out criminal or violent acts.”

Last week, the Department of Homeland Security issued a warning about domestic extremists “motivated by a range of issues,” including Biden’s win.

Boebert and Greene are among the 147 congressional Republicans — including House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy Kevin McCarthyWhite House readies for Chauvin verdict McCarthy to introduce resolution to censure Waters House GOP's McClain responds to Pelosi calling her 'that woman' MORE (R-Calif.) — who voted against certifying Joe Biden Joe BidenObama, Clinton reflect on Mondale's legacy Biden, Harris commend Mondale in paving the way for female VP Mondale in last message to staff: 'Joe in the White House certainly helps' MORE’s election as president of the United States, citing bogus conspiracy theories about widespread voter fraud.

The deranged thinking has infected Republicans beyond Capitol Hill.

Oregon’s Republican Party issued a statement calling the deadly violence at the Capitol earlier this month a “false flag operation” — something staged, just as Greene has said about the school shootings.

McCarthy, through a spokesperson, has said he plans to “talk” with Greene about her conspiracy theories.

ADVERTISEMENT

That’s not good enough.

I can’t help but wonder what is driving the deafening silence from GOP leadership.

It could well be fear of reprisals — political or physical violence from the QAnon crowd, the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers, all known to have had a role in the siege at the Capitol.

And it could be politics. There are no tests for sanity at the voting booth. Greene easily won her seat. Republican strategists might fear losing her supporters and the whole QAnon crowd in the 2022 elections.

But the party will be dead by then if the Republicans of sound mind don’t stand up right now.

The healing begins by expelling Greene from Congress.

I'm describing my emotions as Joe Biden was inaugurated as president last week, marking the end of Donald Trump's time in the White House.

Load Error

I'm not alone.

Dr. Anthony Fauci described his emotion as a ""liberating feeling.""

His joy comes from being able to simply speak honestly about ""what the evidence, what the science is."" He said with Trump gone he can tell it straight, offering the truth without ""any repercussions about it.""

It's not just Fauci and me.

""I feel lighter,"" Sarah Rassey of Chicago told the New York Times. ""I'm just grateful, relieved, happy.""

""I am breathing a major sigh of relief,"" Joe Johnson, a Nashville veteran, told The Washington Post. ""It feels like we've been in a fox hole, under siege, running out of supplies, and in the 11th hour...the cavalry came.""

These positive feelings matter.

Biden enters office with a 58 percent approval rating and a plurality of Americans - 46 percent - saying they believe he will make the federal government work better, according to Pew Research.

He also begins his term as the person to receive the most votes for president in American history, 81.3 million. That's an incredible performance against an opponent with the power of the presidency.

Incumbents rarely lose.

And to top it off, voters gave Biden's party control of both houses of Congress.

A Fox News poll from December showed 55 percent of Americans either ""fully support him"" (34 percent) or are ""with him for now - but we'll have to see how he does"" (21 percent). Another 24 percent say they are willing to give Biden a chance, even though he would not be their choice for president.

Trump never had an approval rating of 50 percent or higher in Fox News polls.

Here's another measure of why Americans are feeling better with Biden in the White House.

According to a new report from Zignal Labs, online misinformation about the 2020 election fell by as much as 73 percent in the week after Trump was banned from Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and other social media platforms.

Halting the constant lies, the appeals to political division that led Trump supporters to attack the Capitol, is enough to make Garth Brooks and a whole country sing ""Amazing Grace.""

Biden, in his inaugural address, boldly called for an end to ""lies told for power and for profit,"" by so many on right-wing social media and on too many talk shows.

Biden said he, as president, has a duty ""to defend the truth and to defeat the lies.""

That will be the first battle in what Biden called his fight to end ""this uncivil war"" of conservative versus liberal and rural versus urban - that divide that Trump, under the banner of 'populism,' exploited for political advantage.

Biden's goal, he said is ""that most elusive of things in a democracy - unity.""

And the idea of unity makes me happy.

I want to feel a part of the American community again - instead of another target for Trump's divisive rhetoric as a journalist who was a repeat victim of his ugly Twitter attacks.

The press is not the ""enemy of the people,"" as Trump proclaimed. A free press is the enemy of propaganda.

For me as a black man, there was relief that Trump's racism no longer resides in the White House.

Award-winning documentary filmmaker Ken Burns feels free to call out what ails the nation.

He told NPR last week: There's ""a year-old COVID-19 virus, but also a 402-year-old virus of white supremacy, of racial injustice...And we've got an age-old human virus of misinformation, of paranoia, of conspiracies.""

But even more, as the son of a black mother and the grandfather of black granddaughters, I couldn't hold back tears at seeing Kamala Harris rise to vice president as a direct repudiation of Trump.

My mother, an immigrant who worked in a sweatshop in Manhattan's garment district, would have cried too at the sight of a black woman, the daughter of Indian and Jamaican immigrants, being inaugurated as the Vice President of the United States.

My mother would have heard the new president when he called for an end to the last four years of stoking racial hatred.

Biden's inaugural address was very careful to avoid the all-too-common ""false equivalency"" trap politicians fall into. He did not say ""both sides"" bear responsibility. He did not pretend blame was evenly distributed.

One side, the American right, is solely responsible for empowering the hateful nonsense of QAnon and the resurgence of white supremacist threats.

In an essay for the Atlantic, Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), who seldom spoke against Trumpism, wrote ""the Republican Party faces a separate reckoning"".

""Until last week, many party leaders and consultants thought they could preach the Constitution while winking at QAnon,"" he wrote. ""They can't. The GOP must reject conspiracy theories or be consumed by them. Now is the time to decide what this party is about.""

Correct, senator.

And the only way to do that is for you and your Republican colleagues to vote to bar Trump from ever holding public office again through the Senate impeachment trial or other means.

With Biden as president, there is hope that national politics can be normal. There's reason to hope that the fever of political hatred and violent extremism is going away.

To quote Langston Hughes, the black poet of the early 20th Century, ""Let America be America Again.""

26,Williams,Juan,foxnews,"He is about to become the most powerful leader in the world.

But despite all that power, Joe Biden is facing a mountain of challenges with three high peaks:

The climb begins with getting the coronavirus pandemic under control by vaccinating 100 million people in 100 days.

That’s a steep challenge.

SOME SCHOOLS WON'T SHOW INAUGURATION IN CLASSROOMS OVER CONCERNS OF POTENTIAL VIOLENCE

Biden plans a centralized, coordinated federal response to arrest a pandemic that has infected 24 million and killed 400,000.

That means he will have to leap across a great void where there is no current national leadership and establish a foothold.

He is putting trust in scientists with real experience to help him and trusting the public to join him in facing the truth about the depth of the problem.

Some people may not want to look down, preferring happy-go-lucky promises that the virus will go away in time.

NY TIMES EDITOR MOCKED FOR BIDEN FANFARE AS PRESIDENT-ELECT LANDS AT JOINT BASE ANDREWS: 'I HAVE CHILLS'

And while Biden starts to scale the mountain of challenge that is the pandemic he also has to:

Offer cities and states a national plan to get schools open safely for students and teachers.

Get Republicans and Democrats in Congress to agree to spend major money – $1.9 trillion – to jumpstart an ailing economy beginning with $1,400 stimulus checks for Americans to address the rising rates of hunger as well as unemployment, evictions and closed businesses. Attempt real immigration reform to bring healing on both sides.

And as he climbs he has to pull a divided nation along or risk having some faction drag him down. To avoid that disaster he has to make time to heal the deep hurt and division while holding radicals accountable for political violence against the Congress that threatened to destabilize the country.

'NO TOLERANCE' FOR INAUGURATION DAY VIOLENCE: ACTING ATTORNEY GENERAL

Biden is a student of history.

He knows that if his administration can show progress on this ascent he will earn a place in history.

He will be honored among the elite fraternity of presidents who somehow kept the nation moving across perilous territory beginning with Washington founding the nation, Lincoln holding the nation together despite Civil War and Roosevelt facing World War II.

Biden has some tools to work with as he gets going.

He has Democratic majorities in the Senate and House of Representatives. He earned a popular mandate by beating the odds to defeat an incumbent president by more than 7 million votes.

In fact, he won the most votes ever in a U.S. presidential contest.

According to a December Fox News poll, 59% of Americans have a favorable view of Biden. That is a big jump from the 42% who had a favorable view of Donald Trump when he was inaugurated.

THESE PRESIDENTS DIDN'T ATTEND THE INAUGURATIONS OF THEIR SUCCESSORS

And 55% of Americans either ""Fully Support Him"" [34%] or are ""With Him, But Will Be Watching"" [21%].

Another 24% say they will give him a chance.

All this is to say that in a country where 71% say the nation is a dysfunctional family, Biden enters office with a reservoir of goodwill.

Some historians have compared Biden’s election to Warren G. Harding’s famous promise in the 1920 presidential election vowing a ""return to normalcy"" for Americans exhausted by World War I and the Spanish Flu pandemic.

Biden’s Cabinet selections are moderate, temperate, competent professionals with vast experience in the parts of government they are charged with leading, people such as Janet Yellen as Treasury secretary, Merrick Garland as attorney general and Xavier Becerra bringing new energy to the Department of Health and Human Services.

If confirmed, Biden’s Cabinet will be the most diverse in history, featuring the most women Cabinet secretaries and the first Native American Cabinet secretary.

Biden’s conventional, qualified picks give him a boost by providing credibility to his pledge to succeed.

There are some negatives.

In a vulgar break from tradition and decency, the Bidens will not be welcomed at the White House by their predecessor.

Biden will be on his own.

I am reminded of the letter that President George H.W. Bush left for Bill Clinton, after the two waged a bitter presidential campaign, in 1993 that made Bush a one-term president.

""I’m not a very good one to give advice; but just don’t let the critics discourage you or push you off course. ... Your success now is our country’s success. I am rooting hard for you. Good luck — George.""

Similarly, with Biden all patriotic Americans – including those who did not vote for him – should be rooting for his success.

28,Williams,Juan,thehill,"‘If you ain’t scared, you ain’t alive.’

There is every reason to fear violence at this week’s inauguration.

It is terrifying to see more armed troops at the U.S. Capitol to deal with potential terrorists than there are in Iraq and Afghanistan.

ADVERTISEMENT

And it is beyond scary that those terrorists could be our fellow Americans and in some cases people tied to the U.S. military and police.

“We always had counter-surveillance but now we have counter-surveillance looking at cops during the inauguration of a new president,” former FBI official Frank Figliuzzi told MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” last week.

In the last week, it is hard to miss disturbing stories about law enforcement’s presence on the wrong side of the Capitol Hill siege:

A Pennsylvania policeman apparently wore a hat during the Trump speech preceding the attack on the Capitol which read: “Trump MAGA 2020 f… your feelings,” according to the CBS station in Pittsburgh.

A Virginia policeman posted on Facebook that “the right IN ONE DAY took the f***ing U.S. Capitol. Keep poking us.”

Trump loyalist police from several other states are under investigation for taking part in the riot.

And two Capitol Hill Police officers are suspended and at least ten others under investigation for participating in the violence or helping the insurrectionists.

Meanwhile, the Joint Chiefs of Staff felt the need to send a message to everyone in the military last week to remind them that, whatever their politics, they have all taken an oath to defend the Constitution.

A former Navy Seal bragged on Facebook about “breaching the Capitol,” adding “you had to destroy doors and windows to get in.”

“A Washington Post analysis of individuals who breached the Capitol or were in the vicinity of the riots identified 21 people with some prior military service background,” the newspaper reported, adding that of 72 people arrested or charged by last Thursday about 15 percent, 11, had military experience.

Fear of these trained fighters goes beyond D.C. on Inauguration Day to state capitols. And farther beyond is fear of spur-of-the-moment violence in random locations by those acting on the outright lie that Trump won the election.

The greatest fear is of an attack on the newly elected president and his vice president. At that point, a nation on the edge might go over the edge.

Here is how deep this goes:

In December, the Secret Service made changes in the group of agents assigned to protect the incoming president. Part of the shift is the normal turnover with a new administration. But some reassignments were done because some agents appeared to “embrace [Trump’s] political agenda,” according to The Washington Post.

In the past, one agent took leave to become a Trump Deputy Chief of Staff and was reportedly one of the people associated with the Trump photo op that followed the forcible clearing of a peaceful protest against racial violence in Lafayette Square.

The ties between Trump and law enforcement go back to the 2016 election.

It has been widely reported that then-FBI director James Comey James Brien ComeyShowtime developing limited series about Jan. 6 Capitol riot Wray says FBI not systemically racist John Durham's endgame: Don't expect criminal charges MORE was prompted to release his fateful letter announcing a reopened investigation into Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' Cuba readies for life without Castro Chelsea Clinton: Pics of Trump getting vaccinated would help him 'claim credit' MORE in part because he was concerned about leaks from Trump supporters in the FBI’s New York bureau.

Rudy Giuliani Rudy GiulianiMyPillow files countersuit against Dominion Voting Systems Guilfoyle named as national chair of Greitens' Senate campaign in Missouri Greitens Senate bid creates headache for GOP MORE’s former law firm was representing the FBI Agents Association while the former mayor went on television to promise negative information on Clinton.

A 2018 New York Times column reported that “the FBI agent corps today overwhelmingly fits the demographic profile of a Trump voter,” and cited one agent who told another paper: “The FBI is Trumpland.”

Meanwhile, Trump celebrates the military and police as his personal troops in facing off against Black Lives Matter or dealing with immigrants.

ADVERTISEMENT

Here is Trump in a March 2019 interview with Breitbart:

""I can tell you I have the support of the police, the support of the military, the support of the Bikers for Trump — I have the tough people, but they don’t play it tough — until they go to a certain point, and then it would be very bad, very bad.""

That was not a one-time utterance.

“Law enforcement, military, construction workers, Bikers for Trump… They travel all over the country… these are tough people. These are great people. But they’re peaceful people, and Antifa and all — they’d better hope they stay that way.”

Trump’s “tough people” and “law-and-order” rhetoric is the cutting edge of troubling ties linking two other factions with a big presence at the siege — white supremacists and conspiracy theorists, especially followers of the QAnon conspiracy.

The Washington Post reported last week that “dozens of people on a terrorist watch list,"" were at the attack on the Capitol and the majority of those people are “suspected white supremacists.""

It turns out Trump was right to warn about a “deep state” working beneath the surface of these institutions to subvert our democracy. But it turns out they are his loyalists.

It’s unclear how deep the rot goes and how many people it involves.

Pray for the safety of all those in Washington on Wednesday. The threat is not yet over.

The Trump seditionists wanted just such a coup. And they came close.

This is the dream for the violent white supremacists and Proud Boys who identify Trump as their defender of white, Christian dominance.

At the Capitol they waved Confederate flags and wore T-shirts with anti-Semitic slogans. One man wore a hoodie with the slogan ""Camp Auschwitz.""

Their years of talking about lynching liberals led them to hang a noose from wooden gallows they erected on the mall.

Their invitations to violence fit with the profile of the people who made a social media hero out of Kyle Rittenhouse, the then-17-year-old who killed two men during protests over the police shooting of a black man in Kenosha, Wis., last year. Rittenhouse, now 18, pleaded not guilty to all charges at his arraignment last week, claiming self-defense.

The Trump anarchists at the Capitol also fit with the crowd that is charged with planning to kidnap Michigan Gov.

These people happily swim in an alternate reality full of despicable lies and radical conspiracy theories fed to them by right-wing media.

The big lie in that echo chamber is that Trump won the November election.

It is a lie that Trump repeated as the violence at the Capitol was in full rage.

He tweeted that “we had an election that was stolen from us.”

Earlier at a rally near the White House, Trump fired up his insurrectionists by saying, “Never concede [the election] — you don’t concede when there is theft involved.”

While the crowd chanted “Fight for Trump,” the president asked his loyalists to march to the Capitol as Congress was about to certify the election results.

He was not done.

As the attack was underway, he attacked Vice President Pence as a man lacking “the courage to do what should have been done to protect our country” and stop Congress from certifying the election.

The lie that Trump won the presidential race is repeated on the radical right by Trump’s radio, TV and social media lieutenants.

According to a Fox News poll taken before Christmas, 36 percent of Americans — including 68 percent of Republicans — believe the election was stolen from Trump.

And 45 percent of Republicans approved of the siege on the Capitol in a YouGov snap poll done the day after the attack.

Last month, the king of conservative talk radio Rush Limbaugh raised the specter of secession: “I actually think that we’re trending toward secession.”

The morning of the assault, Trump’s attorney Rudy Giuliani Rudy GiulianiMyPillow files countersuit against Dominion Voting Systems Guilfoyle named as national chair of Greitens' Senate campaign in Missouri Greitens Senate bid creates headache for GOP MORE told the mob, “Let’s have trial by combat!”

Adding to the tension was the Democrats winning two Senate seats in Georgia the night before — giving Democrats control of the Senate.

Now the burning question for Biden is how to bring the country together when the radical right does not want healing.

What can he do when Republican politicians fundraise by refusing invitations to compromise?

What can Biden do when two-thirds of the House GOP caucus voted not to certify his election as president?

What can anyone do with racists who see themselves as victims of “PC culture” when they are challenged for denigrating racial equality and criticized for preferring mob rule over the rule of law?

“The question is whether ... America is at the beginning of a descent into an even darker and more divided epoch or the end of one,” The New York Times editorialized the day after the assault on the Capitol.

The paper called on Republicans outside the ranks of their radical fringe to rise “in defense of the nation they swore oaths to serve.”

In the days before the assault, several Republicans in the military and in the business world spoke out against Trump’s refusal to accept election loss.

ADVERTISEMENT

Ten former U.S. secretaries of Defense — including former Vice President Dick Cheney — signed an unprecedented op-ed in The Washington Post calling for the military to stay out of presidential disputes.

After the assault, the head of the National Association of Manufacturers even called on Pence to “seriously consider” using the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office.

Now will they back up their words with deeds and refuse to give PAC contributions to the Republican who abetted the coup?

Enough is enough.

The week after the election, I wrote in this column:

“In his victory speech, President-elect Biden said: ‘This is the time to heal in America.’ Yes, the country needs healing. But honesty and accountability are part of national healing.”

And in a democracy, accountability requires consequences for the Trump mob. We just had a chilling reminder of the fragile state of our democracy.

There can be no more of trying to reason with people who violently acted to tear down the most essential pillar of the Founding Fathers’ design — political stability based on liberty and justice for all as written in law, our Constitution.

Arrest the rioters; impeach Trump.

© Stefani Reynolds Juan Williams: The GOP's problem with women of color

Most women of color, especially Black women, are Democrats.

Load Error

Now the overwhelmingly white, male, Republican Senate majority is aiming to reject one of President-elect Biden's cabinet-level nominees. No surprise, that person is a woman of color - Neera Tanden.

If confirmed, Tanden would be the first non-white woman to serve as director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).

But she is far from the first woman of color in Washington to ignite ugly talk - especially about Black women as angry, unqualified and having an attitude.

Tanden is not alone in feeling the weight of this racism right now.

Another woman of color, Susan Rice, has long been smeared by Republicans in Congress with bogus claims that she knowingly lied about the 2011 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya.

It is a commonly accepted fact of political life in Washington that Rice is branded with the GOP's slander and will never be confirmed by a Republican Senate.

That is the case even though Rice has extraordinary credentials as a Rhodes scholar who served as assistant secretary of state, UN Ambassador and President Obama's national security advisor.

Instead, Rice has been chosen to lead the Domestic Policy Council, a position that does not require Senate confirmation.

The GOP's problems with Tanden and Rice are matched by the GOP's disdain for another high profile woman of color, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris.

The first woman to win the vice presidency, Harris is a former California attorney general with a tough-on-crime reputation. Her law enforcement background hurt her with liberals in the Democratic primaries. But among white male Republicans, Harris is viewed, in the words of President Trump, as a scary ""radical.""

Even worse, Trump depicted Harris after the vice presidential debate in October as ""this monster that was onstage with [Vice President] Mike Pence...She was terrible...and totally unlikeable.""

Strange, but most polls named Harris the debate winner. She also has better favorability ratings than Trump.

Trump's put-downs of Black women are near-constant.

He called Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) a ""low-IQ individual."" He demeaned his former White House aide, Omarosa Manigault Newman, as ""that dog.""



Video: Poll: 75% of Americans prefer capitalism over socialism (FOX News)

And Trump, in an act of pure projection of his own racism, labeled the four Democratic women of color in Congress known as ""The Squad"" as ""a very Racist group of troublemakers who are...not very smart.""

He also told Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), to ""go back"" to where they came from, apparently without realizing three of the four were born in the USA - and all four are American citizens.

Trump's demonizing of Black women is now a model for other white Republicans.

Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.) who is in a tough reelection fight, recently made news by imitating Trump's game.

Perdue mocked Harris' first name as strange, foreign. ""Kamala-mala-mala, I don't know, whatever,"" he told a rally in October.

""Senator Perdue never would have done this to a male colleague. Or a white colleague. And everyone knows it,"" tweeted Jon Ossoff, the Democrat running against Perdue.

But the woman with the target on her back at the moment is Tanden, a child of Indian immigrants.

Few Republicans openly argue that Tanden, one of the architects of Obama's Affordable Care Act and the head of a leading Washington think tank, is unqualified.

White, male senators' big problem with Tanden is...wait for it...her tweets.

Yes, Senate Republicans had little to say for the last four years about tweets from President @realDonaldTrump that mocked political opponents and even fellow Republicans. But they are now in full fury over Tanden's sharp verbal jabs on Twitter.

Here's Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas):

""I think, in light of her combative and insulting comments about many members of the Senate, mainly on our side of the aisle, that it creates certainly a problematic path.""

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) called her a ""nut job.""

Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) worried she was ""overtly partisan.""

Biden brushed off the criticism of Tanden's tweets.

Comparing Tanden's sharp tongue with white men who have been confirmed to run OMB is another problem for Republicans.

Trump's current OMB director, Russell Vought, spent ""much of his past 15 years in Washington as a political brawler,"" The Washington Post wrote last year. He, too, was confirmed.

31,Williams,Juan,thehill,"Most white men are Republicans.

Most women of color, especially Black women, are Democrats.

Now the overwhelmingly white, male, Republican Senate majority is aiming to reject one of President-elect Biden’s cabinet-level nominees. No surprise, that person is a woman of color — Neera Tanden Neera TandenFive ways an obscure Senate ruling could change Washington 2024 GOP White House hopefuls lead opposition to Biden Cabinet White House delays release of budget plan MORE.

If confirmed, Tanden would be the first non-white woman to serve as director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).

But she is far from the first woman of color in Washington to ignite ugly talk — especially about Black women as angry, unqualified and having an attitude.

Tanden is not alone in feeling the weight of this racism right now.

Another woman of color, Susan Rice Susan RiceHillicon Valley: Facebook Oversight board to rule on Trump ban in 'coming weeks' | Russia blocks Biden Cabinet officials in retaliation for sanctions Russia blocks key Biden Cabinet officials from entering in retaliation for sanctions White House 'horrified' by Indianapolis shooting MORE, has long been smeared by Republicans in Congress with bogus claims that she knowingly lied about the 2011 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya.

It is a commonly accepted fact of political life in Washington that Rice is branded with the GOP’s slander and will never be confirmed by a Republican Senate.

That is the case even though Rice has extraordinary credentials as a Rhodes scholar who served as assistant secretary of state, UN Ambassador and President Obama’s national security advisor.

Instead, Rice has been chosen to lead the Domestic Policy Council, a position that does not require Senate confirmation.

The GOP’s problems with Tanden and Rice are matched by the GOP’s disdain for another high profile woman of color, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris Kamala HarrisBiden, Harris commend Mondale in paving the way for female VP Overnight Energy: Treasury creates hub to fight climate change through finance | Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez introduce 'Green New Deal for Public Housing' | Harris: Americans able to 'breathe easier and sleep better' under Biden MORE.

The first woman to win the vice presidency, Harris is a former California attorney general with a tough-on-crime reputation. Her law enforcement background hurt her with liberals in the Democratic primaries. But among white male Republicans, Harris is viewed, in the words of President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE, as a scary “radical.”

Even worse, Trump depicted Harris after the vice presidential debate in October as “this monster that was onstage with [Vice President] Mike Pence Michael (Mike) Richard PenceSicknick had two strokes, died of natural causes after Capitol riot The Hill's 12:30 Report - Presented by Facebook - All US adults now eligible for COVID vaccines The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Facebook - All US adults can get vaccine; decision Friday on J&J vax MORE…She was terrible…and totally unlikeable.”

Strange, but most polls named Harris the debate winner. She also has better favorability ratings than Trump.

Trump’s put-downs of Black women are near-constant.

He called Rep. Maxine Waters Maxine Moore WatersWhite House readies for Chauvin verdict McCarthy to introduce resolution to censure Waters House GOP's McClain responds to Pelosi calling her 'that woman' MORE (D-Calif.) a “low-IQ individual.” He demeaned his former White House aide, Omarosa Manigault Newman Omarosa Manigault NewmanJudge denies Omarosa Manigault Newman request to depose Trump, John Kelly in lawsuit Tanden seeks to defuse GOP tensions over tweets Juan Williams: The GOP's problem with women of color MORE, as “that dog.”

And Trump, in an act of pure projection of his own racism, labeled the four Democratic women of color in Congress known as “The Squad” as “a very Racist group of troublemakers who are…not very smart.”

He also told Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Alexandria Ocasio-CortezOvernight Energy: Treasury creates hub to fight climate change through finance | Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez introduce 'Green New Deal for Public Housing' | White House defends 'aspirational' goal of 62,500 refugees Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez introduce 'Green New Deal for Public Housing' MORE (D-N.Y.), Ilhan Omar Ilhan OmarBiden on refugee cap: 'We couldn't do two things at once' McCarthy: GOP not the party of 'nativist dog whistles' White House reverses course on refugee cap after Democratic eruption MORE (D-Minn.), Ayanna Pressley Ayanna PressleyPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' FDA ends restrictions on mailing abortion pills during pandemic Tlaib: US policing 'intentionally racist,' can't be reformed MORE (D-Mass.) and Rashida Tlaib Rashida Harbi TlaibCan policing be reformed? GOP believes Democrats handing them winning 2022 campaign McCarthy: GOP not the party of 'nativist dog whistles' MORE (D-Mich.), to “go back” to where they came from, apparently without realizing three of the four were born in the USA — and all four are American citizens.

Trump’s demonizing of Black women is now a model for other white Republicans.

Sen. David Perdue David PerdueWarnock raises nearly M since January victory Georgia's top election official looks to shake political drama Lobbying world MORE (R-Ga.) who is in a tough reelection fight, recently made news by imitating Trump’s game.

Perdue mocked Harris’ first name as strange, foreign. “Kamala-mala-mala, I don’t know, whatever,” he told a rally in October.

“Senator Perdue never would have done this to a male colleague. Or a white colleague. And everyone knows it,” tweeted Jon Ossoff, the Democrat running against Perdue.

But the woman with the target on her back at the moment is Tanden, a child of Indian immigrants.

Few Republicans openly argue that Tanden, one of the architects of Obama’s Affordable Care Act and the head of a leading Washington think tank, is unqualified.

White, male senators’ big problem with Tanden is…wait for it...her tweets.

Yes, Senate Republicans had little to say for the last four years about tweets from President @realDonaldTrump that mocked political opponents and even fellow Republicans. But they are now in full fury over Tanden’s sharp verbal jabs on Twitter.

Here’s Sen. John Cornyn John Cornyn15 Senate Republicans pledge to oppose lifting earmark ban Cornyn defends controversial tweet as not about Biden's competency Media complicity in rise of the 'zombie president' conspiracy MORE (R-Texas):

Biden brushed off the criticism of Tanden’s tweets.

“That disqualifies almost every Republican senator and 90 percent of the administration,” he told Thomas Friedman of the New York Times. “But by the way, [Tanden is] smart as hell.”

Comparing Tanden’s sharp tongue with white men who have been confirmed to run OMB is another problem for Republicans.

For example, Senate Republicans confirmed Trump’s first nominee for OMB director, former Rep. Mick Mulvaney Mick MulvaneyHeadhunters having hard time finding jobs for former Trump officials: report Trump holdovers are denying Social Security benefits to the hardest working Americans Mulvaney calls Trump's comments on Capitol riot 'manifestly false' MORE (R-S.C.).

I begin with Rep. Paul Mitchell (Mich.), a lifelong Republican.

Load Error

He walked away from the GOP last week. Why?

He put America first after 126 members of the House Republican Conference signed an anti-American brief calling for the Supreme Court to overturn the presidential election.

""This party has to stand up for democracy first, for our Constitution first and not political considerations, not to protect a candidate, not simply for raw political power,"" Mitchell told CNN's ""The Lead.""

The Supreme Court, which includes six Republican-nominated justices, seems to agree with Mitchell. It threw the suit out without comment.

More than 50 cases challenging the election have also been dismissed as baseless - in many cases, by Republican judges in state and federal courts.

But unpatriotic Republicans keep up the attack.

Leading commentators such as Rush Limbaugh have even escalated the revolt with talk of secession.

Virginia state Sen. Amanda Chase, a Republican now running for governor, called for martial law.

She spoke up after Michael Flynn, Trump's former national security adviser, incredibly propagated the idea that Trump should suspend the Constitution. Flynn also said that the military could oversee a new election.

Now the big question is how President-elect Joe Biden will deal with Republicans who favor a coup.

""It's a position so extreme, we've never seen it before,"" Biden said. ""A position that refused to respect the will of the people, refused to respect the rule of law, and refused to honor our Constitution.""

With Biden not yet in the White House, the immediate problem is how can c ongressional Democrats do business with Republicans who put partisanship above patriotism?

How do you trust House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) when he is turning away from patriotism by attacking America's greatest asset, its political stability?

Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-N.J.) called on Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to refuse to seat the Republican House members who signed on to the Texas lawsuit.

""Men and women who would act to tear the United States government apart cannot serve as Members of the Congress,"" Pascrell tweeted.

But those Republicans were elected - just as was Biden. It would be anti-democratic not to seat them.

The real headache belongs to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). Does McConnell, the top Republican, close his eyes or does he confront the damage being done by the traitors?

Let's be clear here.

McConnell and most Senate Republicans didn't show much courage in the six weeks after the presidential election. Few refuted Trump's charge that the election was ""rigged.""

But once the Electoral College voted, McConnell acknowledged Biden's clear victory.

""Our country has officially a president-elect and a vice president-elect,"" McConnell said. ""The Electoral College has spoken.""

McConnell was immediately scolded by the conspiracy-minded, sore loser Trump: ""Mitch...too soon to give up. Republican Party must finally learn to fight,"" the president tweeted.

Even after the Electoral College vote, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) used the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee to air more false claims of election corruption.

This daily show of contempt for democracy did not stop even when Trump's former head of cybersecurity, Chris Krebs, testified that the election was the most secure in the nation's history.

""Continued assaults on democracy and the outcome of this election, that only serves to undermine confidence in the [democratic] process ... is ultimately corrosive,"" Krebs told the committee.

That is the point.

""Millions of Republican voters may now believe that their democracy no longer functions - not because there was fraud, but because their leaders lied to them or remained silent while others did so,"" said a Washington Post editorial.

A New York Times news article drew parallels between the GOP's conspiracy theories and ""anti-communist paranoia that was promoted in the 1960s by the John Birch Society.""

The difference is that an extremist group of that era did not have social media to amplify its paranoid charges.

""And the fringe never, of course, enjoyed the support of the sitting president,"" reported the Times's Jeremy W. Peters.

In his first speech after the Electoral College voted, Biden said he is optimistic. ""I'm convinced we can work together,"" he said in reference to Republicans, ""for the good of the nation on many subjects.""

Biden is to be commended. The nation needs healing.

But a skeptic could be forgiven for doubting the honest intentions of Republicans who excuse attacking democracy by pointing to Trump voters in their home states.

I'm reminded of this line from George Orwell's ""1984.""

""Power is not a means; it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship...The object of power is power.""

It is now dangerously clear that for Trump and fans of his authoritarian style, the object of power is power.

God help President Reagan's vision of America as a ""shining city upon a hill,"" an enduring constitutional democracy, if they ever get presidential power again.

Two weeks ago, I tested positive for the coronavirus.

I am a 66-year-old cancer survivor.

I am a black man.

Load Error

And I inhale my share of second-hand smoke because my wife smokes cigarettes.

So I set off several red lights that indicate a high risk of a bad outcome if I got COVID-19.

And I really didn't want my wife, the smoker, to have COVID-19 attack her lungs.

After the phone call telling me I tested positive on a lab test, I was sent for two more tests. They confirmed the worst.

A bad situation kept going down. My wife told me I couldn't come home for fear of spreading the virus to her.

So I immediately went into quarantine in a hotel room.

Physically, I was not doing well. Already there was extreme fatigue, sudden waves of fever and then chills that left goosebumps on my skin. The headaches, the sinus pain, feeling as if I was going to pass out - it was terrible.

At night, sleep was rare and dreams out of control.

I'd turn over and think, ""This bed is wet."" Then I'd realize there was sweat pouring off me.

But it was the isolation that was hell. That and feeling caught in an out-of-control situation.

The doctors tell you there is not much they can do for you until you can't breathe. If you have trouble breathing, call an ambulance, they add.

Suddenly, I felt trapped in a small room. I began to fixate on the thought that there is no fresh air because the windows don't open.

As I looked out the window at masked people walking down the street I realized I was the one they wanted to avoid - a person with a confirmed positive test capable of spreading the disease.

What a mind shift.

Until then I thought of myself as the cautious one, avoiding people spreading the virus. I am the one always wearing the mask, even stepping off the sidewalk to avoid getting too close to anyone. Now, I was the threat, the bad guy.

Turning on the TV did not do much good. The numbers on the virus do not calm. This deadly disease has infected 16 million people, and killed about 300,000, in the U.S. alone. The hospitals are full.

The texts and emails from friends became a lifeline.

Given that this is the Christmas season, I had a new appreciation for how angels helped that cranky Ebenezer Scrooge and the depressed Jimmy Stewart, playing George Bailey, in ""It's a Wonderful Life.""

So many people helped me to push back the fear.

Even one of my critics, a big Trump supporter, tweeted: ""God's Blessings to you and your family during this difficult time. I hope you get better soon so we can disagree some more. Get Well Soon.""

My son left novels. My daughter left a folding exercise bike so I could keep moving.

Even better, she brought my grandchildren to the street far below my hotel room window. They waved at me.

The hotel staff left food outside my door. They were my lifeline.

One night, a waiter stood at a distance to tell me he had only two couples at the lobby restaurant. One of them was talking about me. They argued about my wife not letting me come home. Is that true, he asked?

When I said it was true, he laughed. And for the first time in days, I got to laugh, too.

Despite the kindness, my mind started to wander into some dark places. I won't sugarcoat it. I went a little stir-crazy.

Sick as I was, I found myself telling a friend to look out for my family if the virus overwhelmed me.

And you start asking yourself, ""Where did I get this? What did I do wrong?""

It is only speculation, but the biggest risk I took was one cold night when I got pulled into a crowded New York restaurant.

A few days after that, I reached out to a doctor. But he told me not to worry. Even when my nose started to drip, I told myself not to be a wimp - it is allergy season and people do get colds.

But it got worse.

And then came the positive test.

Three days into quarantine, my wife called to say she tested positive.

The guilt kicked in.

But the doctors said since we both had the virus we could quarantine together. I could go home. Ending the isolation was a big emotional lift.

Fourteen days after my positive test and my quarantine I am feeling much better. My wife is even better. Thank God.

Over the years, I have rarely shared personal stories. Readers come here to read into the theater of politics.

My general rule is to only open personal wounds when there is a clear lesson to offer.

The lesson here is to take this virus seriously - wear the mask, wash your hands, keep your social distance. And reach out to people hit with it.

The coronavirus doesn't care whether you are a liberal or conservative.

We are all in this together. Our best hope is to take care of each other.

Merry Christmas.

But his message twisted his knife into the Republicans.

After weeks of saying the presidential election was rigged in Georgia and elsewhere, Trump spent most of his rally ranting his baseless grievances and telling his fans not to accept his loss because Democrats ""steal and rig and lie.""

So, why should Republicans vote in those races if they believe Trump’s claim that the presidential election was rigged?

That makes no sense unless he is trying to get the party to kill itself.

One Republican voter in Georgia pointedly asked Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel during a recent visit why the party’s supporters should put money and work into the election when “it’s already [been] decided?”

That voter is understandably confused by Trump. But Trump’s message is echoed by his leading supporters.

“Why would you go back and vote in another rigged election?"" said Trump-boosting attorney Lin Wood at a Georgia “Stop the Steal” rally last week.

But what if this backstabbing among Republicans makes sense to Trump?

What if Trump’s lie that the election was stolen is fatal to the GOP but gives him new life with an infusion of money from the hard-right conspiracy crowd, the most gullible Republicans?

Then there is a method to the madness.

Here’s the proof that Trump may be on to something.

Enough Republicans swallowed Trump’s bait to send him more than $170 million in the month after he led them to defeat.

That money went to an entity described on the Trump campaign website as the “Official Election Defense Fund.” But according to The Washington Post, “there is no such account.”

As one former Biden aide told The New York Times, this is “plain and simple grift.”

In fact, 75 percent of the money goes to a new Trump political action committee brashly labeled “Save America.” The paper reports the money will pay for things like Trump’s future “staff and travel.” The remaining 25 percent goes to the Republican National Committee.

Meanwhile, the GOP in Georgia is struggling to stay alive as a party due to Trump’s attacks.

He recently demanded Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp Brian KempTrump: GOP candidates need to embrace 'make America great' agenda if they want to win Rick Scott warns 'woke corporate leaders' of 'massive backlash' 'Black Panther' director condemns Georgia voting law but says sequel will film in state MORE (R) should “call off [the] election” and said Kemp allowed his “state to be scammed.” Trump also phoned Kemp, on the morning of the president's rally in the state, encouraging the governor to call a special session of the state legislature. Trump apparently hoped that GOP legislators would then appoint electors to the Electoral College who would subvert the election result in Georgia.

Trump also told his followers that Georgia’s secretary of state, lifelong Republican Brad Raffensperger, is an “enemy of the people.”

Gabriel Sterling, a Republican elections official who works for Raffensperger, reported that Trump’s threatening language led to a death threat against an election worker.

“It has to stop — Mr. President, you have not condemned these actions or this language ... I can’t begin to explain the level of anger I have right now over this. Every American, every Georgian, Republican and Democrat alike, should have the same level of anger.”

But because so many conservative voters are spellbound by Trump’s tricks, there is silence among top Republican elected officials, the very people who should be protecting the GOP brand.

It is amazing that Loeffler and Purdue remain silent in the face of killing blows to the party. The two Georgia senators have yet to clearly say that Trump lost a fair election, for fear of antagonizing him.

Their silence fits with the failure to speak out from other GOP senators.

“Yes, Donald Trump is an asshole,” Sen. Ron Johnson Ronald (Ron) Harold Johnson15 Senate Republicans pledge to oppose lifting earmark ban 'Real Housewives of the GOP' — Wannabe reality show narcissists commandeer the party Republicans fret over divisive candidates MORE (R-Wis.) told Mark Becker, a former Republican county chairman in Wisconsin, according to a piece Becker wrote for The Bulwark last week.

Yes, Trump lost there, too. But, in Becker’s account, Johnson fears it would be political suicide to stand up and point out publicly that Trump is hurting the party.

In Georgia, the Senate candidates are also weak.

Both Loeffler and Perdue are under scrutiny over whether they might have violated federal law when they engaged in large, suspiciously timed stock deals around the time the coronavirus pandemic hit the U.S. full force earlier this year.

The GOP’s control of the Senate hinges on these subpar candidates hanging on, even while Trump blasts the legitimacy of the election process.

It’s a perfect, deadly storm — of Republicans’ own making.

If not for Clyburn, Biden would not have been on the ballot to defeat Trump.

Clyburn picked Biden off the mat to make him the winner in the Democratic primary fight.

Name another Democrat who could have beaten Trump, an incumbent president with a fired-up base, a record bankroll and total control over the GOP.

The other leading Democrats would have been demonized by Trump’s attack machine as your crazy, socialist uncle [Sen.

Whites, Latinos and young Black Democrats voting in the early primary races felt nothing for the moderate, elderly Biden — until Clyburn made the call of the year by endorsing a candidate able to withstand the mudslinging.

He took his late wife’s advice.

Last week, Clyburn told me that after a 2019 South Carolina fish-fry with about 20 candidates seeking the nomination, his wife Emily told him, “Joe’s your best bet to defeat Trump.”

Once Clyburn publicly stood by Biden, the dominoes began to fall. Black Democrats, starting in Clyburn’s South Carolina, made Biden a winner. Democrats across the south, Midwest and west got on board.

Biden himself understands Clyburn’s importance to everything that has happened since then.

Biden called Clyburn on election night and told him, “I would never be in this position, but for you.”

A historian agrees, too.

“Without Jim Clyburn endorsing Joe Biden, Donald Trump would be president for real — not just in his own mind,” Jon Meacham recently explained to Bill Maher William (Bill) MaherSharon Osbourne tells Maher she's 'angry' and 'hurt' after departure from 'The Talk' Bill Maher blasts Oscar picks: Hollywood movies now are 'just depressing' Why the unhinged woke brigade is a profound threat to our freedom MORE on HBO.

And here is something else to bolster Clyburn’s standing atop 2020 politics:

If not for Clyburn, a Black woman would probably not be set to be vice president for the first time.

Clyburn recommended several Black women as potential running mates, he said in an interview last week.

“Joe and I talked in detail about them all. I thought the election would turn on whether that woman [was] a Black woman. To his credit, he made a wise decision.”

Biden won 90 percent of the Black female vote, according to exit polls. Even before that, record fundraising followed the announcement that he had selected Sen. Kamala Harris Kamala HarrisBiden, Harris commend Mondale in paving the way for female VP Overnight Energy: Treasury creates hub to fight climate change through finance | Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez introduce 'Green New Deal for Public Housing' | Harris: Americans able to 'breathe easier and sleep better' under Biden MORE (D-Calif.) as his running mate.

Clyburn saw the emotional power of that choice. The 80-year-old congressman explained that his three daughters and two granddaughters will live in a country where the ambitions of Black women can soar to new heights because of Harris.

On the night when Biden stood on a Delaware stage to declare he had won the election, he acknowledged the critical role Black voters, spurred by Clyburn, played in his victory:

“Especially at those moments when this campaign was at its lowest ebb, the African-American community stood up again for me. You’ve always had my back, and I’ll have yours.”

That promise makes Clyburn a power player going into 2021.

Why?

Clyburn is the leading voice in Biden’s ear on civil rights as the incoming president begins to handle the racial fires still burning after the massive fall-out from the May death of George Floyd, a black man who had his neck pinned under a policeman’s knee until he died.

The powerful, nationwide “Black Lives Matter” movement still has strong political support across racial and political lines. But in the presidential campaign, Trump turned it against Democrats. He played up incidents of looting and mocked the slogan “Defund the Police” in order to diminish all calls for racial justice.

With Biden in the White House, Clyburn is the leading Black politician on racial issues. He is already on record calling “Defund the Police” a bad slogan that cost Democrats at the polls. He tells me he prefers “Reimagining Policing.”

ADVERTISEMENT

He wants Biden to begin pattern-and-practice investigations of police departments to stop abuse. He wants to fix flaws in the 1994 crime bill. His pragmatic view will have influence.

Clyburn is also positioned to hold President Biden’s feet to the fire when white advisors will be cautioning him to stay away from racially charged issues.

In 2018, I gave the politician of the year award jointly to Harris and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong 15 Senate Republicans pledge to oppose lifting earmark ban It's not 'woketivism,' it's good business MORE (R-Ky.).

This year, I am tempted to give grudging acknowledgement to McConnell again, this time for putting so many conservative judges on the federal bench, including another on the Supreme Court.

But that effort doesn’t match the importance of deposing Trump.

Oh, there is one other political player who deserves recognition:

41,Williams,Juan,thehill,"Here’s what former President Obama thinks about the far right.

Their brains are numbed by the din of the right-wing echo chamber.

Conservative talk radio and clickbait websites drown their capacity to think with noisy, repeated messages of fear and grievance, he told The Atlantic magazine.

It requires them to “go along with conspiracy theorizing, false assertion, fantasies that Donald Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE and Rush Limbaugh and others in that echo chamber have concocted,” the former president said in an interview to promote the release of his new book, ""A Promised Land.""

ADVERTISEMENT

The first Black president is baffled that right-wing talk hosts have succeeded in marketing Trump as a hero for working-class white people.

Trump is neither a stand-up for the little guy, a Robin Hood populist, nor a John Wayne or Clint Eastwood type of “classic male hero” in Obama's eyes.

To Obama, Trump is a rich-guy cartoon character: “Richie Rich — the complaining, lying, doesn’t-take-responsibility- for-anything type of figure,"" he told Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic.

He explained: “I would not have expected someone who has complete disdain for ordinary people to be able to get attention and then the following from those very same people.”

Obama did several interviews for his bestselling book last week. In every sitdown, he found his way back to discussing the political power of right-wing media.

In an interview with CBS’s “60 Minutes” he talked about “truth decay.”

He drew a picture of the current political landscape in which “issues, facts, policies per se don’t matter as much as identity and wanting to beat the other guy … The current media environment adds to that greatly. This democracy doesn’t work if we don’t have an informed citizenry.”

In the Atlantic interview, he said with alarm, far-fetched conspiracy theories are circulated until some people “genuinely believe the Democratic Party is a front for a pedophile ring.”

The power of right-wing media to distort reality “is the single biggest threat to our democracy,” Obama added.

Obama’s take on the right-wing media comes across as a warning to President-elect Joe Biden Joe BidenObama, Clinton reflect on Mondale's legacy Biden, Harris commend Mondale in paving the way for female VP Mondale in last message to staff: 'Joe in the White House certainly helps' MORE.

In an NPR interview, Obama identified media that is focused on ratings, rather than the well-being of the nation, as one of the biggest challenges that Biden will face upon taking office in January.

“I think Steve Bannon Stephen (Steve) Kevin BannonThere was Trump-Russia collusion — and Trump pardoned the colluder MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell's new free speech site to ban certain curse words Trump denies Gaetz asked him for blanket pardon MORE explicitly said, we're just going to fill up the information pipeline with excrement and it'll get very cloudy,” Obama said. “It doesn't really matter whether ultimately what we're saying is disproven, it creates confusion and uncertainty in the minds of voters, and that's enough for our purposes of getting power.”

Obama is signaling to Biden that misinformation and political tribalism form the basis of Republican hostility to compromise and solving difficult issues facing the nation.

Those factors will not go away with the defeat of Trump.

Republicans on Capitol Hill are not likely to work with Biden to break the political gridlock because, in Obama’s experience, they have to dance to the music from the “right-wing media ecosystem.”

If he is correct, the right-wing media’s echo chamber is a bigger problem than Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong 15 Senate Republicans pledge to oppose lifting earmark ban It's not 'woketivism,' it's good business MORE (R-Ky.) or any other political opponent on the right.

That means Biden will have a hard time fulfilling his promise to unify the country.

In Obama’s time in the White House, he told the Atlantic, the drumbeat from conservative talk radio and websites was so constant, he found that GOP politicians concluded it was “politically advantageous to demonize me and the Democratic Party.”

ADVERTISEMENT

Suddenly, even reasonable Republicans “couldn’t take anything less than a hard line; they had to tolerate conspiracy theorizing that they knew wasn’t true — obviously that’s pertinent today,” he said, pointing to the current situation where congressional Republicans refuse to condemn Trump’s failure to concede a clear defeat to Biden.

Looking back, he said he saw the dawn of the current problem in the media’s celebrity-like fascination with former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin (R) when she became Sen. John McCain John Sidney McCain'Real Housewives of the GOP' — Wannabe reality show narcissists commandeer the party George W. Bush: 'It's a problem that Americans are so polarized' they can't imagine him being friends with Michelle Obama Congress brings back corrupt, costly, and inequitably earmarks MORE’s (R-Ariz.) running mate in 2008.

The culture of grievance added to the problem when television reporter Rick Santelli began ranting from the floor of the Chicago Board of Trade in opposition to Obama’s plan to help homeowners facing foreclosure as a result of the recession that started in 2008.

Santelli became well known for attacking many of Obama’s proposals as leading to higher taxes. It was a spark for the Tea Party, the right-wing group that stood against much of Obama’s agenda. And it translated into ratings for conservative news outlets.

The control conservative media have over Republicans on Capitol Hill allows the nation to fall into deep political division.

If the media doesn’t give Americans “the capacity to distinguish what’s true from what’s false,” Obama told the Atlantic, “then by definition the marketplace of ideas doesn’t work.”

Obama has a lot invested in Biden’s presidency.

The success of Biden’s first term will depend on defending the Affordable Care Act as well as restoring myriad Obama-era regulations on civil rights and environmental protection, as well as rejoining international agreements like the Paris climate accords.

Trump gained political capital with right-wing talk shows for erasing Obama’s work.

Trump may be on his way out, but right-wing media remains as the big boulder on the road ahead for Biden.

And he better watch his step.

He could end up in jail.

ADVERTISEMENT

No president has ever gone to jail. But Trump is pushing his luck.

His biggest risk is a guilty verdict if a case comes out of the criminal probe being led by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance.

Vance is looking at “extensive and protracted criminal conduct at the Trump Organization,” according to court documents.

The alleged criminal acts took place before Trump became president. That means Trump can’t hide behind executive privilege or a federal pardon.

“Vance ... is free to go after Trump not as a crooked president but as a common crook who happened to get elected president,” Jeff Wise recently wrote in New York Magazine.

The case centers on Trump possibly lying about his finances on official business records. That includes, allegedly, falsely describing a payment to silence a porn star as a legal expense. Proof that Trump signed off on that kind of financial deception could lead to a more serious charge — tax fraud.

If he is found guilty of tax fraud charges, there is no escaping the threat of serious jail time.

The DA has already won court approval to access Trump’s tax returns.

That could be trouble. The man who says he is a billionaire somehow paid no federal income taxes in 10 of the 15 years preceding the 2016 election, and only $750 in such taxes in 2016 and 2017, according to The New York Times.

If he is convicted in the Vance case, Trump will have the chance to get used to a style of government housing quite different from the White House.

Then there is a second, separate tax fraud investigation spearheaded by Letitia James, the New York State Attorney General.

Even without the prospect of jail time in this case, Trump risks being hit with big fines.

James is looking into whether Trump illegally inflated the value of his assets to get loans. He may also have misled officials by lowering the value of his real estate holdings to reduce his taxes.

Trump already owes more than $300 million to banks and creditors. He will have to repay that money or renegotiate the terms of the loans in the next four years. The Internal Revenue Service is also challenging him over a tax refund. A loss in that case could leave him owing another $100 million.

Then the question becomes, what would an ex-president do to pull in that much cash?

There is always the possibility that Trump could star in a television show. He might even start his own media company to pay bills. It was widely reported that his backup plan if he lost the 2016 election was to launch a “Trump TV” operation.

But it looks like he will be busy in court for a long time.

Oh, don’t forget, there are also defamation suits brought by two women who claim Trump sexually assaulted them. The women are taking Trump to court for saying they lied. A loss in those cases could drain him of more money.

ADVERTISEMENT

In the short run, the biggest risk to Trump in those cases is embarrassment. E. Jean Carroll, a magazine writer, has the right to get DNA from Trump to see if he stained a dress she said she wore when he allegedly raped her.

“Trump has famously survived one impeachment, two divorces, six bankruptcies, twenty-six accusations of sexual misconduct, and an estimated four thousand lawsuits,” Jane Mayer wrote in The New Yorker before Trump lost his bid for reelection. “Few people have evaded consequences more cunningly. That run of good luck may well end, perhaps brutally, if he loses to Joe Biden.”

Well, he lost.

Trump leaves office as one of only five incumbent U.S. presidents to lose reelection bids in the last 100 years.

He goes back to private life with a majority of the country — 54 percent according to the latest Fox News poll — disapproving of his job performance as president.

This is not exactly the kind of high esteem that could help in front of a jury.

And don’t forget, some Democrats still hunger for congressional investigations into his conduct as president.

Rep. Eric Swalwell Eric Michael SwalwellGOP struggles to rein in nativism Personal security costs for anti-Trump lawmakers spiked post-riot Trump knocks CNN for 'completely false' report Gaetz was denied meeting MORE (D-Calif.) has proposed a “presidential crimes commission” to untangle and investigate some of Trump’s questionable actions as president.

Yes, the country needs healing. But honesty and accountability are part of national healing.

The greatest test of one of the founding principles of American life — no man is above the law in this country — will be on trial if Trump ends up in court.

It’s increasingly plausible that Trump’s greatest legacy could be as proof that even a man who held the highest office can end up in jail.

But I get it. Trump scared Cubans in Florida with talk about creeping socialism.

But Trump did well with Latinos beyond the Cuban-American community.

He won 35 percent of all Latino voters, including 32 percent of Puerto Ricans, according to the Fox data. In Arizona, which borders Mexico, he won 40 percent of the Latino vote. And everywhere, his biggest support among Latinos came from men.

The only way to explain the ‘bromance’ between men of color and Trump is cultural.

Latin machismo and Black gangsta rap lyrics have long had a fascination with big money, grabbing women, including porn stars, and Trump’s “La Vida Loca” lifestyle.

Many Latinos “like a strongman even when he’s the wrong man,” syndicated columnist Ruben Navarrette wrote last week.

What about Black men?

Just before the election, rapper 50 Cent said Trump’s racial antagonism was a secondary issue: “I don’t care [if] Trump doesn’t like Black people.” The bigger issue, he said, is not wanting to pay higher taxes under Joe Biden.

America’s first Black billionaire, Bob Johnson, also focused on money. He told CNBC that Black people can see that decades of voting for Democrats has led to “minimal return” with regard to “closing the wealth gap, the job creation and job opportunities.”

And John Legend, the singer, explained minority men growing politically close to Trump by saying:

“Some people see the meanness, the bullying, the selfishness of Donald Trump and they mistake it for strength, a kind of twisted masculinity. Some see his greed and they mistake it for being good at business.”

This cultural confusion takes on painful power when it allows the overwhelmingly white GOP to slap down talk about Trump’s racism.

The Fox exit polls showed Trump winning 25 percent of the non-white vote, enabling Republicans to insist he could not be racist if such a sizable number of Blacks and Latinos voted for him.

By their logic, the people of color who voted for Trump just gave the 55 percent of whites who voted for Trump — including 59 percent of white men — a free pass for ignoring his racism.

If so many Latino and Black men can vote for someone with a record of separating children from their parents at the Mexican border, then why ask whites to treat it as a deal-breaker for their vote?

Men of color also stood with a man who has blocked the ‘Dreamers,’ immigrant children who grew up in the U.S., from a path to citizenship.

This is a president who has overseen a spike in the rates of racial violence in the country. And don’t forget the growth of white supremacists under his watch into the FBI’s number one domestic terror threat.

Trump declared there were “very fine people on both sides” of the Charlottesville white supremacist march; he stopped diversity training programs and gutted programs for people of color to get housing and employment. Trump has been manifestly hostile to the interests of Black, brown and even poor white people.

And it is not just Clyburn and me.

Trump’s racism toward Blacks and Latinos is so well-established that half of all Americans in a July YouGov/Yahoo News poll said outright that he is a racist and another 13 percent could only say they are “not sure” whether he is a racist or not.

A Quinnipiac University poll in July 2019 found 80 percent of Black people and 55 percent of Latinos saying Trump is a racist.

A Fox News poll in July 2019 found 57 percent of Americans agree that Trump has no respect for racial minorities.

It’s sad to say, but a lot of Black and Latino voters, especially the men, got distracted by Trump’s boasts and bling.

But don’t lose sight of the possibility of history being made in the South.

After signing the 1964 Civil Rights Act into law, President Lyndon Johnson famously remarked that the Democratic Party would lose the South for a generation.

He was right. Southern politics has been solid red for most of the last 50 years.

But thanks to the implosion of the Republican Party under President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE, Democrats are in position to take a sledgehammer to the red wall that has been the basis of Republican strength in Congress.

Over the last month, polls put Democrats within striking distance of flipping U.S. Senate seats in Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, and even Mississippi (Mississippi!).

Here’s why: In every one of these states, an increasingly racially diverse, politically moderate electorate is asking GOP incumbents why they got on board the Trump train of old-time racial division.

Specifically, those Republicans have given him uncritical support even as Old South-style white supremacists rallied to Trump’s racially divisive rhetoric and grew into the nation’s number one terror threat, according to the FBI.

Trump’s history of stirring racial division is also a driving force in getting moderate white voters to be open to supporting black candidates.

Those white voters, often younger people who have moved to the South in recent years, are more likely than older white southerners to know Blacks, Latinos and Asians as neighbors and co-workers.

The need for an interracial political alliance in the South gained urgency in the last year due to recent controversial, high profile killings of Breonna Taylor in Kentucky, and Ahmaud Arbery and Rayshard Brooks in separate incidents in Georgia.

Those tragic events have given southern Democrats the chance at political upheaval.

It can only happen if Democrats achieve high black voter turn-out while successfully appealing to young and suburban whites.

The glue to bind this new political alliance is a message of racial peace coming from moderate, educated candidates, both black and white, who can’t be easily caricatured by Republicans as crazy left-wingers.

And then there is money.

The king of national fundraising in this year’s Senate races is a black southerner — Jaime Harrison, who has a Yale undergraduate degree and a Georgetown law degree. He has raised a record $100 million in his campaign to oust an incumbent, Sen.

Given South Carolina’s long history of slavery followed by rigid segregation, it is remarkable that a black man has a chance to win.

That history jumped into the contest last month when Harrison’s opponent, Graham, remarked: “If you’re a young, African American or an immigrant, you can go anywhere in this state, you just need to be conservative, not liberal.”

If Harrison wins, South Carolina will be the first state ever to be represented by two black people simultaneously in the U.S. Senate.

Brady retiring Tim Scott to participate in GOP event in Iowa MORE (R-S.C.), is currently the only black Republican in the Senate. The state is 69 percent white and 27 percent black, according to the last Census.

Demographic change is also impacting two Georgia Senate races. The New York Times put it this way in a recent story: “White residents now make up fewer than three in five voters in Georgia, and a wave of migration to the Atlanta area over the past decade has added roughly three quarters of a million people to the state’s major Democratic stronghold.”

One fast changing factor in the state’s politics is that 50 percent of voting-eligible Georgians are under the age of 45. And currently a third of that young, diverse population is black and — thanks to Trump — highly energized to turn out and vote.

The result of that infusion of new voters is that Raphael Warnock, a black minister, is in position to take advantage of an intraparty fight between GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler Kelly LoefflerLoeffler group targets Democrats with billboards around baseball stadium Warnock raises nearly M since January victory A proposal to tackle congressional inside trading: Invest in the US MORE and Rep.

If disaffected Republicans stay away from the polls in Georgia, now or in the likely run-off races, Warnock has a path to victory.

The biggest surprise on election night could be Mississippi where one poll released in September from the Tyson Group showed Democrat Mike Espy within one percentage point of incumbent Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith (R). Mississippi is 59 percent white, 38 percent black.

Espy, a black man with a Santa Clara law degree, served as Secretary of Agriculture under President Clinton.

Espy forced Hyde-Smith into a run-off in 2018 when neither got a majority of the vote.

In a solid red state, Hyde-Smith still generated national headlines in 2018 when she was caught on tape saying she would gladly “be in the front row” for a “public hanging.”

Those three races reveal the changing face of Democratic political prospects in the South.

And, of course, it was South Carolina’s black Democrats who set former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenObama, Clinton reflect on Mondale's legacy Biden, Harris commend Mondale in paving the way for female VP Mondale in last message to staff: 'Joe in the White House certainly helps' MORE’s campaign on the road to the party’s presidential nomination.

Wouldn’t it be something if they also delivered him a Democratic Congress to enact his first-term agenda?

51,Williams,Juan,foxnews,"The recent sight of people standing in long lines to vote — some waiting as long as 11 hours in Georgia — made me so proud to be an American that I couldn’t speak.

I just pointed at the TV to show my wife why I was choked up.

Americans holding tight to their right to vote are to my mind the essence of taking pride in a national government that is “of the people, by the people, for the people,” as President Abraham Lincoln put in his Gettysburg Address.

DEMS GRASP AT OPPORTUNITIES IN RED STATES AS ELECTION DAY LOOMS

In a modern America, where overnight delivery and fast food are the norm, the sight of people giving up hours of their time to vote is pure patriotism — a defiant act to protect our form of democratic governance.

Over the past four years President Trump — with the help of too many state Republican Party officials — has tried to put a friendly face on suppressing the votes of people who do not vote for him.



Trump gave the game away in March when he dismissed Democratic efforts to include protections to keep polling places open, and allow for same-day registration and early voting in the first coronavirus relief legislative package.



“The things they had in there were crazy … you’d never have a Republican elected in this country again,” Trump said in an interview on “Fox & Friends.”

Pay close attention to what the president said. If there are no limits on Americans turning out to vote, he thinks he will lose his reelection bid.

Trump’s reasoning is based on the results of recent presidential elections. Since 1988, the GOP has won the majority of votes in a presidential race only once – President Bush in 2004.

And as the years go by, the number of young and minority Americans in big cities and suburbs — areas that typically vote for Democrats — continues to grow.

Meanwhile, the number of White people in rural areas who typically back Republicans has been shrinking.

These demographic facts have led the GOP and its supporters to spend $20 million on 300 court cases to oppose state and local laws that make it easier to vote, according to the Center for Public Integrity.

Republicans in some states have also tried to place limits on the number of polling places and sites for early voting.

And of course, there is a major Trump donor now running the U.S. Postal Service, who critics say has purposely tried to hamstring the delivery of mail-in ballots.

Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., found that mail in several big cities — including Philadelphia, Baltimore and Detroit — recently had delays 20% of the time.

The president, however, claims he is fighting voter fraud. The flaw in that argument is the lack of evidence of widespread voter fraud.

“The truth is that after decades of looking for illegal voting, there’s no proof of widespread fraud,” Ben Ginsberg, one of the Republican Party’s top election lawyers, recently wrote in a Washington Post column.

“At most, there are isolated incidents — by both Democrats and Republicans,” Ginsberg wrote. “Elections are not rigged. Absentee ballots use the same process as mail-in ballots — different states use different labels for the same process.” He concluded that claims of widespread voter fraud are “unsustainable.”

But some political players do not bother to claim voter fraud in trying to stop people from voting.

In October, residents of a mostly Black poor Detroit neighborhood got robocalls warning that voting by mail could lead to debt collections and even being forced to take vaccinations.

These voter suppression efforts sometimes become public policy.

Georgia Republicans cut nearly 10% of the state’s polling places even as the number of voters increased.

“Voter suppression is preventing many from casting their ballots,” Martin Luther King III wrote on Twitter. The son of the civil rights leader told Georgia residents to “be prepared to protect your rights.”

There is a similar story in Texas. The state Supreme Court upheld an executive order from Republican Gov. Greg Abbott that each Texas county can have only one drop-off box for ballots. This means that Harris County — where the state’s biggest city, Houston, is located — has only one box. Note that more than 25% of the voters in Harris County are Black.

And there is a similarly upsetting story in Florida.

The state’s voters overwhelmingly approved an amendment to the state Constitution in 2018 to restore voting rights for felons. But the Republicans in the Legislature responded by passing a law requiring that the former convicts pay all of their outstanding debts and court costs before they can vote.

Critics called the law a “modern-day poll tax,” but it was upheld by a federal court. Just 67,000 felons out of the newly-eligible population of 1.4 million successfully registered to vote this year.

So, to all Americans who stood in line, who defied any effort to block you from voting, I say thank you.

With opposition to abortion as their guiding light, they have ignored multiple women who have charged Trump with sexual assault, his pay-offs to porn stars, the rise in white supremacy under his watch and his policies separating immigrant children from their parents.

ADVERTISEMENT

But with Barrett on the high court, the evangelicals can see a big pay-off on their number one issue – banning abortion.

Her confirmation hearing created an “Alice in Wonderland” moment.

Everyone watching saw the obvious — but no one was allowed to say — that President Trump, the GOP majority on the Senate Judiciary Committee, and evangelicals favored Barrett principally because of her opposition to abortion.

To keep up the charade, Barrett denied the obvious by claiming to have no opinion on abortion.

But Barrett signed her name to a 2006 newspaper ad that explicitly called for the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision to be overturned and decried its “barbaric legacy” of abortion.

It should be noted that Barrett failed to disclose this fact to the Senate Judiciary Committee in her official nomination paperwork.

Oh, and in 2013 she signed another anti-abortion advertisement condemning Roe v. Wade as a ruling that “killed 55 million unborn children.”

She also did not initially disclose that she was a featured speaker for two anti-abortion groups at Notre Dame.

Barrett told the Senate Judiciary Committee she signed one ad on her “way out of church,” and that her personal views on abortion will not impact her rulings as a judge.

If that’s the case, then why did she refuse to tell the committee her opinion of the 1973 Roe case establishing a constitutional right to abortion?

She also refused to reveal her views on the 1992 Planned Parenthood v. Casey decision which reaffirmed Roe and the right for women to have an abortion.

Barrett said it would “actually be wrong — a violation of the canons — for me to do that as a sitting judge…If I say I love it or I hate it, it signals to litigants that I might tilt one way or another on a pending case.”

When he ran for president, Trump said plainly the Supreme Court would overturn abortion rights “automatically” if he was elected and able to appoint enough justices to the court.

When asked last month on Fox News if a Supreme Court with three of his nominees would end abortion rights, Trump said: “It’s certainly possible…And maybe they’d give it back to the states. You just don’t know what’s going to happen.”

Oh, sure.

In his rhetoric and actions, Trump is ignoring a clear majority of Americans who support abortion rights.

An ABC/Washington Post poll this month found 62 percent of registered voters saying Roe v. Wade should be upheld, while 24 percent believed it should be overturned.

Barrett kept up the pretense of having no opinion on abortion when she refused to say if she agrees with the 1965 Griswold case which ended all state bans on birth control and gave Americans the right to privacy as a constitutional right. It is the foundation of the Roe decision.

Note that Chief Justice Roberts said Griswold was rightly decided at his confirmation hearing. Even Justices Alito and Thomas, fellow Catholics, said it was the right decision.

Instead, Barrett has pointed to the confirmation hearing for Justice Thurgood Marshall to argue that past statements and advocacy should not disqualify her from a seat on the court.

“Justice Marshall was chosen by Lyndon Johnson precisely because he was a hero in the fight for racial equality. It would be odd if those principles kept him from sitting in school desegregation cases, even if they made his judgments fairly predictable,” Barrett wrote as the co-author of a 1998 article.

Objection, your honor.

As a biographer of Justice Marshall — my bestselling book is called “Thurgood Marshall — American Revolutionary” — I know something about the man and his beliefs.

Marshall’s jurisprudence was rooted in expanding equal rights protection for all.

ADVERTISEMENT

Barrett’s jurisprudence is rooted in a belief that some rights should be restricted and eliminated on religious grounds — whether it is the rights of gay people to marry the person they love or a woman’s right to end her pregnancy.

Marshall was part of a 7-2 majority that voted in favor of legalizing abortion in the Roe case.

And in a 1977 case on the legality of using Medicaid to pay for abortions, he wrote that poor women, especially racial minorities, lose their right to equal protection under law when rich women can pay for an abortion but poor women do not have the same right.

“I am appalled at the ethical bankruptcy of those who preach a ‘right to life’ that means, under present social policies, a bare existence in utter misery for so many poor women and their children,” Marshall wrote in dissent.

So, Judge Barrett, I knew Justice Marshall and you are no Justice Marshall.

Trump’s October Surprise was grounded. He got nothing.

Then, Trump’s second attempt at an October Surprise also failed to take flight.

This time another U.S. attorney, John Bash, totally pulled the plug on a separate probe into the “unmasking” of Americans caught on phone taps talking with Russians, in this case Trump campaign officials.

“The greatest political scam, hoax in the history of our country,” Trump announced, implying that those involved deserved 50-year jail sentences.

Bash sent no one to jail — zero.

Again, Trump got nothing — no visions of Democrats in handcuffs to rev up the faithful at campaign rallies.

He is not happy with the attorney general.

“Unless Bill Barr indicts these people for crimes. ... To be honest, Bill Barr is going to go down as either the greatest attorney general in the history of the country or he’s going to go down as, you know, a very sad situation,” Trump said on Fox Business Network before Barr disappointed him.

Pay close attention to that quote.

Trump said out loud he is willing to go so low as to ask his attorney general to indict political opponents without any basis, weeks before the election.

Faced with collapsing poll numbers, Trump is open to using federal law enforcement to divert attention from his divisive talk and his failed handling of the coronavirus pandemic.

And he is still going at it, trying to go lower than low.

In the tradition of crime families, he turned to old friends to get the job done.

Bannon, who was indicted on federal fraud charges in August, contacted the paper about the emails, which were supposedly found on a hard drive left in a Delaware computer repair shop. Giuliani, the former New York mayor who also is under investigation, then gave a copy of the hard drive to the New York paper.

The story took flight on pro-Trump websites, especially after Facebook and Twitter declined to let their platforms be used to circulate the potentially explosive but unverified information.

Mainstream newspapers and computer security professionals pointed out that Giuliani refused to produce the actual emails, and there is no evidence that the then-vice president ever met with the man.

The Washington Post reported the next day that national security officials at the White House were warned last year that “Giuliani was being used to feed Russian misinformation to the president.”

The New York Times noted that American intelligence officials “had picked up chatter that stolen Burisma emails would be leaked in the form of an ‘October surprise.’”

So, a third attempt by Trump to launch an October Surprise remained grounded.

A fourth effort involved pressuring Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe John Lee RatcliffeTrump alumni launch America First Policy Institute Sunday shows preview: Democrats eye two-part infrastructure push; Michigan coronavirus cases surge Former Trump officials eye bids for political office MORE.

Ratcliffe declassified intelligence from the time of the 2016 campaign, including reports that Hillary Clinton’s campaign wanted to call attention to Russia’s ties to the Trump campaign.

This is the same reporting that the Senate Intelligence Committee, with a Republican majority, long ago discarded as unimportant.

Why? The committee heard from every U.S. intelligence agency that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to help Trump and damage Clinton.

But Trump later tweeted that he authorized “the total Declassification of any & all documents pertaining to the greatest political CRIME in American history, the Russia Hoax.”

And Ratcliffe ended up in a mud fight that damaged his reputation.

Former acting CIA Director Mike Morrell and former Under Secretary of Defense Mike Vickers called Ratcliffe’s actions “the most blatant and egregious politicization of intelligence that we, two career intelligence officers, have ever seen,” in a Washington Post op-ed calling for Ratcliffe to resign.

Trump’s political rhetoric has long been divorced from reality, much less a coherent strategy to win reelection.



But at best his repeated attempts to ignite an October Surprise seem to rely on grievances from the 2016 race — most of all, the same old attacks on Hillary Clinton.



Trump is now a desperate man clinging to power to stave off the humiliation of a defeat on Election Day.

He can try again to pressure Barr on indicting his political opponents on bogus charges.



But for now, Trump’s attempts to patch together another October Surprise are too low, even for Barr.



Now that is saying something.

So what if a Fox News national poll has him down by ten points with less than a month to go before Election Day?

So what if the latest Reuters-Ipsos poll has Biden with a 12-point lead nationally?

ADVERTISEMENT

So what if Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight favors Biden to win and posits that, out of all the possible outcomes, Trump would lose 85 percent of the time.

Those polls and the forecast are based on votes. But what do votes matter if the president refuses to acknowledge that he lost?

In a fury, he can call on the Supreme Court’s right-wing majority to invalidate the election results, as he fills conservative media with shouting about voter fraud.

His goal will be to remain in office at least until the pandemic is over, but most likely until the next election four years from now.

In addition to calling on the high court to play politics, Trump can also ask Republican-controlled state legislatures to ignore a Biden win. The strategy is to simply demand they show GOP loyalty by handing him their states’ electoral college votes.

The ignition switch for these perverse attacks on democracy is Trump casting doubt on the integrity of vote counting — even though there is little or no evidence of fraud in either mail-in voting or in-person voting.

At a September rally in North Carolina, Trump encouraged his fans to “watch those ballots…You know you have a Democrat governor; you have all these Democrats watching this stuff… Be poll-watchers when you go there. Watch all the thieving and stealing and robbing they do.”

By last week, the Trump campaign claimed to have a “50,000-plus army of volunteer observers across an array of battleground states like North Carolina and Pennsylvania, where operations are already underway,” according to Politico.

Trump is also using fear to deter voting.

At the first debate, he refused to condemn the Proud Boys, a far-right group known for violence, and also advised them to “stand by.” That was a wink and nod for extremists to act if they see that he is losing.

Trump has frequently said the only way he can lose is if the election is rigged.

These messages feed a strategy intended to “suppress and depress” the vote.

Emory University Professor Carol Anderson said the strategy starts with Trump telling Americans that their “vote won’t count, and it doesn’t matter what I do.”

She explained on a recent Slate.com podcast:

“So we have these suppressive techniques: voter ID, poll closures, massive voter-roll purges, eliminating early voting days…When you begin to see these five-hour lines, and the research is clear on this: It is designed to make folks think, ‘Oh, this is just too much,’ and…voter turnout goes down.”

This ‘Suppress the Vote — Depress the Vote’ strategy is also obvious to historian Jon Meacham.

Meacham said Trump’s “thuggish performance” at the presidential debate was all about “voter suppression.”

Trump wants people to view politics as so nasty that they decide “I’m not going to go stand in that line, I’m not to go catch COVID, I’m not going to worry about these mail-in ballots, to hell with it,” Meacham said on MSNBC.

But first comes the assault on information going to voters.

One front in that attack was revealed last week when Facebook and Twitter suspended or banned more than 200 accounts being run by a pro-Trump group that was paying teenagers to “cast doubt on the integrity of mail-in ballots, amplifying the erroneous claim that 28 million of them went missing in the past four elections,” The Washington Post reported.

ADVERTISEMENT

The young people were working for Rally Forge, a group tied to Turning Point USA, a larger organization long intent on convincing students to back Trump.

And there is more.

Last month, Michigan’s attorney general filed felony charges against two Trump supporters who allegedly flooded black Michigan neighborhoods with robocalls warning that “personal information for those who vote by mail will be shared with police tracking down warrants, credit card companies collecting outstanding debt.”

The power of those disinformation efforts is amplified by Russian propagandists, according to a Department of Homeland Security report released last week.

“Russia is the likely primary covert influence actor and purveyor of disinformation and misinformation within the Homeland,” the DHS reported. They said the memes, the manipulated videos, and the outright lies aim to hurt Biden’s campaign “as part of a broader effort to divide and destabilize America.”

FBI Director Christopher Wray told a Congressional hearing last month, “We certainly have seen very active efforts by the Russians to influence our elections in 2020,” citing the use of social media, state media and other types of propaganda.

Trump’s plan is obvious: declare the election rigged and stay in office.

Every patriotic American has to fight Trump’s plan — it is a threat to democracy.

Now take a look at what has happened since Biden called out Trump at the debate.

Do you see a pattern of racism?

ADVERTISEMENT

First, it was revealed last week that Trump administration officials are being told to speak up for a 17-year-old Trump supporter charged with killing two people. The teen allegedly crossed state lines with a gun to oppose people protesting about the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man, in Kenosha, Wis.

Department of Homeland Security officials are urged to say in defense of Kyle Rittenhouse that he “took his rifle to the scene of the rioting to help defend small business owners,” NBC News reported. Rittenhouse is charged with first-degree murder.

Second, the National Park Service suspended hundreds of diversity training programs intended to help federal workers end sexual harassment, bias against disabled people and racial discrimination. The Department of Veterans Affairs similarly canceled a racial diversity training program.

Why?

According to a September memo from the director of the Office of Management and Budget, Russell Vought, Trump has directed him to stop federal agencies from funding training on the impact of white privilege because such teaching is “divisive, un-American propaganda.”

After the memo became public, Trump tweeted: “Americans should be taught to take PRIDE in our Great Country, and if you don’t, there’s nothing in it for you!”

When Trump’s demand to end the training sessions was raised as a topic at the debate, Biden responded by saying explicitly: “He’s racist.”

And there’s more to this pattern of Trump’s racist actions since the debate.

Here’s a particularly sad example.

Only 15,000 refugees will be allowed into the U.S. next year, the lowest number since the 1980 Refugee Act took effect.

“This absurdly low number is based on nothing more than xenophobic political pandering, and it’s no surprise that this all-time low comes during an election year,” the head of the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Services, Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, told The Washington Post.

Then Trump told a rally of his fans in Minnesota that Biden would “inundate your state with a historic flood of refugees.”

He whipped up the crowd by saying that Rep. Ilhan Omar Ilhan OmarBiden on refugee cap: 'We couldn't do two things at once' McCarthy: GOP not the party of 'nativist dog whistles' White House reverses course on refugee cap after Democratic eruption MORE (D-Minn.), a naturalized American born in Somalia, wants to tell “us how to run our country — can you believe it?”

In response, Trump’s fans roared: “Lock her up!”

Last year, Trump said Omar and the three other nonwhite Democratic congresswomen known as “the squad” should “go back” to the “crime infested places from which they came” — even though they are all American citizens, have all sworn allegiance to the Constitution and, with the exception of Omar, are all American-born.

When Trump was criticized for those comments last year he said he does not have “a racist bone in my body.”

But the squad’s most famous member, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Alexandria Ocasio-CortezOvernight Energy: Treasury creates hub to fight climate change through finance | Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez introduce 'Green New Deal for Public Housing' | White House defends 'aspirational' goal of 62,500 refugees Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez introduce 'Green New Deal for Public Housing' MORE (D-N.Y.), shot back on Twitter that Trump may not have racist bones, but “you have a racist mind in your head, and a racist heart in your chest.”

Of course, since the debate, discussion about Trump’s racism has focused on his initial refusal to condemn the Proud Boys, a far-right group.

“Proud Boys, stand back and stand by. ... Somebody’s got to do something about antifa and the left,” Trump said, adding that violence and disorder “is not a right-wing problem. This is a left-wing problem.”

Trump’s blindness to the danger of violent white supremacists requires him to ignore the FBI.

At a September hearing before the House Homeland Security Committee, FBI Director Christopher Wray said white supremacists make up the largest cohort of “the most lethal of all domestic extremists” since 2001.

Beyond that, the president’s false equivalence about racially motivated violence is factually wrong, according to his own administration officials.

“When white supremacists act as terrorists, more people per incident are killed,” testified Trump’s own acting deputy secretary of Homeland Security, Ken Cuccinelli, at a Senate hearing in September.

The politics of Trump’s racial rhetoric is often interpreted as a strategy to keep a firm hold on his base, which includes racists.

For example, the neo-Nazi website Daily Stormer celebrated Trump’s call to “stand by” as a call to “get ready for war.”

That “war” is tied to Trump’s effort to question the validity of the election if he loses.

After last week’s debate, his use of race to divide the country is a pattern that can’t be ignored.

It is a clear and present danger.

63,Williams,Juan,thehill,"One of the first questions at Tuesday night’s presidential debate is sure to be about the far-right’s frantic rush to get a Trump nominee added to the Supreme Court with the election little more than a month away.

But there is a bigger question.

Can we now stop playing games?

ADVERTISEMENT

Let’s just accept that every opinion from the high court is now nothing more than a Republican or Democrat majority spinning the law to fit the political agenda of the red or blue team.

President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE’s actions remove all pretense about justices as impartial, learned people upholding the law. This is an exercise in brute politics.

What we have now at the very top of the American judicial system are nine politicians wearing the robes of Supreme Court justices.

This fits with Trump transforming the Centers for Disease Control from a trusted source of information on heath to a political agency being used to minimize his failed handling of a pandemic.

It fits with Attorney General William Barr Bill BarrAmy Coney Barrett receives million advance for book deal: report Garland rescinds Trump-era memo curtailing consent decrees Boehner: Trump 'stepped all over their loyalty' by lying to followers MORE using the Justice Department to protect Trump and his pals — from Michael Flynn to Roger Stone Roger Jason StoneThere was Trump-Russia collusion — and Trump pardoned the colluder On The Money: Moderates' 0B infrastructure bill is a tough sell with Democrats | Justice Dept. sues Trump ally Roger Stone for unpaid taxes Justice Dept. sues Trump ally Roger Stone for unpaid taxes MORE — while looking to produce damaging charges against Democrats.

It fits with Trump undermining public trust in the FBI and CIA after they found evidence of Russian interference to help him in both the 2016 election and the current election.

Much of that can be repaired over time beginning with a new president.

But the Supreme Court is different.

Supreme Court justices get lifetime appointments.

And in a country founded on the idea that it is a nation of laws, a lack of trust in the Supreme Court’s ability to be impartial portends long-term damage.

A Gallup poll taken earlier this year found that just 40 percent of Americans say they have either a “great deal” or “quite a lot” of confidence in the Supreme Court. A much greater number, 58 percent, said they had only “some” or “very little.”

Keep in mind, Trump has no mandate to dismantle trust in the court.

To the contrary, he is a president who lost the popular vote by almost 3 million votes. His job approval rating has never reached 50 percent in the RealClearPolitics polling average.

If you want to rip out your hair, consider that if Trump’s latest nominee is confirmed it will mean that 15 of the last 19 Supreme Court justices have been named by Republican presidents.

This tyranny of the minority — there are more Democrats in America than Republicans — led Ian Millhiser to write in Vox: “If Trump fills the Ginsburg seat, fully one-third of the Court [the three justices put on the court by Trump] will be controlled by judges with no democratic legitimacy.”

Several polls done last week showed a clear majority of Americans think the current opening on the court should be filled by the winner of the November election.

A Reuters/Ipos poll has 62 percent saying the next president deserves to make the nomination. That includes 49 percent of Republicans who say the nomination is best left for after the election.

A Morning Consult/Politico poll had 50 percent of registered voters agreeing that the winner of the 2020 race should get to pick the nominee.

And Rasmussen, often favorable to Trump, also found 51 percent of likely voters saying that the winner of the election is the right person to make the pick for the court.

Public opinion in opposition to Trump filling another Supreme Court seat before the election also reflects the political games he played with his first two picks.

Now we have Trump’s nominee, Amy Coney Barrett, a polarizing Republican judicial activist hostile to abortion rights and government regulation of big industry.

If Barrett is confirmed, there is nothing stopping the new 6-3 conservative majority on the Court from overturning Roe v. Wade and denying millions of American women the right to an abortion.

The new Trump majority on the Court could also move to roll back same-sex marriage and legal protections prohibiting discrimination against LGBTQ Americans.

There is nothing to stop Trump’s team on the court from striking down the Affordable Care Act and legal protections for people with pre-existing conditions.

Democrats are on the verge of being run over on the Supreme Court. But the Founding Fathers and their heirs will mourn the loss of an independent judiciary.

Why is Sanders feeding doubts about Biden instead of pitching in to help? Why isn’t he busy corralling his big following of “Bernie Bros” to get behind Biden and beat Trump?

Here is Sanders in a recent PBS interview:

“Biden’s views are not mine. My program was much more progressive — but he has a strong program. And I think he’s got to do a better job in getting it out, to be honest with you.”

Here’s the best interpretation of Sanders’ critique of Biden:

“Senator Sanders is confident that Joe Biden is in a very strong position to win this election, but nevertheless feels there are areas the campaign can continue to improve upon,” said Sanders’ former presidential campaign manager, Faiz Shakir.

Shakir pointed to Biden’s need to boldly lay out plans to “raise wages, create millions of good-paying jobs, lower the cost of prescription drugs and expand health care coverage.”

Now let’s hear the worst interpretation of Sanders’ jabs at Biden:

“Why is it that every single year the Republicans seem to ratchet it to the right [and] Democrats feel compelled to follow them to the middle? We’ve lost all semblance of any true Left party…that is genuinely looking out for the interests of poor, working class people, in particular labor,” Briahna Joy Gray, Sanders’ former press secretary, recently argued in a Vice News interview.

Keep in mind, Gray abandoned Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' Cuba readies for life without Castro Chelsea Clinton: Pics of Trump getting vaccinated would help him 'claim credit' MORE and the Democrats in 2016 to vote for Jill Stein of the Green Party, opening the door for Trump.

In the Vice News interview, Gray also said: “Bernie supporters aren’t rooting for Biden to lose. They’re rooting for Biden to be the kind of candidate who we believe…would be more electable and a more ethical and humane president.”

Did Gray say “ethical and humane”?

Wait a minute.

This election offers a binary choice. Does the left consider Trump more “ethical and humane” than Biden?

Are there Sanders fans who really think “ethical and humane” wins the day if they decide Biden is too moderate to get their support and stay home, or vote for Kanye West Kanye Omari WestAfter fleeing Trump, will celebs return to DC under Biden? Amazon's shutdown of Parler is a threat to all small businesses 2020's top political celebrity moments MORE — either of which amounts to support for Trump?

Meanwhile, Trump has been hammering Biden for being too close to Sanders and his brand of democratic socialism.

Trump called Biden a “puppet of the radical left movement that seeks to destroy the American way of life” at a rally in Pennsylvania last month.

A recent Trump campaign ad featured a woman insisting the president is “the only barrier between us and socialism.”

In any case, Biden’s response is clear. “Do I look like a radical socialist with a soft spot for rioters?,” he asked reporters late last month.

He might also point to FBI reports that Russia’s authoritarian government is once again backing Trump, this time with online attacks denigrating Biden.

The facts are on Biden’s side.

Biden does not fully support the Green New Deal. He is not backing Medicare-for-All. He opposes the slogan “Defund the Police.”

This is why polls show Trump is failing to convince voters that Biden is some sort of wild-eyed radical.

Biden’s moderate positions are in line with Democrats who selected him as the nominee with the best chance to beat Trump.

By contrast, Sanders has twice been unsuccessful in winning the Democrats’ nomination, first losing to Hillary Clinton in 2016 and losing to Biden this year.

It was over a year ago when former President Obama warned Democrats against creating a “circular firing squad where you start shooting at your allies because one of them has strayed from purity on the issues.”

Obama’s words have added power because he created a winning coalition for Democrats in two successful runs for the White House.

The Obama coalition crossed racial lines. It was urban and suburban. Young and old came together. Environmentalists stood with women’s groups and labor unions.

It is one of the most impressive achievements of modern politics, especially when you consider it held together to elect and reelect the first black president.

Hillary Clinton won the popular vote in 2016 but failed to hold enough of the Obama coalition in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania to deliver a win in the electoral college.

When Sanders suspended his 2020 campaign, he told CBS’s Stephen Colbert Stephen Tyrone ColbertColbert: 'There's no avoiding' Trump, but 'I don't like saying his name' Colbert mocks Gaetz after Trump denies he asked for a pardon Meeting between Trump, Ohio Senate candidates turns tense: report MORE: “I will do everything I can to make sure Donald Trump is not reelected.”

Senator, don’t take your eyes off that big prize.

66,Williams,Juan,thehill,"Step right up — get your scorecard for the Biden-Trump debate.

First, keep in mind that this debate is more important to the guy playing catch-up in the polls — Trump — than the guy holding the lead — Biden.

ADVERTISEMENT

Here is the pre-game scouting report:

The party conventions did not shake Biden’s seven percentage point lead in national polls. Trump’s campaign is in a budget crunch and cutting advertising in swing states. Biden has ads on the air thanks to a record fundraising haul in August.

Oh, don’t forget this debate is unique in that the country is so politically polarized that polls show there are few undecided voters.

So, Trump is the one who needs the debate to be a big game-changer.

On the other side, Biden’s primary need is a steady debate performance. He wants to cleanse himself of Trump’s mudslinging claims — specifically that Biden is an old man who has lost his marbles and needs a teleprompter to answer any question.

Even before the conventions, Trump was aiming to unnerve Biden by calling for extra debates.

Rudy Giuliani Rudy GiulianiMyPillow files countersuit against Dominion Voting Systems Guilfoyle named as national chair of Greitens' Senate campaign in Missouri Greitens Senate bid creates headache for GOP MORE, on behalf of Trump’s campaign, pushed for a fourth debate in early September. He wrote to the Commission on Presidential Debates that people in 16 states will have mail-in ballots before September 29, the date of the first debate.

Nice try, but no cigar. Any voter with an early ballot, the debate commission replied, can wait and watch the debate.

Meanwhile, Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiWhite House readies for Chauvin verdict House GOP's McClain responds to Pelosi calling her 'that woman' GOP struggles to rein in nativism MORE (D-Calif.) trolled Trump by going exactly the opposite way on calls for more debates.

Tongue-in-check, she announced to a room full of reporters, “Just don’t tell anybody I told you this…” before saying in a low voice that she would cancel all the debates.

Trump tells so many lies, Pelosi explained, that he has no “association with truth, evidence, data and facts.”

In one deft move, she skewered Trump and his supporters by reminding them that fact-checkers rank Trump as the biggest political liar of all time.

Biden never wavered on participating in the debates.

Biden has presented himself as a stable, adult alternative to Trump before the debates begin.

And why give any credence to Trump’s claim that Biden is looking to avoid the debate?

That might bolster Trump’s crass suggestions that Biden is weak of mind and — get this — has been on some form of performance enhancing drugs to help his debating prowess.

Yes, like a schoolyard bully, Trump is trying to unsettle Biden with pre-game trash talking. The 74-year-old Trump slandered the 77-year-old Biden back in June as “not all there, everybody knows, and it’s sad.”

Trump is repeating himself here.

He threw the same suggestion of drug use at Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' Cuba readies for life without Castro Chelsea Clinton: Pics of Trump getting vaccinated would help him 'claim credit' MORE before the last of their three 2016 debates. In the second of those debates, he had famously tried to provoke her by walking behind her. In their final clash, he interrupted as she spoke to complain that Clinton is a “nasty woman.”

Clinton did not buckle. But Trump is not changing his tactics.

Politico recently reported Trump’s debate preparation team is “studying Biden’s idiosyncrasies,” looking for any tactic to make Biden nervous or angry, apparently in hope of making Biden lose his train of thought or even resurrect the Democrat’s childhood stuttering.

The Biden team sees Trump’s pre-debate strategy as predictable. It is all about put-downs, intimidation and bullying.

“I think I know how to handle bullies — we’ll find out,” Biden said last week when asked about debating Trump.

“I hope I don’t get baited into getting into a brawl with this guy,” Biden added. “It’s going to be hard because I predict he’s going to be shouting.”

Let’s not forget Biden has 40 years of experience with debates. He was widely credited as the winner of his two vice-presidential debates against Sarah Palin in 2008 and Paul Ryan Paul Davis RyanOn The Money: Senate confirms Gensler to lead SEC | Senate GOP to face off over earmarks next week | Top Republican on House tax panel to retire Trump faces test of power with early endorsements Lobbying world MORE in 2012.

Biden’s debate strategy, his aides say, is presenting his agenda to voters while pointing out Trump’s failure as a leader and his many broken promises.

Team Biden goes into the debate with the advantage of the whole country being recently reminded of Trump’s failures and broken promises.

Journalist Bob Woodward’s latest book “Rage” has Trump on tape admitting that he downplayed the killing power of the coronavirus.

Woodward also quotes Trump’s former Secretary of Defense James Mattis James Norman MattisBiden's is not a leaky ship of state — not yet Rejoining the Iran nuclear deal would save lives of US troops, diplomats The soft but unmatched power of US foreign exchange programs MORE calling Trump “dangerous” and “unfit” for office.

Mattis’ indictment fits with the bombshell report from the Atlantic’s Jeffrey Goldberg that Trump disparaged American soldiers killed in action as “losers” and “suckers.”

Woodward also reports Trump divulged to him the existence of a classified nuclear weapons program in casual conversation.

So, Biden is loaded for a fight. But Trump is a showman. He brought women who accused former President Clinton of sexual misconduct to one debate with Hillary Clinton.

So, get ready to Tweet, post to Facebook, and add to your Instagram story.

The debates have the power to change the race.

Fireworks swirled around the Washington Monument after Trump accepted the GOP nomination on the White House lawn on Aug. 27. They spelled “TRUMP” in the night sky.

When Trump ran for president he promised to “drain the swamp” of Washington political corruption.

Well, the inspector general was looking into how Pompeo used the department staff to run errands, such as picking up takeout food orders and the family dry cleaning.

If you think that was bad, how about this? Pompeo spoke at the convention, live from Jerusalem, while on a taxpayer-funded trip.

Really.

Oh, and the head of the Department of Homeland Security used the White House to stage a naturalization ceremony starring the president. It became a video segment for the GOP convention.

“It’s starting to seem like the Trump administration is going out of its way to find new ways to violate federal law,” said government watchdog group, the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. The group was referring specifically to the Hatch Act, which prohibits partisan political activities by federal employees.

Trump has now turned the tables on the press.

His press office recently announced they have compiled a “very large dossier” on a Washington Post writer, David Fahrenthold, after he reported that “taxpayers have paid Trump’s businesses more than $900,000 since he took office.”

That was followed by an act of screaming hypocrisy when a former Florida attorney general, Pam Bondi (R), tore into former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenObama, Clinton reflect on Mondale's legacy Biden, Harris commend Mondale in paving the way for female VP Mondale in last message to staff: 'Joe in the White House certainly helps' MORE and his son at the convention for allegedly taking money from foreign governments.

Her charges against the Bidens have long been reviewed and found lacking. But Bondi said: “If they want to make this election between who is saving America and who is swindling America, bring it on.”

Bondi’s hypocrisy encompasses her work as a registered agent for Qatar, a foreign government dealing with charges of corrupt dealings in its bid for the soccer World Cup.

As for the baseless charge that the Biden family took in millions from a foreign government, it is hard to ignore that Trump’s daughter Ivanka was granted valuable trademarks by China, including three approved on the same day she dined with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping.

And more muck emerges from the swamp daily.

“As Election Day looms, MAGA meme moguls are enjoying explosive surges in traffic …Their thriving cottage industry serves as a free propaganda operation for the president’s campaign” — and brings money to anyone willing to dive into the Trump swamp, wrote Jesselyn Cook.

68,Williams,Juan,thehill,"It was a surprise to me.

Every night of last week’s Republican National Convention featured a steady parade of mostly black men — from football star Herschel Walker to Georgia State Rep. Vernon Jones (D) — saying racism isn’t a problem in America and President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE is not a racist.

Jones said Democrats don’t “want Black people to leave their mental plantation.” He added that he had “news” for Democrats: “We are free people with free minds.”

ADVERTISEMENT

Well, if that is true, then an amazing number of free black people think Trump is a racist and feeding the fires of racial hatred.

Here are the numbers.

Eighty-eight percent of black people told Marist College pollsters in June that Trump has increased racial tension. Earlier this year, another poll, from the Washington Post and Ipsos, found more than 80 percent of black Americans said Trump is racist.

Keep in mind it is not just black people who think Trump is racist. Among free-thinking Americans of all ethnicities, 52 percent say Trump is racist, according to a poll by YouGov/Yahoo.

And while Trump describes the words ‘Black Lives Matter’ as a “symbol of hate,” 84 percent of black people with free minds support the movement, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll in June. And 52 percent of all Americans are “sympathetic” to Black Lives Matter’s goals, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll done last month.

Maybe that is why free-minded black people give former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenObama, Clinton reflect on Mondale's legacy Biden, Harris commend Mondale in paving the way for female VP Mondale in last message to staff: 'Joe in the White House certainly helps' MORE a 74-percentage point lead — 83-9 — over Trump, according to a new Morning Consult poll.

So why, then, did the Trump campaign spend so much convention time having black faces lead a ‘gaslight’ crusade to create an alternate reality in which Trump is a man intent on healing racial wounds?

Well, it is a mistake to think those black faces on the convention stage were speaking to black people. They were on stage to speak to white women in the suburbs and white men in Trump’s base.

Their first job was to get white, suburban women to stop seeing Trump as a racist.

White female voters went for Trump by nine points in 2016. But in the 2018 midterms they split their vote and gave Democrats control of the House. Recent polls show women favor Biden by “an eye-popping 23 percentage points, according to an average of national polls since late June,” according to the Washington Post.

And when Trump sent federal agents into cities “some 44 percent of suburban Americans said they thought the federal agents were being used for political purposes,” according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll.

Currently, suburban voters favor Biden. But according to the Morning Consult poll, after Trump’s fear-filled convention pitch, Biden leads by 8 points with suburbanites, as opposed to 14 points before the convention.

Trump’s plan to win back those suburbanites, especially the white women, is out in the open.

In July, he tweeted: “Suburban Housewives of America…Biden will destroy your neighborhood and your American Dream. I will preserve it.”

Trump is also promising to end Obama administration efforts to get suburban governments to build more moderate and low-income housing.

That pledge is a plainly racist appeal from Trump to the people he calls “housewives,” that he will save them from criminals and an influx of any neighbors who are not upper income, and white.

Trump needed black voices to tell white women that kind of thinking isn’t racist while also slamming black people as failing to think for themselves.

ADVERTISEMENT

It doesn’t stop there.

Trump-loving black voices at the GOP convention had another job.

Tell Trump’s heavily white, male base of voters that they are not racist for backing Trump and America is not a racist country.

Trump’s lawyer and friend Rudy Giuliani Rudy GiulianiMyPillow files countersuit against Dominion Voting Systems Guilfoyle named as national chair of Greitens' Senate campaign in Missouri Greitens Senate bid creates headache for GOP MORE spoke at the convention and called Black Lives Matter one of the root causes of an “unprecedented wave of lawlessness.” Before the convention he labeled “Black Lives Matter” as part of “domestic terrorist groups — without any doubt.”

What was the point of all the rhetoric about crime at a time when crime is at near record lows?

Rick Wilson, a former GOP strategist who worked for Giuliani and now opposes Trump, said the point is that “They’re coming for you, they’re coming for you to your suburbs, these Black Lives Matter [protesters.]”

But Giuliani and Pence are white voices. Again, Trump needed black voices to assert that the real problem is that blacks can’t think for themselves and the racial justice movement is just an excuse for looting, violence and chaos.

The strategy was revealed when a white woman, Kellyanne Conway Kellyanne Elizabeth ConwayKellyanne Conway joins Ohio Senate candidate's campaign Mark Zuckerberg, meet Jean-Jacques Rousseau? The Hill's Morning Report - Biden: Let's make a deal on infrastructure, taxes MORE, a senior advisor to Trump, said plainly that the Trump campaign benefits from “more chaos and anarchy and vandalism and violence,” because it offers voters a “very clear choice on who’s best on public safety and law and order.”

That led Biden to say that Trump is “just pouring gasoline on the racial flames that are burning now.”

Every day of the convention, Trump turned to black voices to tell white voters to ignore reports of racial fires burning in America. I’m black, they said, and it is just a false alarm.

Karen Bass Karen Ruth BassBass 'hopeful' on passing police reform: 'Republicans that I am working with are operating in good faith' Sunday shows preview: Russia, US exchange sanctions; tensions over policing rise; vaccination campaign continues Lawmakers demand justice for Adam Toledo: 'His hands were up. He was unarmed' MORE (D-Calif.). His thinking seemed to be that Bass was a better bet to unify the party because of her leadership of the Congressional Black Caucus and ties to advocacy groups on the left.

As Biden looked over the field at a time of nationwide Black Lives Matter protests, Harris’s work as a prosecutor in California did her no favors.

Critics said she was slow to investigate police shootings and noted that she appealed a ruling that the death penalty is unconstitutional.

And then she butted heads with Chris Dodd, a leader on Biden’s vice presidential selection team.

Harris famously refused to kowtow to Dodd, the former senator, when he asked her if she had remorse for smacking Biden in the first debate. She said it was just hardball politics when she knocked Biden for opposing mandatory school busing in the 1970s.

And there was grumbling about her failure in the race for the Democratic nomination.

She went into the race as a leading contender. But her campaign was poorly organized. And she never generated enthusiasm among voters, specifically black voters.

Remember, she dropped out before the first primary vote.

OK, but now those problems are in the past. Harris is joining a strong, existing campaign organization.

Her ties to Black Lives Matter activists have also improved. During her speech accepting the nomination, she memorably said: “There is no vaccine for racism.” She also read out loud the names of victims of police brutality, George Floyd and Breonna Taylor.

But even now there is concern about her past waffling on issues, most of all ""Medicare for All.""

You can expect Vice President Pence to mention in their debate that Harris backed Sanders’s single-payer health plan in the Senate before changing her position in the primaries.

As a candidate, she shifted to a plan described by The Wall Street Journal as a “government-run health care system that would maintain a limited role for private plans.”

Pence will also remind union members that while Biden supports the U.S.-Mexico-Canada deal that President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE negotiated to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement, Harris voted against the deal. She said it lacked environmental protections.

Those splits contributed to the Biden camp’s surprisingly long deliberations over naming a vice president.

Harris was the early favorite. But questions about her waffling led critics to argue her ambition was greater than her principles. That allowed other candidates to rise and fall as the flavor of the day among Biden’s inner circle.

Still, Harris consistently scored well with former President Obama, who counseled Biden on the pick.

Now all the hesitation looks crazy.

With the excitement Harris is generating — especially among black women and immigrants but also white women — and the flood of donations, she is clearly the right pick.

Note the importance of her support from suburban white women. The Democrats’ big win in the 2018 midterms, reclaiming the majority in the House, was based on those suburbanites. Already, 59 percent of female suburbanites disapprove of Trump, according to a July Wall Street Journal-NBC News poll.

And then there is the element of relief in Harris’s selection for deep pocketed, mostly white corporate donors who are much more at ease with Harris than with Warren’s tough approach to big tech monopolies and Wall Street regulation.

Harris even got a backhanded endorsement from Trump when he said her tough questioning of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh Brett Michael KavanaughBiden's court-packing theater could tame the Supreme Court's conservatives Trump knocks CNN for 'completely false' report Gaetz was denied meeting NY Times beclowns itself by normalizing court-packing 'to balance the conservative majority' MORE was “extraordinarily nasty.”

As Biden said at his first event with Harris: “Is anyone surprised that Donald Trump has a problem with a strong woman?”

Harris is the first woman of color — and only the fourth woman — to appear on a major party’s presidential ticket.

“Yet so many of the Black women who helped secure that victory [passage of the 19th Amendment giving women the right to vote a hundred years ago] were still prohibited from voting, long after its ratification,” Harris recounted in her acceptance speech.

“But they were undeterred. Without fanfare or recognition, they organized, testified, rallied, marched and fought — not just for their vote, but for a seat at the table.”

Welcome to the biggest campaign table of all, Sen. Harris.

85,Williams,Juan,thehill,"You hear a lie.

You call it out as a lie.

But the liar keeps lying. His lies make news.

ADVERTISEMENT

And social media executives allow the lies to stay on their platforms, attracting eyeballs and advertisers. The lies keep spreading.

But when the leaders of social media companies are asked why they allow lies to spread, they hide behind claims of free speech for all.

It is enough to make you crazy.

But we’re not crazy.

What is crazy is the corrupt state of American political debate as we head into the home stretch of the 2020 presidential race.

This problem is not limited to spoken lies.

You say you saw Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiWhite House readies for Chauvin verdict House GOP's McClain responds to Pelosi calling her 'that woman' GOP struggles to rein in nativism MORE (D-Calif.) drunk at a press conference?

ADVERTISEMENT

No, you didn’t.

You were one of three million people on Facebook who saw a doctored tape of a Pelosi press conference with her speech intentionally slowed to make her look like a drunk.

Oh, did you notice the Nazi symbol in a June Trump campaign advertisement attacking the “dangerous mobs of far-left groups…running through our streets and causing absolute mayhem?”

Facebook took that one down after the Anti-Defamation League complained that the upside-down red triangle is commonly used by “modern extremist groups and white supremacists in the United States.”

That is just a small taste of the social media universe of lies, hate speech and conspiracy theories now distorting American politics.

So, how do you tell Americans that easy access to social media, including videos, comes at the cost of being manipulated, being unable to know the truth from a lie?

How can Americans deal with a president willing to tweet, “When the looting starts, the shooting starts” — a threat of violence against people protesting the murder of a black man by police?

How are Americans to know what to think about a presidential tweet of a video in which a doctor echoes President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE’s baseless claim that hydroxychloroquine is a cure for COVID-19? Did you know that the same doctor contends sex with demons and aliens is the root cause of many illnesses?

Supporters of the QAnon conspiracy theory, which spread on social media, regularly show up at Trump rallies to support him as a secret agent trying to bring down an international cabal of the powerful elite, who are pedophiles.

One of the conspiracy crowd brought a gun into a D.C. pizza parlor a few years back because he read on the internet that it was a front for a child sex trafficking ring run by Democrats. Another backer of the conspiracy theory, Marjorie Taylor Greene, is almost certain to be elected to Congress in November. Greene recently won the GOP primary in Georgia's heavily Republican 14th district — proof of how these toxic beliefs are seeping into the mainstream.

A recent Frontline documentary on PBS — “The United States of Conspiracy” — focused on how Alex Jones developed a fan base by promoting conspiracy theories. For example, he said the September 11, 2001 attacks were an inside job by the U.S. government. As a presidential candidate, Trump appeared on his show and praised Jones’ “amazing” reputation.

But when Congressional Democrats call out this cesspool of lies, propaganda and intentional distortion, they are accused of engaging in “cancel culture,” or unfairly punishing Trump’s right to speak freely to his followers.

Congressional Republicans at a recent hearing with social media leaders said the real problem is that social media executives are “out to get conservatives — that’s not a hunch, that’s not a suspicion, that’s a fact,” in the words of Rep. Jim Jordan James (Jim) Daniel JordanTop House Republicans ask Harris for meeting on border The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Facebook - All US adults can get vaccine; decision Friday on J&J vax Waters: Fauci 'was being bullied' by Jordan during hearing MORE (R-Ohio).

No, it is absolutely not a fact.

In fact, the heads of the big social media companies have become whipping boys for the liars and hateful extremists who falsely claim to be victims of left-wing bias while continuing to use social media platforms to weaponize political misinformation.

Meanwhile, the high-tech executives are happy that the Trump administration takes a hands-off approach to breaking up their vast monopolies.

Earlier this month, the American Psychological Association said that by providing a platform for hateful speech, Facebook is increasing prejudice in the country and “knowingly harming the welfare of [its] consumers, employees and shareholders.”

And 20 state attorneys general wrote a letter to Mark Zuckerberg Mark Elliot ZuckerbergHillicon Valley: Apple approves Parler's return to App Store | White House scales back response to SolarWinds, Microsoft incidents | Pressure mounts on DHS over relationship with Clearview AI Facebook unveils new audio features Hillicon Valley: Biden administration sanctions Russia for SolarWinds hack, election interference MORE, the head of Facebook, calling on him to do more to stop his site’s role in accelerating the nationwide rise in hate crimes, harassment and promotion of conspiracy theories that lead to violence.

In June, several hundred Facebook employees protested that the company was giving Trump an open platform to spread political propaganda.

Big corporations, including Verizon and Disney, have joined a boycott of Facebook for its indifference to the reality that it is a springboard for hate speech.

Just this month, Facebook took down a post of a Trump video in which he falsely said children are “almost immune” to COVID-19.

Yet Congressional Republicans continue to play the grievance game, pretending to be victims of ""cancel culture,"" while refusing to deal with Trump’s lies.

They accept no responsibility for the damage being done to the idea of telling the truth, the basis on which a free people make informed decisions and vote for the best leaders.

Ten years ago, I wrote a book about the danger of politically correct speech: “Muzzled — the Assault on Honest Debate.”

Today there is a far greater threat to honest debate — the flood of lies and distortion on social media.

Well, Mr. President, the wife of the late David Nagy thinks you are wrong.

She is furious at you about the death of her 79-year-old husband.

ADVERTISEMENT

“Family members believe David’s death was needless,” Stacey Nagy wrote in her husband’s newspaper obituary. “They blame his death ... on Trump, [Texas Gov. Greg] Abbott and all the politicians who did not take this pandemic seriously and were more concerned with their popularity and votes than lives.”

Mrs. Nagy’s anger at Trump fits with the political message in another obituary in North Carolina:

“In lieu of flowers, think of Mrs. Thomas while casting your vote to remove President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE from office,” said the obituary for 82-year-old Sandra Shuler Thomas in the Citizen-Times of Asheville.

And then there is the death of a well-known senior citizen — someone I knew and liked — who believed the president’s claim that his political rivals called attention to the virus only to damage his bid for a second term.

Herman Cain Herman Cain'Trumpification' of the GOP will persist 'SNL' host Dave Chappelle urges Biden voters to be 'humble' winners 18 Trump rallies have led to 30,000 COVID-19 cases: Stanford University study MORE, a 74-year-old Trump supporter and 2012 presidential candidate, urged people to rebuke “the left wing” for insisting on wearing masks and social distancing to stop the spread of the virus.

Then Cain went to a Trump rally in Tulsa. He wore no mask and did not social distance. Eight of Trump’s staff at the rally came down with the virus. And then Cain tested positive. He died about a month later.

“Cain, like Trump ... flouted the recommendations of public health officials,” wrote Alex Shephard in The New Republic. “Those attempting to wall off ‘politics’ from Cain’s death aren’t doing it to protect Cain. They are doing it to protect Trump. Trump’s failure to organize America’s response to the virus has led to more than 150,000 deaths.”

Now the death total is more than 160,000 and rising. And 80 percent of those fatalities are people over the age of 65, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

In 2016, voters 65 and older voted for Trump over Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' Cuba readies for life without Castro Chelsea Clinton: Pics of Trump getting vaccinated would help him 'claim credit' MORE by about 7 percentage points. The senior vote was critical to Trump’s wins in swing states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Florida.

But in a July Fox News poll, Trump had only a 1-point lead over his presumptive Democratic opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenObama, Clinton reflect on Mondale's legacy Biden, Harris commend Mondale in paving the way for female VP Mondale in last message to staff: 'Joe in the White House certainly helps' MORE, among the over-65s.

What was a strength for Trump in 2016 is now a split vote, not giving a clear edge to one side or the other in 2020.

Trump’s “ostentatious concern with reopening the economy rather than preventing deaths among the most vulnerable, has not gone down well with these [older] voters,” Ruy Teixeira, a political scientist, wrote in a June column in The New York Times.

And with the virus as the number one issue for voters, the Fox poll found that voters trust Biden to do a better job than Trump in handling the virus by 17 percentage points.

Overall, 67 percent of Americans disapproved of Trump’s handling of the virus, in a July ABC News-Ipsos poll.

In the swing state of Florida, more than 20 percent of the state’s population is over the age of 65. Trump won the state in 2016 by just over 1 point.

But in the most recent polling, Biden leads Trump in Florida by 13 percentage points, 51 percent-38 percent, according to the late July Quinnipiac survey.

In an interview with Axios that aired last week, Trump claimed that coronavirus deaths in Florida are “going down.”

In fact, the rate of deaths was increasing.

But Trump’s position remained blind to the reality: “Right now, I think it’s under control,” Trump told Jonathan Swan of Axios.

Swan responded that it is hard to see the disease as under control when “a thousand Americans are dying a day.”

“They are dying, that’s true and it is what it is,” Trump conceded. Later he added: “First of all, we have done a great job.”

Trump’s inability to face his failure to stop the spread of the virus, especially among older voters, is evident in his revamped campaign advertising.

There is no mention of the virus.

That’s right.

After stopping all television advertising to review why it was failing to cut into Biden’s strong lead, both nationally and in swing states, the Trump campaign came back last week with advertising with no mention of the number one issue on voters’ minds.

Instead, the Trump advertising is focused on selling fear of anarchy in big cities and portraying Biden as a victim of a far-left “takeover.”

“The radical left has taken over Joe Biden and the Democratic Party,” says a deep, scary voice. “Don’t let them take over America.”

The problem is that voters see Biden as a moderate, not a radical. And a lot of seniors fit into that moderate voter mold.

In North Carolina and Georgia, according to CBS News polling, a plurality of moderate voters see Biden as a moderate. “Beyond the Republican base, few voters see Biden as being on the far left at this point in the campaign,” wrote Kabir Khanna of CBS News.

What is radical is Trump’s failure to deal with the virus.

88,Williams,Juan,thehill,"What happens to reality TV shows when they go into summer reruns?

The ratings sink.

That’s also true for a reality TV show host when the audience gets tired of seeing him repeat the same old act.

ADVERTISEMENT

Before the 2018 election, President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE screamed about a caravan of menacing immigrants approaching the border. For the 2020 election, he is fear-mongering by shouting about chaos and anarchy in cities run by Democrats.

As with all reruns, the ratings go down.

Now Trump is whining.

Last week, he stood in the White House briefing room in front of a national television audience and asked why Dr. Anthony Fauci Anthony FauciOvernight Health Care: All adults in US now eligible for COVID-19 vaccine | White House launches media blitz to promote vaccines Suspect in custody in deadly Wisconsin tavern shooting White House launches media effort to promote coronavirus vaccines MORE is so popular.

Fauci, he said, has “got this high approval rating, so why don’t I have a high approval rating with respect ... to the virus?”

Then he complained that Dr. Deborah Birx is also more popular.

“They’re highly thought of,” said a frustrated Trump. “But nobody likes me. It can only be my personality, that’s all.”

It’s hard to believe, but with more than 150,000 people dead from the coronavirus and the economy suffering from some of the worst GDP numbers in history, Trump focused on himself, specifically his loss of popularity.

Could it be that his audience has good reason to disapprove of his failure to protect the American people from the deadly virus?

Could it be that the man who ran for the White House as a reality TV star has shown a lack of empathy as Americans struggle with the loss of loved ones, loss of jobs and the loss of normal life experiences?

Trump’s disastrous mishandling of the pandemic has killed off summer music concerts and summer blockbusters at movie theaters. He has killed off overseas vacation travel.

His fumbling has twisted the baseball season, as well as the basketball and hockey seasons, into pale versions of themselves with no fans allowed to watch live action.

No wonder people are tired of this act.

What some critics never seem to get about Trump is that he is more a pop culture phenomenon than a politician.

“In the 21st century, fascism will not come with concentration camps and swastikas, it’ll come with a smiley face and a TV show,” Michael Moore, the liberal film maker, observed in 2018.

“It was that TV show that made Trump a beloved figure in the United States,” Moore added. “People loved watching 'The Apprentice.'”

That insight is in keeping with something I first heard from the late right-wing provocateur Andrew Breitbart. He said: “Politics is downstream of culture.”

But if pop culture celebrity is a winning hand, it is also a fact that Americans do not like reruns.

And in every episode of the Trump Show, the script uses the same schtick to hold the audience.

Trump’s favorite schtick is making himself the hero. He alone can save America from — well, take your pick:

Remember when Trump promoted himself as the only man willing to imply the first black president was a fake because he was not born in the U.S.? It wasn’t true. But in the Trump Show, only ratings matter.

Remember when he came down the golden escalator in Trump Tower to announce his run for the White House was to protect the nation from criminal, rapist Mexicans threatening the American way of life? It wasn’t true. But it got ratings.

Remember the call to “lock her up,” because Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' Cuba readies for life without Castro Chelsea Clinton: Pics of Trump getting vaccinated would help him 'claim credit' MORE’s email server was somehow a threat to national security? Again, not true but it got some votes.

At some point, this act gets tired.

In 2017, a column in The New York Times predicted that Trump’s celebrity act might eventually wear thin for voters.

Trump’s “eventual downfall may be less like Richard Nixon’s than Paris Hilton’s,” wrote Tim Wu, a Columbia Law School professor. “To live by attention is to die by it as well, and he may end up less a victim of political defeat than of waning interest, the final fate of every act.”

Even more troubling for Trump, there are new celebrities to replace him, such as Fauci.

It was Fauci who was invited to throw out the first pitch for the first baseball game of the season — not Trump.

Trump then announced that he was going to throw out the first pitch at a Yankees game. Within days, the word got out that the Yankees knew nothing about it. They did not invite Trump to throw out a first pitch. Soon after, Trump announced he couldn’t make it.

Trump also had no role to play in the national celebration of the life of the late Rep. John Lewis John LewisProgressives put Democrats on defense Democrats face mounting hurdles to agenda Democrats see opportunity as states push new voting rules MORE (D-Ga.).

90,Williams,Juan,foxnews,"“Hello, Congressman.”

“Today, I’m the ‘Boy from Troy,'” John Lewis replied with a mischievous grin.

It was October 2011. The Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial had just been dedicated in Washington, D.C.

POSTHUMOUS LETTER FROM JOHN LEWIS PUBLISHED

Lewis could see I didn’t get the joke from the confused look on my face.

“That’s what he called me,” the congressman explained.

Yes, Dr. King created a rhyme to tease the young John Lewis. He wanted to lovingly remind him he would always be in King’s eyes, the son of sharecroppers who in 1958 got a prepaid bus ticket – sent by mail from Dr. King – to travel 50 miles from Troy to Montgomery and meet King.

The power of John Lewis, as he was honored on Thursday with a funeral featuring three presidents, is he remained the ""Boy from Troy,"" incredibly humble, incredibly determined, as he put himself on the line to make American history, as he made America a better, more just nation.

Lewis had every reason to strut.

He had the right to brag about being one of the brave people in the Freedom Rides – crossing state lines on integrated buses and withstanding bloody beatings from White segregationists for breaking their racist rules.

He had every right to brag that at 23 he spoke immediately before Dr. King at the March on Washington – a speech that was a perfect prelude to “I Have a Dream,” because Lewis spoke of the harsh, violent reality facing people trying to achieve the dream of racial equality in the face of segregationist violence.

And Lewis certainly had the right to say that a week after he suffered a cracked skull – by marching for voting rights – he watched as the president of the United States, Lyndon Johnson, stood before a joint session of Congress to propose the 1965 Voting Rights Act.

Imagine the Boy from Troy, having so much heart that as a 25-year-old man he was in the lead of daring activists who compelled a president from Texas to tell 70 million watching on television and the entire Congress: “Their cause must be our cause, too. Because it is not just Negroes, but it is really all of us who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. We shall overcome.”

C.T. Vivian, a top aide to Dr. King, who died the same day as Lewis, watched President Johnson’s speech with Dr. King. In my book on the civil rights movement, “Eyes on the Prize – America’s Civil Rights Years, 1954-1965,” I quoted Vivian as recalling that when the president said, “We shall overcome,” he looked over at King.

“Martin was very quietly sitting in the chair and a tear ran down his cheek. It was a victory like none other. It was affirmation of the moment,” Vivian said.

In today’s New York Times, in a posthumous essay by Lewis, he offered his affirmation for the continuing movement for racial justice, the Black Lives Matter movement.

At the end of a life that inspired so many, including President Johnson to take action for racial justice, Lewis praised Black, White, Latino and Asian Americans for keeping up the movement today by marching to protest today’s police brutality.

Lewis wrote today’s multi-racial movement sets “aside race, class, age, language and nationality to demand respect for human dignity… the truth is still marching on.”

The Boy from Troy wrote in the Times that as a Black child of the 1940s and 1950s he lived as a virtual captive of legal racial segregation and the racial violence used by White public officials to enforce second-class status on Black people.

“Emmett Till was my George Floyd,” he wrote. “He was my Rayshard Brooks, Sandra Bland and Breonna Taylor. He was 14 when he was killed, and I was only 15… I will never forget the moment it became clear that he could easily have been me.”

Lewis added that as a child his family was constrained by “an imaginary prison and troubling thoughts of potential brutality committed for no understandable reason were the bars [of that prison.].”

That child, that Boy from Troy, somehow made a way out of no way, as the gospel song says, using a steady, nonviolent passion to face down racist traditions, racist laws and violent, racist state troopers.

At a time when America offered few reasons for hope to a Black child from the rural south, that child found Godly purpose as an evangelist for racial equality.

He grew up to be Congressman Lewis. He traveled so far to be on the right side of history.

But the most amazing grace of his life is that he remained humble, available to all as a public servant, never envious of a new generation of civil rights activists, no matter their race. He was so humble as to want to pull all of America along the true path of love for all.

What a Boy from Troy.

Lewis gave me an endorsement for my last book – “What the Hell Do You Have to Lose? – Trump’s War on Civil Rights.” He wrote the book “was needed now more than ever – not just in libraries and classroom but in our homes and our hearts… we must speak up and speak out before it is too late.”

Obviously, this is a weak argument. You might even say it is a desperate argument.

ADVERTISEMENT

Why?

Well, the real issue is Trump’s handling of the virus.

Already, 60 percent of Americans disapprove of Trump’s handling of the virus, according to a recent Washington Post/ABC News poll.

Another recent poll, from Fox News, had 56 percent of registered voters disapproving of Trump’s response to the virus.

In fact, voters have already concluded by a large margin — 17 percentage points in the Fox poll — that they trust Biden to do a better job of leading the nation through the pandemic.

Even on a personal basis, Fox reports that only 36 percent believe Trump has “the compassion to serve effectively as president.” By comparison, 56 percent say Biden is a compassionate man.

So the American people have reached a conclusion about the performance of the incumbent: Trump failed. And that has big political consequences because the coronavirus is the number one issue for voters.

By asking what Biden could have done differently, Trump’s campaign is trying to change a national conversation that has already reached a conclusion.

They are kicking up a storm of distraction by arguing that even if Trump dropped the ball, where is the evidence that Biden might have done any better?

Biden answered the question last week.

While Trump was promising that “like a miracle – it will disappear,” Biden said he would have to work — improving testing, tracing people who had spread the disease and using the Defense Production Act to get U.S. companies to produce tests, masks and equipment for hospitals.

Trump did not do those things, Biden said, but instead “raised the white flag.”

“He has no idea what to do,” Biden told MSNBC host Joy Reid last week. “Zero.” Trump’s only concern is winning the election, Biden said.

“And it doesn’t matter how many people get COVID or die from COVID,” Biden added, “because [Trump] fears that if the economy is strapped as badly as it is today…he is going to be in trouble [in November].”

Let’s take Biden’s answer with a grain of salt, since he is running against Trump.

But what do political reporters — people watching every day, the judges at ringside — think of how Trump is handling the virus?

After interviewing Trump for an hour, Chris Wallace Christopher (Chris) WallaceCornyn defends controversial tweet as not about Biden's competency Sullivan: White House 'absolutely committed' to raising refugee cap McConnell seeks to end feud with Trump MORE of Fox said Trump’s White House still “doesn’t seem to have a handle” on the pandemic.

These judgments that Trump failed are hard to refute.

It is a fact that in January Trump told CNBC he had no worry about the coronavirus because “we have it totally under control…we have it under control. It is going to be just fine.”

In late February, Trump again steered the country wrong by tweeting that the virus is “very much under control in the USA…Stock Market starting to look very good to me!”

In March, as the situation grew worse, Trump blamed “Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party,” for trying to “inflame the CoronaVirus situation.”

Then in mid-March he declared, “I’ve felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic.” Later in March, he announced the virus would be gone in time for Americans to gather at church for Easter services in mid-April.

That’s due to President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE’s failure to halt the high rate of coronavirus infections in the United States.

That’s not normal.

Yes, he really said that.

There is so much that is not normal at the Trump White House that Rachel Maddow Rachel Anne MaddowOcasio-Cortez eyeing T over 10 years for infrastructure Tucker Carlson: Matt Gaetz sexual allegation interview 'one of weirdest' he's done MSNBC changes branding of live breaking news coverage to 'MSNBC Reports' MORE, the MSNBC host, recently spent an entire segment reading off a stunning list of scandalous acts now accepted as normal in the Trump era.

Is it normal, she asked, that Trump “put his son’s wedding planner in charge of federal housing in the northeastern United States ... fired one inspector general who was investigating the secretary of State ... advertised his wife’s jewelry line on the White House website?""

Any of the Trump scandals, Maddow said, would have amounted to “the biggest scandal to ever afflict any other presidency — but by virtue of the sheer number of scandals that surround [Trump] like flies around a pigpen ... [they] have just become part of what we expect, right?”

And it keeps going. Here’s an example from last week.

“The Trump Administration lifted a ban on sales of [gun] silencers to private overseas buyers that was intended to protect U.S. troops from ambushes,” The New York Times reported.

And there’s an eye-opening kicker to that tale.

The Times reported the ban was lifted as a result of strenuous lobbying by a lawyer currently working in the Trump White House. That lawyer previously worked for a firearms group. Now, firearms companies might make $250 million a year in potential sales overseas, the story noted.

That’s definitely a huge scandal in any other administration, sure to stir outrage from defenders of the American military.

It’s just another day in the Trump presidency.

But what about the obvious conflict of interest in that episode?

Well, it is hard to get attention for that argument.

Why?

As the Times explained, Trump’s Cabinet features “a former coal lobbyist as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, a former lobbyist for the defense contractor Raytheon Technologies as defense secretary, a lobbyist for the auto industry at the helm of the Energy Department and a former oil and gas lobbyist as interior secretary.”

This administration is a gusher of conflicts of interest.

That’s why it is easy to become numb to the Trump administration crossing red lines that define normal, ethical behavior by people at the highest level of government.

At this point you might be scandal fatigued. You might agree that it is bad but excuse it as not the end of the world. But then you find out there is more.

How about the attorney general pressuring career prosecutors to recommend a lighter sentence for Roger Stone Roger Jason StoneThere was Trump-Russia collusion — and Trump pardoned the colluder On The Money: Moderates' 0B infrastructure bill is a tough sell with Democrats | Justice Dept. sues Trump ally Roger Stone for unpaid taxes Justice Dept. sues Trump ally Roger Stone for unpaid taxes MORE, an old friend of the president who had been convicted of lying to Congress?

Then Trump took it to the next level. He commuted Stone’s sentence.

Even the conservative editors of National Review couldn’t swallow that one. They wrote that “Trump’s handling of the matter is indefensible. It is another indication of his perverse, highly personalized view of the criminal justice system.”

“An American president commutes the sentence of a person convicted by a jury of lying to shield that very president,” is the way Sen. Mitt Romney Willard (Mitt) Mitt RomneyAdvocacy groups pushing Biden to cancel student debt for disabled 15 Senate Republicans pledge to oppose lifting earmark ban The Hill's 12:30 Report - Presented by Facebook - All US adults now eligible for COVID vaccines MORE (R- Utah) described the astonishing act. He summed it up as an act of “unprecedented, historic corruption.”

While that was taking place, the attorney general also looks to have been trying to help another of the president’s friends get out of legal trouble.

In that case, Barr tried to force out the prosecutor reportedly investigating the president’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani Rudy GiulianiMyPillow files countersuit against Dominion Voting Systems Guilfoyle named as national chair of Greitens' Senate campaign in Missouri Greitens Senate bid creates headache for GOP MORE. Barr wanted to install a new U.S. attorney with no experience as a criminal prosecutor.

Geoffrey Berman, who was the Trump-appointed U.S. attorney in Manhattan, told Congress that Barr made him an unseemly offer if he agreed to quit.

Berman testified that Barr told him he could take over the civil rights division of the Justice Department but really use his time to build up a “book of business,” or list of clients that could help him get a big payday when he took a job at a private law firm.

Now that is a scandal in any other administration. But, again, it is just another day in the Trump presidency.

After all, this is the attorney general who ordered federal troops to use chemical agents and smoke bombs against Americans protesting police brutality. Why? So, the president could create a photo-op. Really.

This is not normal.

There is no way to explain President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE’s lack of action in response to U.S. intelligence showing Russia paid bounties for the murder of American soldiers.

Even worse, there is no explanation for why Congressional Republicans aren’t raising hell over Trump’s silence.

ADVERTISEMENT

Some military veterans are speaking up:

“Putin pays bounties to Taliban enemies to kill American soldiers and not a word from Donald Trump,” says the narrator in an ad from the group ‘VoteVets.’

In a different ad from the same group, the narrator says: “Benedict Arnold can step aside, because Benedict Donald is America’s number one traitor.”

I get uneasy when political players start throwing around loaded words like 'traitor.'

But what’s the choice now?

Trump’s only defense is to say he was not told about the intelligence and did not read his briefing book.

“Either way, it is an unjustifiable dereliction of duty,” tweeted Joe Biden Joe BidenObama, Clinton reflect on Mondale's legacy Biden, Harris commend Mondale in paving the way for female VP Mondale in last message to staff: 'Joe in the White House certainly helps' MORE, the Democrats’ nominee for president.

Trump is also hiding behind the fact that the intelligence is not totally confirmed. But Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiWhite House readies for Chauvin verdict House GOP's McClain responds to Pelosi calling her 'that woman' GOP struggles to rein in nativism MORE (D-Calif.) dismissed the idea that Trump did not react to the report because the intelligence agencies did not have a “100 percent consensus.” She called it a “con.”

“We would practically be investigating nothing if you had to start off at 100 percent…Just because they didn’t have 100 percent consensus, should this be not briefed to the president of the United States?” Pelosi said.

Keep in mind the seriousness of the Russian bounty report.

The Washington Post reported that in April 2019 there was an attack in Afghanistan killing three Marines and “those who planned it may have been paid a bounty by a Russian military intelligence unit to kill Americans.”

So it is hard to say which is worse: Either Trump did not read his written briefing report, or his aides thought it best not to tell him.

Whatever the case, it is shockingly clear that the President of the United States did nothing.

So, where is the shouting from all those flag-waving congressional Republicans?

Their current silence reminds me of their quiet when the Trump administration did nothing to punish Russia for interfering in the 2016 presidential election. Trump even enlisted fellow Republicans in demonizing the FBI for looking into the plot.

Trump called the probe into Russian election interference a “hoax.” Now he is calling news of the Russian bounty intelligence a “hoax.”

He is keeping Republicans in line by linking the election tampering probe to the questions about the bounty scandal. He said this latest outrage is “possibly another fabricated Russia Hoax…wanting to make Republicans look bad!!”

But it is an outrage to play politics with a matter of life and death for American soldiers.

And it is particularly galling when you consider how they attacked people who asked questions about the Iraq War — people like me.

They smeared critics of Bush’s Iraq War as traitors.

Then-Rep. Tom Davis (R-Va.), who led the House Republicans’ campaign arm at the time, accused then-Sen.Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) of “divisive comments [that] have the effect of giving aid and comfort to our enemies by allowing them to exploit divisions in our country.""

So, where are today’s Republicans calling out the Trump administration for its lack of response?

The only action by the Trump administration has been to start a probe to find out who leaked news of the intelligence reports to newspapers.

That diversionary tactic is consistent with Trump’s failure to handle foreign affairs throughout his presidency.

The American people see it. In the current RealClearPolitics average of polls, 52 percent of Americans disapprove of Trump’s handling of foreign policy.

Trump’s foreign policy failures are too numerous to list in one column but here are some of the lowlights —

Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris Climate Accords and the Tran-Pacific Partnership (TPP) has not only cost Americans jobs but has ceded our leadership role in the world to countries like China.

“Trump didn’t want to hear [early reports about the coronavirus in China] because he didn’t want to hear bad things about [Chinese leader] Xi Jinping…He didn’t want to hear bad things about the Chinese economy that could affect the ‘fantastic’ trade deal he was working on,” former Trump National Security Adviser John Bolton John BoltonHillicon Valley: Facebook Oversight board to rule on Trump ban in 'coming weeks' | Russia blocks Biden Cabinet officials in retaliation for sanctions Russia blocks key Biden Cabinet officials from entering in retaliation for sanctions The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Tax March - US vaccine effort takes hit with Johnson & Johnson pause MORE recently told ABC News.

He has exacerbated tensions between the Israelis and the Palestinians by giving enormous concessions to the Netanyahu government.

And perhaps, most dangerously, Trump failed to halt Iran’s nuclear program after ripping up President Obama’s nuclear deal — which was working.

The Democratic National Committee has started running ads hitting Trump’s stumbles on foreign policy.

“Trump said he’d get tough on China,” a narrator intones. “He didn’t get tough. He got played.”

And once again, he is getting played by Russia.

The civil rights leader Jesse Jackson is among those outraged — and using the word ‘treason.’

If it is true that Russia is paying others to kill American soldiers, Jackson tweeted, “and we are not retaliating appropriately, that is as close to treason as you can get.”

Where’s the wall — and is Mexico paying for it?

Where’s the fabulous plan to replace ObamaCare?

Where’s the deal with North Korea to end their nuclear threat?

Where’s the racial healing in retweeting a supporter shouting “white power”?

Oh, didn’t he tell you in February the virus was going to magically disappear and then repeat it to you last week after more than 125,000 Americans died from it?

Now that’s a record of failure.

And here is one more question on empty promises for Trump’s biggest fans, white evangelicals:

Has Trump delivered for you after the Supreme Court’s recent rulings in support of gay rights and abortion rights?

Trump’s standing with evangelicals started fraying before the court’s decisions.

First, the failure to protect the country from the virus hurt him, especially with seniors.

Then evangelicals of all ages saw a lack of Christian empathy in his attacks on people standing together, across racial lines, to protest police brutality. “We’re one race and we need to love each other,” said Pat Robertson, a major evangelical leader.

To shore up his base, Trump is now resorting to open appeals to white racial grievance.

He has retweeted videos of black and white people fighting. Last week, he retweeted a video of a white St. Louis couple holding guns to threaten people marching for racial justice.

Putting fear into his white base — to get them back in line — can be seen in his damning comments on protestors. They are all “thugs,” and “hoodlums,” even as the instances of rioting are few amid overwhelmingly peaceful demonstrations.

Similarly, Trump’s strategy includes demonizing people pulling down statues of Confederate generals. He says they are “terrorists.” He refuses to admit the damage done by ever-present symbols of white supremacy, including the Confederate flag.

So, exactly which white people are the audience for Trump’s acid politics?

Trump won 57 percent of the white vote in 2016. One-third of that support came from white evangelicals. Another 20 percent of Trump’s 2016 base of support came from white Catholics, according to a Pew Research Center analysis.

That means white evangelicals and white Catholics made up half of the people who voted for Trump in 2016.

But now several polls showing Trump losing to Democrat Joe Biden Joe BidenObama, Clinton reflect on Mondale's legacy Biden, Harris commend Mondale in paving the way for female VP Mondale in last message to staff: 'Joe in the White House certainly helps' MORE by a substantial margin. The decline is due to sliding support from white evangelicals and white Catholics.

“In March, nearly 80 percent of white evangelicals said they approved of the job Mr. Trump was doing, [according to polling by PRRI],” the New York Times reported in early June.

“But by the end of May, with the country convulsed by racial discord, Mr. Trump’s favorability among white evangelicals had fallen 15 percentage points to 62 percent, according to a PRRI poll,” according to the Times story, by Jeremy W. Peters. The article noted that Trump’s white Catholic support is down 27 points since March.

David Brody, the chief political analyst for the Christian Broadcasting Network, recently told Politico that “any slippage” of Trump’s support among evangelical voters would doom him to defeat in November.

Trump is potentially losing those few percentage points of evangelical support in a nation showing increasing support for the Black Lives Matter movement but also dealing, as Brody put it, with “everything from the coronavirus to George Floyd and Trump calling himself the ‘law and order president.’""

If evangelicals are the target of Trump’s racial grievance strategy, the bull’s-eye on that target are white people without a college degree.

Since the end of May, Trump has lost 15 percentage points of support among whites without a college degree, according to an average of polls by The Washington Post.

He had a 37-percentage point lead among those voters over Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' Cuba readies for life without Castro Chelsea Clinton: Pics of Trump getting vaccinated would help him 'claim credit' MORE in 2016. It is now down to a 22-point lead over Biden.

There is deadly political consequence for Trump’s reelection bid in those numbers.

The loss of those voters is a big reason behind a June New York Times poll showing Trump and Biden basically tied among white voters.

ADVERTISEMENT

The RealClearPolitics average of polls shows Biden currently leading Trump in six states Trump won in 2016: Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Florida, Arizona and North Carolina.

With four months to go before Election Day, all Trump can do now is ask his evangelical supporters to overlook his failures in exchange for more promises, especially continuing to pack the federal courts with conservative judges who are hostile to abortion rights and gay rights.

He thinks that promise will be enough to motivate evangelicals and Catholics to turn out for him.

“You won’t have religious liberty — you won’t have anything,” if Biden wins in November, Trump predicted in a recent interview with his former press secretary Sean Spicer Sean Michael SpicerOvernight Health Care: CDC director calls on Michigan to 'close things down' amid surge in cases | Regeneron says antibody therapy prevents COVID-19 infections The Hill's 12:30 Report - Presented by ExxonMobil - Biden moves vaccine eligibility by almost two weeks Easter Bunny pays surprise visit to White House briefing room MORE, after highlighting his appointment of “two Supreme Court justices.”

If a few evangelicals decide a few more judges aren’t worth sacrificing their most cherished principles of Christian love and morality, they may end up voting for a white Catholic.

100,Williams,Juan,americanheritage,"The architect of American race relations in the twentieth century, he ended legal segregation in the United States and became the first African-American on the Supreme Court.

Editor's Note: Juan Williams is a journalist and political analyst for Fox News and writes for The Washington Post, The New York Times, Atlantic Monthly, and other publications. He interviewed Justice Marshall extensively while he was still alive and published a biography, Thurgood Marshall: American Revolutionary, from which this was adapted.

Rumors flew that night. Supreme Court Justice Tom Clark had resigned a few hours earlier. By that Monday evening, Solicitor General Thurgood Marshall and his wife, Cissy, heard that the president was set to name Clark’s replacement on the Court the very next morning.

At the Marshalls’ small green townhouse on G Street in Southwest Washington, D.C., the phone was ringing. Friends, family, and even politicians were calling to see if Thurgood had heard anything about his chances for the job. But all the Marshalls could say was that they had heard rumors.

As Marshall dressed for Clark’s retirement party on that muggy Washington night of June 12, 1967, he looked at his reflection in the mirror. He replayed all the rumors he had heard about why the president was reluctant to appoint him to the high court. Thinking about it, Marshall got grumpy, then angry. His chance to be in the history books as the first black man on the Supreme Court was fading, and he felt abandoned. The word around the capital was that the nomination would be announced tomorrow. Marshall had heard nothing from the White House.

Johnson bluntly told Marshall not to get his hopes up because he wasn't going to named to the Supreme Court.

At the retirement party President Johnson was his usual dominating self, alternately bullying and ingratiating himself with both justices and the politicians in the crowd. When Marshall made his way through the faces surrounding Johnson, the president quickly greeted him with a wide smile. The two men loved to drink bourbon and tell stories full of lies. They were the same age and had strong feelings for each other. So it was no surprise when the president threw a long arm around Marshall and briefly pulled him aside. Johnson bluntly told him not to get his hopes up because he was not going to replace Justice Clark.

Marshall played it off with a laugh. Standing to his full height, he reminded Johnson that he didn’t need a job and there had never been any promise he would get to the high court. Behind his bluster, however, Marshall felt a fierce determination to argue with Johnson right there. It was Marshall’s style to apply pressure and fight. But this time he bit his tongue. It didn’t make sense to think he could bully Lyndon Johnson in the middle of a party and win. He drove home, cutting across the Mall, with the U.S. Capitol’s magnificent white dome glowing to one side and the towering Washington Monument on the other. The nation’s grand symbols made him feel small, an outsider. He had missed his chance.

The next morning, Tuesday, June 13, Marshall was in his office at the Justice Department on Pennsylvania Avenue when his secretary got a call from the attorney general Ramsey Clark, who was also the son of the retiring Justice Tom Clark. It was just before 10:00 A.M., and Clark told her he was coming down to see Marshall and to keep everyone else out.

When Clark got into Marshall’s office, he asked him what he was doing later that morning. Marshall replied that he was going to the White House to speak with a group of students. Clark told him to go over fifteen minutes early and stop in the Oval Office. Marshall pressed Clark to tell him what was going on. Clark said he didn’t know. But given the spate of rumors over the last twenty-four hours and the disaster at the party, Marshall figured this trip was for Johnson to stroke him and tell him why he didn’t get the job.



When he was finally called into the Oval Office at 11:05, Marshall saw Johnson, all by himself, bent over the news service ticker-tape machine. While Marshall waited for the president to turn around, he quickly glanced about the Oval Office. In the far corner was a bronze caricature of a frenetic President Johnson running while holding a phone in one hand. On the marble coffee table Marshall could see a bunch of index cards and papers, some of which had spilled onto the green rug under the president’s rocking chair.

“You know something, Thurgood?” said Pres. Johnson. “I’m going to put you on the Supreme Court.”

Nervously, Marshall coughed to get the president’s attention. Johnson spun around, as though surprised, and said, “Oh, hi, Thurgood. Sit down, sit down.” Marshall moved toward the couch and sat next to Johnson’s rocking chair. Johnson made small talk with the fidgety Marshall until he abruptly turned to him and said, “You know something, Thurgood? ... I’m going to put you on the Supreme Court.”

Marshall was stunned. All he could say was “Oh, yipe!”

Hearings for most Supreme Court nominees began within a week of the nomination. Byron White, President Kennedy’s first candidate for the Court, had been nominated and confirmed within eight days. Abe Fortas, President Johnson’s first, had to wait only fourteen days. Thurgood Marshall was different. It would be seventy-eight days before his name would come up for a vote of confirmation in the Senate, where segregationists like Strom Thurmond, James Eastland, and John Stennis held power.

In the two and a half months between the nomination and the vote on Marshall, his record as a lawyer, his writings, his drinking, the women he slept with, and his family came under the intense scrutiny of FBI and Senate investigations. Sen. Robert Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia, wrote to FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, asking if there was information about Marshall’s ties to Communists. Another senator focused on uncovering evidence that Marshall hated whites; other senators loaded up on detailed legal questions, hoping to reveal gaps in Marshall’s knowledge of the law that would disqualify him for the high court.

But the larger topics for Marshall’s opponents were still left unanswered: Who was this man? How did a black man so despised by millions of segregationists rise past Jim Crow political power to become a federal judge, the first black solicitor general, and finally to stand at the door of the highest station of American law, the Supreme Court?

Simply put, where did this Negro come from?

Associate Justice Marshall in 1976. Library of Congress.

All his life Marshall had been an integrationist. If black people could mix freely with white people, study and work together, he believed, there would be no racial problems in America. He had pushed that theory in courtrooms throughout the nation. His lifework made him one of America’s leading radicals.

Thurgood Marshall's great achievement was to create creating new protections under law for America’s women, children, prisoners, homeless, minorities, and immigrants.

As a suit-and-tie lawyer, however, Thurgood Marshall was the unlikely leading actor in creating social change in the United States in the twentieth century. His great achievement was to expand rights for individual Americans. But he especially succeeded in creating new protections under law for America’s women, children, prisoners, homeless, minorities, and immigrants. Their greater claim to full citizenship in the Republic over the last century can be directly traced to Marshall.

Even the American press has Marshall to thank for an expansion of its liberties during the century. But for black Americans especially, Marshall stood as a colossus. He guided a formerly enslaved people along the road to equal rights.

Oddly, of the three leading black liberators of twentieth-century America — Thurgood Marshall, Martin Luther King, Jr., and Malcolm X — Marshall was the least well known. Dr. King gained fame as the inspiring advocate of nonviolence and mass protests. Malcolm X was the defiant black nationalist whose preachings about separatism and armed revolution were the other side of King’s appeals for racial peace. But the third man in this black triumvirate stood as the one with the biggest impact on American race relations.

It was Marshall who ended legal segregation in the United States. He won Supreme Court victories breaking the color line in housing, transportation, and voting, all of which overturned the “separate-but-equal” apartheid of American life in the first half of the century.

It was Marshall who won the most important legal case of the century, Brown v. Board of Education, ending the legal separation of black and white children in public schools. The success of the Brown case sparked the 1960s civil rights movement, led to the increased number of black high school and college graduates and the incredible rise of the black middle class in both numbers and political power in the second half of the century.

And it was Marshall, once he became the nation’s first African-American Supreme Court justice, who promoted affirmative action — preferences, set-asides, and other race-conscious policies — as the remedy for the damage remaining from the nation’s history of slavery and racial bias. Justice Marshall gave a clear signal that while legal discrimination had ended, there was more to be done to advance educational opportunity for blacks and to bridge the wide canyon of economic inequity between blacks and whites.



Marshall’s lifework, then, literally defined the movement of race relations through the century. He rejected King’s peaceful protest as rhetorical fluff, which accomplished no permanent change in society. And he rejected Malcolm X’s talk of violent revolution and a separate black nation as racist craziness in a multiracial society.

Instead of leading protests, Marshall won permanent changes in the rock-hard laws of segregation, creating a new legal landscape where racial equality was an accepted principle.

Instead Marshall was busy in the nation’s courtrooms, winning permanent changes in the rock-hard laws of segregation. He created a new legal landscape, where racial equality was an accepted principle. He worked in behalf of black Americans but built a structure of individual rights that became the cornerstone of protections for all Americans. Marshall’s triumphs led black people to speak of him in biblical terms of salvation: “He brought us the Constitution as a document like Moses brought his people the Ten Commandments,” the NAACP board member Juanita Jackson Mitchell once said.

The key to Marshall’s work was his conviction that integration — and only integration — would allow equal rights under the law to take hold. Once individual rights were accepted, in Marshall’s mind, blacks and whites could rise or fall based on their own ability.

Marshall’s deep faith in the power of racial integration came out of a middle-class black perspective in turn-of-the-century Baltimore. He was the child of an activist black community that had established its own schools and fought for equal rights from the time of the Civil War. His own family, of an interracial background, had been at the forefront of demands by Baltimore blacks for equal treatment. Out of that unique family and city was born Thurgood Marshall, the architect of American race relations in the twentieth century.

Martin Luther King, Jr., and Malcolm X both died young, the victims of assassins. They became martyrs to the nation’s racial wars. Thurgood Marshall lived to be eighty-four and was no one’s martyr. Given that Marshall laid the foundation for today’s racial landscape, his grand design of how race relations best work makes his life story essential for anyone delving into the powder keg of America’s greatest problem.

He was truly an American Revolutionary.",-1,https://www.americanheritage.com/thurgood-marshall-american-revolutionary
101,Williams,Juan,thurgoodmarshall,"Thurgood Marshall was America’s leading radical. He led a civil rights revolution in the 20th century that forever changed the landscape of American society.But he is the least well known of the three leading black figures of this century. Martin Luther King Jr., with his preachings of love and non-violent resistance, and Malcolm X, the fiery street preacher who advocated a bloody overthrow of the system, are both more closely associate in the popular mind and myth with the civil rights struggle. But it was Thurgood Marshall, working through the courts to eradicate the legacy of slavery and destroying the racist segregation system of Jim Crow, who had an even more profound and lasting effect on race relations than either of King or X.

It was Marshall who ended legal segregation in the United States. He won Supreme Court victories breaking the color line in housing, transportation and voting, all of which overturned the ‘Separate-but-Equal’ apartheid of American life in the first half of the century.

And it was Marshall, as the nation’s first African-American Supreme Court justice, who promoted affirmative action — preferences, set-asides and other race conscious policies — as the remedy for the damage remaining from the nation’s history of slavery and racial bias. Justice Marshall gave a clear signal that while legal discrimination had ended, there was more to be done to advance educational opportunity for people who had been locked out and to bridge the wide canyon of economic inequity between blacks and whites.

He worked on behalf of black Americans, but built a structure of individual rights that became the cornerstone of protections for all Americans. He succeeded in creating new protections under law for women, children, prisoners, and the homeless. Their greater claim to full citizenship in the republic over the last century can be directly traced to Marshall. Even the American press had Marshall to thank for an expansion of its liberties during the century.

Marshall’s lifework, then, literally defined the movement of race relations through the century. He rejected King’s peaceful protest as rhetorical fluff that accomplished no permanent change in society. And he rejected Malcolm X’s talk of violent revolution and a separate black nation as racist craziness in a multi-racial society.

The key to Marshall’s work was his conviction that integration — and only integration — would allow equal rights under the law to take hold. Once individual rights were accepted, in Marshall’s mind, then blacks and whites could rise or fall based on their own ability.

Marshall’s deep faith in the power of racial integration came out of a middle class black perspective in turn of the century Baltimore. He was the child of an activist black community that had established its own schools and fought for equal rights from the time of the Civil War. His own family, of an interracial background, had been at the forefront of demands by Baltimore blacks for equal treatment. Out of that unique family and city was born Thurgood Marshall, the architect of American race relations in the twentieth century.

After Marshall died in 1993 there was still no authoritative, thorough account of his life and the impact his work had on the nation. The combination of his reclusiveness and his standing in popular culture as an elderly, establishment figure blinded much of the nation to the importance of Marshall’s work. Young people were especially uninformed about the critical role Marshall had played in making history.

A new biography – Thurgood Marshall: American Revolutionary – is intended to fill some of that vacuum. In these pages the great storyteller tells his stories. And the history, of both his family and the civil rights movement, are in one place so that future generations can understand the dynamics that created and sustained Marshall’s conception of successful race relations. Given that Marshall laid the foundation for today’s racial landscape, his grand design of how race relations best work makes his life’s story essential for anyone delving into the powder-keg of America’s greatest problem. He was truly an American Revolutionary.",-1,http://thurgoodmarshall.com/books/thurgood-marshall-american-revolutionary/
102,Williams,Juan,thehill,"Dear Joe Biden Joe BidenObama, Clinton reflect on Mondale's legacy Biden, Harris commend Mondale in paving the way for female VP Mondale in last message to staff: 'Joe in the White House certainly helps' MORE —

You are doing great. You are up in the polls. Money is starting to come in.

MORE are voting for you.

Now is the time for Fourth of July political fireworks to fight any complacency among your voters.

So, here’s my advice:

Before you name your pick for vice president, you should name three cabinet secretaries and your first Supreme Court nominee.

First, name Sen. Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth WarrenWorld passes 3 million coronavirus deaths Poll: 56 percent say wealth tax is part of solution to inequality Democratic senators call on Biden to support waiving vaccine patents MORE (D-Mass.) as your Treasury Secretary.

Second, name Sen. Amy Klobuchar Amy KlobucharJimmy Carter remembers Mondale as 'best vice president in our country's history' Hillicon Valley: Apple approves Parler's return to App Store | White House scales back response to SolarWinds, Microsoft incidents | Pressure mounts on DHS over relationship with Clearview AI Democrats push Twitter, Facebook to remove vaccine 'disinformation dozen' MORE (D-Minn.) as your Attorney General.

Third, name Susan Rice as your Secretary of State.

And finally, tell the world that Sen. Kamala Harris Kamala HarrisBiden, Harris commend Mondale in paving the way for female VP Overnight Energy: Treasury creates hub to fight climate change through finance | Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez introduce 'Green New Deal for Public Housing' | Harris: Americans able to 'breathe easier and sleep better' under Biden MORE (D-Calif.) is your first pick for the Supreme Court.

This strategy has high risk and high reward.

The risk comes with creating new targets for Trump to belittle with schoolyard nicknames.

But you’re after the big reward.

The announcements will tell everyone you are fired up, ready to govern. It will energize the voters you need to turn out in big numbers, especially Black Americans, suburban women and Sen. Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersOvernight Energy: Treasury creates hub to fight climate change through finance | Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez introduce 'Green New Deal for Public Housing' | Don't attack Zoom for its Bernie Sanders federal tax bill Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez introduce 'Green New Deal for Public Housing' MORE’ (I-Vt.) fans on the party’s left.

Putting Warren in your cabinet signals you are already taking action on income inequality — looking to address the urgent needs of students with college debt, financially squeezed middle-class workers and small businesses. The left will love this pick.

The only problem with Warren is that she is an excellent choice for vice president. But this move will not take her out of the running.

There is no such complication with Klobuchar.

She took herself out of the running for VP recently. Naming a hardworking Midwesterner with stellar credentials to fix the odor of corruption coming from President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE's Justice Department will remind everyone what is at stake.

And since there is no vacancy on the Supreme Court at the moment, naming Harris as your future choice for the high court will not rule her out as a pick for vice president either.

Now, here comes the risk.

Name Rice as your Secretary of State with the caveat that she, like Warren and Harris, is a contender to be your running mate — even if doing so sets off red lights and screams in the Trump media echo chamber.

To my mind, she’d be a great vice president.

Rice provides you with a fierce tag-team partner for Trump’s bare-knuckle political wrestling. She has no problem saying the Trump administration is “racist to its core.”

“We have a choice,” Rice recently told HBO’s Bill Maher William (Bill) MaherSharon Osbourne tells Maher she's 'angry' and 'hurt' after departure from 'The Talk' Bill Maher blasts Oscar picks: Hollywood movies now are 'just depressing' Why the unhinged woke brigade is a profound threat to our freedom MORE.

That choice, she said, was between Trump remaining in office and Biden winning.

If the Democrat won, she added, Americans would have a president who “understands that…it’s time to invest in health, in education, in housing and…in so many of the underlying conditions which have exacerbated the systemic racism in this country…I would urge those that are questioning how they might vote in this context to be very mindful of what the choice is. It couldn’t be more stark.”

Running mates are traditionally the “attack dogs” that allow the presidential nominee to keep clean while they handle the day-to-day combat.

Spiro Agnew famously played that role for Richard Nixon in 1968. John Edwards did it for John Kerry John KerryOvernight Energy: Treasury creates hub to fight climate change through finance | Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez introduce 'Green New Deal for Public Housing' | Blinken says US falling behind China as global leader on climate change The shipping industry needs to move in line with the Paris Agreement MORE in 2004.

Rice fits the role. Her sharp intellect also makes her a favorite in any debate against Vice President Pence.

And she has already been battle-tested.

For years, Republican talk radio hosts vilified her over her response to the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi in 2012.

They accused her of “lying” for saying the attack grew out of a spontaneous demonstration, prompted by an American anti-Muslim video.

The truth was more complicated, but also exonerating of Rice. The CIA director at the time of the attacks, David Petraeus, later told Congress that the agency knew a terrorist group was involved in the attack — but that this classified information had been intentionally omitted from an unclassified memo given to Rice to prepare for TV interviews.

To this day, Republicans point to Benghazi to libel Rice even though she — and the Obama administration — was cleared of any wrongdoing by 10 separate investigations, many done by Republicans in Congress.

Rice also shines a light on a major Trump weakness — America’s diminished strength on the world stage.

A Gallup poll released earlier this month found 58 percent of Americans disapproving of Trump’s handling of foreign affairs.

And this was before Trump’s former National Security Adviser John Bolton John BoltonHillicon Valley: Facebook Oversight board to rule on Trump ban in 'coming weeks' | Russia blocks Biden Cabinet officials in retaliation for sanctions Russia blocks key Biden Cabinet officials from entering in retaliation for sanctions The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Tax March - US vaccine effort takes hit with Johnson & Johnson pause MORE kicked off his book tour by slamming Trump’s handling of foreign policy, saying: ""I don't think he has the competence to carry out the job.”

Rice is uniquely well-positioned to highlight Trump’s failures in handling North Korea, China and Russia.

Her selection also signals that you are hiring people who have expertise and speak the truth as compared to the incompetent loyalists around Trump.

This is no time to lay back, Joe.

Trump can’t be counted out. It is no coincidence that only three incumbents have lost in the last 50 years. He has a ton of money. He will play the lowest racial politics — last week retweeting fights between white and black people. He still has the power of the White House.

Naming a few cabinet members now will shine a light on his poor cabinet choices — further revealing the damage done by the big fumble of 2016.

103,Williams,Juan,thehill,"In the immortal words of Creedence Clearwater Revival, “I see a bad moon rising.”

My fear comes from watching a scary alliance taking shape on the far-right.

It begins with President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE, who is falling farther and farther behind former Vice President Biden, his presumptive Democratic opponent. Biden led Trump by 12 points in a Fox News poll last week.

ADVERTISEMENT

Feeling political heat, Trump is resorting to dividing and scaring people while posing as the strong man needed to satisfy what he calls the American public’s “demand [for] law and order.”

Just last week, Facebook took down several Trump campaign ads because they featured a Nazi symbol.

My anxiety goes even higher as white militants, some waving Trump flags, are becoming more public and more violent to people marching for racial justice.

“Federal prosecutors have charged various supporters of a right-wing movement called the ‘boogaloo bois,’ with crimes related to plotting to firebomb a U.S. Forest Service facility, preparing to use explosives at a peaceful demonstration and killing a security officer at a federal court-house,” The Washington Post reported on its front page last week.

And then there are the rising threats from police unions.

In the face of rising calls for police reform, the police unions are now politically aligned with Trump. And he is standing as their defender.

In a clear slap at people protesting police brutality, Trump said last week the real problem is that the “police have not been treated fairly.”

The police unions are using the same tactic, attacking protesters, in the words of the president of Minneapolis Federation of Police, as a “terrorist movement.”

This rising alliance of Trump, white militants and angry police unions fits with Trump’s long expressed desire to have men with guns on his side.

“I can tell you I have the support of the police, the support of the military, the support of the Bikers for Trump — I have the tough people, but they don’t play it tough — until they go to a certain point, and then it would be very bad, very bad,"" Trump famously told Breitbart last year.

Keep in mind this is not an empty threat.

The Trump administration used a mix of several federal police agencies — armed with tear gas and smoke bombs — to disrupt a peaceful protest in Lafayette Square this month, all so Trump could take a campaign-style picture in front of a nearby church.

That brutal use of police power could well be a preview of more ugly conflict around the country as protests, political rallies, conventions and the November election approach.

That’s why several polls show the country to be on edge.

In fact, last week 74 percent of Americans, including 63 percent of Republicans, said the country is headed in the wrong direction, according to an AP-NORC poll. A Monmouth poll also had 74 percent saying the country is going the wrong way.

And 64 percent of adults, including 37 percent of Republicans, according to the AP poll, said Trump has made the U.S. “much or somewhat more divided.”

Trump’s most divisive tactic at the moment is to malign Americans protesting police violence.

He exaggerates violence at protests, then blames left-wing groups even as federal officials have identified right-wing, white militants as behind much of the trouble.

ADVERTISEMENT

Even before the protests, his administration pulled back from deals between the federal government and several big cities to halt aggressive police tactics.

Attorney General Bill Barr raised eyebrows late last year when he said if Americans fail to show proper respect to police “they might find themselves without the police protection they need.”

Barr’s position is way out of step with American public opinion. The AP poll found that more than 70 percent of white Americans say police violence against the public is either very serious or moderately serious.

Even libertarian-conservative billionaire Charles Koch’s network of political activists see the need for police reform.

The Koch network is working to reform “qualified immunity” as part of police reform so law enforcement officers no longer enjoy blanket protection from being sued for abusing the public trust.

Even Senate Republicans are working on police reform.

Led by South Carolina’s Sen. Tim Scott Timothy (Tim) Eugene ScottBass 'hopeful' on passing police reform: 'Republicans that I am working with are operating in good faith' The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Tax March - CDC in limbo on J&J vax verdict; Rep. Brady retiring Tim Scott to participate in GOP event in Iowa MORE, the Senate GOP introduced the Just and Unifying Solutions to Invigorate Communities Everywhere (JUSTICE) Act last week to improve police reform, accountability and transparency.

At a time when Trump has expressed overt authoritarian tendencies by praising dictatorial thugs in other countries like Russia and North Korea, his focus on law enforcement takes on a new sense of urgency.

Biden has raised the specter that if Trump loses the election, he may not concede defeat.

Even worse, the president may call on his army of police officers to restore order and back an attempt to postpone, cancel, or invalidate the November election.

Biden said he may have to deploy the military or law enforcement to forcibly remove Trump from the White House.

No wonder so many Americans say the country headed in the wrong direction.

107,Williams,Juan,thehill,"The hellish road to the racial turmoil of the last few weeks began the day Donald Trump was elected president.

I predicted this more than a year ago in my book “What the Hell Do You Have to Lose? — Trump’s War on Civil Rights.”

“When African Americans protest repeated cases of young black men killed by police,” I wrote, “President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE sees only valiant police protecting white America against a race of people with high rates of criminal activity. He is oblivious to black people as fellow Americans suffering injustice.”

ADVERTISEMENT

Since then Trump has dedicated himself to reversing civil rights progress and denigrating people standing up for equal rights.

Long before George Floyd died under a policeman’s knee, Trump attacked NFL players kneeling in peaceful protest against police brutality as unpatriotic “son[s] of ... bitch[es].”

And with him as president, personal hate crime attacks against blacks, Jews, Latinos and immigrants have spiked, according to the FBI.

Some people say Trump is appealing to his base.

But keep in mind that Trump now stands apart from the 68 percent of white Americans, in a Washington Post poll last week, who say Floyd’s killing is not an isolated event but part of a broad problem with how police treat black people.

He is apart from NASCAR, which has decided to ban Confederate flags.

He is apart from several Republicans in Congress, who last week joined calls to remove statues of Confederate politicians from the Capitol.

He is apart from military leaders calling for the names of Confederate generals to be taken off military bases.

As I recount in the book, there is a long history of Trump claiming not to be racist — even when he settled a suit brought by the Nixon Justice Department by agreeing to stop blocking blacks from renting apartments in his buildings.

The same racist impulse allowed Trump to falsely insinuate that the first black president had not been born in the U.S. and was therefore illegally in the White House.

Trump’s history of playing on racial division for political gain allowed him to tell a 2017 audience of police officers “please don’t be too nice” to suspects being taken into custody. Then he added that the laws are made “to protect the criminal” and “horrendously stacked against us.”

That fit with his Justice Department acting to end consent decrees with several cities written to stop police from using excessive force.

This pattern of racial antagonism goes beyond police brutality.

From his first days in office, Trump claimed to know of widespread voter fraud — particularly in cities with large minority populations.

A presidential panel, however, failed to find any evidence of this.

But Trump still supported the divisive idea of requiring registered voters to have a photo identification. That requirement is proven to depress minority voter turnout. And he continues to oppose mail-in voting, even in the middle of a pandemic.

Trump’s negative attitude about affirmative action has been clear since the late 1980s, when he famously said an educated black person has it easier than an educated white person in getting a job.

His administration opposed requirements for federal contractors to show they made efforts to hire minorities. It also supported eliminating federal minority business development agencies and cut back on community development finance.

The same racial blindness by Trump holds true in his indifference to diversity.

A 2016 ruling by the Supreme Court allowed race to be a legitimate consideration — a “compelling interest” — for schools to consider as they admitted students. Trump’s Justice Department said such diversity efforts by schools were “unnecessary, outdated [and] inconsistent with existing law.”

To maintain his blindness on race, Trump surrounds himself with others blind to the reality of being black in America.

Last week, Larry Kudlow Larry KudlowMORE, his top economic adviser, was asked if he believed systemic racism exists in the U.S., and replied, “I do not.”

The week before, Robert O’Brien, the national security adviser, said: “No, I don’t think there’s systemic racism. I think 99.9 percent of our law enforcement officers are great Americans.”

And Bill Barr, Trump’s attorney general, sings the same song: “I don’t think that the law enforcement system is systemically racist,” he recently told CBS’s “Face the Nation.”

This callous indifference requires blinders.

Last week, Trump announced he will move the Republican National Convention to Jacksonville, Fla. He will accept the GOP’s presidential nomination on the 60th anniversary of “Ax Handle Saturday,” the day in Jacksonville when a mob of alleged Ku Klux Klan members beat peaceful activists trying to desegregate lunch counters.

He had planned to restart his campaign rallies in Tulsa this Friday, which is also ""Juneteenth,"" the anniversary of the emancipation of the last U.S. slaves. Amid an outcry, Trump moved the rally to Saturday. Tulsa is also a place with a bitter racial history. It was the site of a 1921 riot in which a band of white racists ransacked a black neighborhood, killing 300 people.

One could write — and I did write — an entire book on Trump’s hostility to black people.

The latest twist to the story is that Trump’s racism is finally catching up with him.

“Over the last two weeks, support for Black Lives Matter increased by nearly as much as it had over the previous two years, according to data from Civiqs, an online survey research firm,” The New York Times reported last week.

Imagine that — Trump’s racism is taking support for Black Lives Matters mainstream.

The November election will be a binary choice — Biden or Trump.

Yet the far left looks back almost 30 years to the 1994 crime bill as if it is a reason to hesitate supporting Biden in 2020.

Do they prefer Trump?

The same insane political myopia extends to harsh attacks on highly qualified candidates, including black women, who want to be Biden’s vice president.

Both Sen.

Demings made history as Orlando’s first female chief of police. Harris was California’s attorney general.

Accomplished black women with law-and-order credentials have the potential to help the Biden ticket with moderate suburban voters. They could also stir voter turnout in the black community.

That is true even at a time of heightened concern over police brutality.

Critics point out that as chief prosecutor in one Minnesota county she “declined to bring charges in more than two dozen cases in which people were killed in encounters with police,” according to the Washington Post.

The criticism of Demings and Harris is even more personal. The charge is that as black leaders the two women failed to counter the racism impacting black people caught in the criminal justice system.

Harvard University Professor Cornel West, an African American, legitimized this way of thinking in a CNN interview last week:

“We've tried black faces in high places,” West said. “They [centrist Democrats], all they want to do is show more black faces, show more black faces. But..the ‘Black Lives Matter’ movement emerged under a black president, black attorney general, and black Homeland Security [Secretary] and they couldn't deliver.”

Now keep in mind that West supported Sen.

And let the politically astute note that Sanders never gained traction with most black voters. Biden formally clinched the nomination on Friday, an outcome that had looked inevitable for some time.

Despite that overwhelming support from black voters, there are activists who continue to harp on Biden’s role in passage of a crime bill that put more police on the streets and increased the use of mandatory minimum sentences by judges.

It also had the unforeseen consequence of putting more black people in jail.

But remember, it is also true that the bill drove down crime rates in black neighborhoods.

That is why the crime bill was supported by the Congressional Black Caucus as well as nearly all of the nation’s black mayors and signed by a Democrat in the White House, President Clinton.

ADVERTISEMENT

That is why Factcheck.org noted last year that a group of black church leaders supported the bill back then by explaining that while they did not agree with every provision, “we do believe and emphatically support the bill’s goal to save our communities, and most importantly, our children.”

Michael Waldman, the president of the Brennan Center for Justice, who was a domestic policy advisor in the Clinton White House in 1994, told The Atlantic last year that the bill was not controversial: “Crime between 1960 and 1990 tripled…the level of social disruption and panic that caused is hard to explain now, because since then the crime rate has been dropping.”

It is a fact that between 1994 and 2017, the nation’s violent crime rate did fall 46 percent.

But in the current, politically charged focus on ending police brutality, the context is forgotten.

This is a sad replay of 2016, when Trump’s campaign got help from left-wingers critical of Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' Cuba readies for life without Castro Chelsea Clinton: Pics of Trump getting vaccinated would help him 'claim credit' MORE for her husband’s support of the crime bill.

Mrs. Clinton was famously asked if her “heart” had changed on race issues.

Clinton responded that apologies are less important that structural change.

“I believe you change laws [and] you change allocation of resources,” she said. “You are not going to change every heart.”

To defeat Trump, Democrats have to confront the absurdity of looking back into the past to attack Biden, Harris, Klobuchar and Demings, instead of looking forward to a better future on race.

The split between Bush and Trump got attention earlier this month when Trump lashed out at the 43

rd

president for issuing a simple call for national unity in fighting the coronavirus.

Trump attacked Bush on Twitter saying: “He was nowhere to be found in speaking up against the greatest Hoax [impeachment] in American history.”

But Bush’s statement never mentioned Trump.

The former president reportedly did not vote for Trump in 2016 but he did not vote for the Democrat, Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' Cuba readies for life without Castro Chelsea Clinton: Pics of Trump getting vaccinated would help him 'claim credit' MORE, either.

In a 2017 speech, Bush seemed to be rebuking the current president for allowing national politics to become “degraded by casual cruelty ... argument turns too easily into animosity.” He avoided directly calling out Trump by name.

Bush has also spoken up for longstanding Republican beliefs now under fire from the current administration.

He said in that same 2017 speech that free trade around the world is key to finding new markets for U.S. goods, as well as maintaining “an international order rooted in freedom and free markets.”

And again without calling Trump’s name, Bush made the point that Republicans have a history of welcoming immigrants, people with “talent, energy and enterprise from all over the world,” and noted that “people of every race, religion and ethnicity can be fully and equally American.”

Also in 2017, when Trump failed to unequivocally rebuke white nationalists after a violent rally in Charlottesville, Va., Bush and his father, former President George H.W. Bush, put out a statement, again without mentioning Trump, that said: “America must always reject racial bigotry, anti-Semitism, and hatred in all forms.”

Trump, for his part, has been quick to call out Bush by name. He falsely claimed to have been “among the earliest” to oppose Bush’s decision to go to war in Iraq.

He also critiqued Bush for the September 11, 2001, terror attacks.

“I’ve heard for years he kept the country safe after 9/11 — what does that mean? ... What about during 9/11? ... The worst attack ever in this country. It was during his presidency. I mean, we had the worst attack ever,” Trump said in 2016.

Trump has also gone after Bush’s fellow members of the club of living former presidents.

He has derided President Carter as a “terrible president.”

Trump also continues to push the debunked “Obamagate” conspiracy theory that President Obama, who is friendly with Bush, is guilty of the “biggest political crime in American history.” He did not say what crime he was talking about, and only offered a conspiratorial comment that “the crime is very obvious to everybody.”

Now Trump is reportedly not inviting Obama to the White House for his official portrait unveiling — a courtesy that every president, regardless of party, has afforded to their predecessor in the modern era.

Recently, Obama has become more direct in criticism of the Trump administration but, like Bush, always without calling out Trump by name.

The Los Angeles Times reported last week that on a conference call with his former White House staffers, Obama called the current White House’s response to the coronavirus “an absolute chaotic disaster.”

In April, Obama tweeted he has not seen a “coherent national plan” to respond to the pandemic. And in a May graduation address, Obama told students: “All those adults that you used to think were in charge and knew what they were doing? It turns out they don’t have all the answers. A lot of them aren’t even asking the right questions.”

Kate Andersen-Brower, author of a new book “Team of Five: The Presidents Club in the Age of Trump,” recently wrote in The New York Times that “now that Mr. Trump has ripped up the playbook of civility, members of the so-called Presidents Club have free rein” to be critical of him.

For all of their faults and foibles, Presidents Carter, Clinton, Obama and Bush — men I have personally interviewed — played presidential politics with a profound sense of public service. That included the old-school notion of holding their tongues during the 2016 presidential campaign.

But if their rhetoric over the last month is any indication, I think they are determined not to make the same mistake twice.

There is no question about whom Carter, Clinton and Obama plan to support.

That leaves Bush holding the biggest stick here. Groups of leading conservative thinkers in The Lincoln Project and a new group including several former top GOP officials called Republican Voters Against Trump have set the table for Bush to speak up.

If he announces he is voting for Biden, it will change some votes.

116,Williams,Juan,foxnews,"The fear of police among black and brown people can be puzzling to whites who find comfort in the famous “Thin Blue Line” between them and criminals.

But the video showing the shocking death of George Floyd under the knee of a Minneapolis policeman makes black fear of the police – especially among black men – a reality for people of all races to see.

Now comes the hard part.

NICK HALL: GEORGE FLOYD RESPONSE — MINNEAPOLIS PASTOR OFFERS 3 ACTION STEPS FOR JUSTICE

Black or white, Asian or Latino, native born or immigrant, we all need police.

And poor people, disproportionately people of color who often live with high rates of crime, need good police the most.

Crime drives down property values and pushes out retail stores.

It can be just as poisonous as banks and insurance companies using red lines on maps to show where they cut off poor neighborhoods as not worthy of investment for home mortgages or home improvement. It is just as destructive as district lines that separate good schools from bad schools.

When people with power signal they are OK with police harassing “those people” it can lead to daily tension that like a burning fuse, is sure to lead to an explosion of outrage after the officer is videotaped pushing his knee into an unconscious man’s neck.

And it inevitably leads to fear and sometimes outbursts of anger among young people of color who feel stigmatized and unfairly harassed by the police.

Even worse, it sometimes leads to police thinking that roughing up people on the wrong side of town is their job since the powerful never raise a voice against it.

The key here for all Americans, but especially for white people at the top of the corporate and political ladder, is to take on the job of shifting a morally corrupt mindset that celebrates the police as a buffer – the Thin Blue Line – between the poor and people in the better parts of town.

That failure of conscience by community officials leads police to use skin color as a shorthand as they assess the threat posed by a citizen.

Americans with money and political power can demand respect from public police forces and even buy private security.

And they can turn away from police harassment of teen and young adult black males – remember “stop and frisk” – as a necessary police tactic because of higher rates of crime in poor neighborhoods.

That kind of thinking – us against them – leads to excusing police abuse of “those people.”

That failure of conscience by community officials leads police to use skin color as a shorthand as they assess the threat posed by a citizen.

The result of that twisted logic is too often the mistreatment of black people of any economic class because they are not seen as citizens first but as a threat on the basis of skin color.

That kind of thinking can lead to harmful, racial stereotyping of a young black man taking a run across town.

It can lead to a white woman threatening a black man by telling police that she is in danger from a black man, knowing the police are more likely to believe her lie than his truth that she got angry after he asked her to obey the law.

In this moment healing can only come from shared purpose, the tissue of community reconnecting to bridge the wound.

It is already on view in Minneapolis, where black and white citizens can be seen with shovels, brooms and “Go-Fund-Me"" donations helping to repair the mindless damage done when legitimate, peaceful protests are taken over by violence.

And healing will come when leaders in government, in business and in culture agree to take on the daily work of sending the message to their community that the police are here to protect everyone from crime.

Healing will lead to peace when the police chief, the mayor, the governor and the president repeat the message that police are here to protect everyone.

Healing means insisting that police do all they reasonably can to show respect for citizens of all colors. That means people at their best, people at their worst.

That kind of policing is the best because it will make us all safer.

It is hard work to defeat a racial stereotype that has been around for so long.

But the best policing begins by successfully crossing racial lines to reach from the poorest neighborhood to the wealthiest with standards in line with the eponymous police pledge to protect and serve all citizens – not just us from them.

117,Williams,Juan,thehill,"When I met Clarence Thomas Clarence ThomasAmy Coney Barrett receives million advance for book deal: report We need a Herbert Hoover to reel in Big Tech Trump-era grievances could get second life at Supreme Court MORE in 1980, I never thought that 40 years later he’d be described as “Trump’s favorite” Supreme Court justice.

After all, a poll earlier this year from the Washington Post and IPSOS found 83 percent of black people think President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE is a racist. So, what does that say about Justice Thomas?

The man I met recited Malcolm X’s radical speeches from memory and had black nationalist views. He believed it is best for black people to take care of themselves instead of waiting for government help or pushing for integration with white people.

ADVERTISEMENT

As an example, he pointed to the failure of government, and of integration, to produce good schools for most black children.

He held the same black nationalist views in the mid-80s when he told me that even educated, successful black Americans who had “made it” knew integration was about whites having a few black people around as window dressing.

“There is nothing you can do to get past black skin,” he told me for a 1987 story I wrote about him for The Atlantic. “I don’t care how educated you are, how good you are at what you do — you’ll never have the same contacts or opportunities, you’ll never be seen as equal to whites.”

Today, that black nationalist is celebrated by Trump conservatives and reviled by black activists for his vote to strike down much of the Voting Rights Act and his opposition to affirmative action.

Today, Thomas is the justice who seemed to dismiss arguments about Congress’ right to see the president’s financial records as nothing more than Trump hatred: “I think we all know it’s about the president,” he said.

Today, his wife, Ginni, is a prominent Trump supporter. She reportedly was among those who gave Trump lists divided into people who were “disloyal” or others who would “work better toward advancing his agenda,” according to CNN.

And Justice Thomas is also the subject and star of a recent documentary made by a right-wing filmmaker who is a fan of Trump’s former chief strategist, Stephen Bannon.

Now, as the longest serving Justice on the high court, Thomas is seeing many of his law clerks appointed to federal courts by Trump. Voting records show he is also a role model for Trump’s two conservative nominees to the court, Justices Neil Gorsuch Neil GorsuchTop GOP super PAC endorses Murkowski amid primary threat Trump-era grievances could get second life at Supreme Court Supreme Court sides with Google in copyright fight against Oracle MORE and Brett Kavanaugh Brett Michael KavanaughBiden's court-packing theater could tame the Supreme Court's conservatives Trump knocks CNN for 'completely false' report Gaetz was denied meeting NY Times beclowns itself by normalizing court-packing 'to balance the conservative majority' MORE.

That is new territory for Thomas.

Even as his “views have endeared him to some conservative legal theorists,” the Wall Street Journal wrote last week, Thomas has had only “limited…influence even on a right-leaning court.”

The Journal cited cases where Thomas’s losing arguments would have made it easier for “states to endorse religion and prosecutors to remove black jurors.”

But with Trump in the White House, Thomas’ arguments are a fit for the Trump agenda. Both want to limit federal regulatory power, oppose abortion rights and support making it harder for news organizations to use the First Amendment to avoid lawsuits.

“He’s the most right-wing member of the court, and we are in a right-wing moment,” Harvard Law School professor Randall Kennedy told the New York Times last week.

A January survey from the Pew Research Center found that a quarter of black Democrats describe themselves as conservative, and 43 percent describe themselves as moderate.

Thomas’ calls for personal responsibility, protection of individual rights, and for black people to build their own successful schools and businesses fits with many of those black conservatives.

Thomas and I have political differences but his intellect and dignity in dealing with unfair personal attacks led me to admire him. I have been rooting for Thomas all these years and holding him out as an example to my own sons.

ADVERTISEMENT

I have seen young black and white people inspired as they hear Thomas’ life story. He grew up poor and fatherless in Georgia yet followed the guidance of a strict grandfather to achieve academic excellence, graduate from Yale Law School and take a seat on the Supreme Court.

Thomas once told me that a young black person came up to him after he gave a speech about his belief in the ability of black people to succeed to say: “Man, they [critics on the left] lied on you.”

But as John Blake, a CNN writer, argued last year, Thomas’ conservatism and inspiring personal story are not at the root of mainstream black criticism of him. Other conservative black leaders such as Colin Powell Colin Luther PowellOvernight Defense: Biden makes his Afghanistan decision Colin Powell on Afghanistan: 'We've done all we can do' Is nonpartisan effectiveness still possible?

Brady retiring Tim Scott to participate in GOP event in Iowa MORE (R-S.C.), do not come in for such rough treatment.

The issue is that “his judicial decisions harm black people,” Blake wrote, citing Thomas’ vote to weaken the Voting Rights Act.

Similarly, a New Yorker article once described Thomas as being cheered by powerful whites for telling them “that affirmative action was bad, that black people didn’t want or need their help, that government did more harm than good.”

Her presence is also likely to be seen as a counter to Thomas and his close ties to a president viewed as an antagonist to black wellbeing — Trump.

119,Williams,Juan,thehill,"Republican strategists earlier this month sent a startling message to GOP senators facing reelection: “Don’t Defend Trump.”

Then last week, a Rasmussen Reports poll said 23 percent of likely GOP voters agree it is a good idea for the party to “find someone other than Trump to be their nominee.”

Trump’s reelection hinges on maximizing turnout among his base. The Rasmussen poll suggests there are more than a few restless souls inside the Trump tent but itching to leave.

ADVERTISEMENT

Up to now, Trump’s best move to enforce loyalty in his base has been to subject anyone stepping out of line to a Twitter rant while also boasting about his high level of support among Republicans — even to the point of exaggeration.

He once claimed to be the most popular Republican president in history. That is not true.

What is true is that he is very popular among Republicans. Polling often shows him in the vicinity of 90 percent approval from GOP voters. He dotes on TV ratings and popularity in the GOP to drown out dissenting voices.

But now there is a platform for just such dissent.

It comes in the form of an ad created by The Lincoln Project, a group of Republicans acting in defiance of the enforced loyalty holding together the Party of Trump.

The ad begins by showing how Trump “ignored” the coronavirus, which has now killed more than 80,000 Americans, and left “the economy in shambles [and] more than 26 million Americans” out of work.

“There’s mourning in America and under the leadership of Donald Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE, our country is weaker, and sicker, and poorer,” the ad intones.

The one-minute ad has over 2.3 million views on YouTube alone.

The Lincoln Project raised more than $2 million the week after the ad aired, according to the Los Angeles Times.

As you can imagine, Trump immediately fired back.

He began on May 5 by attacking the founders of The Lincoln Project as a “group of RINO Republicans who failed badly 12 years ago, then again 8 years ago, and then got BADLY beaten by me ... doing everything possible to get even for all of their many failures.”

Then on May 9, he tweeted: “These people are stone cold crazy!”

That was almost a week after he first saw the ad.

Trump’s persistent anger thrilled the people behind the ad.

“We found his weakness and we’re going to keep hitting it,” Rick Wilson, a GOP strategist and one of the key members of The Lincoln Project, told Vanity Fair.

The other founders of The Lincoln Project include George Conway George ConwayLincoln Project forming 'transition advisory committee' amid calls to close The Hill's Morning Report - Democrats ready mammoth relief bill for 10-day sprint Lincoln Project faces calls to shut down MORE, the conservative lawyer who is the husband of Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway Kellyanne Elizabeth ConwayKellyanne Conway joins Ohio Senate candidate's campaign Mark Zuckerberg, meet Jean-Jacques Rousseau?

Their efforts legitimize a fast exit for every Republicans looking to pull away from enforced loyalty to Trump.

“We’re creating a movement of Republicans who’ve decided it’s better for us to defeat this flavor of Republicanism — even if it means electing a Democrat,” Sarah Lenti, the executive director of The Lincoln Project, told the Wisconsin Examiner.

Lenti thinks the ad will lead more conservatives away from Trump.

“If ever there were a time when you might see Republicans move, this is it,” she explained to the Examiner. She added that Trump will lose in November if only a small percentage of Republicans defect.

The emotional impact of the Lincoln Project’s ad is generating envy among some Democrats who wonder why — despite Trump’s consistently high disapproval ratings among all voters — they have had trouble penetrating the Trump bubble to reach dissident conservatives.

“The way that you run a presidential campaign is you're a pirate ship. ... You seize and you loot and you burn,” James Carville, the Democratic strategist, said on MSNBC last week.

ADVERTISEMENT

“Let me tell you ... these ‘Never Trumper’ Republicans, the Democrats could learn a lot from them. They're mean. They fight hard. And we [Democrats] don't fight like that.”

The Lincoln Project’s advertising also includes criticism of Republican senators whom they have accused of “spineless servility” to Trump for allowing him to take control of the party.

“I’m just disgusted by what they’ve been doing, really, for the last three years,” Bill Kristol, the conservative commentator, told the Washington Post magazine last week.

“We're really going to pay a price for this terrible failure in leadership.”

Much of the price may come in the loss of independent voters.

A Monmouth University poll released earlier this month found Joe Biden Joe BidenObama, Clinton reflect on Mondale's legacy Biden, Harris commend Mondale in paving the way for female VP Mondale in last message to staff: 'Joe in the White House certainly helps' MORE leads Trump by over 40 percentage points among voters who have a negative opinion of both candidates.

The Lincoln Project ads have the power to free those voters from any lingering allegiance to Trump.

Lincoln Project, keep up the good work for the country’s sake. Please.

Step one — the former “wartime president” now wants you to forget his stumbles on the battlefield of the coronavirus pandemic.

Next, playing the role of “CEO president,” Trump will stage pep rallies full of promises of a quick economic recovery.

ADVERTISEMENT

Polling gives the president good reason to campaign as a master of job creation and stock market highs.

While most Americans disapprove of his job performance as president, a poll released last week by Navigator has 51 percent of Americans approving — strongly or somewhat — of Trump’s handling of the economy.

And in a head-to-head comparison with presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden Joe BidenObama, Clinton reflect on Mondale's legacy Biden, Harris commend Mondale in paving the way for female VP Mondale in last message to staff: 'Joe in the White House certainly helps' MORE in a recent Reuters poll, Trump held a big lead, 45 percent to 32 percent, as the better candidate to create jobs.

Trump’s campaign is already playing to his image as an economic leader by running television advertising declaring he is the man to bring back jobs and high investment returns.

My only question is: How can any voter fall for it?

It is a repeat of the same empty economic promises he made in the last campaign.

Even Trump’s most loyal backers know that despite his promise to create 4 percent or higher economic growth when he became president, he has never produced such results.

The truth is that he has averaged about 2 percent growth.

And that was before the virus hit.

That 2 percent rate of growth is basically the same as the growth rate under President Obama. Trump mocked that growth rate as piddling even though Obama started out in a deep hole, dealing with the deep recession that took root under President George W. Bush. As Chuck Jones of Forbes noted earlier this year, “Trump’s economic growth is slower than Obama’s last 3 years.""

Obama also reduced unemployment from 10 percent at the height of the recession in 2009 to 4.7 percent by January 2017 when Trump took office. Yet, Trump brags that he took unemployment down to 3.5 percent without mentioning that he inherited a growing economy.

Now that jobless claims have soared to depression-level highs, Trump is selling himself to voters once again as a rich man who knows how to pull the economy out of the ditch it fell into due to his failed handling of the pandemic.

But to buy his sales pitch, the voters will have to forget that January day when the ‘CEO President’ sold Americans on the idea that the virus is “totally under control,” and no threat to Americans or the American economy.

Trump’s Commerce Secretary, Wilbur Ross Wilbur Louis RossFormer Trump officials find tough job market On The Money: Retail sales drop in latest sign of weakening economy | Fast-food workers strike for minimum wage | US officials raise concerns over Mexico's handling of energy permits US officials raise concerns over Mexico's handling of energy permits MORE, even predicted in January that the virus was good economic news because it was sure to “accelerate the return of jobs to North America” from overseas.

In late February, Trump was bragging that he had the virus “very much under control in the USA… stock market starting to look very good to me!”

By mid-March, as businesses began to close, Trump was still selling smoke and sizzle: “I think we’re going to get through it very well.”

Trump’s happy talk ignored his failure to prepare to contain the virus, specifically in terms of tests and medical supplies.

Without the tools to contain the spread of the virus in the U.S., the economy came to a near-halt as scientists and doctors advised people to keep their distance from each other and when possible stay home.

Let me preempt my Trump-supporting friends right here, because I can feel them getting ready to interject.

ADVERTISEMENT

No, I am not saying that Trump caused the deadly virus. I am saying that Trump’s failure of leadership, constant spewing of misinformation and lack of a coherent national strategy allowed the virus to do greater damage to the economy than it otherwise would.

Yet an upbeat Vice President Pence is still selling the illusion that the nation will be done with the punishing virus by the end of May. And Trump is forecasting a “phenomenal” economy in time for the November election.

Any voter applauding Trump’s bluster has to close their eyes to the obvious. With the virus still spreading and many people out of work, there is not a lot of consumer confidence in an economy that thrives on consumer spending.

Majorities of Americans tell pollsters they have no plans to spend money to go to a movie, to go out to dinner, to attend a ballgame or travel.

Biden needs to remind voters of the Obama administration’s success in pulling the country out of recession and specifically its success in pushing the stimulus plan that got the economy back on track.

There will be Trump supporters who ignore the candidates’ track record on the economy. They don’t like to let simple facts stop them from endorsing — and enjoying — his latest sales pitch.

Suddenly the hot question is whether Trump’s support among Republicans on Capitol Hill is withering.

First came the memo warning Senate Republicans up for reelection: “Don’t defend Trump, other than the China Travel Ban — attack China.”

The advice to seek political shelter at a distance from Trump arrived from the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Given Senate Republicans’ record of blindly defending Trump, the memo signaled a new reality.

GOP senators for the first time see their political future as separate from Trump’s bid for a second term.

Further reason to distance from the president came from an ad attacking four Senate Republicans up for reelection for their record of “spineless servility” to Trump. The ad was paid for by anti-Trump Republicans.

And the biggest sign of internal GOP division was Trump’s threat to sue his campaign manager.

Trump was upset that Brad Parscale Brad ParscaleAides tried to get Trump to stop attacking McCain in hopes of clinching Arizona: report MORE sent him polls showing him losing the White House to former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenObama, Clinton reflect on Mondale's legacy Biden, Harris commend Mondale in paving the way for female VP Mondale in last message to staff: 'Joe in the White House certainly helps' MORE.

“I’m not f---ing losing to Joe Biden,” President Trump said on a call with his senior campaign staff last week, according to multiple sources who spoke to The Associated Press.

But losing, you are, Mr. President. Parscale’s data fits with both public and internal campaign polling.

Trump is losing in national polls and in key swing states. He is even losing among people over 65, according to the Wall Street Journal. Biden’s lead grew after the president’s infamous suggestion that injecting disinfectant into the human body could wipe out the deadly virus.

An NPR–PBS NewsHour–Marist poll out last week found a majority — 55 percent — of Americans disapprove of Trump’s handling of the pandemic — an increase of 6 points since last month.

Some political forecasts are outright scary for Republicans. Political scientist Rachel Bitecofer published an election forecast for the Niskanen Center which predicts a “blue tsunami” as the “most likely outcome.”

The latest USA Today–Suffolk poll shows that if the election were held today, Biden would beat Trump by 10 points in a nationwide head-to-head match-up.

And the latest RealClearPolitics average of polls has Biden leading Trump by more than 3 points in Wisconsin, Florida, Michigan, Arizona, Minnesota and Pennsylvania.

With those numbers, strategists have good reason to tell Republican politicians to move away from Trump. If he is at the top of ballots in the November elections his decline is a threat to pull them down.

“President Trump’s erratic handling of the coronavirus outbreak, the worsening economy and a cascade of ominous public and private polling have Republicans increasingly nervous that they are at risk of losing the presidency and the Senate if Mr. Trump does not put the nation on a radically improved course,” The New York Times reported last week.

Already, Democrats look well-positioned to hold on to — and even expand — their House majority.

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee reported its largest quarterly fundraising haul in history last week — with $43.5 million and more than $80 million cash on hand. The National Republican Congressional Committee raised $39.3 million in the first quarter with just $49 million cash on hand.

With that fundraising disadvantage, the GOP is unlikely to capture the seats they need to win the House majority.

The Senate majority is also now up for grabs. Prospects for Republicans holding on to their 53-47 Senate majority look dimmer than earlier in the year. Incumbent Republican senators in Colorado, Arizona, Maine and North Carolina are all struggling to defend Trump’s slow response to the COVID-19 crisis.

In addition, the nonpartisan Cook Political Report now rates four more GOP-held seats, in Georgia, Iowa, Kansas and Montana, as only “lean Republican.”

The rising prospect of that severe storm for the GOP is leading strategists to advise their candidates to shelter away from Trump.

“This may be an unprecedented circumstance in terms of public health and the budget, but it’s not unprecedented politically for the party in Congress to look at the incumbent president in the election and say: ‘How can we protect ourselves from the drag of the White House?’” former Republican congressman Vin Weber told The Hill last week.

Again, this is why Republican spin doctors are advising vulnerable senators to stop defending Trump and try shifting to attacks on China.

Senate Democrats see the GOP infighting as confirmation of the power of their argument against Trump.

“Ignoring warnings from the intelligence community, sending PPE to China, and failing to properly prepare the country — that’s the legacy of this administration and the Republican Senators who continue to support it,” said DSCC spokesperson Helen Kalla.

With six months until Election Day, Republicans are wise to consider the political equivalent of a quarantine of Trump to keep him from infecting otherwise politically healthy incumbents.

The president has tried to blame immigrants, the media and, of course, China. He claims he did not actually put into words the idea of putting disinfectants inside people but was being “sarcastic.”

Well, it is not sarcasm to say right now that Trump’s bleach comments may have just wiped out his “red wall” in the Electoral College and possibly the Republican majority in the Senate.

Let’s begin with the former president, the most powerful political player not currently in office.

When Obama endorsed Biden earlier this month, The New York Times ran a quote describing Obama as having unique superpowers. He is “a surrogate unlike anyone else anyone can bring to bear — I mean, who has Trump got?” said Democratic pollster Joel Benenson.

Good question.

Even if the previous Republican in the White House, President George W. Bush, agreed to campaign for Trump, he does not excite Trump’s anti-Republican establishment base of voters.

How about Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong 15 Senate Republicans pledge to oppose lifting earmark ban It's not 'woketivism,' it's good business MORE (R-Ky.)? I’ll let you answer that.

By contrast, Obama is revered among Democratic voters. He even has pull among swing state independent voters, some of whom backed Obama before voting for Trump.

Obama also has the power to stir up the maximum turnout from black voters, the most reliable voting bloc among Democrats and a group that overwhelmingly disapproves of Trump, as shown in poll after poll.

Getting the full black vote to the polls could be fatal to Trump’s reelection. In 2016, the black voter turnout declined 7 percentage points from 2012. Almost 67 percent of black voters turned out to reelect Obama, whereas that figure fell to 60 percent four years later.

The absence of those black voters in swing states was bad news for Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' Cuba readies for life without Castro Chelsea Clinton: Pics of Trump getting vaccinated would help him 'claim credit' MORE. She lost Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin by a narrow margin, a combined total of about 80,000 votes.

Black voters in those states, potentially energized by Obama, can erase that shortfall by themselves.

Obama also retains appeal to older, white moderate voters who twice put him in the White House. And his reputation for competence and compassion makes him an effective critic of Trump’s bungled response to the coronavirus pandemic.

The second member of this fantastic real-life foursome is his wife.

Michelle Obama grabbed headlines last week when Biden smiled at the idea of having her as his vice presidential running mate.

“I’d take her in a heartbeat,” Biden said last week. “She’s brilliant. She knows the way around. She is a really fine woman. The Obamas are great friends.”

Since leaving office, the former first lady has stayed in the public eye and become the rare political leader who can fill arenas nationwide with female voters of all races.

Her memoir, “Becoming,” was the best-selling nonfiction book of 2019. A December Gallup survey said she is the “most admired woman in America,” a title she claimed for the second year in a row.

And she packs a political punch with her nonpartisan, nonprofit group to protect voting rights, When We All Vote.

She started the group in 2018 and recently weighed in on the controversial decision by the GOP majority on the top Wisconsin court to insist on going ahead with the state’s primary elections during the coronavirus.

""Americans should never have to choose between making their voices heard and keeping themselves and their families safe,"" Obama said, putting a new, compelling face in the front of the Democrats’ fight against voter suppression.

The third member of this Biden-backing group is Holder, Obama’s former attorney general. He is now chairman of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, campaigning against GOP efforts to gerrymander congressional districts.

He is calling for an expansion of voting options including mail-in and absentee ballots. While these proposals are getting a closer look as a practical response to coronavirus, they could eliminate barriers to voting for elderly and minority voters if they become permanent.

The final member of the team is Stacey Abrams. She narrowly lost her race for governor of Georgia in 2018, but the powerful sight of a black woman doing well in Southern politics made her a political rock star.

She wrote a best-selling book in 2018 and now heads up a nonprofit encouraging people, particularly minorities, to fill out the 2020 census so they can be accurately counted for federal aid and congressional reapportionment.

Biden has pledged to put a woman on his ticket and a black woman on the Supreme Court. Abrams’s name comes up regularly for consideration for both spots.

These four black champions hold the keys to a Biden victory by juicing Democrats’ energy and turnout in an election likely to be decided by which side gets out its voters.

Last year I wrote that “Obama has one more election to win for the Democrats.”

That is still true, and a unified party behind Biden is ready to give him lots of help.

Most of all, you can count on President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE to continue saying “The Bernie people” should “come to the Republican Party.” Trump tweeted that message earlier this month.

Trump is targeting the 27 percent of Democrats who told a HuffPost/YouGov poll last week they are “dissatisfied” or “upset” with Biden as the party’s presidential nominee.

Much of that discontent comes from Sen. Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersOvernight Energy: Treasury creates hub to fight climate change through finance | Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez introduce 'Green New Deal for Public Housing' | Don't attack Zoom for its Bernie Sanders federal tax bill Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez introduce 'Green New Deal for Public Housing' MORE’ (I-Vt.) supporters. Fifteen percent told an ABC/Washington Post poll in March “they’d back Trump over Biden.”

Like soldiers hiding in the hills, shooting at shadows long after the war is over, these dissident Democrats are mostly a threat to themselves.

Last week, Sanders and the other leading light of the party’s left wing, Sen. Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth WarrenWorld passes 3 million coronavirus deaths Poll: 56 percent say wealth tax is part of solution to inequality Democratic senators call on Biden to support waiving vaccine patents MORE (D-Mass.), gave strong endorsements to Biden. So did the most progressive president in my lifetime, President Obama.

They don’t want the nightmare of four more years of Trump assaulting healthcare in general and ObamaCare in particular; provoking racial tensions by ignoring the rise of white supremacist groups; demonizing immigrants; and showing indifference to climate change.

But somehow there are still leading voices on the left who say that it will be “four years of darkness” for progressives seeking structural change in America no matter who wins between Biden and Trump.

Say what?

Ginsburg has had four bouts with cancer, including undergoing treatment for pancreatic cancer last year.

The dissident Democrats might want to ask themselves if they are willing to give Trump two more appointments to the Supreme Court.

If Trump makes those nominations, he will create a 7-2 conservative majority on the Court for another generation. That conservative majority will aim to end legal protection for abortion by overturning Roe v. Wade as well as reversing the legalization of gay marriage.

Trump has already appointed nearly 200 right-wing judges to the federal bench.

Last week, he threatened to forcibly adjourn Congress so that he could ram through a new slate of far-right presidential appointees.

When he endorsed Biden last week, Sanders said any of his supporters who cite policy disagreements with Biden as a reason to vote Republican or sit out this election are being “irresponsible.”

But not everyone sees it that way.

Briahna Joy Gray, Sanders’ former press secretary, last weeek tweeted about her admiration for “ideas like #MedicareForAll, cancelling ALL student debt, & a wealth tax.”

She immediately added that “Biden supports none of those,” to explain why she is not getting on board with Biden.

But in Sanders’ words, anyone who decides to stay on the sidelines will be guilty of allowing “the most dangerous president in modern American history to get reelected.”

Obama is also trying to rein in discontent among the Bernie Bros.

“Of course, Democrats may not always agree on every detail of the best way to bring about …[progressive] changes, but we do agree that they’re needed,” Obama said. “And that only happens if we win this election.”

Obama also took responsibility for some of the bitterness among Democrats on the left. He knows some on the left view his presidency as having been too moderate. They blame him for failing to blast Republicans who blocked his nominees and refused to act on his agenda.

If he was running for the White House this year, Obama said, he would be more aggressive and not run on the same platform as he did in 2008.

“The world is different,” he said during his 12-minute video endorsing Biden. “There is too much unfinished business for us to just look backwards. We have to look to the future.”

Obama’s pitch fits with the fact that two-thirds of Democrats are “satisfied” with Biden as the party’s nominee, according to the HuffPost/YouGov poll.

It is also a fact that Biden won the majority of votes in the Democratic primaries. He won despite Sanders raising the most money. He won after losing the first three contests for the nomination. He won while being attacked by Trump, and without a big establishment campaign organization.

And now, Biden is attempting to build a bridge to Sanders voters.

Biden last week announced support for lowering the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 60. He has also come around to making public colleges and universities cost-free for most students. These are both ideas from the Sanders playbook.

As Obama was fond of saying, let’s not let the perfect be the enemy of the good.

One of the most memorable moments at the 2016 Democratic National Convention featured comic Sarah Silverman, a Sanders supporter. She went on stage to say it made no political sense for people like her to abandon the Democratic ticket because Sanders lost the nomination.

“To the ‘Bernie or Bust’ people,” she said, “you’re being ridiculous.”

Here we go again. Bernie or Bust people, stop being ridiculous. Again.

124,Williams,Juan,thehill,"Andrew Breitbart, the late rightwing media provocateur who became a friend of mine when we did debates, once famously remarked that politics is downstream from American culture.

So, what does it say about our politics when the most popular show on Netflix right now, when everyone is staying home due to coronavirus, is “Tiger King”?

The documentary is a cultural phenomenon with its carnival of characters involved with murder-for-hire, animal cruelty, and gay polygamy.

ADVERTISEMENT

It even caught the attention of O.J. Simpson — a celebrity familiar with sensational murders. He tweeted that one character fed her missing husband to the big cats as “Tiger Sashimi.”

When I asked a Washington wiseman about the political message coming from the show’s success, he tried to stop the conversation. “Why do you bring politics into everything?” he asked.

I then reminded him that the central character in “Tiger King,” ran for political office twice.

‘Joe Exotic,’ the gun-toting zookeeper, got 19 percent of the vote in the 2018 Libertarian primary for governor of Oklahoma.

And two years earlier, Joe Exotic, also known as Joe Maldonado-Passage, got nearly a thousand votes for President of the United States.

His third-party presidential run got attention on “Last Week Tonight with John Oliver.” The HBO host described the tiger tamer as the “candidate you’d like to sit down and have a beer with, and then another beer and then several more beers…”

Joe Exotic’s attraction as a candidate is the latest evidence of the power of celebrity in today’s politics.

After all, Donald Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE, a self-promoting reality television star with no political experience, won Oklahoma in 2016 with 65 percent of the vote on his way to winning the presidency.

Celebrity politics roared again last week when a reporter asked Trump if he would consider pardoning the ‘Tiger King,’ who is currently in jail after being convicted of plotting to murder a rival.

Culture and politics are now so mixed together that they can’t be separated. That’s the reality of American politics in 2020.

We’ve reached an extreme where the president, in the middle of national crisis, happily brags that his daily televised briefings from the White House get high ratings on par with the finale of “The Bachelor,” and ""Monday Night Football.""

As the conservative editorial page at The Wall Street Journal wrote last week, Trump has turned briefings intended to inform people about the crisis into “a showcase for him…[a] substitute in his mind for campaign rallies…the briefings are now all about the president.”

More precisely, the briefings are now a televised platform for his stroking his ego and promoting his re-election campaign. He even awarded himself the brassy title of “Wartime President.”

With cameras on him for more than an hour, he pursues grudges, including raging at governors who fail to praise him. In the middle of a global pandemic the TV audience can see him trash the World Health Organization, shifting blame from his own slow response to the pandemic.

How can Democrats create a reality show to compete with the Trump show?

To flip the script, Democrats need to outdo Trump with a more fascinating show featuring their own heroes and villains.

“Tiger King” provides the script outline for how Democrats can replace Trump as the leading man in contemporary political culture.

The new storyline was written by Amanda Green, the U.S. attorney who got a red-state, Oklahoma jury to convict Joe Exotic of hiring a hitman to kill his rival.

In a made-for-TV closing statement, Green said Joe Exotic built his fame by deceiving people and abusing tigers to build “his own kingdom,” and convince people he was a real “Tiger King.” In Trump-like style he boasted, he lied, attacked critics and fed his ego with an internet television show.

Green got the jury to shift from fascination with Joe Exotic to revulsion with a bully who took advantage of people because he got to make “all the rules… He decided he would protect the kingdom at all costs. It’s your job to make sure that no one, not even the Tiger King, is above the laws of the United States.”

Imagine if Green had been the lead attorney for Trump’s impeachment over the Ukraine scandal.

Instead of Trump depicting himself as a hero under attack from evil Democrats led by “Shifty-Schiff” [Rep. Adam Schiff Adam Bennett SchiffOvernight Defense: Administration says 'low to moderate confidence' Russia behind Afghanistan troop bounties | 'Low to medium risk' of Russia invading Ukraine in next few weeks | Intelligence leaders face sharp questions during House worldwide threats he Hillicon Valley: Biden administration sanctions Russia for SolarWinds hack, election interference Intelligence leaders face sharp questions during House worldwide threats hearing MORE (D-Calif.), the lead House prosecutor] Green would have called out Trump as a “Paper Tiger,” another fake concerned only with protecting his power.

With that vivid talk, she would have created the kind of made-for-TV moment that gripped a jury in Oklahoma and turned Joe Exotic into a villain behind bars.

America’s fascination with Joe Exotic fills me with fear that we may not have seen the height of celebrity politics with Trump. One day we may look back at Trump as a relatively dignified character given the excesses of the next generation of celebrity politicians.

If the Democrats want to prevent the next wave of charlatans from presenting themselves as heroes fighting the establishment, they can begin by recasting Trump, Red State America’s current hero, as the villain.

A highly entertaining villain but nonetheless, a villain.

That was Maryland’s Republican governor, Larry Hogan, defying President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE’s claim that there is no shortage of tests for the coronavirus.

Earlier, another GOP governor, Charlie Baker of Massachusetts, gave a similarly pointed response to another presidential edict on coronavirus: “No.""

Baker went negative on Trump’s call to end social distancing and pack churches by Easter Sunday.

And of course, Ohio’s Republican governor led the way in breaking with Trump’s decision to downplay the virus.

“This is life and death,” Gov. Mike DeWine told The Washington Post, by way of explaining his decision to cancel sports events and close schools in the absence of direction from Trump.

DeWine clearly saw the threat posed by the virus differently than Trump, who famously promised that “like a miracle, it will disappear.”

Those three GOP governors put a premium on effectively protecting their states’ residents from widespread infection and death.

Their pragmatism led them to defy the indifference to the virus coming from Trump and echoed by right-wing websites and radio hosts.

But several other Republican governors chose to go along with Trump out of fear of being sent into political purgatory if they got out of step with the president.

By the end of last week, the 13 states without stay-at-home rules were all states led by Republicans — and states carried by Trump in the 2016 presidential election.

Ron DeSantis Ron DeSantisDeSantis signs 'anti-riot bill' cracking down on 'public disorder' WHO panel comes out against requiring vaccination proof for travel Parade of 2024 GOP hopefuls court House conservatives MORE, the Republican governor of Florida, issued his ‘stay-at-home’ order late last week; that came only after he allowed beaches and amusement parks to remain open in March, leading to a rapid increase in the spread of the virus in his state.

The slow response from DeSantis and several other Republican governors is understandable in political terms. Every politician on the right got chills watching Trump lashing out at Democratic governors who have been critical of his lack of early response to the virus.

Trump admitted at a press briefing that he advised Vice President Pence, the head of the White House task force dealing with the outbreak, not to call Gov. Jay Inslee Jay Robert InsleeDelaware state lawmakers consider bill to allow human composting The Hill's 12:30 Report: Nearly half of U.S. adults partially or fully vaccinated The Hill's 12:30 Report: CDC identifies 5.8K COVID cases of 66M vaccinated MORE (D) of Washington — whom Trump has called a “snake” for criticizing him.

And Trump told the vice president not to speak with the Democratic governor of Michigan, Gretchen Whitmer: “Don’t call the woman in Michigan.”

In true Trump bully-style politics, he has also tried to coin a nickname for Whitmer suggesting she lacks full mental capacity.

When Democratic governors complained about a lack of federal coordination in helping with supplies of ventilators, masks and medical gloves, Trump attacked them.

“For years they bought them and now they’re coming to the federal government,” Trump argued, seeking to distract from his administration’s failure to ramp up production of medical supplies in February or early March.

In the case of New York, Trump even suggested to Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo Andrew CuomoNew York AG asked to investigate if Cuomo used state resources on his book On The Money: Treasury creates hub to fight climate change | Manchin throws support behind union-backed PRO Act | Consumer bureau rolls out rule to bolster CDC eviction ban Cuomo: Congress must include SALT cap repeal in future legislation MORE that the real problem was theft.

“Where are the masks going?” Trump asked at a news conference. “Are they going out the back door,” he said in response to Cuomo’s request for more masks.

But when Florida’s DeSantis finally got serious about battling the virus, the White House opened its cabinet of medical supplies.

“As states across the country have pleaded for critical medical equipment from a key national stockpile, Florida has promptly received 100 percent of its first two requests — with President Trump and Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis both touting their close relationship,” the Washington Post reported.

As always, the president seems singularly focused on his political fortunes in November. Nothing else explains his erratic behavior during the crisis.

Keep in mind, Trump wants to win Florida in the fall campaign.

Specifically, he fears losing to Joe Biden Joe BidenObama, Clinton reflect on Mondale's legacy Biden, Harris commend Mondale in paving the way for female VP Mondale in last message to staff: 'Joe in the White House certainly helps' MORE and his campaign is open about that anxiety.

""This is the bottom line: President Trump is leading the nation in this war against the coronavirus, and Joe Biden, the Democrats and the media have decided to be the opposition in that war,"" Tim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign's communications director, told campaign surrogates last week.

Trump even tried to pit Cuomo against Biden by suggesting that Cuomo is the better choice for the Democrats to nominate as their presidential candidate.

“I wouldn’t mind running against Andrew…I’ll be honest, I think he’d be a better candidate than Sleepy Joe,” Trump said on “Fox & Friends.” His nervousness about Biden was evident again when he added the nation needs “a great president...I personally don't think Joe Biden is capable.""

Biden is not responding with put-downs, but by saying he is open to talking with Trump.

Biden supporters, however, are taking to the airwaves with hard-hitting ads replaying the president’s own dismissive words and misinformation during the early weeks of the outbreak.

Priorities USA, one of the top Democratic super-PACs, is running a $6 million television and digital ad campaign in Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, slamming Trump’s poor handling of the crisis.

Trump bears responsibility for pushing politics to the forefront of this crisis. He is the one who is thin-skinned, demanding public praise and describing Democrats and even Republicans who disagree with him as “the opposition” in this moment of national trauma.

Wrong, Mr. President — the virus is the opposition.

Mueller’s work led to 37 indictments or guilty pleas.

But a year later, what stands out is how the lack of criminal charges against Trump and members of his family have emboldened the president.

And when that corrupt phone call was uncovered, Trump thumbed his nose at the House impeachment process by describing it as sour grapes from Democrats, depicting them as disappointed that he was not ousted by Mueller’s findings.

Trump also felt free to punish the military and diplomatic staff that fulfilled their constitutional duty to testify before Congress about his underhanded effort with the Ukrainians. Then he went on a pardoning spree, even hinting at possibly pardoning Flynn and attacking a juror in the Stone case.

Earlier this month, Barr’s twisting of the Mueller Report led U.S. District Court Judge Reggie Walton to order the Justice Department to give him a full — no redactions — copy of the document.

Walton wrote that the attorney general’s “misleading public statements” in summarizing the parts of Mueller’s work that were later released appear to have been a “calculated” effort to protect the president and even create political advantage for the president.

Why did the judge issue such a rare rebuke?

For one, Mueller’s failure to charge Trump with obstruction of justice created an opening for Barr to claim that Trump broke no law.

But Mueller later told Congress he did not exonerate Trump and did not indict because of federal policies against charging a sitting president.

Here is what Mueller wrote about Trump’s effort to interfere with his probe: “If we had confidence… that the president clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state.”

That’s not all.

Barr also twisted Mueller’s failure to charge conspiracy or collusion between Russia and Trump’s campaign. Somehow, he did not mention that Mueller set a very high standard by looking for an explicit agreement between Moscow and Trump’s campaign.

Also, Barr did not say that Mueller’s report found “numerous links between individuals with ties to the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump campaign.”

This is why Mueller protested that Barr’s summary “did not fully capture the context, nature and substance” of his report.

ADVERTISEMENT

Yet, that mild, gentlemanly rebuke from Mueller cannot hide the reality that having uncovered damning facts, his report lacked the strong language and charges necessary to stand up to a storm of Trump’s alternative facts and pure misinformation.

Ken Starr, the independent counsel who investigated President Clinton, charged him for lying about sex.

Mueller had more significant lies by Trump but did nothing with them.

As a result, Trump continues to use the Mueller Report as a political whipping boy, happily dismissing the investigation as a “scam,” and “witch hunt.” Trump says it never should have taken place even though the Justice Department’s Inspector General found no political bias in the decision to start the Mueller investigation.

When Trump objected to the sentencing recommendation in the Stone case he tweeted “these were Mueller prosecutors.”

Looking back, Mueller’s failure to interview the president and members of his family — including his son, Donald Trump Jr., who met with a Russian at Trump Tower during the campaign — was viewed as having prevented a lengthy court fight that could have delayed release of the report.

The same forgiving attitude extended to Mueller’s failure to get Trump’s tax returns. Mueller’s decision to go easy apparently also led him to not call out Trump for lying about writing a misleading statement about the Trump Tower meeting.

But those decisions are hard to swallow today. The underlying offense — that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to help Trump — is still ongoing.

As the New York Times reported in February: “Intelligence officials warned House lawmakers last week that Russia was interfering in the 2020 campaign to try to get President Trump re-elected.""

The question is, how do Biden and Democrats handle Mueller’s report and Russia as a campaign issue? Should they just let it go, not mention Russia?

There is a strong argument that Biden should let Russia go and focus on Trump’s mishandling of the coronavirus and the looming recession. That does not mean history will do the same.

Their dismissive view of Biden’s pledge to name a woman as his running mate is a hint of their likely distaste for his promise to nominate a black woman to the Supreme Court.

No black woman has ever been considered for the court, much less served there. Of the 114 people who have been on the bench since 1790, 108 have been white men.

For most of my life, the idea of a woman as vice president or a black woman sitting on the Supreme Court amounted to a progressive’s pipe dream.

The core of the GOP argument is that Biden is guilty of pandering to women instead of seeking the best qualified person for the job.

The air goes out of that putdown with a look at how President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE handed the vice presidency and two court nominations to white men.

Trump’s Supreme Court nominees both came from a list provided by the conservative Federalist Society. Clearly, a consistent conservative political leaning — not simply top judicial qualifications — has been the determining factor for Trump.

The only time a woman was named as the Republican vice-presidential nominee — Sarah Palin in 2008 — few argued that her resumé made her the best qualified person for the job.

Palin was selected because the Alaska governor was a fresh voice and she generated excitement. But her lack of experience in national politics and foreign affairs — in other words, a lack of qualifications — became a burden on Sen.

The same is true of the wealth of well-qualified black women for Biden to nominate to the Supreme Court.

Biden has an array to put on his shortlist. It begins with Harris, who previously served as District Attorney of San Francisco and Attorney General of California. But it also includes Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia and Justice Leondra Kruger of the California Supreme Court.

Biden could even go out of the box with a political star with a Harvard Law School degree — former first lady Michelle Obama Michelle LeVaughn Robinson ObamaGeorge W.

The only lack of ‘qualification’ for these women is that they are not men.

And the U.S. has never had a woman serve as president or vice-president.

Keep in mind that the majority of the voters in at least the last five presidential elections have been female, and most of them cast their ballots for the Democrat.

A majority of women of color voted for the Democrat in each election — including 94 percent of black women in 2016.

But in all five elections, a majority of white women voted for the Republican presidential candidate. However, in the most recent national elections, white women have been trending away from Republicans.

In 2016, white women voted for the GOP by 11 percentage points but in 2018 they voted for Republicans and Democrats in equal numbers — 49 percent for each party.

Exit polls from those midterm races found 59 percent of all women voted for the Democrat in that year’s congressional races compared to just 40 percent of women who voted Republican.

Note that when Democrats won those 41 seats, most were won by female candidates. The Democrats’ class of 2018 in Congress introduced the nation to a new generation of female leaders like Reps. Katie Porter (Calif.), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Alexandria Ocasio-CortezOvernight Energy: Treasury creates hub to fight climate change through finance | Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez introduce 'Green New Deal for Public Housing' | White House defends 'aspirational' goal of 62,500 refugees Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez introduce 'Green New Deal for Public Housing' MORE (N.Y.), Elissa Slotkin Elissa Slotkin House Republicans pressuring Democrats to return donations from Ocasio-Cortez Democrats move smaller immigration bills while eyeing broad overhaul On The Money: Biden celebrates relief bill with Democratic leaders | Democrats debate fast-track for infrastructure package MORE (Mich.) and Abigail Spanberger Abigail Davis SpanbergerLawmakers say companies need to play key role in sustainability On The Money: Weekly jobless claims fall to lowest level since lockdowns | Retail sales surge in March | Dow, S&P hit new records Democrats brace for new 'defund the police' attacks MORE (Va.).

So far, Biden’s primary campaign has succeeded by attracting the same suburban, white, moderate female voters who rewarded the Democrats with a House majority in 2018.

That why his promise to nominate a female vice president makes sense.

To use Biden’s famous hot-mic line from the Obama years, this is a “big f-in deal.”

It could come to that, because despite the power of incumbency and a passionate political base, President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE’s political prospects are looking shaky.

The Trump administration’s incompetent response to the coronavirus has sent financial markets on a rollercoaster ride while triggering an explosion of public anxiety.

Last week’s nationally televised speech from the Oval Office was full of factual errors. And on an emotional level it failed to reassure the public or the financial markets as evidenced by the alarming response from apolitical money managers.

They voted with a sell-off. Suddenly the word ""Recession” has new currency. Both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average saw their single biggest drops last week since the “Black Monday” stock market crash of 1987.

Then there is the political backlash from the right to consider:

Trump regularly fires up his base by telling them he is looking out for them. He presents himself as their guardian, standing between them and every threat.

He will build a wall to keep out the immigrants.

He will bring back jobs in coal mines and manufacturing factories.

He will ignore climate change so the government won’t ask his fans to limit use of fossil fuels.

Well, four years later there is no wall. Coal mines and manufacturing remain in decline. Household debt and the national deficit continue to balloon.

And now he has failed to protect anyone with his faulty response to a pandemic. Local officials in the absence of federal leadership took the lead by shutting down schools, major sports leagues and Broadway shows.

Trump’s primary response has been political spin.

He blames his failures on the “Fake News” media and the Democrats. He blames Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. He blames President Obama.

The reality is that Trump’s failure to protect Americans from the virus is very hard to spin.

Last week a Hill/HarrisX poll found 53 percent of registered voters disapproving of the president’s response to the virus. And 58 percent of independent voters also disapproved.

In a Kaiser Family Foundation poll, 55 percent of Americans are either “somewhat” or “very” concerned there will be a widespread outbreak of the coronavirus.

Keep in mind these numbers are likely to go up because Trump’s base among Republicans is currently the least concerned about the impact of the virus. Trump told them not to worry.

A week after the first American was diagnosed with the virus in January Trump said, “We have it totally under control.”

On February 24 he sent the same message, tweeting: “The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA.”

Trump’s spin, echoed by his choir in right-wing media, continued to downplay the public health crisis and dismissed the need to declare a national emergency.

He predicted on February 26 that the number of infections is “going very substantially down, not up” and in “a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero.”

Incredibly, on February 28 he put more spin on the message by saying: “It’s going to disappear…like a miracle — it will disappear.”

When it did not disappear and passengers got sick on a cruise ship off the California coast, Trump put political appearances first by saying he did not favor allowing sick people off the boat for treatment.

“I like the numbers being where they are,” he said of the total number of people counted as suffering with the virus in the U.S.

“I don’t need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn’t our fault.”

Trump’s biggest failure is his administration’s inability to provide testing kits to detect the virus.

Seven weeks after the first case of Coronavirus in the U.S. was made public, the problem with inadequate supply of tests is there for everyone, including Trump’s supporters, to see.

And without proper testing, medical authorities have no idea about the size of the population already infected and spreading the disease.

ADVERTISEMENT

Congressional panels have spent weeks grilling top Trump administration officials like Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar over the government’s failure to provide enough testing equipment in the early stages of the outbreak.

""The system is not really geared to what we need right now…That is a failing. It is a failing, let’s admit it,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

That is just one part of the failure.

In 2018, the Trump administration decided to disband the White House’s global health security team.

Given the depth of the political hole he has dug eight months before the presidential election, does anyone really think the president would hesitate to use the coronavirus as justification for postponing or canceling the next presidential election?

Now is the time for journalism to hold the president and his administration and their Republican enablers in Congress fully accountable for their spin and failure to govern effectively.

Americans are panicked. The markets are tanking. People are dying. If now is not the time for Trump’s base, independent voters and journalists to challenge him on his failures then there will never be a good time to do it.

I’m all-in on fighting capitalist greed and military dominance. But something is wrong when the left blindly praises the failed leadership of Cuba’s Fidel Castro, Venezuela’s Hugo Chavez and Nicaragua’s Daniel Ortega — even after the damage done by their oppressive regimes.

“We’re very opposed to the authoritarian nature of Cuba but …” Sanders told 60 Minutes in February, “[Castro] had a massive literacy program. Is that a bad thing? Even though Fidel Castro did it?”

That’s a ridiculous comment.

In terms of 2020 presidential politics, it delights President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE’s supporters as they rush to label Sanders a “socialist.”

And Sanders’s words hurt Democrats with moderate voters, especially blacks and suburban women, who boosted the party to majority control of the House in the 2018 midterms.

But for young Democrats, Sanders’s passionate base, the call for revolution has gained traction because they are infuriated by moderate Democrats who lost the 2016 election to Trump.

What good is being moderate — in the style of Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' Cuba readies for life without Castro Chelsea Clinton: Pics of Trump getting vaccinated would help him 'claim credit' MORE or Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaObama, Clinton reflect on Mondale's legacy Polls suggest House Democrats will buck midterm curse and add to their ranks Boehner: Mass shootings 'embarrassing our country' MORE — if an uncompromising minority of voters elect a bullying, immoderate President Trump?

What good is being reasonable if the majority of voters, who chose Clinton over Trump, can only watch as Trump exercises uncompromising control of the Senate while politicizing the Supreme Court?

There is a lot of truth there.

There is also a need for a forceful, political response to Trump’s embrace of right-wing authoritarian rule overseas, as well as his divisive politics at home, including giving tax cuts to the rich at a time of grave income inequality.

But populist left-wing calls for a political revolution are not selling with most Democrats, or the suburban swing voters who will decide the 2020 elections.

Even if we confine the debate to the base of the Democratic Party, Sanders’s appeal falls short because black voters, who know a lot about inequality in America, are not buying it.

Beginning in South Carolina, black Democrats – the party’s most reliable voting bloc – have given more than half of their primary votes to a centrist candidate: former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenObama, Clinton reflect on Mondale's legacy Biden, Harris commend Mondale in paving the way for female VP Mondale in last message to staff: 'Joe in the White House certainly helps' MORE.

And most white Democrats aren’t buying it either.

According to a Pew Research poll published in January, a majority of Democrats – 52 percent – describe themselves as either “moderate” (38 percent), “conservative” (11 percent) or “very conservative” (3 percent).

“Americans aren’t looking for revolution,” Biden recently told NBC News. “They’re looking for progress. They’re looking for, ‘Tell me how you’re going to help me with my health care. Tell me you’ll make me safer.’”

“You don't have a majority of the Democrats that are in on your revolution,” James Carville, the former strategist for President Clinton, told MSNBC on the night of Super Tuesday, in comments aimed at Sanders.

“We want to beat Donald Trump…Democrats are not interested in a revolution, they are interested in getting this guy out of power just as fast as they possibly can,"" he added.

On Capitol Hill, Democrats tell me they fear Trump will label Sanders a communist in the November election — and that will imperil every Democrat running.

""I think everyone knows that it's going to be much more difficult to win back the Senate and keep the House if Bernie is at the top of the ticket,"" Biden told CNN in an interview last week.

And Sanders’s biggest political vulnerability as he calls for revolution is his exotic view of Latin American dictators.

ADVERTISEMENT

Putting politics aside for the moment, this is personal for me.

My family left Panama in the early 1950s to escape poverty and open the doors to education and opportunity that began being shut by a Latin strong man — Arnulfo Arias.

Like Castro, Arias claimed to be fighting for poor and working-class people in his country. But Arias jailed, tortured and oppressed anyone who did not obey his regime.

He discriminated against blacks, Asians and native people. That repression extended to confiscating property and even trying to deny Panamanian citizenship to people like my grandfather, who died building the Panama Canal.

Even in the troubling age of Trump, my personal experience with Latin revolutionaries leaves me a true believer in restoring America’s promise of equal rights under the law, free debate and democratic politics.

Democrats, by voting for Biden over Sanders, are coming down on the side of restoring American institutions. They are voting for a revival of those institutions, not a revolution.

What will it take to get Senate Republicans to march to the Trump White House — as they did long ago when Nixon was in the Oval Office — and tell the president he is hurting the country and it is time to go?

ADVERTISEMENT

Less than a month ago, Senate Republicans gave Trump a pass despite clear evidence he committed a high crime by pushing a foreign government to interfere in the 2020 election. They even refused to hear witnesses.

The job of justifying the GOP’s refusal to convict fell to Sen. Susan Collins Susan Margaret CollinsSenate aims to pass anti-Asian hate crimes bill this week This week: Democrats move on DC statehood Trump looms over Senate's anti-Asian hate crimes battle MORE (R-Maine).

Senate Republicans’ stand against removing him from office was nonetheless a “lesson” for Trump, she said.

How was it a lesson?

In a subsequent interview, Collins explained that “many voices in the Senate have pointed out that the call [in which Trump asking the Ukrainian president to announce a probe into a political opponent] was problematic.”

Well, Collins should take a look at what has happened since:

Trump fired the Director of National Intelligence after one of his aides told Congress that Russia continues to interfere in U.S. politics and is interfering in the 2020 election to help Trump.

Trump then replaced him with a loyal Trump supporter with no experience in the FBI, CIA or any other intelligence agency.

And the new head of intelligence, Richard Grenell, then fired a deputy with 30 years of experience. He replaced him with a former House aide who has pushed the discredited conspiracy theory that the FBI and CIA led a ‘Deep State’ effort to defeat the Trump 2016 campaign.

Now, Collins has regrets: “I would have much preferred that the president nominate the acting director Maguire for the post…” she said. “I care deeply about that position and believe the person needs experience in the intelligence community, which regrettably Ambassador Grenell does not have.”

And there is more, Sen. Collins.

Since the Republicans in the Senate gave him a free pass, Trump has fired people who testified at the House impeachment hearings. The banished include Alexander Vindman Alexander VindmanVindman says he doesn't regret testimony against Trump Esper: If my replacement is 'a real yes man' then 'God help us' Ukrainian president whose call with Trump sparked impeachment congratulates Biden MORE, a decorated war veteran.

Once again, Sen. Collins, while the Senate is looking the other way, Trump appears to have clearly broken the law.

U.S. Code states it is illegal to retaliate against “any person, for providing to a law enforcement officer any truthful information relating to the commission or possible commission of any Federal offense.”

But Trump’s press secretary disagrees. Anyone who testified about the president’s actions “should pay for that,” she said.

Collins again expressed regret.

“I obviously am not in favor of any kind of retaliation against anyone who came forward with evidence,” Collins said when told the news of the president’s purge of American citizens for having testified to the facts under oath in public congressional hearings.

Oh, but there is more, Sen. Collins.

With no fear of Congressional oversight, Trump is now acting as judge and jury by giving clemency to a group of convicts, mostly rich friends, including a former New York police commissioner, the former owner of an NFL team, the former governor of Illinois and a former Wall Street “junk bond king.”

Rep. Bill Pascrell William (Bill) James PascrellLawmakers launch bipartisan caucus on SALT deduction Five hurdles Democrats face to pass an infrastructure bill Progressives fight for leverage amid ever-slimming majority MORE Jr (D-N.J.) described the wave of pardons as Trump shielding “unrepentant felons, racists and corrupt scoundrels.”

And that led to concern that he is on the verge of pardoning even more of his friends, including former aides from his 2016 campaign who have been convicted of crimes. They include former campaign chairman Paul Manafort Paul John ManafortThere was Trump-Russia collusion — and Trump pardoned the colluder Treasury: Manafort associate passed 'sensitive' campaign data to Russian intelligence Hunter Biden blasts Trump in new book: 'A vile man with a vile mission' MORE, former national security adviser Mike Flynn and political confidante Roger Stone Roger Jason StoneThere was Trump-Russia collusion — and Trump pardoned the colluder On The Money: Moderates' 0B infrastructure bill is a tough sell with Democrats | Justice Dept. sues Trump ally Roger Stone for unpaid taxes Justice Dept. sues Trump ally Roger Stone for unpaid taxes MORE.

Senator, you may say that is only speculation. But there is reason for the concern.

Trump has launched a Twitter attack on federal prosecutors, a federal judge and even a juror in the Stone case.

Trump complained that the sentence recommendation from federal prosecutors for Stone, to punish him for lying to Congress and witness intimidation, was too harsh. Soon after, top Justice officials changed the sentencing memo and four prosecutors quit.

That didn’t stop Trump. He then attacked the federal judge and a juror in the case. The judge is “totally biased,” he said before accusing the jury foreman of hating him and Stone.

The judge, unlike Congress, took a stand: “Any attempts to invade the privacy of the jurors or to harm or intimidate them is completely antithetical to our system of justice,” said Judge Amy B. Jackson.

She added the obvious about a nation that is founded on equal justice under law and not one man’s opinion: “The truth still exists. The truth still matters.”

We are lost, Sen. Collins.

Neither of them has a history of success with black Democrats.

Joe Biden Joe BidenObama, Clinton reflect on Mondale's legacy Biden, Harris commend Mondale in paving the way for female VP Mondale in last message to staff: 'Joe in the White House certainly helps' MORE, the former vice president, has been the strong preference of black voters in national polls for months. But in the wake of his poor showing among white Democrats, Biden is now losing support among blacks who desperately want to beat Trump.

Of course, if South Carolina and other southern states with large black populations had been the first to vote, Biden would have a large lead.

The failure of white voters to take into account Biden’s strong support from black voters — the base of the party’s vote in presidential elections — has the potential to lower black turnout in November. It is puncturing any happy talk about a party unified across racial lines to defeat Trump.

The key to understanding the split among black and white Democrats is that black Democrats have more at stake in preventing four more years of Trump.

Yes, a majority of Democrats of all races agree Trump is a racist.

But 65 percent of black Americans say it is a “bad time” to be black in the United States, according to a January Washington Post-Ipos poll.

Those same black Americans told the pollsters they think it is a “good time” to be white and a majority added that white Americans — of all political stripes — somehow “don’t understand” what it means to be black in Trump’s America.

White Democrats regularly point to Biden’s role as vice president to the first black man in the White House, President Obama, to explain the black voter preference for Biden.

That is patronizing.

The biggest factor, according to months of polls, is that Biden to this day consistently beats Trump. He wins against Trump, especially among working-class white voters in swing states such as Pennsylvania and Michigan.

That is why blacks so far have been reluctant to take a risk on a far-left candidate, Sanders, or a newcomer with the added electoral challenge of seeking to become the first openly gay president, Buttigieg.

The same risk-averse impulse among black voters led them to withhold support from the main black candidates seeking the nomination, Sens. Kamala Harris Kamala HarrisBiden, Harris commend Mondale in paving the way for female VP Overnight Energy: Treasury creates hub to fight climate change through finance | Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez introduce 'Green New Deal for Public Housing' | Harris: Americans able to 'breathe easier and sleep better' under Biden MORE (D-Calif.) and Cory Booker Cory BookerBass 'hopeful' on passing police reform: 'Republicans that I am working with are operating in good faith' Progressive lawmakers press DHS chief on immigration detention Democrats battle over best path for Puerto Rico MORE (D-N.J.), both of whom have now dropped out.

Black voters want a sure shot to end a very personal threat.

How personal?

Step outside the distorting political lens of the battle for the nomination and listen to Jay Tabb, chief of the FBI national security operation.

Tabb last month put it this way: The United States is experiencing a “significant increase in racially motivated violent extremism.” He added that the racial violence has come with a rise in white supremacist and white nationalist movements across the nation in recent years.

That gives black voters a pragmatic reason to be very anxious about the possibility of four more years of Trump.

Another source of alarm among black voters is that the Congressional GOP leadership has stopped all efforts during the Trump era to renew the Voting Rights Act. Instead, they have trumpeted the lie that there is widespread voter fraud and called for more voter identification requirements.

And then there is the economy.

Trump often cites low black unemployment as evidence of how good he is for black America.

ADVERTISEMENT

But 77 percent of black Americans, according to the Post-Ipos poll, said Trump’s efforts deserve “only some,” or “hardly any” credit for the current low rate of black unemployment while he is working to cut the social safety net, from ObamaCare to Medicaid and food stamps.

Trump has tried to distract attention from the racial impact of those harsh policies.

During the Super Bowl, his campaign ran an ad about his commutation of the sentence for a black woman, Alice Marie Johnson, who had been in jail 21 years for her non-violent role in cocaine trafficking.

Then during the State of the Union address he pointed to a 100-year-old former Tuskegee Airman in the House gallery. Trump noted he gave the man, Brig. Gen. Charles McGee, an honorary promotion.

It was quite a show for whites, especially suburban white women who voted for Trump in 2016. They have been turned off by Trump’s behavior, including his racism, and voted heavily against Trump and the GOP in the 2018 midterms.

Meanwhile, white Democrats in the early primary contests are looking away from black racial angst, showing a preference for an exciting nominee even if their favored candidates are not the choice of black Democrats and do not poll the best against Trump.

A Democratic nominee who excites white Democrats but not black Democrats may lead to a repeat of 2016 when black voter turnout was down from 2012.

Trump’s 2020 campaign is very interested in peeling even a few percentage points off black turnout in order to win again in the swing states.

South Carolina’s results will say a lot about the depth of the split between black and white Democrats.

Yes, the former vice president had a disappointing showing in the first two Democratic presidential contests — placing fourth in the Iowa caucuses and fifth in the New Hampshire primary.

Trump is so scared of facing Biden in a general election that the president got himself impeached for trying to get a foreign leader to damage Biden’s campaign.

Despite the ‘anything goes’ political tactics from Trump, Biden remains the Democrat who does best against Trump in most head-to-head general election polls.

Across the nation, Democrats have said defeating Trump is their number one priority. So, there should be no question about Biden’s standing as the candidate who meets the top criteria for Democratic voters.

Yes, Biden is one of several Democrats currently polling ahead of Trump in the general election. But those polls do not take into account that Biden has already withstood prolonged attacks from Team Trump.

The media narrative that Biden is not long for this race is wildly unfair and does a tremendous disservice to voters who have not yet made up their minds.

Maybe I’ll be proven wrong in two months if Biden drops out.

But there is something fundamentally unfair and undemocratic about the media driving a Trump message as conventional wisdom to damage Biden.

Biden is still in it.

A White House beset by lies, chaos, and corruption,” a narrator says in a Bloomberg ad. “It doesn't have to be this way. Next year we can have a leader who brings people together…Mike Bloomberg will get it done.""

Bloomberg is not on the ballot in Tuesday’s New Hampshire primary. He was absent in Iowa last week. And he will be absent in upcoming races in Nevada and South Carolina.

But while standing on the sidelines, Bloomberg changed the game by pledging to double his already sky-high spending on TV advertising. According to multiple reports, Bloomberg has spent around $300 million on TV, radio and digital advertising since entering the race in November.

Bloomberg had one big reason to double down. Joe Biden Joe BidenObama, Clinton reflect on Mondale's legacy Biden, Harris commend Mondale in paving the way for female VP Mondale in last message to staff: 'Joe in the White House certainly helps' MORE, the top candidate for centrist Democrats, finished fourth in Iowa.

Bloomberg’s ambition got another lift last week when the Democratic National Committee issued new rules for qualifying for upcoming debates. With a donor requirement removed, Bloomberg will be on the debate stage from now on.

Bloomberg is not known for charisma, one-on-one or on the debate stage.

But his money makes him very attractive to primary voters as the answer for the top question on their mind: How do Democrats stop the threat of a second Trump term?

Exit polls coming out of Iowa last week confirmed what nationwide polls have been saying for months: Democrats’ top priority is selecting a nominee who gives them confidence in beating Trump in November.

For five years, politicians on the left and right have looked for the best way to respond to Trump’s populist appeals to working class, white voters with attacks on ‘the swamp’ of government workers, FBI officials, educated elites, immigrants, blacks and Latinos, and strong women — most recently Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiWhite House readies for Chauvin verdict House GOP's McClain responds to Pelosi calling her 'that woman' GOP struggles to rein in nativism MORE (D-Calif.).

The Bush family, the Clinton family and every formidable political force in-between — including major political donors from the Koch family on the right to George Soros on the left — have searched for the magic formula to respond to Trump’s gleeful appeals to right-wing grievance and anger.

Bloomberg’s simple answer: money, money, and more money.

For example, Bloomberg spent $11 million on a 60-second Super Bowl ad calling for new gun control laws.

It was a powerful ad, full of drama as a mother grieves over her child’s loss of life. And it was a clear rebuke to Trump’s caving to the gun lobby despite constant gun violence and mass shootings.

In contrast, Biden’s pitch to Iowa voters — in person and in ads — was that Trump will lose if the election is a referendum on the president’s bullying, his chaos and racism.

As a moderate former senator and vice president who is well-liked by Republicans and Democrats, blacks and whites, Biden argued that his presence as the Democrat on the ballot would force voters to focus on Trump’s troubling antics.

But if Biden can’t win in Nevada and South Carolina — after losing in Iowa and likely in New Hampshire — then the door opens for Bloomberg to be crowned as the Democrat with the best chance to beat Trump.

Unlike Biden, Bloomberg has yet to face the full force of a Trump barrage. Meanwhile, his first hurdle is winning the Democratic nomination.

Bloomberg is spending heavily on advertising in the states that will vote on Super Tuesday, March 3.

More than one-third of the Democrats’ available delegates will be up for grabs that day, in big states such as California, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Texas, and Virginia.

Bloomberg’s biggest weapon at the moment is the Democratic establishment’s fear of Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersOvernight Energy: Treasury creates hub to fight climate change through finance | Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez introduce 'Green New Deal for Public Housing' | Don't attack Zoom for its Bernie Sanders federal tax bill Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez introduce 'Green New Deal for Public Housing' MORE.

“If Sanders soars through the first four primaries…Mike may end up as the only thing standing between Bernie and the nomination,” Bradley Tusk, who managed Bloomberg’s 2009 mayoral campaign and is advising the presidential run, told the Atlantic magazine last week. “A large portion of the party believes that Bernie can’t beat Trump — and that beating Trump is all that matters.”

Democrats have a credible fear that Sanders’s unabashed embrace of far-left policies will make him a big target for Trump’s fear-mongering about ‘socialist’ politics.

Trump taunted Bloomberg by falsely claiming that the 5’8” former mayor requested a box to stand on behind the debate podium.

But Trump’s ridicule can’t turn off Bloomberg’s money.

The latest polling also shows the Vermont Senator leading in the New Hampshire primary.

And he has a surprising helping hand: Team Trump is cheering him on while dumping on Biden.

Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst Joni Kay Ernst15 Senate Republicans pledge to oppose lifting earmark ban Child care advocates seek to lock down billion in new federal funding GOP senator: Raising corporate taxes is a 'non-starter' MORE (R) gave the GOP’s game away last week during the heat of the Senate impeachment trial based on President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE’s attempt to get Ukrainian officials to damage Biden.

Here’s Ernst:

“Iowa caucuses are this next Monday evening. And I'm really interested to see how this discussion today informs and influences the Iowa caucus voters, those Democratic caucus-goers. Will they be supporting Vice President Biden Joe BidenObama, Clinton reflect on Mondale's legacy Biden, Harris commend Mondale in paving the way for female VP Mondale in last message to staff: 'Joe in the White House certainly helps' MORE at this point?” she mused to reporters.

“She spilled the beans!” Biden later told a crowd in Iowa. Ernst, he added, “just came out and flat said it. The whole impeachment trial for Trump is just a political hit job to try to smear me, because he is scared to death to run against me.”

There’s no question that Trump fears Biden and sees Sanders as what boxers call a “tomato can” opponent – someone who can easily be bloodied.

Last week the New York Times reported on Team Trump’s embrace of Sanders:

ADVERTISEMENT

“President Trump’s advisers see Senator Bernie Sanders as their ideal Democratic opponent in November and have been doing what they can to elevate his profile and bolster his chances of winning the Iowa caucuses, according to Republicans familiar with the plans.”

The latest Fox News poll has the former vice president beating Trump in a head-to-head match-up by nine points. The same poll shows Sanders defeating Trump by six points.

But keep in mind that Trump has been trashing Biden for months while giving Sanders a free ride.

In a general election, how easy will it be for Team Trump to portray Sanders as a wild-eyed, self-proclaimed socialist radical? Already Trump has branded initiatives from single-payer health care to the Green New Deal as costly exercises in “socialism.”

And that’s just the start.

With Sanders — or “Crazy Bernie” as Trump calls him — as the nominee, Trump will point to his opponent’s honeymoon trip to the former Soviet Union.

Trump can run ads of Sanders praising the regime of Cuba’s Fidel Castro for promoting a “revolution of values.”

Sanders once delighted in calling U.S. policy towards Castro’s Cuba a failure. He said Americans failed to understand that the Cuban people, had no intention of rising up against Castro’s communist ideology.

""Everybody was totally convinced that Castro was the worst guy in the world... They forgot that he educated their kids, gave their kids healthcare, totally transformed the society,” Sanders claimed.

How do you think that will play in Florida?

The irony here is that the democratic socialist from Vermont is the mirror image of the Republican plutocrat from Manhattan.

They both attract big, loud, crowds by appealing to populism and railing against powerful and well-connected business and political insiders — what Trump calls “the swamp.”

Their social media presence dwarfs their opponents and their online supporters belittle, even threaten, opponents.

Also like Trump, many of Sanders’s supporters wear grievances against the political establishment as badges of honor.

In Trump’s case he used his 2016 campaign to belittle every establishment Republican from Sen. John McCain John Sidney McCain'Real Housewives of the GOP' — Wannabe reality show narcissists commandeer the party George W.

Now Sanders is at war with the Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' Cuba readies for life without Castro Chelsea Clinton: Pics of Trump getting vaccinated would help him 'claim credit' MORE and the Democratic National Committee.

It is an article of faith among the “Bernie Bros” that Sanders was cheated out of the 2016 nomination by corrupt pro-Clinton forces at the DNC.

They rightly point out that Sanders won the Democratic contests in Wisconsin and Michigan in 2016 — states that Clinton went on to lose to Trump in the general election.

Meanwhile, Clinton, in a new documentary, says of Sanders “nobody likes him.”

The split among Democrats has the potential to weaken anti-Trump turn-out in November.

And as Jonathan Chait pointed out in New York magazine last week, the far-left, Sanders wing of the party lost most of its races in the 2018 midterms while moderate candidates won enough seats to put Democrats back in the majority of the House and open the door to impeaching Trump.

ADVERTISEMENT

Note that throughout this column, I have made reference to “Team Trump.” Trump’s view is not as clear.

As the Intercept reported last week: “Trump, according to operatives in his circle, has expanded his reelection worries from his longtime focus on former Vice President Joe Biden to the new twin threat of Sanders and former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg…He has also long been concerned that the populism embraced by Sanders…would play out in unpredictable ways in a general election.”

That’s right. If Sanders is the nominee he will have won as a populist insurgent who destroyed his party’s establishment and excites the party’s base.

That’s why Trump’s campaign better be careful about rooting for Sanders.

That same political formula took Trump to the Oval Office.

Best of all, Schiff created a good story by asking Republican senators to stand up for what is right. “If right doesn’t matter,” he said, “we’re lost. If truth doesn’t matter, we’re lost.”

Lots of people agree.

Last week, Pew reported 63 percent of Americans — including 32 percent of Republicans — agree that Trump has “probably” or “definitely” engaged in illegal activities.

Polls released last week also show big majorities of Americans want the Senate to allow new evidence and witnesses. The American people want a fair trial.

But then there’s this:

Former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenObama, Clinton reflect on Mondale's legacy Biden, Harris commend Mondale in paving the way for female VP Mondale in last message to staff: 'Joe in the White House certainly helps' MORE, campaigning in Iowa recently, said he is frequently asked, “Isn’t the president going to be stronger and harder to beat if he survives this?”

And the answer is “Yes, probably,” according to the man leading national polls for the Democratic presidential nomination.

Biden is right. Trump will use even a slim, party-line acquittal in the Senate to portray himself as the victim of a “hoax.”

That is one of Trump’s signature moves. It will be a repeat of his claim that Russian interference in the 2016 election was a “made-up story” — a claim that won PolitiFact’s 2017 “Lie of the Year.”

We saw the same move from Trump when he falsely claimed that Special Counsel Robert Mueller Robert (Bob) MuellerWhy a special counsel is guaranteed if Biden chooses Yates, Cuomo or Jones as AG Barr taps attorney investigating Russia probe origins as special counsel CNN's Toobin warns McCabe is in 'perilous condition' with emboldened Trump MORE’s investigation exonerated him. That lie is now repeated endlessly in right-wing echo chambers, despite the fact that Mueller explicitly told Congress he did not exonerate Trump.

So, Trump is certain to stick with what works with his base. He will use any acquittal to claim his call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was “perfect,” and then stir up right-wing grievance, pull in more donations and excite higher turn-out for his reelection campaign.

“From the campaign side, our numbers have gone up [since impeachment],” Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale Brad ParscaleAides tried to get Trump to stop attacking McCain in hopes of clinching Arizona: report MORE told Fox News last week. ""It's going to create lots of fundraising — we have over $200 million in the bank between our committees — our numbers have gone up, and independents see this farce, and this hoax.”

Since no president has been impeached and then sought reelection, it is not clear how the politics of impeachment will shake out in November.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiWhite House readies for Chauvin verdict House GOP's McClain responds to Pelosi calling her 'that woman' GOP struggles to rein in nativism MORE (D-Calif.) was reluctant to begin impeachment until public support for such a move began to crescendo last year in the wake of the revelation of Trump’s call with Zelensky.

Those numbers have not gone away.

A CNN/SSRS poll out last week found that a majority of Americans — 51 percent — want the Senate to remove Trump from office.

The RealClearPolitics polling average on Friday showed a 47 percent tie for or against removal.

As data website FiveThirtyEight noted earlier this month, Trump is the most unpopular president to run for reelection since Gerald Ford. His job approval rating, which has mostly lagged in the low-to-mid 40s, has never been higher than the public’s disapproval of his work.

On the plus side for Trump, impeachment has not prompted a big decline in support.

ADVERTISEMENT

Also, his supporters are giving him money.

His presidential campaign’s most recent quarterly filings showed it banked $46 million in the last three months of 2019, beginning 2020 with $103 million cash on hand.

Democrats are raising money, too. But with no candidate, Democratic donor dollars have been dispersed among the presidential candidates.

As ABC News reported last week, “The Democratic presidential field and the Democratic National Committee together raked in a total of about $580 million in 2019, surpassing President Donald Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE and the Republican National Committee's combined total of about $463 million by more than $100 million, according to a DNC spokesperson.”

And the political winds blowing through Congress don’t look good for Trump.

Earlier this month, longtime Tennessee Republican Rep. Phil Roe David (Phil) Phillip RoeHouse Republicans who didn't sign onto the Texas lawsuit Illinois Republican elected to serve as next ranking member of House Veterans' Affairs Committee Here are the 17 GOP women newly elected to the House this year MORE became the 26th House Republican to announce his retirement. The wave of retirements shows that GOP lawmakers fear losing if their name appears on the ballot below Trump in November.

I appreciate the Speaker’s enthusiasm for holding Trump accountable. But lots of tough politics are ahead.

After Schiff’s brilliant call for the Senate to do what is right, it is key for Democrats to make sure that powerful message reaches educated suburban voters and especially people who voted twice for President Obama but in 2016 shifted to Trump.

History’s judgment is one thing — the judgment of voters in the general election ten months from now is another matter entirely.

145,Williams,Juan,foxnews,"Editor’s note: The following column originally appeared in The Hill newspaper and on TheHill.com website.

Let me open a personal wound.

When I was four years old, my mother took me, my brother and sister out of Panama. My parents wanted to escape poverty and open the doors to education and opportunity for their children.

Those doors shut in Panama thanks to a Castro-like populist dictator named Arnulfo Arias. He jailed, tortured and oppressed anyone who did not obey his regime.

He discriminated against dark-skinned people, blacks, Asians and native people – many of whom, like my grandfather, died building the Panama Canal. The repression extended to confiscating property and even trying to take away Panamanian citizenship from people like my father, who had come from Jamaica.

America’s left-wing academics and Hollywood celebrities have long romanticized Latin American strongmen as righteous revolutionaries, opposed to mid-20th century American military and business dominance of the region.

But to people living in those nations, the reality is that the revolutionaries became cruel, oppressive dictators in the case of Arias, the late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and most of all, Fidel Castro.

Given my scars, President Obama’s trip to Cuba later this month leaves a bitter taste in my mouth.

To me, it is painful to see the president of a nation based on individual liberty and protection of rights under law have to keep silent about the thousands of people who have suffered oppression at the hands of the Castro regime.

It is not that I don’t understand what the president is trying to do by restoring full U.S. diplomatic relations with Cuba after a half century of isolation.

I get it that sanctions, embargoes, even attempted invasion have not improved human rights in Cuba. Obama’s premise is that an infusion of Americans, with ideas and money, will lead the Cuban people to demand a more open and free society. He can point to the history of President Nixon’s successful outreach to China as a model for creating a new political dynamic with old enemies.

The idea is like a long-term investment. But the reality of the moment is that the president has normalized relations without obtaining a schedule for resumption of democratic freedoms, human rights and property rights for the Cuban people.

The release of 53 political prisoners by Cuba last January looks like window dressing to international human rights watchdogs who describe the reality of progress on Cuban human rights as a myth.

The Wall Street Journal noted in a recent editorial that since Obama’s change in policy, “the number of individuals jailed arbitrarily has gone up. This past January, according to the Madrid-based Cuban Observatory on Human Rights, some 1,474 individuals were jailed at the regime’s whim, more than 500 of them women.”

“The Cuban government continues to repress dissent and discourage public criticism,” according to the website of U.S.-based Human Rights Watch.

“It now relies less on long-term prison sentences to punish its critics, but short-term arbitrary arrests of human rights defenders, independent journalists, and others have increased dramatically in recent years. Other repressive tactics employed by the government include beatings, public acts of shaming, and the termination of employment.”

Yet another respected observer of human and political rights, Amnesty International, comes to a similar conclusion on its website:

“Despite increasingly open diplomatic relations, severe restrictions on freedoms of expression, association and movement continued. Thousands of cases of harassment of government critics and arbitrary arrests and detentions were reported.”

Even with those disturbing assessments of the Cuban human rights record, the American people support Obama’s diplomatic approach. A Pew poll from last summer found that 73 percent of Americans favor the Obama policy of normalizing relations with Cuba. And 72 percent favor lifting the five-decades-old trade embargo.

The Pew poll also found that a whopping 83 percent of Democrats favor normalization and 82 percent back lifting the embargo. Even a majority of Republicans – 56 percent – stand with Obama on reopening relations and 59 percent want the embargo lifted.

In Miami, just 90 miles from Cuba and home to so many who fled the Castro regime, young people of Cuban heritage are increasingly vocal in their support for new U.S. policies allowing closer ties between Cuba and the U.S.

The same is true among the Cuban people. In April 2015, a poll by Univision and The Washington Post found Cubans unhappy with their political structure and overwhelmingly in support of stronger ties with the U.S.

But for all the promises, political rights remain absent.

Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), a man of Cuban heritage, argues that the Castro regime has won “access to millions if not billions of dollars in resources they didn’t have access to before this opening” without significant retreat from hardline communist policies.

Donald Trump, the front-runner for the GOP presidential nomination, also agrees it is time for a new American policy in dealing with Cuba, but in tune with Rubio he concludes, “We should have made a better deal.”

The president will take in an exhibition baseball game between the Tampa Bay Devil Rays and the Cuban national team during his visit to Cuba.

It will be fun. But to my mind, knowing what my father went through in Panama, it is hard to match fun and games with the reality of ongoing repression in Cuba.

But first, what will it take to get to four?

That’s the number of Republican senators who would need to join with the Democrats to get witnesses and documents introduced at Trump’s impeachment trial.

Four Republican votes is a low bar to avoid a sham trial. But Trump has defined membership in the GOP as a matter of loyalty to him above all.

At the moment, that means a Republican has to be blind to all evidence that Trump broke the law.

The Government Accountability Office confirmed that Trump did break the law when he used U.S. foreign aid to try to pressure Ukraine’s new president into announcing an investigation into a potential Trump political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenObama, Clinton reflect on Mondale's legacy Biden, Harris commend Mondale in paving the way for female VP Mondale in last message to staff: 'Joe in the White House certainly helps' MORE.

But Trump continues to say his call with the Ukrainian president was “perfect,” and claims that impeachment is a “hoax.”

So what will it take for Senate Republicans to have the scales fall from their eyes? What will it take for them to consider that the president deserves impeachment and removal?

Let’s begin with the voters.

Last week a majority of voters, 51 percent, said they approve of the House impeaching Trump, according to a Quinnipiac University poll. As of Saturday, the RealClearPolitics average of polls had 46.9 percent support for the Senate removing Trump from office.

Four Republican senators already seem concerned that they will be seen as allowing a sham trial for Trump: Sens. Mitt Romney Willard (Mitt) Mitt RomneyAdvocacy groups pushing Biden to cancel student debt for disabled 15 Senate Republicans pledge to oppose lifting earmark ban The Hill's 12:30 Report - Presented by Facebook - All US adults now eligible for COVID vaccines MORE (Utah), Lisa Murkowski Lisa Ann MurkowskiTrump: GOP candidates need to embrace 'make America great' agenda if they want to win Republicans who backed Trump impeachment see fundraising boost Moderates' 0B infrastructure bill is a tough sell with Democrats MORE (Alaska), Susan Collins Susan Margaret CollinsSenate aims to pass anti-Asian hate crimes bill this week This week: Democrats move on DC statehood Trump looms over Senate's anti-Asian hate crimes battle MORE (Maine) and Lamar Alexander Lamar AlexanderSenate GOP faces retirement brain drain The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by the National Shooting Sports Foundation - CDC news on gatherings a step toward normality Blunt's retirement deals blow to McConnell inner circle MORE (Tenn.).

A Morning Consult/Politico poll taken this month found that 57 percent of registered voters — 71 percent of Democrats, 56 percent of independents and 40 percent of Republicans — say the GOP-controlled Senate should allow witnesses to testify at the impeachment trial.

Murkowski told an Alaska TV station last month she was “disturbed” by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong 15 Senate Republicans pledge to oppose lifting earmark ban It's not 'woketivism,' it's good business MORE’s (R-Ky.) pledge to coordinate the Senate impeachment trial with the president’s lawyers.

“For me to prejudge and say ‘There's nothing there,’ or on the other hand, ‘He should be impeached yesterday,’ that's wrong, in my view, that's wrong,” she added.

So, let’s count the four senators who are open to witnesses as perhaps also being open to Trump’s removal, if the testimony is damaging.

Then there are Republicans trying to win reelection in states where Trump is not popular.

Maine’s Collins fits into that category as does Sen. Cory Gardner Cory GardnerBiden administration reverses Trump changes it says 'undermined' conservation program Gardner to lead new GOP super PAC ahead of midterms OVERNIGHT ENERGY: Court rules against fast-track of Trump EPA's 'secret science' rule | Bureau of Land Management exodus: Agency lost 87 percent of staff in Trump HQ relocation | GM commits to electric light duty fleet by 2035 MORE (R-Colo.).

In addition to those five Republicans, there are three GOP senators running in swing states where they have to worry about being labeled as Trump acolytes if an anti-Trump backlash stirs up a big turnout of Democrats in November.

Those three are Sens. Joni Ernst Joni Kay Ernst15 Senate Republicans pledge to oppose lifting earmark ban Child care advocates seek to lock down billion in new federal funding GOP senator: Raising corporate taxes is a 'non-starter' MORE (Iowa), Martha McSally Martha Elizabeth McSallyArizona state senator announces bid for Kirkpatrick's seat Democratic Arizona Rep.

Now add three more Republican senators who are about to retire. They are less vulnerable to intimidation by Trump since they are leaving the political stage.

Alexander — whom I’ve already counted — leads this group, which also includes Sens. Richard Burr Richard Mauze BurrA proposal to tackle congressional inside trading: Invest in the US Former Gov.

That makes 11 possible votes to convict, taking us more than halfway to the 20 GOP votes necessary to remove Trump.

Now there is another element to consider — the political grudge.

There are way more than nine GOP senators who have been insulted, berated, demeaned and threatened by Trump since he ran for president.

Here’s a good example: Sen. Rand Paul Randal (Rand) Howard Paul15 Senate Republicans pledge to oppose lifting earmark ban The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Tax March - CDC in limbo on J&J vax verdict; Rep. Brady retiring Anti-Asian hate crimes bill overcomes first Senate hurdle MORE (R-Ky.), the loudest advocate for a restrained U.S. foreign policy and a recent critic of Trump’s action against Iran.

Trump once tweeted: “Truly weird Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky reminds me of a spoiled brat without a properly functioning brain.”

Then there’s Sen. Ted Cruz Rafael (Ted) Edward Cruz15 Senate Republicans pledge to oppose lifting earmark ban 'Real Housewives of the GOP' — Wannabe reality show narcissists commandeer the party Is the antidote to bad speech more speech or more regulation? MORE (R-Texas).

Trump famously suggested Cruz’s father was involved in the assassination of President Kennedy. He also insulted the senator’s wife and threatened to “spill the beans” about her.

By the way, there is no love lost between Trump and Murkowski.

After the Alaskan voted against the GOP’s ObamaCare repeal bill, Trump tweeted that she “really let the Republicans, and our country, down yesterday. Too bad.”

I’m reminded of a Wall Street Journal piece from last year about Trump defenders who ended up being damaged by covering up for his wrongdoing — men such as National Enquirer publisher David Pecker and lawyer Michael Cohen Michael Dean CohenTrump Organization adds veteran criminal defense attorney Manhattan DA investigating Trump says he won't seek reelection John Dean: 'Only a matter of how many days' until Trump is indicted MORE.

“They pledged fealty to Mr. Trump and dedicated themselves to shielding him,” the Journal wrote. “For a while, they became wealthier and more powerful through their association with him. But Mr. Trump ultimately offered little back in protection or respect.”

The 20 votes may be there.

148,Williams,Juan,thehill,"I’ve seen this movie before — and so have you.

A Republican administration makes vague claims of an “imminent threat” from a Middle Eastern country to justify the use of military force.

Seventeen years ago, any American who questioned the reliability of U.S. intelligence in the run-up to the Iraq War was trashed as unpatriotic.

Now President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE is selling tickets to Part Two of the same cynical story by hiding behind the flag without explaining why he risked all-out war to kill an Iranian general.

But wait — this is actually worse than starting a war in Iraq and later finding out there were no weapons of mass destruction.

Iranian General Qassem Soleimani was a murderous man, but this time there has been nothing like the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, on the United States.

And Trump does not have the credibility of then-President George W. Bush.

According to The Washington Post’s fact checker, President Trump is culpable for more than 15,413 lies or misleading statements.

A man undeserving of trust is asking the American people to believe the intelligence from the same agencies that he spent the last four years denigrating as the “Deep State” — scheming bureaucrats conspiring to undermine him.

Keep in mind that Trump campaigned for office as an opponent of the Iraq War. He promised to get the U.S. out of never-ending military conflict in the Middle East.

Yet, somehow, the same Trump supporters who cheered his verbal attacks on the CIA and FBI are now giving glassy-eyed nods of approval as Trump claims there was solid information about an imminent attack on Americans.

One constant in both the original movie and this sequel is the lack of heart on Capitol Hill.

Congress finds itself in the audience, watching the same movie over and over because it is too cowardly to assert itself as the branch of government with the sole constitutional responsibility to declare war.

Congress has not declared war since the Second World War. President Bush got an Authorization for the Use of Military Force from Congress after 9/11 — but not a declaration of war.

This sheepish behavior goes across party lines.

House and Senate members of all stripes are afraid that if Congress declares war then the voters will hold them responsible if the war goes badly.

They’d also be responsible if — as is the current case in Afghanistan — the war goes on and on and on for almost 19 years.

Meanwhile, Trump is citing Congress’s 19-year-old authorization for the use of military force after 9/11 to justify killing Soleimani. Last week, Vice President Pence even tried to link the general to 9/11 in a desperate effort to shut up congressional critics.

As they say in the entertainment business, that claim ‘jumped the shark.’ It is so crazy that it is hard for anyone to believe it.

Last week, for the first time in modern congressional history, the House took the risk of passing a war powers resolution calling for Trump to end military conflict with Iran unless there is clear evidence of “an imminent armed attack.”

But Gaetz was one of the few Republicans to take a stand.

Instead, most Republicans nodded along while lip-synching the administration’s talking point that by asking for information, Congress is giving America’s enemies reason to question “America’s resolve and makes war more, not less, likely,” to quote Rep.

Lee said all he hears from the administration is that Congress needs to “be good little boys and girls and not debate this in public.”

Paul added that the killing has “taken diplomacy off the table” and praised the previous administration’s nuclear deal with Iran — the one that Trump gleefully scrapped in his first year.

151,Williams,Juan,thehill,"A Republican friend recently asked me what I remember about President Clinton’s impeachment. How do I compare it to the impeachment of President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE?

I laughed. He insisted I tell him.

But before saying anything I warned him not to get partisan and angry.

ADVERTISEMENT

Then I told him the truth: My strongest memory of those 1998 hearings is the hypocrisy of the Republican men in Congress.

It turned out that Newt Gingrich Newton (Newt) Leroy GingrichMORE (R-Ga.), who as Speaker led the charge to impeach Clinton for lying about sex with a White House intern, was having an extramarital affair with a congressional staffer.

It also was revealed at that time that Gingrich cheated on and divorced his second wife while she was being treated for multiple sclerosis.

Gingrich also cheated on his first wife — with the woman who became his second wife — while she was being treated for cancer.

And there was more hypocrisy.

Then-Rep. Bob Livingston (La.), the Republican chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, was poised to take over as Speaker after Gingrich resigned. But he also had a sex scandal. He quit Congress after it was revealed he had had extramarital affairs, even though he was railing against Clinton’s infidelity.

Then-Rep. Henry Hyde (Ill.), the Republican chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, who served as the chief prosecutor in Clinton’s impeachment trial, was also exposed for having had an extramarital affair while condemning Clinton’s behavior.

Hyde famously described his affair as a “youthful indiscretion.” Hyde was 41 years old at the time of the affair.

Now my friend looked upset. He tried to end the conversation by saying Democrats who defended Clinton now look like hypocrites for going after Trump.

But I told him the GOP hypocrisy extends from Clinton’s impeachment to Trump’s impeachment.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham Lindsey Olin Graham'Real Housewives of the GOP' — Wannabe reality show narcissists commandeer the party Graham: 'I could not disagree more' with Trump support of troop withdrawal Wall Street spent .9B on campaigns, lobbying in 2020 election: study MORE (R-S.C.) is now one of Trump’s loudest defenders.

But here is Graham, as one of the GOP’s impeachment managers in 1998, talking about what it takes to remove the president from office:

“You don’t even have to be convicted of a crime to lose your job [as president] in this constitutional republic if this body determines that your conduct as a public official is clearly out of bounds in your role,” Graham said. “Because impeachment is not about punishment. Impeachment is about cleansing the office. Impeachment is about restoring honor and integrity to the office.”

With Trump in the White House, Graham is singing a different tune.

""I think what's best for the country is to get this thing over with… So, I don't need any witnesses,” he told CBS’s “Face the Nation” earlier this month. “I am ready to vote on the underlying articles. I don't really need to hear a lot of witnesses.""

And the hypocrisy does not stop there.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong 15 Senate Republicans pledge to oppose lifting earmark ban It's not 'woketivism,' it's good business MORE (R-Ky.) is also trying to prevent witnesses who were blocked by Trump from testifying before the House from testifying in the Senate trial.

Here is McConnell speaking when the Clinton impeachment reached the Senate:

""There have been 15 impeachments [of federal officials] in the history of the country. Two of them were cut short by resignations. In the other 13 impeachments, there were witnesses,"" he told CNN's Larry King in January 1999. ""It's not unusual to have a witness…in an impeachment trial.”

And one more hypocritical touch.

McConnell recently accused Pelosi of breaking precedent by not immediately sending the articles of impeachment to the Senate after the House voted to impeach.

But how can McConnell complain about breaking with precedent when, during President Obama’s time in office, he broke long Senate precedent by refusing to hold confirmation hearings for a Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland Merrick GarlandGarland warns domestic terrorism 'still with us' on anniversary of Oklahoma City bombing Mazie Hirono: Asian American, Pacific Islander community 'feels under siege' amid rise in hate crimes ABC lands first one-on-one TV interview with Garland since confirmation MORE?

Along with this rich hypocrisy is a healthy dose of revisionist history about the Clinton impeachment.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy Kevin McCarthyWhite House readies for Chauvin verdict McCarthy to introduce resolution to censure Waters House GOP's McClain responds to Pelosi calling her 'that woman' MORE (R-Calif.) tweeted on the eve of the impeachment vote: “For the Democrats sitting in districts that voted to send President Trump to the White House — if you vote to impeach tomorrow, you will be defying the vote of your own constituents.”

This drew a sharp rebuke from veteran political reporter Ron Brownstein, who corrected McCarthy on Twitter:

“In 1998 there were 91 House Republicans in districts that voted for Clinton in 1996. Almost all of them voted to ""defy the votes of [their] constituents"" by impeaching him.

“Over the next two elections (‘98 & 2000) just 7 of those 91 Clinton district Republicans were defeated,” Brownstein added.

As I have noted on this page before, public support for the Republican House majority’s effort to impeach Clinton never went above 29 percent.

That is quite different from the 50 percent of Americans who support Trump’s impeachment and removal from office, according to a recent Fox poll. An even higher number, 54 percent, supports his impeachment but not his removal from office.

After 40 years of covering Washington politics, it once again feels to me that democratic norms are being tossed out by Trump and his GOP acolytes in Congress.

So, my friend, I’m sorry if I upset you. But you asked and that is what I will remember about both impeachments.

President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE loves to claim the nation is living through “the Greatest Economy in American history!”

But job growth was higher in President Obama’s second term. The growth in gross domestic product, a standard measure of economic performance, is “about the same as it was to this point in Obama’s second term,” according to The Washington Post.

ADVERTISEMENT

And this year, U.S. manufacturing has fallen into an official recession, recording two successive quarters of negative growth.

These facts produce a politically explosive possibility of blue-collar Trump voters revolting against his failed economic promises heading into the 2020 presidential election.

The president stirred up populist passions in 2016 with talk of bringing manufacturing industries, coal mines and steel mills back to life.

The heart of that pledge was his call to get rid of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), a trade agreement with Mexico and Canada that Trump called “one of the worst trade deals ever.”

Last week, the House passed a Trump-backed replacement for NAFTA, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). And the Senate, caught in Trump’s grip, is highly likely to pass the bill in January.

So, will the new deal produce a spike in manufacturing jobs or increase stagnant wages?

The U.S. International Trade Commission says the USMCA will only result in a modest 0.35 percent GDP growth and fewer than 200,000 jobs after six years.

And economists across the political spectrum predict prices will go up on cars, for example, without producing a big jump in manufacturing jobs.

I know what Republican readers are thinking — there goes another Trump critic, trying to deny the president a victory as he heads into the 2020 campaign.

Oh, really.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong 15 Senate Republicans pledge to oppose lifting earmark ban It's not 'woketivism,' it's good business MORE (R-Ky.) is not exactly happy, either.

“From my perspective, it’s not as good as I had hoped…but we’ll have to take a look at the whole package,” McConnell said last week.

So, why are McConnell and other Republicans making excuses for a bill they don’t like?

The answer is: Fear.

The GOP is backing this bill out of fear that if it doesn’t quietly go along, Trump is capable of doing a head-first dive into America First-style economic protectionism.

In other words, he is capable of killing any trade deal with Mexico and Canada. That would damage the U.S. economy — and hurt Republican prospects in the 2020 elections.

ADVERTISEMENT

Even in the face of those threats, the free traders who write conservative editorials for The Wall Street Journal can’t hide their discontent with the current political reality.

“The shame is that in many respects the new deal is worse than NAFTA, especially its bows to politically managed trade,” the Journal editorialized last week.

“The new deal…raises the cost of manufacturing, making North American products less competitive worldwide,” the editorial said, after explaining that they see themselves doing “damage control,” in the face of Trump’s protectionist instincts.

The bottom line is that the president has succeeded in muzzling conservative critics of his economic policies.

That’s why Congressional Republicans have little to say about how the president’s tax cut sent the lion’s share of its benefits to people and companies in the top income brackets — not to middle-income wage earners.

And they have only silence when it comes to the nation’s ballooning deficit as a result of the tax cut and increased spending under Trump.

Trump’s specific failure to deliver for blue-collar workers is being hidden by the GOP out of fear that it is too late to be honest with voters about Trump’s empty bluster.

If they dare challenge him on his failed economic promises, he will remind them that he is their best bet to keep a Republican in the White House.

The president’s hunger for any new trade deal with Canada and Mexico led Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiWhite House readies for Chauvin verdict House GOP's McClain responds to Pelosi calling her 'that woman' GOP struggles to rein in nativism MORE (D-Calif.) to tell her caucus last week, “We ate their lunch.” She was referring to changes made to the bill at Democrats’ behest that attracted more support from unions.

Trump is grabbing at the proposed deal so he can go out on the 2020 campaign trail and paper over his failures with the vacuous claim that he produced a better trade agreement.

Republicans in Congress have no choice but to play along.

But their private grumbling is increasingly public as the nation approaches Election Day 2020.

157,Williams,Juan,thehill,"Christmas came early this year for black supporters of President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE.

Two recent polls showed the president with support from more than 30 percent of black voters.

ADVERTISEMENT

If those polls are right, the 2020 election is over. Get ready for Trump to stay in the White House until 2025.

But I have my doubts. The polls have a high margin of error due to small sample size. And Trump’s approval rating among black Americans has been consistently measured at about 10 percent.

Even if the polls are off, they have opened a very scary question for Democrats:

Can Trump’s campaign win by counting on depressed — or in some places, suppressed — black turnout in November 2020?

Black voter turnout across the nation went down 7 percentage points in 2016 when compared to the 2012 election.

Despite about 90 percent of blacks voting for Democrat Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' Cuba readies for life without Castro Chelsea Clinton: Pics of Trump getting vaccinated would help him 'claim credit' MORE in 2016, the decline in black turnout had a major impact.

Specifically, the lower level of black turnout in Detroit, Milwaukee and Philadelphia all helped Trump to narrowly win Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania and build the electoral college advantage that took him to the White House.

As Trump said a month after defeating Clinton in 2016: “They didn’t come out to vote for Hillary. They didn’t come out. And that was a big — so thank you to the African American community.”

Russian interference might also be due some credit for the lower 2016 turnout of black voters. No “single group of Americans was targeted by [the Russian internet trolls] more than African Americans,” according to a recent Senate Intelligence Committee report.

In fact, more than 60 percent of all Russian activity on social media, such as Facebook, targeted black voters.

And now, with no black candidate among the leaders for the Democratic presidential nomination, there is a repeat of another key dynamic in the 2016 race. There will be no black candidate at the top of the ticket to inspire black people to get to the polls.

When President Obama was on the ballot in 2008 and 2012, black voters set records for turnout.

In 2016, Trump won eight percent of the black vote, a higher level of support than the two previous GOP nominees, Sen. John McCain John Sidney McCain'Real Housewives of the GOP' — Wannabe reality show narcissists commandeer the party George W.

But keep in mind, McCain and Romney ran against Obama.

In the 2020, as in 2016, there is no black or minority candidate standing tall.

Harris herself did not attract much black support — but will her charge that white voters remain fundamentally biased against non-white candidates potentially infect black voters with racial discontent and keep them away from the polls?

The other major black candidate in this cycle is Sen. Cory Booker Cory BookerBass 'hopeful' on passing police reform: 'Republicans that I am working with are operating in good faith' Progressive lawmakers press DHS chief on immigration detention Democrats battle over best path for Puerto Rico MORE (D-N.J.).

There is no sign he has gained traction with voters, white or black.

As a result, the best hope for a high black turnout in 2020 is not racial identification with any candidate, but disapproval of Trump.

In October, The Hill reported that a Hill-HarrisX poll found that “98 percent of black voters who identify as Democrat and 72 percent of those who identify as independent said they would back whoever ultimately becomes the Democratic nominee over Trump.”

But Obama remains the singular voice able to call black voters to the polls.

For strategic reasons, Obama is holding back from public support of Biden or anyone else.

He does not want to be seen as an establishment ‘kingmaker,’ anointing any candidate.

But the lack of credible, prominent black Democratic voices on the national stage is flashing a danger sign in the face of Trump’s desire for a depressed turnout in black precincts.

For that, Obama needs to get off the sidelines as early as possible next year and dedicate himself to activating the black vote. He has a moral obligation to stop Trump, the most racially inflammatory president in living memory, from winning a second term.

Obama has one more election to win for the Democrats.

On that day, she pointedly reminded him that a majority of House Republicans joined her Democratic caucus in voting to condemn him for pulling troops out of Syria.

The picture was so powerful that the White House released it and in act of pure spin described it as proof of Pelosi having an “unhinged meltdown.”

But once the picture was out, Pelosi’s fans produced memes, hashtags (#PelosiOwnsTrump) and even coffee mugs with the iconic picture to celebrate her for showing strength in the face of Trump’s name-calling and bullying.

In the meeting, Trump called her either a “third grade” or “third rate” politician.

She responded by telling him she wished he had some political skill. She not only had the heart to stand up to him but she walked out.

In that moment, Pelosi distinguished herself as one politician Trump has failed to intimidate.

For the last nine years, this year-end-tradition column has spotlighted the politician — Republican or Democrat, in the Senate or House — who came out the biggest winner.

The problem with giving the award to Pelosi is that she deserves recognition for more than any single year of political mastery.

As the first woman to serve as Speaker, the 79-year-old mother of five has long ago earned the status of a living legend. She is the most powerful Democrat in Washington.

As Speaker, she has never lost a House vote she brought to the floor.

And now she is making more history as the third Speaker to preside over the impeachment of an American president.

She has achieved two critical goals while guiding her party through treacherous political waters.

First, she has protected Democrats whose districts were carried by Trump in 2016. Until they told her they were on board with the political risk of an impeachment inquiry, Pelosi refused to proceed.

Second, she has provided the map for House Democrats to tell the public that impeachment is bigger than another partisan battle.

“The president’s actions have seriously violated the Constitution,” she said in a speech announcing plans to proceed with an impeachment vote. “Our democracy is what is at stake. The president leaves us no choice.”

So far, her approach has enjoyed unprecedented success with the public.

By October, several polls found a plurality of Americans agreed that Trump should be impeached. That high level of support has stayed in place despite Trump’s claims of a “coup” and an impeachment “hoax.”

When President Clinton was impeached, the support for that effort by a Republican House majority never went above 29 percent.

Pelosi built a far higher level of support for Trump’s impeachment with care.

And last week, after public testimony and Trump’s refusal to have his aides to testify, Pelosi gave the green light for a vote on impeachment.

This has been a masterclass in politics for the businessman in the White House.

As impeachment gained steam this year, Trump said Pelosi’s Democratic majority in the House was being sidetracked and damned them as a “Do Nothing” Congress.

But as The Washington Post noted last week: “The House has actually passed more legislation this year than the Senate” including bills to increase background checks before gun purchases and increase protection against violence against women.

At every turn, Pelosi has protected her House majority. She now has Republicans retiring or quitting House seats at a rapid rate, out of frustration that Democrats are likely to hold onto their majority in the 2020 election.

Yet, for all her prior legislative triumphs — the 2009 economic stimulus and the 2010 Affordable Care Act among them — Pelosi is writing the first line of her historical legacy as I write this column: Her stamp of approval makes it all but certain that the House will impeach Trump.

Even if the politics of impeachment blow up in the Democrats’ face, there is virtually no chance that her Speakership will be in jeopardy. There is no one in the House Democratic caucus with enough gravitas to seriously challenge her.

Pelosi will have the Speakership for as long as she wants. She is the author of her own political destiny.

By finally standing up to Trump and expertly navigating the process that will most likely result in his impeachment, Pelosi wins the prize for Politician of the Year.

Name any of President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE’s cruel immigration policies — from separating families to caging children to banning Muslims — and Miller is in the lead, crafting and implementing them.

Critics have long alleged that hatred of non-whites drove Miller to put in place the Trump administration’s shameful immigration policies.

Now recently leaked emails fuel the suspicion that he harbors a long-held hatred of immigrants, especially when they are not white.

He pushed that nastiness in emails to a reporter at the alt-right website Breitbart News.

So, this is not about “identity politics.” It can’t be quickly dismissed by the far-right as the excesses of “snowflakes,” who can’t handle policy arguments without playing the race card.

And this is not about “cancel culture,” the over-reaction to a slip of the tongue, calling out offensive language by a comedian or a commentator.

In Miller’s case, what was once just suspect — or at most thought to be implicit — is now explicit.

That hard-edged reality can lead to only one conclusion — Miller must be fired.

That means the Miller case is now about you.

Will you, will we, across the political divide, stand as one against racial hate in politics?

Miller’s awful beliefs are particularly alarming right now because an increasingly racially diverse nation with a rising number of immigrants is seeing its president and the Republican Party becoming the angry face of one race – whites.

Republican leaders on Capitol Hill know this is a problem.

But the Trump White House has taken no action against Miller.

“George H.W. Bush, George Bush, Ronald Reagan never would have tolerated any of this,” Mike Murphy, the GOP political adviser told NPR. Murphy worked for two presidential candidates, John McCain John Sidney McCain'Real Housewives of the GOP' — Wannabe reality show narcissists commandeer the party George W. Bush: 'It's a problem that Americans are so polarized' they can't imagine him being friends with Michelle Obama Congress brings back corrupt, costly, and inequitably earmarks MORE and Mitt Romney Willard (Mitt) Mitt RomneyAdvocacy groups pushing Biden to cancel student debt for disabled 15 Senate Republicans pledge to oppose lifting earmark ban The Hill's 12:30 Report - Presented by Facebook - All US adults now eligible for COVID vaccines MORE.

Vanita Gupta, who runs the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, similarly told NPR, “I fear that the line of what is normal is moving… I don’t think there’s any way to…not be profoundly disturbed about what we are allowing at the highest level of government today.”

The Newark Star Ledger called for Trump to fire Miller by noting that there is “meticulously” documented evidence – 900 emails – that show “Miller shared the racist writings of white nationalists and urged others to share them.”

If Trump retains Miller, he will have removed the last shreds of benefit of the doubt: He is either himself a racist or someone who gives aid and comfort to avowed racists.

Race relations are at an all-time nadir under President Trump.

An August WSJ/NBC News poll found that 56 percent of Americans say race relations have gotten worse under Trump, 33 percent say they have stayed the same and 10 percent say they have gotten better.

And polling on Trump’s anti-immigrant policies and rhetoric – all tied to Miller – show outright public rejection. After three years of Trump trying to whip up anger at immigrants there is little public demand for these policies.

Even a poll of only white Americans done by Reuters/Ipos in July found whites were 19 percentage points more in support of a path to citizenship for the undocumented or illegal immigrants than they were in 2015.

Among all Americans, a July NPR/PBS Newshour/Marist poll found 64 percent in support of creating “a pathway to citizenship for immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally.”

In July, a CNN poll found “just 15 percent overall and only 32 percent of Republicans say the nation should prioritize deporting all people living in the U.S. illegally over developing a plan” to allow some illegal immigrants to gain legal status.”

And a Fox News poll done in June found “by a 50-24 percent margin, Americans think Trump’s enforcement of immigration laws has ‘gone too far,’ instead of ‘not far enough.’""

So, Trump’s anti-immigrant policies make no sense as politics. They only make sense as evidence of Miller’s influence on Trump.

In a letter to the president, 107 Democrats in the House called for Miller to be fired, writing “a documented white nationalist has no place in any presidential administration, and especially not in such an influential position.”

According to a tally by the Huffington Post, more than 20 senators — including Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer Chuck Schumer'Real Housewives of the GOP' — Wannabe reality show narcissists commandeer the party 'Building Back Better' requires a new approach to US science and technology Pew poll: 50 percent approve of Democrats in Congress MORE (D-N.Y.) and presidential candidates Sens.

More than 50 civil rights organizations, including the Anti-Defamation League and the NAACP wrote: “Stephen Miller’s racist, deadly agenda is contributing to this violence and must be stopped.”

The only question now is: Where are Republican voices demanding Miller’s firing?

And what about Fiona Hill?

Once the top Russia expert at the Trump White House, she has had to deal with death threats, apparently from Trump’s backers, because she responded to a congressional subpoena to appear at impeachment hearings.

Hill also testified that she was libeled in conservative media as “a mole for George Soros,” via comments by recently convicted Trump ally Roger Stone Roger Jason StoneThere was Trump-Russia collusion — and Trump pardoned the colluder On The Money: Moderates' 0B infrastructure bill is a tough sell with Democrats | Justice Dept. sues Trump ally Roger Stone for unpaid taxes Justice Dept. sues Trump ally Roger Stone for unpaid taxes MORE among others.

“This is the longest-running anti-Semitic trope that we have in history,” Hill said, as she explained to Congress that the attacks against Soros amount to “the new Protocols of the Elders of Zion,” a fake from more than a century ago that portrayed Jews as seeking to dominate world affairs.

Soros is a constant target of attacks from far-right Trump supporters. Anti-Semitic violence in general has been on the rise too.

Cesar Sayoc, a Trump supporter, sent bombs to Soros among others. Robert Bowers is charged with killing 11 at a Pittsburgh synagogue after blaming a Jewish charity for offering aid to Central American immigrants.

Then there are smears coming directly from the Trump White House.

A White House aide sent talking points to Republicans in Congress lambasting both Vindman and Sondland.

“Vindman has major credibility issues,” said one email from a White House aide, Julia Hahn. She undercut Vindman, who still works at the White House, as a man guilty of “poor judgment, leaking and going around normal procedures.”

Vindman was not the only target. The Washington Post reported that Trump’s White House sent “14 different sections of talking points to congressional Republicans, coming in at more than 3,300 words.”

The president himself set the tone for these broadsides.

Trump dismissed testimony from Jennifer Williams, who advised Vice President Pence on Russia, as coming from one of the “Never Trumpers.”

Williams “should meet with the other Never Trumpers, who I don’t know & mostly never even heard of, & work out a better presidential attack!""

“America hired [Trump] to fire people like the first three witnesses we’ve seen,” he wrote, in a direct attack on Yovanovitch as well as George Kent, a State Department official and the acting ambassador to Ukraine, William Taylor.

The White House attacks inspired Trump supporters to do the same.

Talk show host Rush Limbaugh created another target for personal attacks by going on radio to name a person he believes to be the whistleblower who formally complained about the July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelensky.

Again, Trump supporters act without any concern for the very real threats to anyone who dares to speak out about the president. The whistleblower’s complaint has been confirmed as “credible” and a matter of “urgent concern,” by the inspector general of the intelligence community, a Trump appointee.

Another attack came from Emerald Robinson, a correspondent for the Trump-supporting outlet One America News Network. She tweeted an attack on Hill and Vindman for being immigrants.

“I’m wondering,” Robinson tweeted, “are any Americans going to testify against Trump?”

After widespread criticism, Robinson deleted the tweet.

Hill responded to the attacks by saying she testified out of a “moral obligation.”

“We came here as fact witnesses,” Hill explained. “I know this has put a huge cloud over this presidency…that’s why, as a non-partisan person, an expert on Russia, I wanted to try to see if I could help.”

In the face of clear evidence of Trump’s abuse of power, his defenders are playing to the same “audience of one” — trying to rush into a closed hearing room to disrupt testimony and now smearing loyal Americans with records of honorable public service.

165,Williams,Juan,thehill,"Why is President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE so nervous about the 2020 race?

He has a record amount of campaign cash. Russian bots are still working for him. And he still has the backing of more than 80 percent of his party.

So, how do I know he’s so nervous?

As Trump loves to say: Read the transcript.

At the heart of the phone call that has led to impeachment hearings is Trump going out on a shaky limb to ask Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for a “favor.”

That “favor” included a request for Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenObama, Clinton reflect on Mondale's legacy Biden, Harris commend Mondale in paving the way for female VP Mondale in last message to staff: 'Joe in the White House certainly helps' MORE and Biden’s son, Hunter.

The only reason for Trump to risk asking a foreign leader for help getting political dirt on an opponent is that he feared that rival’s power. And that November 2020 powerhouse in Trump’s mind is Biden.

Recall that in June, Trump’s anxiety was on display when he insisted his campaign fire some its pollsters after internal polls showed him losing in Michigan and Wisconsin to Biden.

Trump’s shaky nerves went public again in July when a Fox News poll showed him losing to Biden — by a lot. Trump went ballistic and attacked Fox.

The president still has every reason to be nervous about a possible match-up with Biden because polls continue to show the Democrat beating him badly.

If Biden, a well-liked moderate, is the nominee the election becomes a referendum on Trump. With an approval rating hovering in the mid-to-low 40s, that is not good news for the president.

Take a look at the latest Washington Post/ABC News poll. It has Biden leading Trump by 17 percentage points.

And a New York Times/Siena College poll has Biden beating Trump in four of the six swing states that are key to control of the Electoral College — Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Florida, and Arizona. That poll had Biden and Trump tied in Michigan.

Why is Biden a special foe for Trump?

He has the backing of black voters and is well-liked by white, working-class voters.

Other Democrats do well against Trump but none of them shows Biden’s power at the polls against Trump. If Sen. Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth WarrenWorld passes 3 million coronavirus deaths Poll: 56 percent say wealth tax is part of solution to inequality Democratic senators call on Biden to support waiving vaccine patents MORE (D-Mass.) or Sen.

Still, Warren has a 7.3 percentage point lead over Trump nationally in the Real Clear Politics average of polls. Sanders has a 7.9 percentage point lead over the incumbent.

But in the New York Times survey of swing states, no Democrat can match Biden’s performance against Trump.

Sanders is ahead of Trump in three of the six states but loses in three others. Warren wins in only one, loses to Trump in three and is even in two.

And among independent voters, who gave Trump a 46-42 percent win in 2016, Biden is now ahead of Trump by 17 percentage points, according to the Post/ABC poll.

These polls explain why Trump decided it was worth the risk to resort to treachery to sink Biden.

If Zelensky acceded to Trump’s requests — we have since learnt there were plans for the Ukrainian president to give a CNN interview to this effect — then Trump would have a 2020 version of Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' Cuba readies for life without Castro Chelsea Clinton: Pics of Trump getting vaccinated would help him 'claim credit' MORE’s emails and he could revise chants of “Lock Her Up,” into chants of “Lock Him Up.”

By using Zelensky as a pawn, Trump could force baseless talk of corruption by Biden onto the front pages of American newspapers, television and Facebook. If Zelensky announced an investigation the news outlets would report it as news.

ADVERTISEMENT

Bill Taylor, the acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, has testified that he was told that Trump’s political strategy was to put Zelensky “in a public box” by forcing him to announce a probe into Biden that would compel Ukrainian prosecutors to take action.

Note there is no evidence that Biden and his son did anything wrong in Ukraine.

So, with that July phone call, Trump made the risky gamble that he could make Zelensky do his dirty work by dangling U.S. military assistance as the carrot to get Zelensky to smear Biden.

In fact, Trump placed two other bets that day.

The first side bet was that blind loyalty would prevent White House officials, National Security aides, and State Department diplomats — especially people on the call or who later learned of the call — from blowing the whistle on him.

The second side bet was that his aides could hide a transcript of the phone call in a classified server at the White House to prevent anyone else from reading it and seeing his crooked political play.

Trump continued down that high-risk road even after it went public that he was withholding the money approved by Congress to help the Ukraine fight off Russian military incursions.

But Trump’s nervousness about Biden convinced him he had to damage Biden at any cost.

If Trump knew in July that by November his party would lose big in Virginia legislative elections, lose big in Pennsylvania suburban elections, and see 20 House Republicans announce they are leaving before the 2020 election, he might have skipped the phone call.

He would have fired up Air Force One for a trip to Kiev and personally put Zelensky in front of that CNN camera.

The quip came to mind last week as South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg Pete ButtigiegBiden looks to bolster long-term research and development White House says gas tax won't be part of infrastructure bill The Hill's 12:30 Report: Biden meets with bipartisan lawmakers for infrastructure negotiations MORE (D), a gay man, surged to second place in polling on the Iowa Democratic caucuses.

Buttigieg had 17.5 percent support in the Real Clear Politics average of Iowa polls as of Sunday.

Nationally, however, Buttigieg is at 7 percent, a distant fourth place.

An even bigger point of contrast comes in South Carolina, where Buttigieg has only 4 percent of the vote and is in sixth place.

What explains the big difference in how Buttigieg is doing in the two states?

Last month, an internal Buttigieg campaign memo, based on conversations with small groups of black voters, found that “being gay was a barrier” to winning over black voters in South Carolina.

Iowa has a black population of less than four percent. South Carolina has a black population of more than 27 percent.

When the memo got into newspapers, House Majority Whip James Clyburn (D-S.C.), specifically pointed to older, black voters as being uncomfortable with an openly gay candidate.

Public displays of homosexuality are a “generational” issue, Clyburn, 79, told CNN. To his thinking, there was “no question” it is hurting Buttigieg in South Carolina’s presidential primary contest, where black voters are expected to cast around 60 percent of all ballots.

As politically incorrect as it may be, Clyburn is telling the truth. The amazing advance in gay rights in America can’t hide the reality that some are slow to embrace the change. A Pew Research Center study from earlier this year offered evidence that there are hold-outs. It found that while 62 percent of adult whites support same-sex marriage the percentage among black adults is slightly lower — 51 percent.

But Clyburn got serious blowback as younger black voices suggested Buttigieg’s campaign leaked the memo to generate sympathy for their candidate as a victim of bigoted black voters.

“Yes, homophobia is an issue in black communities, but it’s also an issue in white communities,” Keith Boykin, a co-founder of the National Black Justice Coalition, which is confronting both racism and homophobia, told The Washington Post. “There is no evidence that homophobia is any worse in black communities than in white communities.”

And Alicia Garza, a co-founder of Black Lives Matter, tweeted: “There are clear answers to why Black voters don’t back your campaign and homophobia ain’t it.”

That view also wins support from Sen. Kamala Harris Kamala HarrisBiden, Harris commend Mondale in paving the way for female VP Overnight Energy: Treasury creates hub to fight climate change through finance | Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez introduce 'Green New Deal for Public Housing' | Harris: Americans able to 'breathe easier and sleep better' under Biden MORE (D-Calif.), the only black woman running for the Democratic nomination. She said it is “nonsense” to say black Americans are more biased against gays.

“To label one community in particular as being burdened by this bias as compared to others is misinformed, it’s misdirected and it’s just simply wrong,” she told CNN.

And black columnists around the country also chastised Clyburn.

“Reducing Pete Buttigieg’s struggle to attract black support solely to black homophobia is not only erroneous, it is a disgusting, racist trope, secretly nursed and insidiously whispered by white liberals with contempt for the very black people they court and need,” wrote New York Times columnist Charles Blow, a black man who identifies as bisexual.

Boston Globe columnist Renee Graham, who also identifies as a member of the LGBT community, argued in a column that black voters are reluctant to support Buttigieg because of his policy record.

“Instead of acknowledging how Buttigieg has failed his black South Bend constituents…they will continue to insist the fault lies in the ways of black people, not the candidate himself,” Graham argued.

Buttigieg trails all three in national polls.

Meanwhile, Buttigieg has a message for black voters.

“All of us in different ways have been led to question whether we belong,” Mr. Buttigieg told a black church last month. “I also know what it is to find acceptance where you least expect it.”

Buttigieg’s campaign is also circulating an ambitious blueprint of ideas for a future Buttigieg administration to use to reduce racial inequity — specifically in the economy, in education and criminal justice. He even dubbed this “the Douglass plan,” after the abolitionist Frederick Douglass.

There is an old saying that predictions make fools of us all.

“In the last 25 years, public acceptance of gay people has changed so much that Buttigieg is on track to skip the Jackson-like struggle and go straight to Obama’s winner’s circle,” I wrote.

And, yes, I agree it is ironic that six months later I am writing that in order to win, Buttigieg will first have to prove himself to black voters.

Fifty-six percent of Americans told the Associated Press poll they would not describe Trump as “honest.”

That’s not just Democrats calling out Trump.

Almost half of Republicans can’t say that Trump is honest.

To be precise, only 53 percent of Republicans say the word ""honest"" describes Trump “very or extremely well,” according to the poll by The Associated Press–NORC.

That leaves a lot of Republicans to live with a painful reality.

They know Trump, a man they regard as less than fully honest, is likely to be at the top of the 2020 ticket for a Republican Party that advertises itself as the home of evangelicals, American tradition and family values.

And there is another poll result showing why congressional Republicans are looking for the exit.

The same poll found 61 percent of Americans think Trump has “little or no respect for the country’s democratic institutions and traditions.”

Remember, Trump is the leader of a party that loves to talk about the Founding Fathers and defending the Constitution and American traditions.

By the way, 26 percent of law-and-order loving Republicans admit in the poll that Trump does not care about the nation’s constitutional-based government.

And get this — 33 percent, a third of Republicans, said Trump does not make them “proud.”

This implosion of Republican self-image, their eroding view of themselves as guardians of American values with Trump in the White House, helps explain why so many Republicans are leaving Congress.

A month ago, The Washington Post described the number of Republicans choosing to retire as “staggering.” By their count “41 House Republicans have left national politics or announced they won’t seek reelection in the nearly three years since Trump took office.”

Longtime GOP Rep. Greg Walden Gregory (Greg) Paul WaldenLobbying world Give Republicans the climate credit they deserve Fox hires former GOP lawmaker Greg Walden as political consultant MORE (Ore.) became the 19th House Republican to announce his retirement last week.

Recently, Walden was twice targeted by Trump’s MAGA mob on conservative social media. First, he was cursed for his lack of loyalty to Trump for opposing the president’s grab of military funding to pay for a wall on the Mexican border.

Then Walden was lashed for condemning Trump’s racist tweet suggesting that four Democratic congresswomen of color “go back” where they came from, even though three of the four were born in the U.S.

In Trump’s own words, Republicans who criticize him are “human scum.”

In the Senate, where Republicans are in the majority, this battle for the soul of the party is also pushing conservatives with a conscience to the exits.

For example, Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr Richard Mauze BurrA proposal to tackle congressional inside trading: Invest in the US Former Gov.

At that time, The New York Times described Burr as facing an “extraordinary pressure campaign ... forcing [GOP] senators to choose between their loyalty to the Intelligence Committee and to the president’s family.”

That kind of political beating keeps most congressional Republicans from breaking with Trump, but it can’t stop others from leaving.

There are glimmers of courage, however, with Senate Republicans exhibiting some conscience in the last month.

A high level of congressional Republican criticism also led Trump to back down on plans to help himself financially by holding an international summit at his struggling resort in Doral, Fla.

But moments of conscience are the exception for congressional Republicans in the Trump era.

Three years into Trump, the options for Republicans who tire of his lies, his bullying and his claim to “great and unmatched wisdom” remain painfully clear — say nothing or head for the door.

This trashy, reality show version of politics is intended to make us all dizzy and distracted.

Then the Drudge Report literally put Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' Cuba readies for life without Castro Chelsea Clinton: Pics of Trump getting vaccinated would help him 'claim credit' MORE in a Halloween witch’s hat as it joined other conservative social media sites in speculating on Clinton running for president in 2020.

Steve Bannon Stephen (Steve) Kevin BannonThere was Trump-Russia collusion — and Trump pardoned the colluder MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell's new free speech site to ban certain curse words Trump denies Gaetz asked him for blanket pardon MORE, President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE’s former campaign CEO and White House chief strategist, got this far-right fantasy going in late September by predicting that Clinton would run.

His suggestion is baseless.

But mocking the prospect of another Clinton campaign holds a double delight for pro-Trump audiences.

By bashing her, they also get to disparage the current field of Democrats. Bannon specifically pointed to the party’s front-runner, former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenObama, Clinton reflect on Mondale's legacy Biden, Harris commend Mondale in paving the way for female VP Mondale in last message to staff: 'Joe in the White House certainly helps' MORE, as a weak candidate.

The reassuring message here for Trump’s fans is that the current crop of Democrats is even less likely to defeat Trump than was Clinton.

Polling shows that is false. But the president and his supporters dismiss polls even as they consistently show Biden beating Trump.

Inside the conservative bubble of fantasy politics, the game extends to generating fake social media support for fringe candidates for the Democratic nomination, including Marianne Williamson Marianne WilliamsonMarianne Williamson: Refusal to hike minimum wage is part of 'rigged economy' Rush Limbaugh dead at 70 Marianne Williamson discusses America's ""soulless ethos"" MORE, Andrew Yang Andrew YangYang expands lead in NYC mayor race: poll Evelyn Yang pens children's book on sexual abuse, reveals she was sexually assaulted as a child Yang pitches plan to revive Broadway, live performances in New York MORE and, most of all, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard Tulsi GabbardNew co-chairs named for congressional caucus for millennials Tulsi Gabbard blasts new House rules on gender neutral language as 'height of hypocrisy' A vaccine, a Burrito and more: 7 lighter, memorable moments from 2020 MORE (D-Hawaii).

Gabbard has about 1 percent support among Democrats for the party’s presidential nomination, according to the RealClearPolitics national polling average.

But Gabbard is literally referred to as ""mommy"" by far-right conspiracy theorists who champion her as a victim of the Democratic Party establishment.

At the moment, Gabbard is the star on far-right websites because Clinton correctly pointed out the Hawaii congresswoman could end up as a third-party candidate who divides the anti-Trump vote in 2020 and delivers a second term to the president.

During a podcast, Clinton contended Gabbard was being groomed “to be the third-party candidate. ... They have a bunch of sites and bots and ways of supporting her. ... She’s also a Russian asset.”

Clinton then reiterated: “Yeah, she’s a Russian asset. I mean, totally.”

Instead of responding to the real threat another third-party candidate poses to Democrats, Gabbard lashed out at Clinton as the “queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long.”

Amid all this, there was confusion over whether Clinton had meant that the people grooming Gabbard were Republicans or Russians. But the idea of Russian backing is hardly far-fetched.

In 2016, Russian trolls and bots promoted the third-party candidacy of Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate whose vote totals in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania were big enough to argue she deprived Clinton of just enough support to hand victory to Trump.

Of course, right-wing websites and radio shows ignored that reality while elevating the intramural fight among Democrats.

Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersOvernight Energy: Treasury creates hub to fight climate change through finance | Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez introduce 'Green New Deal for Public Housing' | Don't attack Zoom for its Bernie Sanders federal tax bill Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez introduce 'Green New Deal for Public Housing' MORE (I-Vt.) fed the frenzy by tweeting last week that “it is outrageous for anyone to suggest that Tulsi is a foreign asset.”

Sanders owes Gabbard from the 2016 race. Gabbard resigned as a vice chair of the Democratic National Committee in 2016 to endorse Sanders.

Gabbard, with her sympathy for the Assad regime in Syria, as well as her defense of WikiLeaks’ decision to release emails from the Democratic National Committee in 2016 — reportedly hacked by the Russians — and willingness to attack fellow Democrats make her an ideal candidate for use by the Russians.

Trump loyalists saw potential in Gabbard in 2016.

Bannon arranged for her to have a face-to-face meeting with Trump to have her considered for a post in the administration, possibly as ambassador to the United Nations.

Trump supporters promote her constantly.

“On podcasts and online videos, in interviews and Twitter feeds, alt-right internet stars, white nationalists, libertarian activist and some of the biggest boosters of Mr. Trump heap praise on Ms. Gabbard,” The New York Times reported two weeks ago.

The paper explained that anti-Semites “fawn” over Gabbard, “praising her willingness to criticize Israel.”

And the story noted that earlier this year “the Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi website, took credit for Ms. Gabbard’s qualification for the first two Democratic primary debates.”

Much of the pro-Trump internet backing of Gabbard is due to “the Hawaiian congresswoman’s isolationist foreign policy views. They like her support for drug decriminalization. They like what she sees as censorship by big technology platforms,” according to the Times.

Gabbard has pledged that she will not be a third-party candidate.

But she plans to take whatever delegate support she wins in the primaries to the Democratic convention to pressure the nominee to hear her agenda for the party.

That means another possible split within the party with the telegenic Gabbard ready to diminish Democrats as captives of establishment politics — divided and out of touch with the base of the party.

Why would the Russians have an interest in her?

That’s because Zuckerberg refuses to halt even the most obvious lies from popping up in political ads on Facebook.

“I think we are in the right place on this,” he told The Washington Post last week. “In general, in a democracy, I think that people should be able to hear for themselves what politicians are saying.”

That’s great news for the Russians and President Trump.

The Russians continue to use social media, principally Facebook, to stir political division, racial division and hatred, according to the FBI, the CIA, the Mueller Report and the Senate Intelligence Committee.

Meanwhile, Trump’s team is acting on its own to swamp Facebook with lies about former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenObama, Clinton reflect on Mondale's legacy Biden, Harris commend Mondale in paving the way for female VP Mondale in last message to staff: 'Joe in the White House certainly helps' MORE and his son, Hunter — and there are no consequences.

Now Warren is campaigning on a promise to break up big tech companies. They are so powerful and so wealthy that they are able to ignore questions about how they are enabling propaganda.

By selling politicians the chance to twist the truth and deceive voters, Facebook profits at the expense of the public good.

Warren put it bluntly: Facebook is guilty of taking ""money to promote lies.”

“A handful of monopolists” should not “dominate our economy and our democracy,” she said.

Zuckerberg could largely solve this problem by simply refusing to accept political advertising. It is not a significant source of income for his company, which is worth upwards of $500 billion.

Another solution is for Facebook to set its own rules to stop political lies and propaganda. That is what newspapers and cable television companies do.

In both cases, Zuckerberg refuses to act.

He did nothing even after the documented abuse of Facebook was proven to be the number one pathway for foreign interference in the 2016 election.

Zuckerberg claims he is protecting America’s free speech rights by allowing political spin, distortion and mockery to flourish on Facebook. People can decide if a politician is telling the truth for themselves, he says.

He says he is open to having the government put rules in place. That position allows him to use political paralysis in Washington as a smokescreen.

Warren has a quick, simple solution: break up these reckless firms.

As you can imagine, Zuckerberg opposes Warren’s plan.

“If she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge. And does that still suck for us? Yeah,” Zuckerberg told his staff in audio leaked to the website The Verge. “But look, at the end of the day, if someone's going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.”

In other words, Zuckerberg has no interest in Warren becoming president.

Meanwhile, Trump and his campaign are betting big on the power of social media platforms like Facebook to carry the president to reelection. That explains the elevation of Brad Parscale Brad ParscaleAides tried to get Trump to stop attacking McCain in hopes of clinching Arizona: report MORE, whose primary experience is as a digital media guru rather than in political organizing, to be campaign manager.

Thomas B. Edsall, writing in The New York Times, noted that Trump’s campaign has spent more than all three leading Democrats on social media.

According to CNN, in the last week of September more than 1,800 ads ran on Trump's Facebook page mentioning ""impeachment.” Those ads wildly distorted reality to make Congress and Democrats into villains attacking a blameless president.

CNN reported: “The ads have been viewed between 16 and 18 million times on Facebook and the campaign has spent between $600,000 and $2,000,000 on the effort.”

Just as the rightwing smear merchants put bogus stories about Uranium One into the 2016 election to damage Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' Cuba readies for life without Castro Chelsea Clinton: Pics of Trump getting vaccinated would help him 'claim credit' MORE, they are doing the same in 2020 with anti-Biden smears regarding Hunter Biden’s position with a Ukrainian gas company.

If Facebook continues to allow their platform to be abused by propagandists, they will be giving Trump a giant advantage in the 2020 campaign.

There is one obvious word for Facebook’s refusal to stop the lies and in-kind contributions to Trump from Zuckerberg:

Sad.

177,Williams,Juan,thehill,"We know — from him — that President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE is a man of “great and unmatched wisdom.”

So why is the president busy asking the Ukrainians, British, Italian and Australians for help in proving Russia is not to blame for interference in the 2016 presidential campaign?

Last week, the GOP majority in the Senate signed off on findings that Russia was responsible for “brazen interference” in the 2016 campaign. Specifically, the Senate Intelligence Committee report concluded the Russians acted to hurt the Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' Cuba readies for life without Castro Chelsea Clinton: Pics of Trump getting vaccinated would help him 'claim credit' MORE campaign while actively “supporting Donald Trump at the direction of the Kremlin.”

Not only that, but the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, Sen. Richard Burr Richard Mauze BurrA proposal to tackle congressional inside trading: Invest in the US Former Gov. Pat McCrory enters GOP Senate race in North Carolina Lara Trump leads GOP field in North Carolina Senate race, poll shows MORE (R-N.C.), said Russia continues to sow discord in the United States by “flooding social media with false reports, conspiracy theories, and trolls…to breed distrust of our democratic institutions and our fellow Americans.”

The two and a half year-long Senate investigation has the same basic findings as special counsel Robert Mueller Robert (Bob) MuellerWhy a special counsel is guaranteed if Biden chooses Yates, Cuomo or Jones as AG Barr taps attorney investigating Russia probe origins as special counsel CNN's Toobin warns McCabe is in 'perilous condition' with emboldened Trump MORE’s report. It is the same conclusion reached by U.S. intelligence agencies: Russia wanted Trump to win and pushed pro-Trump propaganda on close to 150 million Americans through Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Google.

But in his “unmatched wisdom” Trump is pursuing delusional conspiracy theories about who is to blame.

When Trump spoke to Ukraine’s President, Volodymyr Zelensky, on a late July phone call, he asked for a “favor.”

“The server,” Trump told Zelensky, “They say Ukraine has it…They say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it’s very important that you do it, if that’s possible.”

By the way, Trump’s request for Zelensky to produce information on the magical server preceded his putting the strong arm on his Ukrainian opposite number for dirt on his top political opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenObama, Clinton reflect on Mondale's legacy Biden, Harris commend Mondale in paving the way for female VP Mondale in last message to staff: 'Joe in the White House certainly helps' MORE, as well as Biden’s son Hunter.

The latter request set off calls for impeachment.

But the first thing on Trump’s mind after reminding the Ukrainian president “that we do a lot for Ukraine,” was to put the squeeze on him to investigate CrowdStrike.

That is the American private security company hired by the Democratic National Committee in 2016 to find out who hacked their systems. The answer from “CrowdStrike” was that Russia had infiltrated the Democrats’ operation to help Trump win the White House.

Trump apparently wants to rewrite history by shifting blame from Russia and pinning it on someone he described to Zelensky as “one of your wealthy people.”

The Justice Department said in September that Attorney General Bill Barr asked Trump to contact these countries to help find “the origins of the U.S. counterintelligence probe of the Trump 2016 presidential campaign.”

Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani Rudy GiulianiMyPillow files countersuit against Dominion Voting Systems Guilfoyle named as national chair of Greitens' Senate campaign in Missouri Greitens Senate bid creates headache for GOP MORE also has said the president enlisted him to identify the real culprit behind disruptions in the 2016 race.

And last week two Ukrainians with ties to Giuliani were indicted on alleged campaign finance violations for funneling money to a congressman — former Rep. Pete Sessions Peter Anderson SessionsEx-Trump aide Pierson planning run for Congress READ: The Republicans who voted to challenge election results National lawyers group seeks to have Gohmert disciplined over election suit MORE (R-Texas). They were also involved, the New York Times reported, in an effort to oust the U.S. ambassador to the Ukraine “on the grounds that she had not shown sufficient loyalty to the president as he pursued his agenda there.”

The Times reported that Giuliani sent the men to Kiev, Ukraine’s capital, with two missions. First, “to find people and information that could be used to undermine the special counsel’s investigation,” and second to “damage” Biden, the Democrat whom many polls project could beat Trump in the 2020 election.

Again, the first order of business was to find information to turn attention away from Russia’s helping hand to Trump in the 2016 election.

And that fit with Trump’s comment, while standing next to Russian President Vladimir Putin Vladimir Vladimirovich PutinThe Memo: Russia tensions rise with Navalny's life in balance How to defeat Vladimir Putin Russian fighter jet intercepts US, Norwegian patrol aircraft over Barents Sea: report MORE in Helsinki in July 2018, that Russia was not responsible for interfering in the 2016 election. Referring to Putin, Trump said: “He just said it is not Russia. I will say this. I don’t see any reason why it would be.”

The idea that there is a hidden tech device somewhere in the Ukraine that proves Russia is not responsible for hacking and interfering in the 2016 race goes beyond bizarre.

“If we take [Trump] at face value, if we believe what he’s saying to Zelensky, the conclusion appears to be that he’s unable to distinguish between conspiracy theories and the intelligence briefings he receives that are backed up by hard evidence and forensics,” Thomas Rid, a Johns Hopkins University political scientist who specializes in computer-based disinformation attacks, told Wired magazine last month.

Now, in the wake of Trump’s phone call pressuring Zelensky, a Fox News poll last week found 51 percent of Americans are “extremely” or “very” troubled by Trump’s “dealings with the Ukrainian president.”

Trump does not like the poll, either.

Barr and Giuliani may soon be on the case.

Now the call of history requires the same fierce focus as congressional Democrats begin the impeachment of President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE.

In every case, the president’s strategy is to get Democrats to take their eyes off the prize with distraction, distortion and delay in producing evidence and witnesses.

He is betting that Democrats will get tired of the fight and lose focus about exactly what he did to deserve impeachment.

It is not just Democrats he is trying to derail through distraction. He wants the public to call off the Democrats.

If the public gets confused and can’t keep track of his corruption, he expects polls to tell Democrats that most Americans are dismissing the whole thing as just more political fighting.

So, here is a primer for Democrats who want to keep their eyes on the prize.

We begin with one fact:

The President of the United States withheld military aid to Ukraine while asking the country’s new president to open a corruption investigation into Joe Biden Joe BidenObama, Clinton reflect on Mondale's legacy Biden, Harris commend Mondale in paving the way for female VP Mondale in last message to staff: 'Joe in the White House certainly helps' MORE’s son.

Yes, Trump put the nation’s military security concerns behind his personal political goal of damaging Biden, an opponent who consistently beats him in 2020 presidential polls.

Last week, in a brazen effort to make his corruption look normal, the president openly called for another nation — China — to also launch a corruption probe into Biden.

These facts are not in dispute. The president released a summary memo of his phone call with the Ukrainian president that confirms the facts.

There are also memos and messages among U.S. diplomats that confirm the facts.

But to get everyone to look the other way, Trump is putting on a dazzling cable news show full of shouted insults and pained claims that he is a victim of Democrats who want to undo the 2016 election. He complains Democrats are conducting a coup. He says they are guilty of treason. He warns of civil war.

Oh, he is also using profanity on Twitter. He distracts by bullying Rep. Adam Schiff Adam Bennett SchiffOvernight Defense: Administration says 'low to moderate confidence' Russia behind Afghanistan troop bounties | 'Low to medium risk' of Russia invading Ukraine in next few weeks | Intelligence leaders face sharp questions during House worldwide threats he Hillicon Valley: Biden administration sanctions Russia for SolarWinds hack, election interference Intelligence leaders face sharp questions during House worldwide threats hearing MORE (D-Calif.), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, with the nickname “Shifty Schiff.” He also gets snickers by being crude and saying Schiff could not hold his secretary of State’s jockstrap.

His friends in the right-wing echo chamber are daring Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiWhite House readies for Chauvin verdict House GOP's McClain responds to Pelosi calling her 'that woman' GOP struggles to rein in nativism MORE (D-Calif.) to hold a formal vote on starting impeachment — even though it is not required by the Constitution. They want to drag Pelosi into a time-consuming exercise that does not advance actual impeachment. It will give Trump more time to cover-up and stonewall.

By the way, Pelosi has the votes if she felt such a vote would make a difference to actually impeaching Trump. It does not.

ADVERTISEMENT

This is just one more distraction from the fact, as affirmed last week by Ellen Weintraub, chairwoman of the Federal Election Commission, that it is illegal to ask a foreign government for help in an American political campaign.

Fox News’ Andrew Napolitano Andrew Peter NapolitanoFox's Napolitano says grand jury erred in Taylor case: 'I would have indicted all three of them' Fox's Napolitano: Supreme Court confirmation hearings will be 'World War III of political battles' Fox's Napolitano: 2000 election will look like 'child's play' compared to 2020 legal battles MORE put it plainly last week:

“Is violating campaign finance law by involving a foreign government in an American presidential campaign an impeachable offense? Yes, it is,” Napolitano wrote on FoxNews.com. “The expressed intention of those who wrote the Constitution and those who wrote the campaign finance laws 200 years later — and the lesson of the post-2016 election and Mueller-investigated angst in America — was to keep foreign governments out of the American political system.”

An open and shut case, right?

A USA Today/Ipsos poll from last week shows growing support for the House impeaching Trump over his phone call with the Ukrainian leader.

“Americans by a 45%-38% plurality now support a vote by the House of Representatives to impeach,” according to USA Today. The poll also found that 44 percent say the Senate “should convict Trump and remove him from office.”

That’s why the effort to distract goes on. You can watch it live every time Rudy Giuliani Rudy GiulianiMyPillow files countersuit against Dominion Voting Systems Guilfoyle named as national chair of Greitens' Senate campaign in Missouri Greitens Senate bid creates headache for GOP MORE goes on television and delivers a rambling, bizarre conspiracy theory.

“We know corrupt Ukrainian oligarch laundered $3 million to the Biden Family,” Giuliani tweeted last month.

There is no such proof. Referring to several component parts of the effort to smear Biden, the Washington Post recently wrote they “fact-checked these allegations in May and found they did not add up.”

Democrats also have to be careful not to distract themselves by responding to calls from their supporters to load up the articles of impeachment with every grievance against Trump for the last four years – contact with Russians, obstruction of the Mueller probe, foreign leaders staying at Trump hotels to gain his favor — as legitimate and important as that might be.

We must all keep our eyes on the prize if the country is to survive Trump.

182,Williams,Juan,thehill,"As the political winds shift in the perfect storm of the 2020 election and impeachment, think about this:

GOP strategist Mike Murphy last week said on MSNBC that a Republican senator had told him that as many as 30 GOP senators would vote to impeach President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE if it were a secret ballot.

Let’s give those 30 Republicans the benefit of the doubt. Each of them has a conscience. Maybe they can’t live with giving Trump a free pass on using military aid money to press another country to find dirt on his Democratic rival, Joe Biden Joe BidenObama, Clinton reflect on Mondale's legacy Biden, Harris commend Mondale in paving the way for female VP Mondale in last message to staff: 'Joe in the White House certainly helps' MORE.

At the risk of sounding cynical, it does occur to me that Senate Republicans for the first time see Trump’s scandal possibly costing them their majority.

Next year, 23 Senate Republicans will be up for reelection with Trump at the top of the ticket.

Murphy warned that, given Trump’s antics, Senate Republicans are thinking they are “going to lose Colorado with Cory Gardner Cory GardnerBiden administration reverses Trump changes it says 'undermined' conservation program Gardner to lead new GOP super PAC ahead of midterms OVERNIGHT ENERGY: Court rules against fast-track of Trump EPA's 'secret science' rule | Bureau of Land Management exodus: Agency lost 87 percent of staff in Trump HQ relocation | GM commits to electric light duty fleet by 2035 MORE.

We’re going to lose Arizona with Martha McSally. And the Democrats will put the Senate very much in play.”

At one time, Trump kept Capitol Hill Republicans in line by threatening to have his supporters back a primary challenge to any dissenting GOP member seeking reelection.

Now, that threat has to be weighed against the increasing fear of a weakened president handing the Senate to Democrats.

There is evidence that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong 15 Senate Republicans pledge to oppose lifting earmark ban It's not 'woketivism,' it's good business MORE (R-Ky.) sees impeachment imperiling his majority next year.

Last week, McConnell showed independence from Trump by coming out publicly in support of continuing military aid to Ukraine.

More important, he also pushed the White House to share the whistleblower complaint with Congress.

And McConnell has to deal with a well-known Senate Republican daring to separate himself from Trump on the Ukraine scandal — Sen. Mitt Romney Willard (Mitt) Mitt RomneyAdvocacy groups pushing Biden to cancel student debt for disabled 15 Senate Republicans pledge to oppose lifting earmark ban The Hill's 12:30 Report - Presented by Facebook - All US adults now eligible for COVID vaccines MORE (R-Utah).

Romney said he is “deeply troubled” to see reports of Trump pressuring the Ukrainian president to damage Biden. And he later told reporters: “I can’t imagine being in the Senate or in any other position of responsibility and looking around to see who’s with you. You stand for what you believe in.”

Loss of the majority might prompt Republican senators to start their own version of the wave of retirements — 15 so far — that have hit House Republicans since Democrats claimed that majority in the 2018 midterms.

Team Trump knows it has a problem. The president last week tweeted out a video of Romney’s sad, losing face on the night of the 2012 presidential election.

And Donald Trump Jr. Don TrumpTrump Jr. shares edited video showing father knocking Biden down with golf ball Trump: 'I can't imagine' any Republican would beat me in 2024 primary if I run Trump Jr.: There are 'plenty' of GOP incumbents who should be challenged MORE described Romney as “forever bitter that my father succeeded where he so embarrassingly failed.” The son added that Romney is straying from the president because he is “desperate to be loved by the left and the media.”

But Romney is not the only Republican willing to speak out.

The shifting political dynamic among Republicans is a budding version of the sudden shift among moderate Democrats in the House that led Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiWhite House readies for Chauvin verdict House GOP's McClain responds to Pelosi calling her 'that woman' GOP struggles to rein in nativism MORE (D-Calif.) to announce the start of impeachment.

Pelosi shifted only after seven moderate freshman Democrats — several from districts Trump won in 2016 and all with national security backgrounds — penned an op-ed for The Washington Post calling for impeachment.

Until those moderates stood up, Pelosi had a clear reason to resist calls for impeachment. She was protecting them, and in doing so, boosting her own chances of keeping her House majority.

“As members of Congress, we have prioritized delivering for our constituents — remaining steadfast in our focus on health care, infrastructure, economic policy and our communities’ priorities,” the seven freshmen wrote. “Yet everything we do harks back to our oaths to defend the country. These new allegations are a threat to all we have sworn to protect.”

Now more than half the members of the US House of Representatives — 223 as of Saturday — have come out in support of an impeachment inquiry.

These politicians know how to read polls. And the polls are shifting in favor of impeachment, too.

Before Pelosi’s announcement a majority of Americans opposed impeachment.

Last week, an NPR/PBS/Marist poll found 49 percent backing for an impeachment inquiry and 46 percent opposition.

The preservation of political power, pure self-interest — from both Democrats and Republicans — is at the heart of the start of impeachment proceedings against the 45th president of the United States.

CORRECTION: Under the National Emergencies Act of 1976, members of Congress can force a vote every six months on Trump's declaration of a national emergency. The vote cannot be prevented by GOP leadership. An earlier version of this story included incorrect information.

Last week, Condoleezza Rice, the prominent Republican and former secretary of State, told CNN she doesn’t like how Trump talks about immigrants.

Trump needs to be a “lot more careful” in how he talks about race, she said, “because race is a very delicate and raw nerve.”

Yet Trump supporters regularly ask me, ""Why do you say Trump is racist?""

As Brian Kelly, a Trump supporter at a recent rally in North Carolina, put it to a New York Times reporter: “I hate this racist nonsense. It’s just a political ploy.”

So it was revealing this month when Gregory Cheadle, a black Republican made prominent by Trump in 2016 — “Look at my African American over here. Look at him. Are you the greatest?” Trump said at that time — said he is leaving the GOP because he can’t stand the racial blindness plaguing Trump supporters.

White Republicans have practiced “sidestepping the people of color issue,” Cheadle told PBS.

Polls back him up: 51 percent of all American voters said Trump is racist in a July Quinnipiac poll. But among Republicans, only 8 percent felt that way.

“Republicans are too sheepish to call [Trump] out on anything and they are afraid of losing their positions and losing any power themselves,” Cheadle said.

While Trump’s followers closed their eyes, Cheadle was shocked to see Trump telling four women of color, elected members of Congress, to “go back” where they came from. He had eyes wide open, too, when Trump called Baltimore, a black-majority city, “a disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess.”

And then there is Trump’s “white superiority complex,” Cheadle said.

“When you look at his appointments for the bench: White, white, white, white, white, white, white,” Cheadle added. “That to me is really damning to everybody else because no one else gets a chance because he’s thinking that the whites are superior, period.”

Toward the end of Trump’s first year in office, The Associated Press analyzed the demographics of his judicial nominees. At that time, 91 percent of Trump’s judicial nominees had been white, and 81 percent male.

Cheadle’s criticism fits with what I hear from blacks in Congress and civil rights leaders about the daily reality of facing Trump’s racism. They can’t understand the absence of any leading black, Latino or Asian senior adviser at the White House.

Then she left on bad terms, saying: “It is very clear Donald Trump is a racist.” Trump called her a “lowlife” and a “dog.”

Trump’s problems with black Americans were further exacerbated when the lone black Republican in the House of Representatives, Will Hurd William Ballard HurdPence autobiography coming from Simon & Schuster Prince Harry joins Aspen Institute commission on misinformation Congress's latest hacking investigation should model its most recent MORE (Texas), announced his retirement last month.

“The party is not growing in some of the largest parts of our country,” he said in a speech shortly before his retirement. “Why is that? I’ll tell you.""

“Don’t be a racist. Don’t be a misogynist, right? Don’t be a homophobe. These are real basic things that we all should learn when we were in kindergarten,” Hurd warned.

While Trump’s supporters remain indifferent to these concerns, the white Democrat leading in polls to face him in the 2020 election sees it as a major political weakness.

“Hate is on the rise again, and we're at a defining moment again in American history,” Biden told the congregation at the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Ala., last week. “Hate only hides. It doesn't go away. If you give it oxygen, it comes out from under the rocks.”

Biden’s speech reflects two political realities:

ADVERTISEMENT

First, Biden knows that his path to the nomination depends on his strong support in the African American community. An Economist-YouGov poll earlier this month found Biden with 47 percent support among African Americans, Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersOvernight Energy: Treasury creates hub to fight climate change through finance | Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez introduce 'Green New Deal for Public Housing' | Don't attack Zoom for its Bernie Sanders federal tax bill Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez introduce 'Green New Deal for Public Housing' MORE with only 14 percent black support and Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth WarrenWorld passes 3 million coronavirus deaths Poll: 56 percent say wealth tax is part of solution to inequality Democratic senators call on Biden to support waiving vaccine patents MORE with 11 percent backing from black voters.

And second, Trump is not worried about the black vote. Despite his boasts about the low African American unemployment rate — which saw its largest decline under President Obama — he knows he is unlikely to beat the 8 percent black support he got in 2016.

Team Trump’s path to reelection depends entirely on maximizing the white vote and playing to white resentment toward immigrants and people of color.

Last year, I wrote a book called “‘What the Hell Do You Have to Lose?’ — Trump’s War on Civil Rights.”

The title was taken from Trump’s demeaning assessment of all black voters as jobless people resigned to life in violent neighborhoods with bad schools.

Even black Republicans like Gregory Cheadle, having taken a chance on Trump, now realize they had a lot to lose.

Get ready for a race-conscious 2020 campaign.

Fear of a larger jail-break from the cult of enforced silence among Republicans about Trump’s failures is the big reason the president’s campaign officials have pushed state party officials to cancel Republican presidential primaries in Arizona, Kansas, Nevada and South Carolina.

And that fear explains why the Republican National Committee is withholding polling data on the president from GOP candidates for state and local offices.

ADVERTISEMENT

“Republican consultants say the Trump information is being withheld for two reasons: to discourage candidates from distancing themselves from the president, and to avoid embarrassing him with poor results that might leak,” according to the investigative news site ProPublica.

It is no secret that Trump’s approval rating has been sagging all summer. As of Friday, 53 percent of voters disapproved of him, according to the RealClear Politics average of polls.

Who knows how high that number might go if Republicans began calling out Trump for never building that wall.

And what happens if Republicans begin to ask about the missing health care plan that was going to be better than ObamaCare?

Trump has already thinned the ranks of high-profile Republican voices willing to challenge him on his lack of results and impulsive, autocratic behavior. GOP critics are shut down by the threat of being targeted by one of Trump’s angry tweets or worse — having Trump endorse a far-right opponent.

Then there is this odd political dynamic at play: After losing 41 seats in the midterms and watching the rush of current House Republicans into retirement, the remaining party faithful have concluded that despite Trump’s negatives, their only chance to hold on to power is to stick with Trump’s theatrical bullying and name-calling.

Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) turned down requests from Republicans looking for someone with strong party credentials to challenge Trump. He said it would have amounted to a “kamikaze mission.”

Why the talk of political death in launching a primary challenge against Trump?

Here’s the answer, from a Wall Street Journal/NBC poll in June. Self-identified Republicans and Republican-leaning adults were asked if they are “more a supporter of Donald Trump or more of a supporter of the Republican Party?”

Fifty-two percent said they are loyal to Trump. How many held a higher allegiance to the party than to Trump? Only 38 percent.

Top Republicans believe they need Trump to hold on to those Republicans who identify with Trump more than with the party.

The party can’t afford the loss of any voters because already 60 percent of all voters, according to a CNN-SSRS poll released last week, do not think Trump deserves a second term.

In last week’s special election for a North Carolina congressional district, the Democrat came within 2 percentage points of beating the Republican in a district that Trump won by nearly 12 points in 2016.

As Vanity Fair’s Peter Hamby pointed out: “Imagine how much media attention would be given to an Obama primary challenger running in double digits at this point in 2011.”

That’s why Trump is fighting to keep up the mirage of total GOP voter fealty to him. He keeps hammering the phony message that he has set the all-time record for support within the party for any Republican president.

Yes, Trump does have strong support from Republicans — 82 percent, according to a recent ABC News/Washington Post poll.

But former President George W. Bush set the record in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.

Trump’s fixation with this very disprovable lie is revealing about his anxiety about facing a challenge in the primaries, even from fellow Republicans he has demeaned as the “three stooges.”

He is referring to three men who have announced they will run against him in the Republican primary: former Rep. Joe Walsh Joe WalshGOP lawmakers mourn death of Rush Limbaugh Sacha Baron Cohen pens op-ed on the dangers of conspiracy theories Sunday shows preview: Protests continue over shooting of Blake; coronavirus legislation talks remain at impasse MORE (R-Ill.), former South Carolina Gov.

""I’m running because he's unfit,” Walsh said in a recent interview with ABC News. “Somebody needs to step up and there needs to be an alternative. The country is sick of this guy's tantrum. He’s — he's a child.""

""I think we have to have a conversation about what it means to be a Republican,"" Sanford said Sept. 8 on “Fox News Sunday,” adding that today’s GOP ""has lost our way.”

The Trump campaign’s ongoing effort to stop Republican primaries from taking place next year, Walsh said on CNN, is an effort to “disenfranchise voters.”

No president in my lifetime has ever short-circuited their party’s presidential primary process. It is contrary to the basic principles of democracy.

To me that seemed petty, very un-presidential.

Then Trump blamed Obama for problems with the White House air conditioning.

At that point I thought we might as well be watching a comedy skit on ""Saturday Night Live.""

That’s why I always skip over headlines about Trump’s obsession with Obama. My gut tells me I’ll laugh but the story will be mostly empty political calories, a weak mix of gossip and amateur psychoanalysis.

ADVERTISEMENT

Even when Trump went overseas and told a foreign audience that Obama was “outsmarted” and embarrassed by Russian President Vladimir Putin Vladimir Vladimirovich PutinThe Memo: Russia tensions rise with Navalny's life in balance How to defeat Vladimir Putin Russian fighter jet intercepts US, Norwegian patrol aircraft over Barents Sea: report MORE, I thought that was so ridiculous, an outright distortion of the truth, that no one could take it seriously. He made that claim on the false premise that Crimea was “taken away from President Obama.”

Then I heard that lie justified by Trump boosters on talk radio with claims about Obama’s reluctance to get into military confrontations.

This led me to ask ‘How does Trump get away with these lies?’ Do Trump’s critics on the left – people labeled by Trump supporters as victims of Trump Derangement Syndrome - accept lies about Trump as fact?

The short answer is ‘No.’

In fact, Trump critics do the reverse to belittle Trump. They ask Trump supporters to imagine their hysteria if it was true that Obama made a pay-off to silence a porn star; took money from the military without congressional approval to build a wall because he couldn't get Mexico to pay for it; and ballooned the deficit to the point that it is estimated to reach a trillion dollars.

What if Obama dismissed complaints that his attorney general paid $30,000 to host a holiday party at a property he owned?

We learned last week that Trump’s attorney general, Bill Barr, did exactly that when he booked the Trump Hotel in Washington for his own lavish holiday party.

What would Republicans say if Obama pitched holding the next G-7 summit at a property he owned?

Trump did exactly that last month by suggesting that the U.S. should host next year’s G-7 at his financially-distressed Doral Club in Miami, Florida.

What would Republicans say if Obama or his aides used a black magic marker to doctor a chart produced by the National Weather Service showing the path of a hurricane bound for America?

That is exactly what happened last week, apparently to cover up Trump’s misstatements that Alabama was in the path of Hurricane Dorian.

You get the point.

These disparate approaches to political attacks from the left and right came to my attention a few weeks ago when a swing-state Democratic congressman jokingly asked me why I think Trump tells so many lies about Obama.

I said fact-checkers have Trump telling a lot of lies about a lot of people and laughed. But then I asked: Like what lies?

The congressman reminded me that Trump said Obama used wiretaps to spy on his 2016 campaign with no evidence.

And Trump lied again by saying Obama was about to start a war with North Korea at the end of his second term and was turned down for a meeting with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong Un Kim Jong UnExclusive: GOP senators seek FBI investigation into Biden Pentagon nominee On North Korea, Biden should borrow from Trump's Singapore declaration North Korea drops out of Tokyo Olympics MORE.

Not only is there no evidence for those claims, the congressman said, but they have been called outright lies, on the record, by top intelligence, State Department and White House officials who were involved.

“At the risk of stating the obvious, this is horsesh*t,” tweeted Susan Rice, Obama’s national security adviser.

To my surprise the congressman kept going with Trump lies about Obama.

Trump lied, he said, when he claimed Obama made it a policy to separate children from their parents at the border. The truth is that Obama acted in select cases to protect children from being trafficked when, in the words of The New York Times, there was “doubt about the relationship between a child and an accompanying adult.”

On the other hand, Trump’s zero tolerance immigration policy resulted in close to 3,000 children being separated from their parents in an attempt to discourage people from seeking legal asylum.

Yet, when Trump’s political supporters hear him trashing Obama they pay less attention to whether the claims are based on a lie than to the pleasure they get from him mocking an opponent.

So, for example, listening to falsehoods about Obama has the power to diminish the truth that Trump inherited from his predecessor a strong economy with falling unemployment, a booming stock-market, and steady GDP growth.

Trump’s distorted history of the Obama administration can also close your eyes when he wrongly claims to be fixing bad Obama policies.

Trump falsely claimed he pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) because Obama made a bad deal for the U.S.

But the truth is it was a good deal for American workers and businesses that kept China from setting the rules of trade in Asia.

Pointing out lies is very different than telling lies and accepting a double standard for your politician’s bad behavior.

On matters big and small, this president’s lies, hypocrisy, and his manic obsession with his predecessor are destroying the fabric of the country he leads.

Trump has already filled two Supreme Court seats with hard-line conservatives.

One of those two seats was a vacancy that McConnell preserved by stopping Garland, a moderate jurist respected by both Democrats and Republicans, from being confirmed.

Now if Trump puts another hard-right conservative on the court he will demolish any semblance of political balance by creating a 6-3 conservative majority. And a possible Breyer retirement brings into play a dreadful prospect for Democrats — a 7-2 conservative majority.

Axelrod’s depressing political forecast is rooted in the bald hypocrisy being practiced by McConnell.

Remember McConnell prevented Obama from putting a justice on the high court with nearly a year to go before the next election.

But now, McConnell contends, Trump can put a nominee on the court with a year to go before the next election because the same party, the GOP, controls the Senate and the White House.

This is a remarkable, self-serving double standard. It shows a blatant lack of fair play, certain to ignite bitter political division. With a 53-47 majority in the Senate, the Republicans’ only concern is losing the vote of one of their own — say, Sen. Susan Collins Susan Margaret CollinsSenate aims to pass anti-Asian hate crimes bill this week This week: Democrats move on DC statehood Trump looms over Senate's anti-Asian hate crimes battle MORE of Maine. With no filibuster, the GOP does not need any votes from Democrats.

McConnell’s goal is to secure his political legacy as the man who cemented a conservative majority on the high court to counter the liberal ideas emerging from the rising number of younger, more racially diverse and more progressive voters in the country.

He will also go down in history as the man who drained all trust from the Founding Fathers’ commitment to a nation of laws beyond the tyranny of any one political ideology or party.

It does not take a fortuneteller to predict that another conservative on the court will stir up rage.

He added, ""Seriously it’s no surprise. @SenateMajLdr McConnell lives for GOP judges because he knows the GOP agenda is so radical & unpopular they can only achieve it in courts. Anyone who believes he’d ever allow confirmation of a Dem President's nominee for SCOTUS is fooling themselves.""

In an unprecedented move, five Democratic senators filed an amicus brief last month urging the court to drop its review of a landmark gun control case because of the National Rifle Association’s work to inflame public opinion and bias the court.

“The Supreme Court is not well,” the senators wrote. “And the people know it. Perhaps the Court can heal itself before the public demands it be restructured in order to reduce the influence of politics.”

He told NBC News he is open to “whatever Supreme Court reform will depoliticize this body” and change the perception that the court is “an almost nakedly political institution.”

That idea would require changing the constitution.

But if the country is up in arms at the sight of an unbalanced court, then changing the number of justices will get consideration.

A Pew Research Center survey published in August found that while 75 percent of Republicans and GOP-leaning independents have a favorable view of the Supreme Court, only 49 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents have a favorable view.

Pew notes, “The 26 percentage point difference between the two parties is among the widest it has been over the past two decades.”

A Quinnipiac University poll in late April indicated 81 percent of registered voters nationwide agree that the process for confirming justices is “too political.”

David Wasserman of The Cook Political Report reported last August that the 52 Republican senators who began the 115th Congress — the session preceding the current one — were elected by only 18 percent of the U.S. population.

That figure hardly changed massively in last year’s midterms, after which the Republicans returned with 53 seats.

One way or another, a majority of the American people are being denied any voice in selecting the justices to sit on the Supreme Court as a result of McConnell’s unscrupulous tactics.

We are rapidly approaching the breaking point predicted by Axelrod.

If that dark moment is to come, history will record that it was McConnell — not Trump — who broke apart the country.

And, yes, you’re right. I’m a big boy. I can ignore his bullying, even his followers’ death threats.

But this goes beyond Trump skewering me.

He is engaged in a coordinated attack on every journalist’s ability to hold him accountable, call out his lies and critique his failed policies.

Trump targeted me last week after watching a “Fox News Sunday” discussion of the damage being done by what I called his “brutish” strategy for forcing China to agree to a new trade deal.

I was asked if Democrats did not agree with the president’s decision to confront China for its unfair trade practices, including stealing intellectual property.

I said yes, it is true that Democrats have pressed for a better trade deal with China. But I added that Democrats are disturbed by the president’s heavy-handed use of tariffs. It has led to a damaging trade war that is pushing the world to the edge of economic recession.

And I added that despite Trump’s denials, his use of tariffs is driving up prices for American consumers while fostering a lack of economic stability. As a result, big business is less likely to make capital investments. That hurts the stock market.

That last point, I mentioned, has been made by the Wall Street Journal editorial board, hardly a bastion of liberal economic thought.

Note the absence of any personal attack on Trump. It was a commentary on the president’s policies.

Several hours later, my phone exploded after Trump tweeted:

""Juan Williams at @FoxNews is so pathetic, and yet when he met me in the Fox Building lobby, he couldn’t have been nicer as he asked me to take a picture of him and me for his family,"" the president wrote. ""Yet he is always nasty and wrong!""

He followed that up with another attack on me in front of reporters on the White House lawn. This time he excoriated me, my network and my Fox colleague Donna Brazile Donna Lease BrazileHow President Biden can hit a home run Scalise bringing Donna Brazile as guest to Biden inauguration Harris selects Tina Flournoy as chief of staff: report MORE.

I know what it is like to be targeted by powerful people who don’t like my views.

As a Washington Post reporter covering the corrupt administration of D.C. Mayor Marion Barry, I was badmouthed by Barry and his supporters. They called me an ""Uncle Tom"" working for a white newspaper. I got menacing calls warning me not to start my car, telling me where my children went to school. Then, as the calls intensified, my house was broken into — my wife found a butcher’s knife left on the bed.

Later in my career, National Public Radio fired me and its top executives called me a bigot in need of psychiatric attention. Why? In commentary, I admitted that after the 2001 terror attacks, I got nervous about getting on planes with people dressed in Muslim religious garb even as I supported building a mosque near Ground Zero.

But those attacks are a step down from a blitz launched by the president using the world’s biggest Bully Pulpit at a time of deep political polarization, rising hate crimes and hate speech on social media.

Allow me to make two points:

First, what happened to me is a chilling example of how this president does not respect the First Amendment rights of any journalist.

He long ago crossed a bright line by labeling journalists the “enemy of the American people.” During the 2016 campaign, his supporters could be heard shouting “Luggenpresse” — the Nazi-popularized German word meaning ""Lying Press"" — to American reporters.

And in 2017 he tweeted NBC and other broadcast networks are so “distorted and fake that licenses must be challenged and, if appropriate, revoked.”

My second point has to do with his support for online provocateurs who delight in trolling liberals while feeding conservatives a diet of fear and grievance.

In July, he held a “Social Media Summit” at the White House with a guest list that included the man famed for pushing a distorted edit of a video to malign former Vice President Joe Biden as a babbling idiot.

“Instead of combatting Russian social media misinformation ... the President has invited trolls, conspiracy theorists, anti-Semites ... to the White House,” tweeted Sen.

The president’s top message to these fake content providers or non-journalists is a promise to prevent social media outlets, such as Facebook and Twitter, from cracking down on them.

In fact, the social media outlets, including Twitter and Facebook, have been slow to crack down on the highly profitable spread of lies, conspiracies and online bullying.

Sorry to disappoint, Mr. President, but I will continue to point out your failures: How about telling your pal #MoscowMitch to send you the bills he is blocking to protect against future election interference?

But just because you attack me personally, I will not refrain from praising you.

Kudos to you for criminal justice reform and backing school choice, Mr. President.

Bet you weren’t expecting that.

About that photo…

In his critical tweet about me, Donald Trump mentioned a photo taken at Fox News in New York and states I asked for a picture with him. That is a total misrepresentation of what happened.

I was standing with my colleague, Ed Henry, when Trump walked through security. He came right over to me. We talked and then, while he talked with Ed, the building’s maintenance man, an older man, waved at me and asked if he could get a picture with Trump. I went over to Trump and made the request. He obliged. Then the maintenance man, now joined by other people, offered to reciprocate by taking a photo of me with Trump; Ed with Trump and more.

I never asked for a picture with Trump and never brought my family into the conversation.

Rep. Joaquin Castro Joaquin CastroDemocrats ask Biden to reverse employee policy on past marijuana use The Hill's Morning Report - Biden's next act: Massive infrastructure plan with tax hikes Blinken to appear before Foreign Affairs Committee MORE’s (D-Texas) new fight plan hit the bullseye when he tweeted out a list of Trump’s top donors in San Antonio.

“Donald Trump has put a target on the back of millions. And you’re too cowardly or agreeable to say anything about it,” Castro tweeted about those funders. “How about I stop mentioning Trump’s public campaign donors and he stops using their money for ads that fuel hate?”

Separately, billionaire Steve Ross saw a rush for the exits at the upscale health clubs overseen by his firm, Equinox and Soul Cycle, after it emerged he was planning a fundraiser for Trump and the Republican National Committee with ticket prices as high as $250,000.

Then Rep. Al Green Alexander (Al) N. GreenBipartisan lawmakers call for action on anti-hate crime measures House Democrat sits on Capitol steps to protest extremist threat Biden pledges support for Texas amid recovery from winter storm MORE (D-Texas) unleashed a new, money-based rationale for House Democrats to begin impeaching Trump — to put a spotlight on Trump’s big donors.

Impeachment, Green told MSNBC, would result in Trump becoming “persona non grata to a good many of these wealthy people.”

Green alleged that Trump’s wealthy donors saw him as a “beneficial bigot.”

Those donors, Green said, are giving money in exchange for right-wing judges on the courts and tax cuts for the rich. “So he has benefitted them to the extent that they will tolerate his bigotry. When you tolerate bigotry, you perpetuate bigotry.”

Also putting money at the front line of the fight against Trump is 2020 presidential candidate Julián Castro, who is paying for tough advertising calling out Trump’s bigoted language in the aftermath of the mass shooting in El Paso that left 22 people dead.

The former Obama Cabinet secretary broke new ground with an ad on Trump’s favorite network, Fox News: “As we saw in El Paso, Americans were killed because you stoked the fire of racists. Innocent people were shot down because they look different from you; because they look like me.”

Many Democratic presidential candidates are already on record calling the president a racist.

But paying for a television ad to rebuke Trump as a racist has the potential to penetrate the far-right bubble. Trump’s backers consistently show indifference to his use of racial fears and anti-immigrant anxiety to stir up his base for the 2020 election.

Polling indicates that this new willingness to confront Trump’s use of racial division has the potential to pay dividends.

Fifty-nine percent of voters in a Fox News poll released last week said Trump is “tearing the country apart.” That number includes 53 percent of white voters. And in terms of Trump’s bid for a second term, it is telling that 59 percent of independent voters also agree with this sentiment.

The poll found that 56 percent of voters disapprove of Trump. “His disapproval rating has only been higher once: 57 percent in October 2017,” according to Fox pollster Dana Blanton.

This reaction against Trump is likely fueled not only by his demonization of immigrants and nonwhite people, but by his constant bullying and name-calling.

If you are not a regular reader of Trump’s Twitter feed, you may have been perplexed by the insinuation that the Clintons were somehow involved in the jail-cell suicide of billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.

You may also be shocked to learn that the president has no problem telling Israel’s prime minister to block his political opponents in Congress from visiting Israel.

You may also be appalled to learn that he believes people with mental illness are to be blamed for mass shootings. And that there is no reason to worry about trade wars damaging the economy.

No American president has ever stooped this low. That’s why the time has come for Democrats to find new strategies to shake Trump’s trance-like hold on the Republican Party and a third of voters.

But there are risks.

Some voters may see revealing the names of Trump’s donors as dirty politics. Some people are certain to become defensive when they hear Trump called out for racism, fearing that because they voted for him they are being called racists.

With Trump as the GOP nominee, the then-first lady advised that politicians’ use of “hateful language” is not representative of “the true spirit of this country.”

But now, with Trump in office, it looks like the Democrats’ best strategy may begin with acknowledging that she was wrong.

197,Williams,Juan,thehill,"Tell the truth — you love Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and all the rest.

I did, too. Then it got personal for me.

In 2016, Russian hackers, using WikiLeaks, “doxed” me.

I gave him my number in a private email to set up an interview.

Once the number was out, my phone blew up. Pranksters harassed me. Thuggish partisans threatened me. I had to get a new phone as I was covering the final weeks of the campaign.

Then, in 2018, a smiling man came up after I hosted a television show in Dallas to tell me how much he enjoyed “trolling” me online with racist language.

I couldn’t believe he was saying this to my face. His smile made it weird.

He then bragged about how he and his pals wrote phony reviews of a book I wrote on President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE’s history of racism. He wanted to bring down the book’s rating on Amazon, even though it had not yet been released and he had not read it.

And get this – this guy then asked for a selfie.

This is just one horrible way the world has been transformed for the worse by social media.

I am not alone in my anger.

The recent mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton reminded the nation of the damage done by Big Tech's refusal to take responsibility for hate speech, racism and calls to violence.

""There are clear [First Amendment] issues with government action to directly ban online discussion forums, but they have no right to the amplification afforded them by Facebook/Twitter/Google/YouTube,"" Facebook's former chief security officer, Alex Stamos, wrote on Twitter after the mayhem.

Polls now show a sharp increase in Americans who are furious with big technology companies that rake in millions while refusing to take any responsibility for the spread of hateful language, bizarre conspiracy theories, financial scams and trolls — as well as the derailing of honest political discourse.

In 2015, 72 percent of Republicans and 74 percent of Democrats held positive views of tech companies, according to polling by the Pew Research Center.

Today — just four years later — Pew finds there has been a 28-point drop in the share of Republicans who say the big tech firms are having a “positive impact.”

And there has been a 20-point drop among Democrats who once cheered the big tech companies.

Why?

Start with the big tech companies’ refusal to stop Russia from interfering in the 2016 election with a deluge of phony online posts designed to tear the country apart by race, religion, sexual preference, and fear of immigrants.

U.S. intelligence has confirmed that the Russians acted to damage Clinton’s campaign and help Trump win the White House.

Then there is the damage Big Tech is doing to American journalism.

More Americans now get their news from Facebook than from newspapers. And local newspapers have been killed off as advertising dollars have migrated from papers to online posts.

Online journalism is too often reduced to a contest of who can get the most clicks.

Forget about the accuracy of the stories or the quality of the analysis. It’s all about the retweets featuring conspiracies, vulgar personal attacks, celebrities in bikinis and celebrities in feuds created by their publicists.

Chris Hughes, one of Facebook’s co-founders, is now telling members of Congress that the social media giant he created is out-of-control.

“Big tech has embraced a business model of addiction,” Hawley said in a press release. “Too much of the ‘innovation’ in this space is designed not to create better products, but to capture more attention by using psychological tricks that make it difficult to look away. This legislation will put an end to that and encourage true innovation by tech companies.”

“The power being amassed by a handful of tech media companies...is a level of power unprecedented in our political discourse,” Cruz said at a Washington Post event in June. He is proposing stripping tech platforms of their free speech protections by citing violations of the Communications Decency Act.

Most damaging is the loss of privacy and failure to protect personal data.

“Most Americans are unaware of just how much personal data is collected and transmitted by the services and devices we depend on daily,” said Sen. Dianne Feinstein Dianne Emiel FeinsteinSenate Democrats call on Biden to restore oversight of semiautomatic and sniper rifle exports Overnight Defense: Army moves to combat sexual crimes | Eight West Point cadets expelled | Democratic senators want to restrict F-35 sale to UAE A proposal to tackle congressional inside trading: Invest in the US MORE (D-Calif.) at the first meeting of a Senate Judiciary Committee tech taskforce last month. “And while the U.S. leads the world in online innovation, we lag many other countries in protecting consumers.”

The problem has only gotten worse.

198,Williams,Juan,thehill,"After interviewing professional, suburban women voters in swing states last week, the Associated Press reported the following:

The “continuing trend of women voting against Republicans could prove exceedingly difficult for [President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE] to overcome in his 2020 reelection bid.”

Why is this one trend such bad news for the Trump campaign?

ADVERTISEMENT

Trump’s win among white female voters in 2016 was critical. They helped him “eke out victories across the Rust Belt and take the White House,” the AP story explained.

But after interviews with mostly white women in the suburbs of Philadelphia, Detroit, Denver and Milwaukee, the reporters painted a damning picture of the current view of Trump among female voters:

“In more than three dozen interviews…nearly all [of the women] expressed dismay — or worse — at Trump’s racially polarizing insults and what was often described as un-presidential treatment of people.”

I was unaware of the AP story until pollsters involved with campaigns for both congressional Republicans and Democrats — and a political researcher — happened to mention it.

The political professionals brought it up to bolster an emerging belief that both major parties will have a woman on their 2020 presidential tickets.

Already Sens. Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth WarrenWorld passes 3 million coronavirus deaths Poll: 56 percent say wealth tax is part of solution to inequality Democratic senators call on Biden to support waiving vaccine patents MORE (D-Mass.) and Kamala Harris Kamala HarrisBiden, Harris commend Mondale in paving the way for female VP Overnight Energy: Treasury creates hub to fight climate change through finance | Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez introduce 'Green New Deal for Public Housing' | Harris: Americans able to 'breathe easier and sleep better' under Biden MORE (D-Calif.) are polling in the top tier of Democrats running for their party’s presidential nomination.

The presidential gender politics of 2020 get even more interesting when you factor in persistent rumors that the GOP ticket will also include a woman.

The theory goes that Trump might replace Vice President Pence as his running mate with former ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley Nikki HaleyThe Hill's 12:30 Report - Presented by Facebook - All US adults now eligible for COVID vaccines Parade of 2024 GOP hopefuls court House conservatives Oddsmakers say Harris, not Biden, most likely to win 2024 nomination, election MORE.

Andrew Stein, a Trump confidante in New York, floated the case for Haley taking over the number two slot on the GOP ticket in a June column in The Wall Street Journal.

""It's too late for Mr. Trump to revamp his political personality”, Stein wrote. “But with the 2016 election in the past, Nikki Haley on the ticket could tamp down the antipathy for Mr. Trump that seems to afflict so many moderate and Republican-leaning women. President Trump needs the prospect of a Vice President Haley to help recapture the White House.”

Why all the attention to white, suburban female voters?

Most voters in the last five presidential elections have been female, and most of them cast their ballots for the Democrat.

But in all five contests, a majority of white women voted for the Republican presidential candidate.

It is important to note that Trump’s win among white women “was the worst showing for a Republican among white women since 2000, when George W. Bush barely edged out Al Gore Albert (Al) Arnold GoreHow Democrats can defy the odds in 2022 The information superhighway must be accessible and affordable for all American Rescue Plan: Ending child poverty — let's make it permanent MORE,” according to The Washington Post.

And in the most recent national elections, white women have been trending away from Republicans.

Democrats won 41 seats to gain control of the House in the 2018 midterms. Exit polls from those midterm races found 59 percent of all women voted for the Democrat in their congressional races compared to just 40 percent of women who picked the Republican.

Among male voters in 2018, 51 percent voted Republican and 47 percent voted Democrat.

The recent midterms also saw a spike in the number of female voters.

In the 2014 midterms, only 43 percent of registered women voted. But in 2018 that percentage jumped to 55 percent of registered women.

And the power of those female voters choosing Democrats has made history. Currently, 17 of the 25 female senators are Democrats. In the House, 89 of the 102 women are Democrats.

When Trump defeated a woman to win the White House, he won 52 percent of white female voters. Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' Cuba readies for life without Castro Chelsea Clinton: Pics of Trump getting vaccinated would help him 'claim credit' MORE, the Democrat, won the majority of all female voters only by winning a disproportionate share of non-white women, including 69 percent of Latina women and 94 percent of black women.

“Fellow white women, I’m done with you,” wrote Sarah Ruiz-Grossman in The Huffington Post soon afterward, as she looked at the slim margin of victory that white female voters gave Trump in states such as Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

If Trump’s narrow advantage among white female voters is now disappearing, specifically in those swing states, his chance of winning in 2020 is declining.

ADVERTISEMENT

The AP’s reporters found “a warning light” for Trump in that even some suburban women who “gave Trump credit for the economy or backed his crackdown on immigration acknowledged they were troubled or uncomfortable lining up behind the president.""

That led the writers to conclude that at a minimum “since [the 2016 election] there are few signs Trump has expanded his support among women.""

Any objective analysis would tell us that Trump’s campaign is going to have a hard time celebrating the 100th anniversary of that “rash experiment.”

They were more than rumors.

On Sunday, Trump confirmed via Twitter that Coats is leaving his position on Aug. 15.

Officially, Coats is resigning — but no one really doubts that he has been pushed out by the president.

The president had already met with aides in late July to figure out a replacement, according to several news reports.

Coats fell out of favor with Trump for publicly confirming Russian interference in the 2016 election.

Now Coats is on the way out, just for doing his job. That has got to be frustrating.

But it is Coats's proposed replacement that takes this story beyond frustrating and straight to outrageous.

John Ratcliffe John Lee RatcliffeTrump alumni launch America First Policy Institute Sunday shows preview: Democrats eye two-part infrastructure push; Michigan coronavirus cases surge Former Trump officials eye bids for political office MORE (R-Texas) to fill the role. Ratcliffe is a pure political player.

He is a direct threat to the nonpartisan reputation of America’s intelligence agencies and to their ability to protect the country by producing unbiased, first-rate information.

He auditioned for the role last week, when he subjected Robert Mueller Robert (Bob) MuellerWhy a special counsel is guaranteed if Biden chooses Yates, Cuomo or Jones as AG Barr taps attorney investigating Russia probe origins as special counsel CNN's Toobin warns McCabe is in 'perilous condition' with emboldened Trump MORE to harsh questioning when the former special counsel appeared before Congress.

Ratcliffe absurdly accused Mueller of having failed to respect ""the bedrock principle of our justice system ... a presumption of innocence,"" when it came to Trump.

At the second of two hearings that day, Ratcliffe pumped conspiracy theories and innuendo into the congressional record, as he quizzed Mueller about the Steele dossier and the FISA warrant against former Trump aide Carter Page.

These are two red herrings that Trump allies have consistently used to try to discredit Mueller — and to downplay the threat from Russia.

Yes, that John Ratcliffe is now the nominee to be director of national intelligence.

It could have been even worse. Another name reported to have been in the mix was Rep.

This is the mudslinger who lied by saying he had evidence to support Trump’s claim that President Obama “wiretapped” Trump during the 2016 election.

Nunes’s claim to fame comes from his eagerness to promote Trump’s “deep state” and “witch hunt” narratives about the intelligence agencies. The goal is to undermine the credibility of their findings that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to help Trump win.

Ratcliffe and Nunes are enablers for Trump, allowing the White House to turn a blind eye to ongoing Russian interference.

Together, they and other allies of the president promoted baseless charges that Trump’s critics told lies that led to the U.S. counterintelligence probe into Russia’s ties to the Trump campaign.

Their goal remains distracting people from the reality that Russians repeatedly met with Trump aides and spent millions on social media to damage Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' Cuba readies for life without Castro Chelsea Clinton: Pics of Trump getting vaccinated would help him 'claim credit' MORE.

Instead of facing that ugly truth, Ratcliffe, Nunes and Trump continue to feed conspiracy theories to right-wing websites and conservative talk radio.

Nunes came to Congress in 2003 — a time when Republicans hurled words like “treason” and “unpatriotic” at anyone who dared to criticize then-President George W. Bush’s administration over the Iraq War and its handling of the war on terror.

But after election interference in 2016, 2018 and going into 2020, we are now in a 21st century cyberwar with Russia.

Should we be calling Nunes’s patriotism into question?

“The Russians are absolutely intent on trying to interfere with our elections,” FBI Director Christopher Wray testified to Congress the day before Mueller asserted that the Russian interference is ongoing.

“It wasn’t a single attempt,” Mueller told the House Judiciary Committee last week. “They’re doing it as we sit here.”

Wray emphasized that the U.S. has — even now — not done enough to deter Russian interference.

“To this day, Mr. Trump refuses to acknowledge the seriousness of Russian intervention, and the Republican-controlled Senate is unwilling to consider legislation for enhanced election security — maybe because doing either could be seen as an admission that the election was tainted,” the New York Times editorial board correctly pointed out.

“Conceding the obvious might seem like a small price to pay. But the president appears more concerned with nursing his ego than safeguarding American democracy — and that puts us all, Republicans, Democrats and independents, at risk.”

Let history record that a delusional president, concerned only with his own ego, and a traitorous Republican Congress, concerned only with their own reelections, chose to ignore Mueller.

Instead, Ratcliffe is the president's nominee to head national intelligence.

204,Williams,Juan,thehill,"If “identity politics” is a sprint into hateful, tribal and racial wars, then President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE is the champ.

Yet — and this is both mystifying and depressing to me — Trump fans never miss an opportunity to make excuses for him while accusing Democrats of playing “identity politics.”

After Trump’s explosive libel on four American citizens last week — telling a quartet of nonwhite congresswomen to “go back” home to “broken and crime-infested” countries — I marveled at how his supporters immediately joined hands to excuse the president’s leap into an ocean of identity politics.

ADVERTISEMENT

How can anyone make excuses when the president is tearing at the historic bond — “Out of Many, One” — that holds together our diverse nation?

But Trump loyalists are making so many excuses they look like contortionists as they try to escape the reality that his political brand is one giant, ugly exercise in identity politics. More specifically, white identity politics.

A USA Today/Ipsos poll taken last week indicated that 57 percent of Republicans agree with the president’s language about the four congresswomen. In fact, the poll showed a third “strongly” agree.

And a separate Reuters/Ipsos poll found Trump’s approval rating among Republican voters went up by 5 points in the days after he launched the racist broadside against the congresswomen.

How can that be?

The USA Today poll found 65 percent of Americans said telling minority Americans to “go back to where they came from” was racist. That included 85 percent of Democrats but also 45 percent of Republicans.

ADVERTISEMENT

Overall, 59 percent of Americans said the president’s tweet was “un-American.” Independent voters felt the same way, about 2-1 in opposition to the president’s words.

Those poll numbers are proof of strong, nationwide opposition to the tweet — even, to some extent, among members of Trump’s party.

But last week, his supporters’ willingness to look the other way on racial politics was on view in Congress.

Only four Republicans felt they could vote for a congressional resolution to condemn the president’s tweet as having “legitimized increased fear and hatred of new Americans and people of color.” They were swamped by the 187 Republicans who voted no.

One of the four dissenting Republicans was Rep. Will Hurd William Ballard HurdPence autobiography coming from Simon & Schuster Prince Harry joins Aspen Institute commission on misinformation Congress's latest hacking investigation should model its most recent MORE (Texas), the only black GOP member of the House. He called Trump’s tweet “racist,” “xenophobic” and “inaccurate.”

The House Republicans’ cowardly display was followed up by a North Carolina rally where the president said the four congresswomen “never have anything good to say, which is why I say, ‘If they don’t like it, let them leave.’ ”

He really went after Rep. Ilhan Omar Ilhan OmarBiden on refugee cap: 'We couldn't do two things at once' McCarthy: GOP not the party of 'nativist dog whistles' White House reverses course on refugee cap after Democratic eruption MORE (D-Minn.), falsely accusing her of supporting terrorists.

That prompted a chilling, mob-like chant of “Send her back!”

The next day, the president said he was “not happy” when he heard that chant.

But the crowd’s threatening shouts are directly tied to Trump’s “go back home” tweet.

Pelosi makes an important point. Trump’s use of ""identity politics"" is an ongoing story.

Recall that during the 2016 campaign, Trump questioned an American-born judge’s ability to be impartial in the Trump University fraud trial because of his Mexican heritage. Then-Speaker Paul Ryan Paul Davis RyanOn The Money: Senate confirms Gensler to lead SEC | Senate GOP to face off over earmarks next week | Top Republican on House tax panel to retire Trump faces test of power with early endorsements Lobbying world MORE (R-Wis.) called that smear the “textbook definition of a racist comment.”

Who could forget Trump saying there were “very fine people on both sides” when people stood against a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va.? Or his lament that the U.S. was accepting too many immigrants from “shithole countries” in Africa and the Caribbean instead of “more people from Norway”?

And when you hear Trump-inspired chants of “build the wall,” keep in mind that the majority of illegal immigrants to the U.S. do not cross the border illegally. They overstay visas.

There is also no forgetting the racist lie that former President Obama — the nation’s first black president — was illegally elected because he was not born in the United States.

Earlier this month, the president hosted alt-right internet provocateurs — some with ties to white nationalist groups, some with histories of racist comments — at the White House for a social media summit.

On CNN, Kris Kobach, the former Kansas secretary of state now running for the GOP nomination for Senate, could not say if he would support the president even if Trump declared himself to be racist.

At this point, it is hard to tell where the white nationalist movement ends and Trump’s racial politics begin.

It’s time to call out Trump supporters for what they are — people willing to excuse the inexcusable when it comes to his dangerous dives into identity politics.

We’ve got questions for you.

But before we begin, the most important questions are for House Republicans.

Why are you so upset about having Mr. Mueller here?

President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE says the Mueller report cleared him, so why don’t you want to hear from its author?

Are you worried that once the former special counsel says to your face that Russia twisted the 2016 presidential campaign in Trump’s favor, you’ll be forced to join Democrats in sounding the alarm?

After all, Trump has done nothing to stop Russia from screwing with the 2020 election.

By the way, can you believe the president recently said he’d have no problem doing it all again — taking damaging “information” on a future political opponent from a foreign country?

And did you see the president sharing a dismissive laugh about continued interference with the man responsible for damaging our last election, Russian President Vladimir Putin Vladimir Vladimirovich PutinThe Memo: Russia tensions rise with Navalny's life in balance How to defeat Vladimir Putin Russian fighter jet intercepts US, Norwegian patrol aircraft over Barents Sea: report MORE?

But back to Mueller’s upcoming testimony.

Initially scheduled for this Wednesday but now postponed for a week, it’s coming sooner or later.

Once the former special counsel repeats that Justice Department policy kept him from laying out federal criminal charges against a sitting president, will you agree that it is now up to Congress to hold the president responsible?

After all, we know of more than two dozen meetings between Trump campaign figures and Russians. Mueller detailed how the president tried to fire the special counsel and made several other efforts to derail the investigation.

Based on his May press conference, Mueller is almost certain to say he believes “the constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing.”

That “other” process is called impeachment.

And you all know that your fellow conservative, Rep. Justin Amash Justin AmashBiden: 'Prince Philip gladly dedicated himself to the people of the UK' Battle rages over vaccine passports Republicans eye primaries in impeachment vote MORE of Michigan, took the time to read the Mueller report. He concluded it was time to begin impeachment proceedings.

So, House Republicans: Are you willing to join a hard-right leader, a co-founder of the Freedom Caucus, and put love of country above fear of being bullied by Trump?

As far he is concerned, the whole Russia matter is “breathless conspiracy theorizing.” McConnell is in such a rush, he recently announced “case closed” because the special counsel did not indict Trump.

Former Speaker Paul Ryan Paul Davis RyanOn The Money: Senate confirms Gensler to lead SEC | Senate GOP to face off over earmarks next week | Top Republican on House tax panel to retire Trump faces test of power with early endorsements Lobbying world MORE (R-Wis.) was quoted last week as saying he quit Congress to “escape” from Trump. He said only party loyalty stopped him from wanting to “scold [Trump] all the time” because Trump “didn’t know anything about government.”

Will Mueller’s testimony compel Republicans still in Congress to come out of the closet and confirm that they, too, are troubled by the president’s conduct?

The sound of the special counsel’s voice — four or more hours of testimony — is sure to reach people who found his 400-page plus report too much to read.

Back in the days when television held power over public opinion, former White House counsel John Dean’s incriminating testimony helped change the narrative arc of the Watergate scandal in the 1970s.

So did then-Sen. Howard Baker’s (R-Tenn.) famous question: “What did the president know, and when did he know it?”

The same poll found 44 percent saying they “definitely” believe Russia interfered, while an additional 29 percent said Moscow “probably” did so.

Now, with a delay in Mueller’s testimony, there will be renewed pressure from the administration for Mueller to never testify. The Justice Department is already instructing some of Mueller’s top aides not to do so.

Of course, the decision on whether to testify is up to Mueller.

But does he want to defy a subpoena?

His initial report was panned by liberals for being overly cautious.

Does Mueller really want to add defiance of a subpoena to his legacy?

207,Williams,Juan,foxnews,"""White Hispanics,"" ""Creepy-Ass Crackers,"" ""Teenage Mammies,"" and ""Suspicious A--holes who always get away"" -- that is the vernacular of the George Zimmerman trial.

George Zimmerman faces life in jail as a jury considers second-degree murder charges against him for killing 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. But thanks to the media he is already sentenced to life in the American public's mind as a racist.

NBC edited a tape of Zimmerman’s call to police as he was following Martin to make him appear to be focused on Martin’s race.

The New York Times has referred to him in unique racial terms as a “white Hispanic."" The terminology was necessary to have the story fit into a well-worn news narrative throughout American history from the Scottsboro Boys to Emmett Till to Rodney King – the black victim of white racism. Hispanic people can be as racist as black or white people in a country with a deep history of racism. But, apparently for the Times, Zimmerman's whiteness was important. It fit their good versus evil tale of a white racist killing an innocent black man.

[pullquote]

In June, before the trial started, a CNN poll asked Americans if they believed the murder charges against Zimmerman were true or false. Without any courtroom testimony or evidence, but based on the racially charged media coverage, 62 percent of Americans said the charges were “probably true” or “definitely true.”

My bet is that poll would have different results today. The trial has failed to prove Zimmerman acted with a “depraved mind” – as required for a second-degree murder conviction – or even with a racist mind. He certainly killed Martin. And the jury may decide he is guilty of second-degree murder or manslaughter. But what we heard in the courtroom fits with an FBI report that found race was not a factor in Martin’s shooting death.

The strong public judgment of Zimmerman’s guilt in the poll reflected a racially weighted media telling of the story. Photos of a bloodied Zimmerman after the incident, Zimmerman’s claim of self-defense and the police decision not to charge Zimmerman all got a dismissive glance from the press and contributed to public assumptions about Zimmerman before the trial.

Liberal and conservative news TV and radio have played to the racial theme, too. The left, notably Rev. Al Sharpton, have made the case a crusade for racial justice. The right-wing media, especially talk radio, has responded by making Zimmerman a hero. In fact, Zimmerman’s lawyer, Mark O’Mara, created an online site that attracted more than $145,000 from people who somehow made Zimmerman into their champion, possibly their great white hero.

The national focus on race in this case hit a high point when Rachel Jeantel, a 19-year-old student, testified that she spoke with Martin just before he was killed. Jeantel, Martin’s friend, told the court that Martin complained that a “man was just watching him.” And Martin described this man, Jeantel said, as a “creepy, white, excuse my language, cracker --- creepy-ass cracker.”

Jeantel’s testimony set off a stupid debate, requiring total ignorance of slavery and legal segregation, about the equivalence of blacks using “cracker” to describe whites, versus whites using the word “nigger” to describe blacks.

And Jeantel’s physical appearance, as a dark, heavyset young woman, speaking with a Southern dialect as she gave the lawyers a lot of attitude with her curt answers, contributed to the racial view of the case.

She became the “teenage mammy,” in the words of a sociology professor quoted in the New York Times, caricatured for “not being smart and using these racial slurs and not being the best witness.”

And now the media, especially some conservative talk radio outlets, are fixated on the possibility of race riots if Zimmerman is acquitted. Meanwhile, Twitter and other social media sites are full of threats from angry black people to kill Zimmerman if he is not held accountable by a jury for killing Martin.

Martin, the 17-year-old, is dead. But he has not escaped the racial slander attached to this case. Zimmerman’s backers note that Martin had smoked marijuana – as if that is unusual among American teenagers. They seem delighted to find online messages in which he took on a rapper, street-thug persona and posed as a tough guy.

These are all caricatures of two real people caught in a tragedy.

Zimmerman should have listened to the 911 emergency dispatch operator who told him to stop following Martin.

Why did he have a gun if he was simply part of a neighborhood watch program?

He had no basis to suspect Martin of any crime. So why does he describe Martin as “suspicious” to police?

Why does he apparently lump Martin with people he describes as “these a--holes, they always get away.”

Why didn’t Martin just walk away from Zimmerman?

But Martin is dead. He can’t speak for himself and get beyond the box of racial stereotypes the media built for him.

Zimmerman is alive. He has chosen not to speak at his trial, and although the prosecution played an interview he did with Fox News' Sean Hannity, it is still no match for skipping an ideal chance to tell his story when everyone is listening in the courtroom and on television.

Now, no matter what the verdict, he is going to carry his box of racial stereotypes around until his death. His identity will always be as a want-to-be cop who trailed a black kid who was not doing anything wrong, got in a fight with him, pulled out a gun and killed him.

Ultimately, it is the job of the media to give straight, objective coverage of any story.

Whatever the final verdict on Zimmerman, the media is clearly guilty of playing on the most primitive racial divisions in our society to fuel racial animosity and boost ratings.

209,Williams,Juan,thehill,"For Democrats, it is a glimmer of hope to see Republicans on Capitol Hill publicly criticizing President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE.

This is happening after Trump’s apparent reversal of his ban on U.S. firms doing business with the Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE.

The turn-around on policy was so fast and so hypocritical that even Republicans who see political profit in blind loyalty to Trump could not keep a straight face.

ADVERTISEMENT

“If President Trump has in fact bargained away the recent restrictions on Huawei, then we will have to get those restrictions put back in place through legislation,” tweeted Sen. Marco Rubio Marco Antonio Rubio15 Senate Republicans pledge to oppose lifting earmark ban Parade of 2024 GOP hopefuls court House conservatives Hillicon Valley: Biden administration sanctions Russia for SolarWinds hack, election interference MORE (R-Fla.). “And it will pass with a large veto-proof majority.”

Lindsey Graham Lindsey Olin Graham'Real Housewives of the GOP' — Wannabe reality show narcissists commandeer the party Graham: 'I could not disagree more' with Trump support of troop withdrawal Wall Street spent .9B on campaigns, lobbying in 2020 election: study MORE (R-S.C.) seemed to back up Rubio’s threat to the president, saying “there will be a lot of pushback if this is a major concession.”

Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) also stood apart from Trump. He tweeted: “President Trump needs to…stay consistent in making sure [Huawei has] ZERO access to the US market.”

And then there is criticism from Trump Senate Republicans on the coming budget deal.

Trump is trying to sell Congressional Republicans on a one-year continuing resolution (CR) in order to avoid a debt default in September.

But GOP defense hawks say it cuts spending on the military too sharply, while the party’s fiscal conservatives say it does nothing to slow the incredible rise in the national debt.

“While some members of the administration have suggested a year-long CR as a viable path forward, this must be avoided,” 16 Republican Senators wrote in the letter to the administration. “Under these draconian conditions, the [Department of Defense] would be incapable of increasing readiness, recapitalizing our force, or rationalizing funding to align with the [National Defense Strategy].”

The Washington Post put it this way: “The brewing opposition from conservative Senate Republicans illustrates the tightrope confronting the administration, as the ultimate plan clearly needs buy-in from Democrats who control the House but must win over enough GOP votes to avert a rebellion from Trump’s own party.”

Between the backing-down on the Huawei ban and the questionable budget proposal, there are signs of a split — if not a coming civil war — between Trump and Senate Republicans.

In the House, there is also a sign of rebellion.

Last week, Rep. Justin Amash Justin AmashBiden: 'Prince Philip gladly dedicated himself to the people of the UK' Battle rages over vaccine passports Republicans eye primaries in impeachment vote MORE of Michigan, one of the founders of the far-right Freedom Caucus, quit the GOP, saying he had become “disenchanted with” and “frightened by” the partisan and divisive politics accelerated by Trump. Amash is now an independent — and he is calling for impeachment hearings on Trump.

“The Republican Party, I believed, stood for limited government, economic freedom and individual liberty — principles that had made the American Dream possible for my family,” Amash wrote in a Washington Post op-ed.

Trump immediately fired back:

“Great news for the Republican Party as one of the dumbest & most disloyal men in Congress is 'quitting' the Party,” the president tweeted. “No Collusion, No Obstruction! Knew he couldn't get the nomination to run again in the Great State of Michigan. Already being challenged for his seat. A total loser!""

What Amash is now saying publicly fits with what I’ve been hearing from Congressional Republicans in private. Trump is abandoning bedrock issues — balanced budgets, free trade and strong support for NATO — that formed the modern Republican Party.

In previous budget fights, Trump and Republicans found a way to reconcile, and that will likely be the case again.

But his incoherent handling of Huawei will be hard to paper over.

Remember, it was Trump who promised that starting a trade war with China would end quickly, with Beijing begging for deal.

And it was Trump who agreed Huawei was a threat because their tactics included passing U.S. technology to the Chinese military.

Trump’s reversal is being defended by his aides as a strategic move to get a trade deal with China. But he has yet to explain how a threat to national security became a bargaining chip.

Why make such a major concession with little to show for it?

The conventional wisdom in Washington has been that GOP elected officials will never turn on Trump for fear of being primaried by a pro-Trump candidate. Just ask former Rep. Mark Sanford Mark SanfordLobbying world 5 lawyers leave Trump impeachment team ahead of trial: reports South Carolina GOP votes to censure Rep. Rice over impeachment vote MORE (R-S.C.) about the price of challenging Trump.

Trump knows this, and uses it to keep the GOP in line.

But some now see his grip on the GOP loosening.

Trump’s “vacillating hyperbole on North Korea” and uncertain stand on Huawei has “managed to confuse allies as well as adversaries,” Bloomberg columnist Eli Lake wrote last week.

The dean of conservative columnists, George F. Will, who left the GOP in 2016, makes the case that the party under Trump has abandoned conservative principles.

“It’s become a cult ― it’s become a cult because of an absence of ideas, because they’ve jettisoned the ideas,” Will said about the GOP in an MSNBC interview promoting his new book, “The Conservative Sensibility.”

“For years, decades, all the 20th century almost, conservatives said, ‘We’re for free trade.’ Trump said, ‘By the way, you’re not anymore.’ And they said, ‘OK, we’re not for free trade anymore,’ or they pretend to be.”

For the first time, there is reason to think Republicans in Congress can see their aims as distinct from Trump’s targets.

Who can forget Trump talking about “some very fine people on both sides,” as protestors took a stand against white nationalists in Charlottesville?

And there is no other logical explanation besides race-baiting for Trump’s shameful insistence that the Central Park Five are guilty of rape even though they were exonerated decades ago.

So it is no surprise that a June poll from Hart Research Associates found 89 percent of black Democrats and 63 percent of black Republicans and independents disapprove of Trump as president.

But there is more to being black in 2019 than constant rage at Trump.

And that is where Rice’s voice enters the conversation, along with Biden saying he is willing to defend his record on civil rights.

One tragic consequence of Trump’s brand of racial politics is that it makes it hard for anyone to say the nation has made progress on race. And it is hard to explain that some progress came in the form of gradual change.

President Obama got a taste of this in 2016 when a Black Lives Matter leader refused to come to the White House to meet with him.

“I could not with any integrity, participate in such a sham that would only serve to legitimize the false narrative that the government is working to end police brutality and the institutional racism that fuels it,” explained Aislinn Pulley.

Obama later responded in a speech critical of the Black Lives Matter movement for just “yelling” at political leaders while refusing to talk and make deals “because that might compromise the purity of your position.”

“The value of social movements and activism is to get you at the table, get you in the room, and then to start trying to figure out how is this problem going to be solved,” he added.

Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' Cuba readies for life without Castro Chelsea Clinton: Pics of Trump getting vaccinated would help him 'claim credit' MORE had a similar experience in her 2016 campaign. She was hectored by some activists for her past support of tough crime legislation. They also wanted her to pledge to change “hearts and minds” to deal with racism.

“You can get lip service from as many white people as you can pack into Yankee Stadium and a million more like it, who are going to say, ‘We get it, we get it. We are going to be nicer,’” Secretary Clinton told Julius Jones, another Black Lives Matter activist. ""That’s not enough, at least in my book.""

“I don’t believe you change hearts. I believe you change laws, you change allocation of resources, you change the way systems operate,” Clinton added.

Now some young activists are making reparations for slavery a litmus test for Democrats seeking the presidency, even though a Fox News poll in April showed 61 percent of the nation opposed, including 68 percent of whites and 36 percent of non-whites.

Last month, Coleman Hughes, a student at Columbia University, was booed when he testified before the House Judiciary Committee that black Americans have less need for “another apology” in the form of reparations for slavery than for more practical solutions with broader support across racial lines. He called for better schools, better healthcare, and a less punishing criminal justice system.

And guess what — there is support for Hughes’s positions among black Americans.

ADVERTISEMENT

The Hart Research poll found less support for reparations (49 percent) than for raising the federal minimum wage (72 percent) and better job benefits (71 percent) to “improve economic conditions for the Black community…a great deal.”

Among 14 policy proposals listed in the poll, the one with the least support from black Americans for providing a “great deal” of help was reparations.

David Leonhardt, a New York Times columnist, saw the poll as a “reminder that black Americans, as a group, don’t have the same political opinions as the most liberal parts of the Democratic coalition. On many issues, black Americans are more moderate – or perhaps more pragmatic.”

Can those black voices be heard in the age of Trump?

The big audience that will see Warren at center stage creates a potential bonanza for her to drive her support even higher.

This comes on top of favorable profiles in The New Yorker and The New York Times.

Warren is now basically in a tie for second place with Sanders. As she is rising in polls, he is fading.

They are still far behind Biden. But he had a rough week.

Black support is at the heart of Biden’s candidacy, but he weakened his link with African-American voters by talking about his past working relationships with segregationists.

He appeared out of touch, unable to understand why younger Democrats, living with a bigot in the White House, might be upset to hear him bragging about his ability to work with a racist, the late Sen. James Eastland (D- Miss.).

Biden is opening the door wide for Warren.

Even President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE’s pollster, Tony Fabrizio, now predicts Warren “will be leading” the Democratic field by October.

What’s the bad news for Warren?

Voters tell pollsters they are not sure she can beat Trump.

Can she deal with his bullying, with being derided as “Pocahontas”?

Can she get angry and fire back?

Actually, Warren’s ascent in the polls is likely due to her ability to show authentic anger.

Here is Warren talking about the right to abortion, which has come under increasing attack from Republicans.

“I’ve lived in an America where abortions were illegal,” she said during an MSNBC town hall event earlier this month. “And understand this: Women still got abortions.”

Restrictions, she added, would mean that “women of means would still have access to abortions. Who won’t, will be poor women, will be working women, will be women who can’t afford to take off three days from work.”

Warren also has a label – “economic patriotism” — for her genuine anger at the way middle-class Americans struggle while Wall Street titans get richer.

“I believe in markets,” Warren told CBS News in March, “markets that work, markets that have a cop on the beat and have real rules and everybody follows them.”

Asked about people who label her a “socialist,” she shot back, “it’s just wrong.”

In her New Yorker profile, she said polls show “between sixty and seventy-five percent of America,” supports her plans to raise Social Security benefits, pay a higher minimum wage and cut student loan debt.

She told the magazine plainly: “The progressive agenda is America’s agenda…This is not only how we win Democrats…It’s how we win independents and some Republicans.”

In televised town hall meetings and in interviews, Warren is showing the same emotion — yes, anger — in talking about issues.

In 2014, I named Warren the “Senator of the Year” in this column because she acted on issues as well as talking about them.

That year she used her political star-power to force income inequality to the top of the national agenda. Sanders in the past even referred to Warren as his “favorite senator.”

And now, Warren has surpassed many of her progressive colleagues in Congress by proposing a “wealth tax” which would raise taxes on billionaires and levy a 2 percent tax on fortunes over $50 million and 3 percent over $1 billion.

216,Williams,Juan,thehill,"They say a picture is worth a thousand words.

So let’s take a look at the front page of newspapers after Democrats take the stage in Miami next week for two primary debates.

I’m telling you those pictures will bring me tears.

For the first time in my life, the field of presidential candidates for a major political party looks like America — a racially diverse country.

The GOP debate stage for their 2016 primaries featured one woman, one African American, one Indian American and two Hispanics. They were basically bookends for 12 white men who dominated that stage.

That shocking contrast on the debate stage is only a hint of the divide between the nation’s two big political parties going into the 2020 presidential race.

There’s a Grand Canyon between each party’s voters.

The Trump party suffers from a staggering lack of racial diversity and a dearth of young people. It also fares startlingly badly with educated people.

According to a report released this month by Public Opinion Strategies, based on NBC News–Wall Street Journal data, whites without college degrees now comprise an outright majority of all people who identify as Republicans.

In 2012, 48 percent of Republicans were non-college-educated whites. By 2018, with Trump as president, that figure had risen to 59 percent.

In 2012, 40 percent of Republicans were college-educated whites. In 2018, under Trump’s leadership, that number had fallen to just 29 percent.

In the 2018 midterms, Republicans lost white voters with a college education by 8 percentage points. They won among whites without a college education by 24 percentage points.

By the way, the report notes the current GOP is dominated by white men.

When Democrats won 40 House seats in the 2018 midterms, “women voted Democrat for Congress by a record margin and by a record gap compared to men.”

Republicans had a 4-point edge with men, but a 19-point deficit with women — a “net 23-point difference by gender,” as the report pointed out.

Once again, the gap comes down to white men without a college degree: 66 percent of them voted for the GOP in the 2018 midterms.

And then there is the age gap.

Last year, the Brookings Institution reported “the oldest Americans, those 50 and over, have consistently given Trump his highest approval ratings while young people aged 18-29 have consistently given him his lowest approval ratings.”

In fact, Quinnipiac University polling in May reported 70 percent disapproval for Trump among adults under the age of 35.

Only 8 percent of blacks, 28 percent of Hispanics and 27 percent of Asians identified as Republicans, according to a 2018 report from the Pew Research Center.

That means an overwhelming share of America’s racial minority voters are Democrats.

Recall that 2016 exit polls showed Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' Cuba readies for life without Castro Chelsea Clinton: Pics of Trump getting vaccinated would help him 'claim credit' MORE carrying nonwhite voters by a huge margin: 74 percent to Trump’s 21 percent. That’s likely to get worse for Trump next year.

The only middle ground left between the divided political parties is occupied by white men in swing states who voted for President Obama in 2012 and Trump in 2016.

“While diverse in many ways, Obama-to-Trump voters are more likely to be white, working-class and to live in the Midwest. Because they voted for Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaObama, Clinton reflect on Mondale's legacy Polls suggest House Democrats will buck midterm curse and add to their ranks Boehner: Mass shootings 'embarrassing our country' MORE in 2012 before supporting Trump in 2016, we can assume that their votes were not informed solely (or even strongly) by racial preference,” Johns Hopkins University Professor Stephen L. Morgan wrote for Bloomberg last week, based on research he recently conducted.

“On economic matters, Obama-to-Trump voters are centrists, except when it comes to free trade, which they view as a greater threat to jobs and wages than both Democratic and Republican party loyalists,” Morgan added.

Team Trump knows its only shot is to hold as many of those 6 million Obama-Trump voters as it can. That means speaking to their No. 1 issue — opposition to free trade.

In the Democratic field, the most outspoken opponent of free trade is Sanders.

“When people take a look at my record versus Vice President Biden's record, I helped lead the fight against NAFTA; he voted for NAFTA,” Sanders said on CNN in April. “I helped lead the fight against [trade agreements] with China; he voted for it. I strongly opposed the Trans-Pacific Partnership; he supported it.”

Warren, too, has called for a renegotiation of NAFTA, although she blasted Trump’s combative use of tariffs to start a trade war.

Look for Trump and the Democrats to continue to talk tough on trade to appeal to those white Obama-Trump voters in Wisconsin, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

If Trump can’t win the few middle-of-the road white men watching next week’s debates from the middle, he might be the last Republican president.

President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE recently tweeted that investigations into allegations of collusions with Russia were unfair “because I had nothing to do with Russia helping me to get elected.”

Uh, Mr. Trump, you’ve now admitted that Russia acted to put you in the White House?

ADVERTISEMENT

Of course, within hours Trump reverted to denying Russia helped him: “Russia did not get me elected,” he told reporters asking about the tweet.

Trump is afraid of the truth regarding Russia’s help because it opens the door for Americans to see him as an illegitimate president.

And if he admits he is in the White House by accident, then his campaign for reelection starts in a big hole. Voters will have to face the ugly reality that he is president only because Russia twisted the 2016 race.

By the way, there is no question that Russia worked to get him elected.

U.S. intelligence agencies stated unequivocally in January 2017 that Russia interfered for the express purpose of boosting Trump and defeating his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' Cuba readies for life without Castro Chelsea Clinton: Pics of Trump getting vaccinated would help him 'claim credit' MORE.

That truth is so frightening to Trump that last year, while standing next to Russian President Vladimir Putin Vladimir Vladimirovich PutinThe Memo: Russia tensions rise with Navalny's life in balance How to defeat Vladimir Putin Russian fighter jet intercepts US, Norwegian patrol aircraft over Barents Sea: report MORE, he said he believed Putin’s denials of interference and not the findings of America’s own intelligence agencies.

Even now, Trump persists in telling people at his rallies that the “deep state” is selling a “Russia hoax.”

Recall the final words from Mueller at his press conference last month, when he asked Americans to focus on the “central allegation of our indictments — that there were multiple, systemic efforts to interfere in our election. That allegation deserves the attention of every American.”

Mueller’s warning is chilling because the crime continues.

Incredibly, Kushner later told Axios that he is not sure that he would alert the FBI if he received an email, similar to one he received in 2016, suggesting that Russia was willing to help a future Trump campaign:

“It’s hard to do hypotheticals,” he said.

Say what?

Americans can see through the Trump team’s attitude.

A Monmouth University poll taken last month found 60 percent of Americans think the government is not doing enough to stop Russian interference.

The press, members of Congress and the American people need to ask themselves which is more important: protecting the president’s fragile ego or protecting the integrity of democratic elections?

Whatever your answer, there is no way to save the Trump presidency from being tainted by the cloud of illegitimacy.

He will be Viewer Number One for this month’s first Democratic primary debates.

He might as well be onstage.

ADVERTISEMENT

Trump will be tweeting his insults and offering demeaning nicknames for all the Democrats who want to take him on in next year’s general election.

The moderators might even ask questions based on his live, running commentary.

Trump’s goal during the split night debate — June 26 and 27 — will be to tar potential opponents in their first moment in the national spotlight. He needs to make all the Democrats appear less appealing to voters than the prospect of another four years of Trump.

He has no choice.

A majority of Americans disapprove of his performance in the White House. And already a majority of likely voters tell pollsters they will not vote to reelect him.

So Trump will be multitasking those two nights: He has to deflate any future opponent and look for lines of attack he might use in the general election.

One note of caution, Mr. President.

Any candidate you try to skewer could benefit from the attention, especially if they have a strong comeback that shows they have the skills to trade punches with you.

The number one issue for Democratic voters is finding a candidate with the ability to defeat you.

That means they will prize a general election candidate who will not let your schoolyard bully-boy tactics and crude comments win the day.

Do you remember how you walked behind Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' Cuba readies for life without Castro Chelsea Clinton: Pics of Trump getting vaccinated would help him 'claim credit' MORE in threatening fashion during a 2016 debate without being told to sit down?

Clinton let you get away with that and Democrats don’t want to see it again. So, knowing that the candidates are preparing to counter-punch, you can’t let your guard down. What comes back at you could be devastating.

I’ve moderated a few presidential primary debates and the best performances are all about a good offense. That means the Democrats will be all about attack, attack, attack.

With each candidate expecting no more than ten minutes of talk time, they have to aim at the biggest targets — topics familiar to viewers such as the GOP’s assault on abortion rights.

So, here, Mr. President is your game plan for the debates.

First, every candidate is going to have to take a stand on former Special Counsel Robert Mueller Robert (Bob) MuellerWhy a special counsel is guaranteed if Biden chooses Yates, Cuomo or Jones as AG Barr taps attorney investigating Russia probe origins as special counsel CNN's Toobin warns McCabe is in 'perilous condition' with emboldened Trump MORE’s report and calls for the House to impeach you.

Since most Democratic voters want you impeached, your response has to be designed to please people who don’t identify as Democrats — the roughly 40 percent of voters who approve of you. You have a different audience than the Democrats.

Also on the Democrats’ list of attacks against you will be your tax breaks for the rich and the higher prices Americans are paying due to tariffs.

The candidates will have a lot to say about Mueller’s finding that he could not exonerate you on suspicions of obstruction of justice. Also, expect them to be asked if they agree with his conclusion that there is insufficient evidence of conspiracy between your 2016 campaign and the Russians to justify any charges.

Your corrupt indifference to Russian interference in the 2016 race and failure to take the lead on preventing a recurrence in 2020 are also certain to come up. Again, Mr. President, play to your base, not the Democrats on the stage or in their audience.

Now for the second level of attacks — the intramural fight among Democrats that will begin with attacks on the front-runner, Joe Biden Joe BidenObama, Clinton reflect on Mondale's legacy Biden, Harris commend Mondale in paving the way for female VP Mondale in last message to staff: 'Joe in the White House certainly helps' MORE.

The former vice president is popular among moderate, older, black and Latino Democrats who see him as the candidate most likely to defeat you.

From the more left-wing candidates, Biden can expect critiques of his support for putting more people in jail as part of criminal justice reforms in the 1990s — a stance that turned out to disproportionately hurt minorities.

ADVERTISEMENT

Since you apparently agree with polls showing Biden is the biggest threat to you, Mr. President, you have to join the critics. But be careful to avoid unintentionally elevating a non-Biden candidate in the eyes of moderate Democrats and independent voters.

Finally, expect attacks on Sen. Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersOvernight Energy: Treasury creates hub to fight climate change through finance | Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez introduce 'Green New Deal for Public Housing' | Don't attack Zoom for its Bernie Sanders federal tax bill Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez introduce 'Green New Deal for Public Housing' MORE (I-Vt.). He is second to Biden in most polls, with strong support from the left wing of the party and younger Democrats.

His rivals will insist he is an easy target for your charge that Democrats are “socialists.” But keep in mind, Mr. President, that Sanders’s populist anger at income inequality has a lot of appeal to what you call the “forgotten men and women,"" your base.

That means first-term Sen. Kamala Harris Kamala HarrisBiden, Harris commend Mondale in paving the way for female VP Overnight Energy: Treasury creates hub to fight climate change through finance | Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez introduce 'Green New Deal for Public Housing' | Harris: Americans able to 'breathe easier and sleep better' under Biden MORE (D-Calif.), South Bend, Ind.

222,Williams,Juan,thehill,"We all know that abortion politics is scary powerful.

But to see it up close is to see the dark heart of extremism in American politics.

That truth hit me like a revelation nearly 30 years ago, as I reported on the confirmation hearings for Clarence Thomas Clarence ThomasAmy Coney Barrett receives million advance for book deal: report We need a Herbert Hoover to reel in Big Tech Trump-era grievances could get second life at Supreme Court MORE’s nomination to the Supreme Court.

ADVERTISEMENT

At first, Thomas had the support of some civil rights groups who saw him as the best possible nominee from a Republican president, George H. W. Bush.

But the civil rights groups did not realize that their liberal allies, especially the women’s groups, saw Thomas as the fifth vote on the court to end legal abortion by overturning Roe v. Wade.

Quickly, the civil rights groups backed off Thomas.

Then came the explosive hearings featuring Anita Hill Anita Faye HillJoe Biden's surprising presidency Gloria Steinem: 'International Women's Day means we are still in trouble' 'Lucky': Kerry Washington got a last-minute switch in DNC lineup MORE’s grave charges of sexual harassment against Thomas.

But as I reported the story, I found that hidden hands pulling the strings from every direction belonged to culture warriors with daggers drawn over the future of abortion rights.

Twenty-eight years later, the fight goes on.

And Thomas is still at its center.

The Supreme Court’s 1973 ruling to legalize abortion is one of the “most notoriously incorrect decisions,” Thomas wrote in February.

And two weeks ago, Thomas was at it again. He wrote it is wrong to uphold prior Supreme Court decisions as “an inexorable command,” because he argued the earlier interpretation may not have been faithful to the original intent of the Constitution.

Thomas’s reasoning “can only cause one to wonder which cases the Court will overrule next,” wrote Justice Stephen BreyerStephen BreyerDemocratic Rep. Mondaire Jones calls on Breyer to retire Pelosi says she won't bring bill to expand Supreme Court to the floor Conservatives slam ties between liberal groups, White House MORE, explaining that in the case being reversed, the earlier ruling was “well-reasoned,” and had “caused no serious practical problems in the four decades since we decided it.”

Breyer’s words set off alarms. Is Thomas preparing to lead the court’s conservative majority in a vote to overturn the 1973 court ruling legalizing abortion?

The court has already limited abortion rights by approving a federal government ban on abortion in the final stage of pregnancy in 2007 and later allowing protests near abortion clinics in 2014.

Now the state of Alabama is trying to get the high court to take an abortion case that opens the door to fully overturn Roe.

The Alabama law, passed this month, bans abortion even in cases of rape and incest. “This bill is about challenging Roe v. Wade,” admitted Terri Collins, a Republican state representative and the bill’s sponsor.

The Alabama law comes on the heels of a Missouri law which bans all abortions after eight weeks, again with no exceptions. Similar measures have been signed into law by GOP governors in Ohio and Georgia. The governors of Louisiana and South Carolina say they plan on enacting similar abortion restrictions.

This wave of extreme opposition to abortion started with President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE's success in placing two very conservative judges on the high court.

Earlier this year, Trump reportedly told top Republicans he is ""saving"" Judge Amy Coney Barrett, one of the most virulent, outspoken opponents of abortion rights on the federal bench today, for his next nominee to the court.

Before he became a presidential candidate, Trump was pro-choice, to the point of saying he would not ban so-called ‘partial birth’ abortion. He gave money to Democratic politicians who support abortion rights.

When he became a GOP presidential candidate, Trump jettisoned his pro-choice position, falsely accusing Democrats of wanting to ""rip"" babies from their mothers’ wombs, ""put them in a blanket,"" and decide whether to ""execute"" them.

This emotionally-charged rhetoric serves to stir Trump's evangelical base.

Trump is betting that evangelical extremism on abortion will override his failure to deliver on better trade deals and his failure to build a wall on the southern border.

That extremist passion, however, creates the danger of a political backlash.

ADVERTISEMENT

A CBS News poll taken this month found that 44 percent of Americans said abortion should be ""generally available,"" 34 percent said it should be ""available under stricter limits,"" and just 20 percent said it should ""not be permitted."" The same poll found 67 percent of Americans want Roe vs. Wade to be kept as law.

“Trump has elevated a position that is clearly and strongly opposed by most Americans,” Leana Wen, the president of Planned Parenthood, wrote in The Washington Post.

She cited a poll last year by The Wall Street Journal and NBC News that found “71 percent of Americans think Roe v. Wade should not be overturned, including 52 percent of Republicans; that’s the highest level of support for Roe in that poll’s history, dating to 2005.”

To avoid losing those female voters, Trump, top Republicans in Washington and even evangelical TV host Pat Robertson are saying the Alabama law “went too far.”

""I believe in exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother, and that’s what I’ve voted on,” House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy Kevin McCarthyWhite House readies for Chauvin verdict McCarthy to introduce resolution to censure Waters House GOP's McClain responds to Pelosi calling her 'that woman' MORE (R-Calif.) told reporters this month when announcing his opposition to the Alabama law.

This amounts to disingenuous doublespeak. It is a smokescreen behind which abortion extremists continue to distort the abortion debate and twist the judicial system.



This is a culture war without end, with Justice Thomas in the eye of the storm.

“They’re not even really ideas — just a series of bizarre rants, personal feuds, and outright lies,” the former secretary of State warned.

Well, it has been almost two-and-a-half years since Trump became president. Was Clinton right?

Let’s go to the judge’s scorecards and see how the world’s top military and economic superpower, the USA, is doing with Trump in charge of foreign affairs.

China: Trump started and then escalated a trade war with our largest single trading partner. The result has been economic pain for American businesses — particularly farmers and manufacturers. They have lost sales and jobs. Tariffs are essentially taxes and always get passed on to consumers, leading to higher prices for Americans.

Last week, as trade talks stalled again, Trump threatened more tariffs on Chinese goods, prompting threats of retaliation from Beijing.

Trump can sign a bad deal and claim victory for his 2020 political campaign.

But let’s be clear — so far, Trump is losing the trade war he started with China.

North Korea: Despite the summit between the two leaders last June, when Trump said he “fell in love” with Kim Jong Un Kim Jong UnExclusive: GOP senators seek FBI investigation into Biden Pentagon nominee On North Korea, Biden should borrow from Trump's Singapore declaration North Korea drops out of Tokyo Olympics MORE, North Korea has done nothing to halt its nuclear program.

In fact, just last week, North Korea tested a new short-range missile. Again despite more than two years of threats of “fire and fury,” and insults about “Rocket Man,” the reality is that the North Koreans are closer than ever to putting a nuclear weapon on a missile and threatening South Korea and Japan.

Israel-Palestine: Trump has given Benjamin Netanyahu Benjamin (Bibi) NetanyahuMORE’s Israeli government everything it wanted — and gotten close to nothing in return.

He helped Netanyahu win reelection as prime minister last month with provocative actions, including moving the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and giving official recognition to Israel’s annexation of the Golan Heights.

These moves reversed decades of U.S. policy. Now rockets are being fired at Israel. And even allies in the Arab world speak of being alienated from the U.S. and Israel.

Iran: Early in his administration, Trump gleefully tore up the Iran nuclear agreement. While forfeiting the best tool to keep Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, Trump also alienated leading nations who remained in the deal.

Last week, Trump further inflamed tensions with Tehran by imposing new sanctions.

Venezuela: Trump and Bolton seem hell-bent on moving the U.S. closer to military intervention in Venezuela. They seem oblivious to the long, tragic history of U.S. interventionism in South America. They continue to throw matches on another global tinderbox.

Let’s finish back at home with a look at how Americans see Trump’s handling of foreign policy.

A CNN poll published earlier this month found 52 percent of Americans disapproved of Trump’s handling of foreign affairs and only 42 percent approved.

The State Department remains hampered by hundreds of vacancies for diplomatic positions. The vacancies are undermining a host of U.S. foreign policy projects, according to a Government Accountability Office report, endangering the security of diplomats and killing morale at the State Department.

Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, noted a pattern in Trump’s handling of foreign policy:

“Mr. Trump inherits a challenge or a problem of some sort, whether it's with China or North Korea or many other parts of the world,” Haass said in a December 2018 interview with NPR.

“What he does is he takes a very confrontational stance, triggers something of a crisis. Then he backs down from the crisis in large part he created. And then he tends to claim victory, somewhat overselling what exactly he accomplished.”

Haass is right but there are real consequences for Trump’s pattern of creating “something of a crisis” as the basis for foreign policy. It makes the world less stable, emboldens our enemies and alienates our friends.

On foreign policy, Trump reminds me of Winston Churchill’s description of John Foster Dulles — “the bull who carries around his own china shop.”

Objective reality tells us that Trump has made each of the global hot spots worse not better.

But in the minds of Trump loyalists, Trump pays no price for his failure. He just says the U.S. is winning the trade war with China. He claims Palestinians are more likely to do a peace deal with Israel. He promises the U.S. will be greeted as liberators by the Venezuelans.

My first reaction to the stories was to think they marked a sad end to the first presidential campaign by an openly gay man. Buttigieg, the Democratic mayor of South Bend, Ind., has been creating a stir since entering the 2020 presidential race.

Within hours, the ‘assault’ story was revealed to be a sick hoax perpetrated by two of President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE’s supporters.

The Daily Beast tied the scam to Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman, whom reporter Sam Stein described as “two of the most notorious smear merchants in politics.”

Stein reported that Wohl had been attempting to find gay Republicans who would levy false accusations against Buttigieg.

You may remember the 21-year-old Wohl as the alt-right provocateur who was banned from Twitter for promoting other hoaxes. He claimed evidence of sexual misconduct by Special Counsel Robert Mueller Robert (Bob) MuellerWhy a special counsel is guaranteed if Biden chooses Yates, Cuomo or Jones as AG Barr taps attorney investigating Russia probe origins as special counsel CNN's Toobin warns McCabe is in 'perilous condition' with emboldened Trump MORE; he started online rumors that Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was dead; and he said Sen.

Wohl bragged to a reporter earlier this year that for one of his made-up stories, “the believability stuck at about 15 to 18 percent by my measurement…not a bad campaign.”

The Mayor Pete hoax came as another social media hoax gained traction on Twitter. The #CharlottesvilleHoax pushed the lame argument that Trump was taken out of context when he said “very fine people” were on both sides of the violence sparked by Neo-Nazis and white supremacists in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017.

The Charlottesville-Truthers say that Trump was talking only about people who wanted to see Confederate statues preserved for history.

The idea that “fine people” march with Tiki-torch carrying Neo-Nazis chanting “Jews will not replace us!” is ludicrous, as Vice President Biden pointed out in his 2020 announcement video.

The emergence of the Charlottesville-Truther movement and the attempted smear on Buttigieg amount to a ‘Canary in the Coalmine,’ moment for American politics going into the 2020 race for president.

Christopher Wray, the FBI director, said in late April that Russia’s success in using the internet’s social media sites to promote distrust in government, and spread racial and religious divisions, is now a model for other countries who see a benefit in interfering in the 2020 race.

Russia, China and Iran are “going to keep adapting and upping their game,” Wray explained to the Council on Foreign Relations, adding that propaganda coming from trolls continues “pretty much unabated.”

The ugly online attack on Buttigieg came two days after a white nationalist teenager used an anonymous website, 8Chan, to declare his hatred of Jews before allegedly killing one and injuring three people at a San Diego synagogue.

“Every Jew is responsible for the meticulously planned genocide of the European race,” John Earnest reportedly wrote. “[Latinos] and [Blacks] are useful puppets for the Jew in terms of replacing Whites.”

The best hope in the fight against the rising online wave of anti-Semitism and racial poison is polling showing Americans souring on social media.

An NBC News//Wall Street Journal poll published last month found the following:

— 61 percent of Americans say social media “spreads unfair attacks and rumors against public figures and corporations.”

— 55 percent say social media “spreads lies and falsehoods.”

“If America was giving social media a Yelp review, a majority would give it zero stars,” said Micah Roberts, one of the pollsters who conducted the survey.

Absent action from the Trump administration, the question is whether this increased public skepticism will limit the power of social media platforms to distort political news.

The public concern evident in the polls led Facebook and Instagram last week to ban extremists such as Alex Jones and Infowars.

The Atlantic reported last week that Josh Russell, an expert on radical extremist use of the internet, reported that “more than 30 white-nationalist pages flagged to Facebook and Instagram last month are still up.”

But will the Trump administration ever do anything to protect elections? The odds look bad.

She quipped, ""If you're going to let Russia get away with what they did and are still doing,"" why not ""have a great power contest and let's get the Chinese in on the side of somebody else.""

She is right. This whole thing is absurd. But it is also a cancer that can quickly spread deeper into the bones of American politics.

We can only hope that this disease is beat back as swiftly and decisively as the Mayor Pete hoax was last week.

230,Williams,Juan,thehill,"Do you recall this golden promise from Donald Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE during the 2016 campaign?

“We’re going to make America wealthy again,” he promised. “You have to be wealthy in order to be great.”

Well, Trump voters, how is that working out for you?

ADVERTISEMENT

After almost two-and-a-half years with Trump in the White House — including two years with Republican control of both houses of Congress — the middle class is getting squeezed to a pulp.

The rich got their Trump tax cut. GDP looks good. And the stock market is doing great for people with money to invest. But it is only the rich who get the big rewards in Trump’s economy.

What about the middle class?

Wages remain stagnant. Trump’s trade wars are hurting farmers. Coal mines keep closing. Teachers in several states have been on strike.

Housing prices are up; prescription drug prices and healthcare costs are up; gas prices are up and student debt is soaring.

This is the reality for the middle class.

Meanwhile, never forget that 83 percent of the benefits of Trump’s tax cut will in the long run go to the nation’s wealthiest 1 percent, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.

That adds up to a big fail on Trump’s promise to boost the middle class.

But get ready for Trump to sell the same stale promise of economic revival for the middle class in his 2020 campaign.

And why not? Trump’s handling of the economy and unemployment are his strongest selling points.

Fifty-one percent of Americans approve of how the billionaire is steering the economy, according to the Real Clear Politics (RCP) average of polls.

Keep in mind that Trump’s overall approval rating is stuck underwater at 43 percent, while 53 percent disapprove, according to RCP. But Americans give Trump a good grade on the economy.

That is why Trump uses the economy as his magic answer to every question.

“The stock market hit an all-time record high today and they’re actually talking impeachment?” he said in a tweet last week. “Will I ever be given credit for anything[?]”

Do people who watch the markets agree with Trump?

Not Rick Newman of Yahoo Finance. He wrote in his column last week:

“If Trump deserves credit for a roaring stock market then Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaObama, Clinton reflect on Mondale's legacy Polls suggest House Democrats will buck midterm curse and add to their ranks Boehner: Mass shootings 'embarrassing our country' MORE, Bill Clinton William (Bill) Jefferson ClintonObama, Clinton reflect on Mondale's legacy Polls suggest House Democrats will buck midterm curse and add to their ranks Democratic Rep. Mondaire Jones calls on Breyer to retire MORE and Ronald Reagan do as well. In fact, all of them presided over more total highs in the S&P 500 than Trump so far.”

And there is more bad news for Trump in a Fox News poll released earlier this month.

It showed “a majority, 53 percent, believes GOP policies benefit the rich and powerful rather than everyday Americans (32 percent), while voters are more likely to see the Democratic Party as being for everyday Americans (40 percent) than the rich (34 percent).”

That’s why Jamie Dimon, the chairman and CEO of J.P. Morgan Chase, wrote in his April letter to shareholders that the American Dream is alive but “fraying for many.”

He explained that 40 percent “of American workers earn less than $15 an hour, and about 5 percent of full-time American workers earn the minimum wage or less, which is certainly not a living wage.”

Consider one more economic fact.

Last May, the Federal Reserve Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households found that 40 percent of American adults would not be able to afford a $400 unexpected expense without borrowing or selling something.

Trump’s failure to deal with the economic squeeze on the middle class gives Democrats a wide opening.

Income inequality is a hot political topic “now that we have the Trump tax cuts that are driving inequality even more,” Neera Tanden, head of the Center for American Progress, recently told The Washington Post.

The Democrat running for president with the best ideas for helping the middle class is Sen.

Last week, she unveiled an ambitious proposal to forgive $640 billion in student loan debt. Student loan debt is a key factor preventing millions of Americans — especially millennials — from making their way into the middle class.

According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, 44 million American borrowers collectively owe $1.5 trillion in student loan debt. Republicans immediately denounced Warren’s plan as unrealistic even though they have no plan of their own.

Warren is on the right track in reminding voters that Trump defaulted on his promise to help the middle class. But Democrats can expect Trump to point to low unemployment and label them “socialists.”

And economic policy, while important, can be boring — especially when it is competing head-to-head with Trump’s twitter feed.

So far, Trump’s distracting Twitter feed — with its attacks on the media and Democrats — is keeping his base voters comatose to the economic ills of the middle class.

What happens, though, if Trump’s base voters wake up to the real state of the American economy?

It will be the end of Trump.

In the last 25 years, public acceptance of gay people has changed so much that Buttigieg is on track to skip the Jackson-like struggle and go straight to Obama’s winner’s circle.

He currently trails only former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenObama, Clinton reflect on Mondale's legacy Biden, Harris commend Mondale in paving the way for female VP Mondale in last message to staff: 'Joe in the White House certainly helps' MORE and Sen.

And Buttigieg claims to have more than 65,000 donors to his campaign. That number qualifies him to be on the stage for the first Democratic primary debate.

Keep in mind that Buttigieg is not hiding his homosexuality as he rises in the polls.

He is openly gay and married to his husband.

What is really incredible about his political rise is that he already has people who condemn homosexuality on the defensive.

That includes Vice President Mike Pence Michael (Mike) Richard PenceSicknick had two strokes, died of natural causes after Capitol riot The Hill's 12:30 Report - Presented by Facebook - All US adults now eligible for COVID vaccines The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Facebook - All US adults can get vaccine; decision Friday on J&J vax MORE who opposes gay sex in the name of religious principle. As governor of Indiana, Pence backed a law to allow merchants to refuse to serve gays if they felt doing so violated the teachings of their faith.

Pence contends Buttigieg is trying to silence Christians who oppose homosexuality as a matter of their faith.

The vice president told a reporter that Buttigieg needs to “offer more to the American people than attacks on my Christian faith... I think Pete’s quarrel is with the First Amendment. All of us in this country have the right to our religious beliefs. I’m a Bible-believing Christian.”

Buttigieg’s answer is that he is a Christian, too, and a man who finds that his gay marriage “has moved me closer to God.”

Pence’s response is limited to saying he and his family ""have a view of marriage that’s informed by our faith,” as the vice president recently told CNBC. “But that doesn’t mean that we’re critical of anyone else who has a different point of view.”

Note that Pence is not damning homosexuality as Christian evangelicals once did freely.

Pence’s political supporters are also moving away from direct debate about homosexuality in the face of polls that show strong public support for gay rights, same-sex marriage and even a gay president.

A May 2018 Gallup poll found that 67 percent of Americans now support legal marriage among people of the same sex. That is a 40-point increase since Gallup first asked the question, just over 20 years ago, in 1996.

And an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll from March found 54 percent of Americans would be comfortable with a gay or lesbian presidential candidate. An added 14 percent said they would be “enthusiastic” about a gay candidate.

As a result of the rapid gain in public acceptance of gay life, Pence’s supporters are now arguing that the real issue is that Buttigieg “would be O.K. with using the government to persecute Christians,” for their beliefs, in the words of Erick Erickson, a conservative writer.

This is the current core of opposition to gay rights and Buttigieg is happily exposing it.

It will be four years next week since the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the landmark Obergefell vs. Hodges case where the justices found a constitutional right to gay marriage. Justice Anthony Kennedy was the decisive swing vote in that 5-4 decision. Kennedy has been replaced by the more conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh Brett Michael KavanaughBiden's court-packing theater could tame the Supreme Court's conservatives Trump knocks CNN for 'completely false' report Gaetz was denied meeting NY Times beclowns itself by normalizing court-packing 'to balance the conservative majority' MORE.

That means the future of gay marriage is still very much in danger.

The current debate reminds me of a joke.

“What’s the difference between being black and gay?

If you are black you don’t have to tell your mom.”

That joke was told to me in 1994 by a well-known Republican. President Clinton was about to sign “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” a policy allowing gays to serve in the military as long as they kept their homosexuality a secret.

My conservative political friend opposed having gays in the military.

He said it could divide the troops and distract them from fighting America’s enemies.

And he really resented hearing gay people claim that their movement for equal rights in the military was the same as the mid-20th Century fight for blacks to be treated as equals to whites in the military.

But Clinton signed the 1994 bill. And in 2011 gay people made more progress, gaining protection under law to be openly gay and free of discrimination in the military.

The times have changed.

Buttigieg officially launched his campaign only a week ago, but he is already a historic candidate.

Now, even if Buttigieg doesn’t win the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, the mayor has already won the future of Democratic politics – Obama-style.",-1,https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/439700-juan-williams-buttigieg-already-making-history

Nielsen, a career bureaucrat, rose to prominence when she accepted Trump’s offer to become Secretary of Homeland Security.

Last week Trump fired her even though she tortured the nation’s conscience as she tried to implement his cruel, zero-tolerance immigration policies.

That included separating immigrant children from their parents. Many of those children have yet to be reunited with their parents.

But it wasn’t enough. Trump wanted her to break the law and begin turning away people with legal asylum claims, according to several reports.

When she refused to break the law, Trump made her the scapegoat for his failed policies.

More families and children are now trying to cross the border in reaction to Trump’s constant threats, including his call to close the border. To repeat, Trump has made the situation worse.

Given this failure let me ask you:

Was Nielsen the person who told Americans that Mexico was going to pay for a wall on the border?

Did she send troops to the border after falsely saying that there was an “invasion” of terrorists, gang members and diseased people?

Did she shut down the government in a failed attempt to get the Congress to pay for the wall?

Of course, those futile gestures all belong to Trump.

But it is Nielsen who exited the public stage in disgrace.

Jeffrey Toobin of CNN summed up Nielsen’s soul-crushing experience as “a great example of what happens when you go to work for Donald Trump.”

“He is the great reputation killer. Here is this woman who was a reasonably admired bureaucrat. For the rest of her life people will look at her and think, 'Oh, that's the woman who put children in cages,'” explained Toobin.

You are the senior senator from South Carolina.

“I am waiting for Republican members of the Senate who served with [McCain] for years and allowed him to be the point of the spear on so many issues [to stand up for him],” said John Weaver, formerly a top adviser to McCain.

Last month McConnell (R-Ky.), the Senate majority leader, blocked a Senate vote on a House bill to expand early voting.

In that case — Democracy be damned — he was running from the GOP fear that more Democrats might vote.

Last week, McConnell ran past another flashing red light.

He went “nuclear” by ditching more than two centuries of U.S. Senate rules to reduce the time senators have to consider federal district court judges and other Trump administration nominees from 30 hours to two hours.

ADVERTISEMENT

He has also run over a century of Senate tradition by ending the “blue slip” practice of allowing senators to shut down nominations for the federal bench in their home state.

Tell us why, senator.

McConnell said Democrats are to blame for the fact that he is running over them because they are guilty of “unprecedented obstruction” of President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE’s judges and executive branch nominees.

Say what?

The fact is that the Senate has confirmed more judges for Trump during his first two years in the White House than any other president in more than 50 years.

McConnell has bragged about his success in getting 37 Trump nominees for the appellate courts confirmed in two years. That is far higher rate for confirmations than any previous president. In his entire 8 years in office President Obama got Senate confirmation for 55 appellate court judges.

But there’s another fact – McConnell’s hypocrisy.

It was McConnell who used the old rules to set a record for obstruction by blocking 79 of President Obama’s nominees in Obama’s first 5 years in the White House.

The highlight of McConnell’s history of obstructionism was the theft of a Supreme Court seat from Obama. For nearly a year he kept Merrick Garland Merrick GarlandGarland warns domestic terrorism 'still with us' on anniversary of Oklahoma City bombing Mazie Hirono: Asian American, Pacific Islander community 'feels under siege' amid rise in hate crimes ABC lands first one-on-one TV interview with Garland since confirmation MORE, the eminently qualified federal judge, off the high court by denying him a Senate hearing.

He wants to be known for all time as the Republican who packed the courts with young, right-wing extremists. To make that happen he has to stop Democrats from using his tactics.

Consider two judicial nominees: 37-year-old Allison Rushing Jones and 39-year-old Eric Murphy. Rushing-Jones has practiced law for only nine years and has tried only four cases to completion. Murphy made a career as solicitor general of Ohio by arguing against gay marriage and abortion rights.

But at 77-years old, McConnell is intent on building a monument to himself as the man who put the federal courts in the hands of ultra-conservative, Koch-backed, Federalist Society judges.

This is his run for glory.

So what if he is destroying the Senate tradition of proper advice and consent on presidential nominations?

So what if he is preventing the Democrats, the minority party, from having a fair say in the nomination process and maintaining public trust in the nation’s courts?

Under McConnell that trust in a Supreme Court that rises above partisan politics is dying fast.

Now frustrated Democrats, reacting to McConnell’s rank partisanship, are giving serious thought to blowing up the current 9-member composition of the Supreme Court.

“What if there were five justices selected by Democrats, five justices selected by Republicans, and those ten then picked five more justices independent of those who chose the first ten?” O’Rourke recently asked voters in an Iowa coffee shop.

I’ve twice name McConnell as this column’s Politician of the Year.

He is a smart man. He is a brilliant political tactician. He is certainly aware that he is abusing and destroying the Senate.

But in McConnell’s Machiavellian mind, the end always justifies the means. The end here is changing the federal judiciary to be more conservative for at least another generation.

During the 2016 Democratic National Convention, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg famously ridiculed Trump’s boasts about his own wealth.

“The richest thing about Donald Trump is his hypocrisy,” Bloomberg joked.

Well, after this week, Senator McConnell has given Trump a run for his money.

If hypocrisy were money, McConnell’s latest run has made him the richest man in Washington.

Here’s a tweet from Josh Holmes, McConnell’s former top aide. He opens in predictable Republican fashion by bashing Democrats for trying to expand ObamaCare but ends with a surprise for Trump.

“Dear GOP,” Holmes wrote, “When Democrats are setting themselves ablaze by advocating the destruction of American healthcare, try to resist the temptation of asking them to pass the kerosene.”

What about the cabinet?

Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Attorney General William Barr Bill BarrAmy Coney Barrett receives million advance for book deal: report Garland rescinds Trump-era memo curtailing consent decrees Boehner: Trump 'stepped all over their loyalty' by lying to followers MORE both told the White House not to do it, according to several reports.

And here is more dissent, this time from the conservatives at The Wall Street Journal’s editorial page.

Destroying ObamaCare without a replacement plan means angering millions of Americans who “now rely on the law for health insurance,” the paper editorialized.

As for the long-promised, fantastic replacement plan, the Journal wrote: “If there’s some new emerging GOP consensus, we haven’t heard about it.”

Okay, so even the people who have been making excuses for Trump are not looking the other way on this one.

Why?

The answer is that angering voters by destroying the ACA would be a political catastrophe.

Health care stands out as the top reason the GOP lost 41 seats and control of the House in the 2018 midterm elections.

According to the 2018 exit polls, 41 percent of voters identified health care as the most important issue to them. Fifty-seven percent of voters said Democrats are the better of the two parties at protecting people with pre-existing conditions.

And heading into the 2020 elections, healthcare remains a loser for the GOP.

A poll taken by the Kaiser Family Foundation in mid-March found that fifty percent of Americans had a favorable opinion of ObamaCare.

Every one of the Democrats running for president are celebrating the ACA’s protections for people with pre-existing conditions.

Several are promoting the idea of “Medicare for All” and “single-payer.” They know voters elected a class of freshman House Democrats who campaigned on these ideas.

An analysis of the television advertising in the 2018 campaign by Kantar Media confirms this political reality. It found advertising for Democratic congressional candidates mentioned healthcare one million times.

AdWeek’s Jason Lynch wrote after the midterms that healthcare-themed advertising “account(ed) for 49 percent of all Democrat ads overall and 59 percent of all Democratic ads for House races.”

ADVERTISEMENT

Meanwhile, 367,000 Republican advertisements — only one-third of the Democratic total — mentioned health care, according to the Kantar analysis. The Republicans preferred to focus on tax reform, immigration and low unemployment. That proved to be a loser for Republicans.

But the president is looking to stir his hardcore base for the 2020 campaign.

Attacking ObamaCare is a potential sop to the Ann Coulter faction of his base who correctly point out he has not lived up to his promise to build the wall — and have Mexico pay.

Will it work? Here is James Capretta, a health care expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, on CNN last week.

""The president, I don't think, really has any idea what he's really saying there,” Capretta said. “It's more of a promotional and marketing impulse on his part. It leaves Republicans open to…ridicule by the Democrats that they don't have a plan.""

But Trump is not convinced:

“We are going to have great healthcare. The Republican Party will be the party of great healthcare. You watch,” the president told Sean Hannity last week.

If this legal takedown works, Trump will take all the credit. But Republicans in Congress know they will take the blame for leaving millions without health insurance.



That’s why Trump’s tribe in Congress is not lining up on this one.

Well, President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE beat Clinton in North Carolina by 3.6 percentage points. And he failed, albeit narrowly, to crack 50 percent of all votes cast. In such close elections, votes that peel off to minor candidates can be crucial.

ADVERTISEMENT

It is true that Russian internet trolls backed Stein to drain support from Clinton and help Trump win, according to studies on Russian interference in the 2016 campaign. One popular Russian slogan was “Grow a Spine and Vote Jill Stein.”

But according to my pal in North Carolina, the Russians had nothing to do with her vote. Here is her explanation:

She voted for Sen. Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersOvernight Energy: Treasury creates hub to fight climate change through finance | Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez introduce 'Green New Deal for Public Housing' | Don't attack Zoom for its Bernie Sanders federal tax bill Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez introduce 'Green New Deal for Public Housing' MORE (I-Vt.) in the Democratic primary. Once he lost, she felt Clinton represented “establishment” politics. So she went with Stein.

That brings me to 2019.

Democrats are about three months away from their first debate among the 15 or so candidates for their 2020 nomination.

Last week, TV star Samantha Bee blasted the large field of Democrats in a monologue.

“There you have it! 16 candidates, 15 will lose while one, let’s be honest, will also probably lose and we’ll be stuck with this toilet monster for another four years,” Bee said referring to Trump. “So tonight, I’m announcing that I too am running…far away because this campaign is already exhausting and it makes me want to hide in a hole.”

Bee is giving voice to fears that a brutal, expensive primary will divide the party and give Trump a second term.

Bee is not alone in her anxiety over a potentially splintered Democratic Party.

The activist, intellectual base of the Democrats remains divided between “liberals and leftists,” Jonathan Chait wrote in New York Magazine last week.

“And leftists themselves are divided,” in Chait’s view, “between those who [see a difference between Democrats and Republicans] and those who see the Democratic Party as essentially corrupt, capitalist and generally unworthy of support.”

Similarly, Jared Bernstein, an economist who worked for Vice President Biden in the Obama administration, wrote last month that the large field of Democrats is risky.

His specific concern is having reporters and voters lose sight of the fact that Democrats of all stripes agree on the need for better health care, dealing with climate change and ending tax breaks for the rich.

“The most important insight about this dynamic, one that risks getting buried if the Democrats aren’t careful, is that you would need a high-powered electron microscope to see the difference among the Democrats, compared with the difference between them and the Republicans,” Bernstein wrote in The Washington Post.

And he pointed to the high level of unity among Democrats on the need to prevent four more years of Trump’s “culture of lies and corruption” in the White House.

All this worry about the coming free-for-all fight over the nomination comes at a bright political moment for Democrats.

Fifty-seven percent of voters say they definitely will not vote for Trump, according to a January poll by NPR-Marist. That includes 62 percent of independent voters who say they won’t give the president a second term. Trump beat Clinton among independents in 2016.

And even among self-identified Trump supporters only three-quarters say they definitely want him back in the Oval Office, according to the poll.

Meanwhile, FiveThirtyEight’s analysis of all credible polls showed Trump’s popularity rating underwater by more than 10 points as of Saturday. It indicated only 41.9 percent approve of how he is handling his job while 52.9 percent disapprove.

Then there is money.

On the first day of his announcement last month, Sanders raised $5.9 million from more than 220,000 donors.

Last week, former congressman Beto O’Rourke (D-Texas) hauled in $6.1 million from more than 128,000 donors.

Even more evidence of enthusiasm for the candidates can be seen in the high number of donors. Sen. Kamala Harris Kamala HarrisBiden, Harris commend Mondale in paving the way for female VP Overnight Energy: Treasury creates hub to fight climate change through finance | Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez introduce 'Green New Deal for Public Housing' | Harris: Americans able to 'breathe easier and sleep better' under Biden MORE (D-Calif.), for example, had 38,000 donors within 24 hours of launching her candidacy. Pete Buttigieg (D), a little-known Midwestern mayor, says he already has more than 65,000 donors.

Last fall’s midterm elections also provided good news. With Democrats controlling the House, they now have the power to investigate decades of Trump’s questionable business deals and ties to Russia.

And there is more good news.

An Emerson College poll published last week found that Biden, the Democrats’ frontrunner for the nomination, would trounce Trump by 10 percentage points if the election were held today. The same poll found Harris, Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth WarrenWorld passes 3 million coronavirus deaths Poll: 56 percent say wealth tax is part of solution to inequality Democratic senators call on Biden to support waiving vaccine patents MORE (D-Mass.) also beating Trump by narrower margins.

The Democrats just need to get out of their own way and keep in mind that incumbents, even Trump, have a built-in advantage with the White House as a stage for their every move.

The key for Democrats is to remember William F. Buckley Jr.’s rule for Republican primary voters.

Pick the most conservative (or in this case the most liberal) candidate who can win.

She is rejecting what the GOP did to President Clinton — impeachment with no plausible path to a Senate vote to remove him from office.

This means the key is Republican opinion.

Democrats are ready to go.

Sixty-six percent of Democrats told a Quinnipiac University poll released this month that Congress “should begin the process to impeach President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE.”

But among Republicans, only 6 percent said it is time for impeachment.

In fact, just 21 percent of Republicans believe special counsel Robert Mueller Robert (Bob) MuellerWhy a special counsel is guaranteed if Biden chooses Yates, Cuomo or Jones as AG Barr taps attorney investigating Russia probe origins as special counsel CNN's Toobin warns McCabe is in 'perilous condition' with emboldened Trump MORE’s investigation into possible conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia is legitimate, according to a December Quinnipiac poll.

That fits with an NPR/Marist poll, also from December, that found 71 percent of Republicans stand by the president’s claim that he is the victim of a “witch hunt.”

Now for a dose of reality.

That same poll found “a majority of independents and 4 in 5 Democrats see Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation as ‘fair.’”

That means all that stands between Trump and impeachment hearings is a thin but unbending reed of support from the declining number of Americans who identify as Republicans.

More than a few formerly loyal Republicans have departed as the GOP has become the Party of Trump.

The result is that Trump can point to support among the remaining Republicans as sky high, near 90 percent, and claim to be the most popular Republican in history.

This political distortion remains a stubborn reality even as Gallup’s most recent poll has Trump’s approval rating among all Americans dropping to only 39 percent.

Megan Brenan of Gallup wrote that “approval of Trump remains sharply polarized — 90 percent of Republicans, 33 percent of independents and 4 percent of Democrats currently approve.”

Even in the face of guilty pleas, convictions and evidence of repeated contacts between Russians and Trump campaign officials, the Trump media and his political supporters reflexively revert to giving blind support to the president.

Somehow they don’t see that Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort Paul John ManafortThere was Trump-Russia collusion — and Trump pardoned the colluder Treasury: Manafort associate passed 'sensitive' campaign data to Russian intelligence Hunter Biden blasts Trump in new book: 'A vile man with a vile mission' MORE, and his former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen Michael Dean CohenTrump Organization adds veteran criminal defense attorney Manhattan DA investigating Trump says he won't seek reelection John Dean: 'Only a matter of how many days' until Trump is indicted MORE, are on their way to jail.

They dismiss the reality that Cohen now describes Trump as a “racist,” a “con man,” and a “cheat.”

After that testimony, polls found more Americans believe Cohen than believe Trump.

But once again, Trump’s faithful stayed behind the president.

To get a clear picture of the current grip Trump has on what remains of the GOP, take another look at the Quinnipiac poll this month. Eighty-nine percent of Democrats said Trump “committed crimes before he became president.”

But 48 percent of Republicans say that is not true.

This is not just a political difference of opinion between Republicans and Democrats.

“Every other listed party, gender, education, age and racial group says by wide margins that Trump committed crimes,” Quinnipiac reported.

To tune into Trump’s defenders — online, on radio and on television — is to hear the president portrayed as a man hunted by a mob of Democrats, elites, ‘Deep State’ actors in the FBI and CIA, and even Republicans from Mueller to former FBI director James Comey James Brien ComeyShowtime developing limited series about Jan. 6 Capitol riot Wray says FBI not systemically racist John Durham's endgame: Don't expect criminal charges MORE and former Attorney General Jeff Sessions Jefferson (Jeff) Beauregard SessionsGarland rescinds Trump-era memo curtailing consent decrees Biden picks vocal Trump critics to lead immigration agencies The Hill's Morning Report - Biden assails 'epidemic' of gun violence amid SC, Texas shootings MORE.

Last week, however, some light made its way through Trump’s iron curtain.

He lost a slice of Republican support in the House and Senate as both chambers voted to disapprove of his declaration of a national emergency after Congress turned down his request for money to build a border wall.

Once again, the Trump echo chamber got busy attacking Republicans who voted their conscience, deriding them as weaklings.

So Pelosi has a point when she predicts that impeaching Trump would be “divisive to the country.”

Respectfully, Speaker Pelosi, the Constitution says Congress has a duty to impeach the president if it finds that he has committed “high crimes and misdemeanors.” There is no exception stating “unless it divides the country.”

And Pelosi can’t stop the approaching 2020 primaries.

Aided by the subpoena power of House Democrats, new information about the president’s business dealings, both foreign and domestic, is likely to raise eyebrows during the campaign, even among Trump’s myopic loyalists.

In addition, the GOP will also be defending 22 Senate seats to keep their majority in 2020. Do those 22 senators really want their careers to come down to a referendum on Trump?

Impeachment might not seem so divisive a short time from now.

241,Williams,Juan,thehill,"Here is the real story behind last week’s House vote to condemn anti-Semitism and all bigotry.

It begins with Christian evangelicals’ frustration at their failure to divide Jewish voters from Democrats and bring them to President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE.

After all, the president moved the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem against the advice of his own national security team.

ADVERTISEMENT

The president also pulled the U.S. out of the Iran deal, at the urging of hardline Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He did so despite the deal’s success at keeping Iran, Israel’s enemy, from developing nuclear weapons.

And don’t forget, Trump abandoned the longstanding, bipartisan U.S. policy calling for a two-state solution to bring peace between the Israelis and Palestinians.

The problem for American evangelicals is that, having pushed Trump to make those political moves, they see no jump in Jewish support for Trump.

At best, the president’s policies have helped him maintain support among white evangelical voters — 80 percent of whom voted for him in 2016 — despite credible allegations of extramarital affairs and pay-offs to a porn star and a Playboy model.

Evangelical leaders, from Pastor Robert Jeffress to Rev. Jerry Falwell Jr., seem less concerned with finding an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan than in asserting Jewish control of the region as a necessary precondition for their vision of the second coming of Jesus.

And they have no problem leaving a distorted impression that the only Americans supporting Israel are Trump Republicans.

On Friday, Trump put it succinctly: “The Democrats have become an anti-Israel party. They’ve become an anti-Jewish party, and that’s too bad.”

But as Paul Waldman, who is Jewish, wrote in the Washington Post last week: “In the U.S. today a ‘supporter of Israel’ is much more likely to be an evangelical Christian Republican than a Jew.”

That sounds crazy but Waldman is exactly right.

Seventy-five percent of American Jews disapprove of Trump, according to a poll done late last year by The Mellman Group. The low level of support is startling when polls also show 51 percent of Jews approve of his policies towards Israel.

In the 2016 presidential race, Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' Cuba readies for life without Castro Chelsea Clinton: Pics of Trump getting vaccinated would help him 'claim credit' MORE won the support of American Jews by 71 percent to Trump’s 23 percent, according to exit polls.

And last week the distance between American Jews and Trump was evident in a statement from a liberal Jewish group, J Street.

It said the “far greater threat to the Jewish community — to its security and its values — come from the surge of ethno-nationalism and racism that forces on the right, including President Trump, have unleashed here and across the globe.”

Sen. Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersOvernight Energy: Treasury creates hub to fight climate change through finance | Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez introduce 'Green New Deal for Public Housing' | Don't attack Zoom for its Bernie Sanders federal tax bill Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez introduce 'Green New Deal for Public Housing' MORE (I-Vt.), who is Jewish, said in a statement he is not buying the GOP effort to “equate anti-Semitism with legitimate criticism of the right wing, Netanyahu government in Israel.”

The GOP strategy is clearly to highlight Israel’s critics inside the Democratic Party in order to pull Jewish voters away from Democrats.

Rep. Ilhan Omar Ilhan OmarBiden on refugee cap: 'We couldn't do two things at once' McCarthy: GOP not the party of 'nativist dog whistles' White House reverses course on refugee cap after Democratic eruption MORE (D-Minn.), one of two Muslim women newly elected to Congress, created a perfect opening for the GOP with a series of offensive statements, such as when she said that as a new member of Congress she is being told “it is O.K. to push for allegiance to a foreign country” — a reference to Israel.

The suggestion that American Jews are primarily loyal to Israel even as they live as U.S. citizens left her vulnerable to charges of anti-Semitism. That slur of dual allegiance has a long history among anti-Semites.

Congressional Republicans were quick to pounce, calling her comments “vile” and demanding she be censured and ejected from the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

That led House Democrats to consider a resolution condemning Omar and anti-Semitism. But after Omar apologized, her name did not appear in the final version of the resolution, which condemned all bigotry.

I also believe there is a difference between criticism of policy or political leaders, and anti-Semitism.”

The resolution passed 407-23, with only Republicans voting against it. The Republicans wanted to signal their opposition to the failure to name Omar.

The Democrats’ success in holding a unified front in the face of the GOP attack does not alleviate the party’s need to offer its own ideas for peace in the Middle East.

That will be particularly important since many of the 2020 Democratic candidates lack a serious track record on foreign policy.

At the same time, it is important to see the Republican charges of anti-Semitism for what they are: a cynical ploy, aimed at reaping political advantage.

All three lies come from Jacob Wohl, a 21-year-old who had 186,000 Twitter followers until the social media platform banned him. He told USA Today last week that telling people the truth is “not the important part” of the messages he sends out to President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE’s base.

Focusing on the accuracy of news is outdated, he told reporter Gus Garcia-Roberts.

What’s important to Wohl, a Trump backer, is that the smear against Harris, for example, got into national political conversation. Some mainstream newspapers had to report it was false because, Wohl said, “the believability stuck at about 15 to 18 percent by my measurement…not a bad campaign.”

Wohl’s abuse of social media is in line with Trump’s use of a witches’ brew of outright lies and distortion to hold the support of at least one-third of Americans.

Do you recall that the nation was facing an invasion on the southern border, for example?

Don’t forget another element needed for a good brew of disinformation — several spoonfuls of attacks on journalists, such as the president’s recent tweet that the New York Times is a “true enemy of the people!”

Then throw in regular doses of resentment against elites in colleges and Hollywood. Don’t forget to include some racially-charged lies. In one recent Trump tweet, he made himself and his base victims of a black movie director: Spike Lee did a “racist hit on your president,” he insisted.

“My use of social media is not Presidential,” Trump once tweeted. “It’s MODERN DAY PRESIDENTIAL.”

For once, he was telling the truth. And that truth spells real trouble for the modern presidency and modern presidential elections.

“Trump unleashing digital juggernaut ahead of 2020,” The Hill reported last week.

The Trump 2020 reelection campaign has already spent more than $3.5 million on Facebook ads with more than 600 days to go before the election.

“Trump’s digital operation in 2016 was so successful he appointed the man widely credited with steering it, Brad Parscale, as his campaign manager for 2020,” according to The Hill.

And it is not just Trump and his campaign who are busy distorting reality on social media to distract and confuse voters.

Trump is getting a major assist from alt-right social media activists. Wohl, however, hit a roadblock after the USA Today story.

“Twitter has permanently suspended Jacob Wohl, a far-right activist who previously tried to fabricate evidence about special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, for creating fake accounts in an alleged attempt to manipulate the 2020 presidential election,” The Washington Post reported last week.

Social media companies like Twitter and Facebook are slowly putting these policies in place, the Post said, to “prohibit users from creating misleading accounts to influence conversations… [and] destabilize U.S. politics on social media during the presidential election four years earlier.”

But Wohl is no outlier.

There are hundreds of alt-right social media accounts that pump inflammatory, conspiratorial nonsense into our politics on a daily basis. They are aided by trolls, bots and all manner of digital malfeasance, especially by the Russians.

Last week, it was reported that U.S. Cyber Command disrupted a big push by Russian trolls on the day of the 2018 midterm elections.

And Trump’s base eats it up.

A Hill-HarrisX survey taken last month found that Trump still enjoys a 79 percent approval rating among the shrinking number of people who are self-described Republicans.

Trump’s support among independent voters has gone down after his government shutdown and dubious claim of a national emergency. It can't be helped by the failed summit with North Korea and damning public testimony from his former personal lawyer Michael Cohen, who called Trump a “racist… a conman. And he is a cheat.”

Overall, Trump retains a 44 percent approval rating (along with 53 percent disapproval) in the Real Clear Politics average of polls. Cohen, the president’s former lawyer, told the House Oversight Committee last week that he fears that if Trump loses the 2020 election “there will never be a peaceful transition of power.”

Similarly, Ted Koppel, the legendary newsman, recently wrote that if Trump is forced from office or defeated at the polls, there is no reason to think he “will become a quieter, humbler, more restrained presence on Twitter and Facebook than heretofore.”

Trump has succeeded in using social media to open a Pandora’s Box of racism, hatred, paranoia, conspiracy-mongering, and rejection of the legitimacy of major American institutions, from the courts to the CIA.

Closing that horror show will be tough because Trump has inspired imitators like Wohl.

It is no longer outside the realm of possibility that Trump could refuse to leave if he loses the 2020 election. And if he does not accept an election defeat — a scenario he threatened in 2016 — he will have a virtual army on social media to defend him.

Where does this stop?

The sight of a young Muslim congresswoman, wearing a hijab, holding a powerful 71-year-old white Republican accountable signals the dawn of a new day in American politics.

The heavily white, older male party of Trump is fighting to hold back what they see coming over the horizon.

Many people — including me — have been targets of President Trump’s Twitter tirades, but women of color provoke a special kind of Trump ire.

Trump last month dismissed Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Alexandria Ocasio-CortezOvernight Energy: Treasury creates hub to fight climate change through finance | Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez introduce 'Green New Deal for Public Housing' | White House defends 'aspirational' goal of 62,500 refugees Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez introduce 'Green New Deal for Public Housing' MORE (D-N.Y.) with a wave of the hand and a “who cares,” after she told CBS’s “60 Minutes” she has “no question” that Trump makes use of the “historic dog whistles of white supremacy.”

Trump has been even more dismissive of other women of color.

The Democrats’ success in the midterms set off these unsettling changes in American politics for Trump and his base.

The new House majority includes a record number of freshman Democratic congresswomen.

In fact, 43 women of color are now serving in the House. Only one non-white congresswoman is a Republican — Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler Jaime Lynn Herrera BeutlerRepublicans who backed Trump impeachment see fundraising boost Lawmakers urge Capitol Police release IG report on riot House Republicans who backed Trump impeachment warn Democrats on Iowa election challenge MORE, who was reelected in Washington state.

The record number includes 22 black women, 11 Latinas, six Asian-Pacific Islanders and the first two Native American women in Congress. It also brought to Congress the first two Muslim women: Omar and Rep. Rashida Tlaib Rashida Harbi TlaibCan policing be reformed? GOP believes Democrats handing them winning 2022 campaign McCarthy: GOP not the party of 'nativist dog whistles' MORE (D-Mich.).

Last month, Tlaib told an excited crowd of liberal activists: “We’re gonna impeach the motherf****r” – referring to Trump.

In that moment, she joined Ocasio-Cortez as a target of right-wing hate.

The New York Times reported last week that Republicans have “amped up” their efforts to demonize these young Democratic women.

The Times’ Sheryl Gay Stolberg wrote that Omar is being targeted for anti-Semitic language she used to criticize Israel’s treatment of Palestinians. Ocasio-Cortez is under attack as an extreme leftist for her focus on income inequality in her Green New Deal proposals.

“Democrats,” Stolberg reported, “see an insidious effort to use women and minorities, especially women of color, as the new symbols of the radical ‘other.’ And they are calling out Republicans as hypocrites, noting that Mr. Trump and other Republicans trafficked in anti-Semitic tropes and racist dog whistles long before anyone noticed Ms. Omar’s Twitter feed.”

The most frequent charge against the newcomers from Trump’s conservative talk radio fans is that these women of color are dividing the country with “identity politics.”

That drew a response from Stacey Abrams, the first black woman nominated by a major party to run for governor. She lost her 2018 race in Georgia.

ADVERTISEMENT

Writing in Foreign Affairs, Abrams pleaded guilty to having “intentionally and vigorously highlighted communities of color and other marginalized groups, not to the exclusion of others but as a recognition of their specific policy needs.”

She argued that an earlier essay, by conservative political scientist Francis Fukuyama, did not consider that “marginalized groups [are] finally overcoming centuries-long efforts,” to deny them access to the ballot box and keep them out of white, male-dominated politics.

Abrams concluded that new “noisy voices represent the strongest tool to manage the growing pains of multicultural coexistence. By embracing identity and its prickly, uncomfortable contours, Americans will become more likely to grow as one.”

Abrams did not mention Trump. But he regularly uses white identity politics to stir up his base.

It can be seen in his attack on Mexicans as rapists and his denigration of “shithole countries.” And who can forget Trump’s false and repeated insinuation that President Obama was not born in the United States? That racist conspiracy theory was the springboard for Trump’s presidential run.

What we see in Trump’s fear of women of color is resistance to the rapidly rising sun of racial change in our politics.

247,Williams,Juan,foxnews,"Editor's Note: This first appeared in The Hill.

An old proverb says a leader with no followers is “only taking a walk.”

If that’s the case, then the strutting President Trump has turned his presidency into a very lonely walk.

A Morning Consult poll released last week found Trump losing support in states he easily carried last year. He is down 23 points in Tennessee since his inauguration in January, down 21 points in Mississippi, down 20 in Kentucky, down 19 in Kansas and down 17 in Indiana.

Overall, 55 percent of the country disapproves of the job he is doing as president, according the most recent RealClearPolitics average. At the three-quarter mark of his first year in office, Trump is the least popular new president in history.

On Capitol Hill, House and Senate Republicans are also walking away from Trump.

A new Quinnipiac poll last week found that 49 percent of voters disapprove of the way Trump is handling taxes and just 37 percent approve.

In part, this is due to his attacks on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis.

Then there are the threats to incumbent Republicans from Stephen Bannon, formerly Trump’s chief strategist.

Bannon said last week he plans to challenge incumbent Republican senators in seven states, including Arizona’s Jeff Flake, Mississippi’s Roger Wicker, Nebraska’s Deb Fischer, Nevada’s Dean Heller and Wyoming’s John Barrasso.

“Creating a civil war inside the Republican Party may feel good, but I think as a strategy, it is stunningly stupid,” former Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., said of Bannon’s plan.

Speaking on Sean Hannity’s radio show, Gingrich stated the obvious: It would be better for the GOP if the president and his allies spent their time trying to beat incumbent Democratic senators.

Instead, Trump has whipped up a very public feud with Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, R-Tenn. Trump tweeted that Corker lacks “the guts” to seek reelection. Trump also belittled Corker as having “begged” for his endorsement.

Corker denied that, shooting back that it is a “shame the White House has become an adult day care center.” He added that Trump has hurt U.S. foreign relations with his impetuous tweets on world affairs, including “things that are not true.”

Rather than let it go, Trump responded by tweeting: “The Failing @nytimes set Liddle' Bob Corker up by recording his conversation. Was made to sound a fool, and that's what I am dealing with!”

Corker was not “set up” by the Times. A transcript showed the senator stating, “I understand we’re on the record.”

Now, commentators who are open to Trump are starting to walk away from his parade as well.

“Last time I checked, you are the president of the United States, so tweeting out these tacky insults just seems beneath you,” Neil Cavuto of Fox News said on his show last week. “You are running out of friends faster than you are running out of time. You might not like Bob Corker, but a lot of senators do, and you need those senators, sir.”

Even Trump’s personal friends are turning away from him.

Thomas Barrack told The Washington Post he was “shocked” and “stunned” by Trump’s recent comments.

“I tell him all the time: I don’t like the rhetoric,” said Barrack, who has been friends with Trump for decades, since they were both Manhattan real estate developers.

To win back some followers, Trump needs a win.

Polls show Americans favor tax reform. They want a simpler tax structure, fewer brackets and loopholes to be closed. Trump repeatedly promised to deliver tax reform during the campaign.

But once again he is strutting with no one behind him as he abandons tax reform. He is focused on tax cuts for the rich.

Polls show that is not popular.

The New York Times analysis of the tax cut plan concluded it would be a “huge windfall for the wealthiest Americans” and “not directly benefit the bottom third of the population.” Polls show Americans oppose tax cuts for the rich.

A new Quinnipiac poll last week found that 49 percent of voters disapprove of the way Trump is handling taxes and just 37 percent approve.

Trump has also failed to deliver on his campaign promise to build a southern border wall and have Mexico pay for it. He continues to say it will get done. But, again, polls show voters don’t want a wall.

Similarly, Trump seems unaware that a majority of Americans now approve of the Affordable Care Act, also known as ObamaCare, and want its problems fixed so it can continue.

Instead, having failed to win a full repeal of the health care law from the Republican majority in Congress, he signed an executive order allowing low-cost insurance to be sold across state lines.

That has been tried before and has a sad history of consumer fraud and regulatory confusion.

So it’s no wonder Trump now walks alone. He remains a celebrity figure for his hardcore base. But 10 months into his presidency, Republicans are starting to drift away as he fails to deliver on nearly every major campaign promise he made.

That’s not my opinion. That’s a demonstrable fact.

Last week, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported that a record 7 million Americans are three months or more behind on their car loan payments.

Last year, the Federal Reserve reported that 40 percent of Americans can’t cover an unexpected expense of $400.

Then there’s the pressure on families from student loans and credit card accounts.

In 2018, total student loan debt was $1.5 trillion and growing. And the credit card debt collectively owed by Americans in 2018 surpassed $1 trillion. An alarming number of accounts are delinquent. Maybe that’s why retail sales had a big drop in December.

Trump backers, also open your eyes to a new study from a University of California at Berkeley economist, Gabriel Zucman. It shows that the 400 richest Americans (.00025 percent of our population) now own more wealth than the 150 million poorest Americans (60 percent of the population).

So while President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE is pledging “America will never be a socialist country,” a lot of Americans are looking for any policy that will help them pay the bills in a time of stagnant wages and high income inequality.

Trump and McConnell have no ideas for dealing with income inequality. Their tax cut put more money in the pockets of the rich and corporations. That is not working for the middle-class.

Polls prove the point.

A recent poll by The Hill/HarrisX found 59 percent of Americans favor raising the top tax rate to 70 percent. A Fox News poll had similar results in January, with 70 percent of registered voters saying they agree with raising income taxes on people who make over $10 million.

The same concern is behind the 70 percent of Americans, in a Reuters poll from last August, who said they support “Medicare for All” – one of the proposals being labeled by the GOP as socialist.

Polls consistently show ‘socialist’ programs or policies — Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, the Veterans Administration and agriculture subsidies — enjoy strong support.

Trump Republicans are quick to point to Venezuela’s economic problems as damning proof of the failings of attempts at socialism.

But the truth is that nearly every first-world democratic country has programs that provide an economic safety net for their people — free health care and education, paid sick leave and vacation. These are the very same kinds of measures the GOP derides as socialist.

The Green New Deal proposal, recently introduced as a resolution — not actual legislation — is a starting point for Americans to begin honest dialogue about income inequality.

Somehow, such conversations did not take place for the last two years with Trump in the White House and Republican majorities in the House and Senate.

The Green New Deal resolution proposed by Democrats — Sen. Ed Markey Ed MarkeyThe Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Facebook - All US adults can get vaccine; decision Friday on J&J vax Democratic Rep. Mondaire Jones calls on Breyer to retire Democratic senators call on Biden to support waiving vaccine patents MORE (Mass.) and Rep.

It aims for a federal policy that would provide jobs with ""a family-sustaining wage, adequate family and medical leave, paid vacations, and retirement security to all people of the United States.""

This calls to mind ideas from the original New Deal.

In his 1944 State of the Union address President Franklin Roosevelt said it was the government’s job to guarantee:

“The right to a useful and remunerative job in the industries or shops or farms or mines of the nation; The right to earn enough to provide adequate food and clothing and recreation…; The right of every businessman, large and small, to trade in an atmosphere of freedom from unfair competition and domination by monopolies at home or abroad; The right of every family to a decent home; The right to adequate medical care and the opportunity to achieve and enjoy good health;”

Those ideas remain central to the American dream.

But 21st century income inequality has the average American living in economic fear and worried about political domination by plutocrats.

My Fox News colleague Tucker Carlson recently told his audience that America’s economic ruling class fails to see that “families are being crushed by market forces.”

I covered President Reagan for The Washington Post when the top tax rate was 50 percent. Under President Nixon, the uber-rich were taxed at a rate of 70 percent. And under President Eisenhower, the top rate was 91 percent.

All three presidents were Republicans, of course.

ADVERTISEMENT

The irony is that Trump now has the GOP steeped in nostalgia, yearning for bygone days and hoping to “Make America Great Again.”

A big part of the reason why life was better back then was a tax structure that guarded against rampant income inequality.

Ocasio-Cortez dismisses the charge that she is “radical” for addressing this issue.

“Abraham Lincoln made the radical decision to sign the Emancipation Proclamation,” Ocasio-Cortez told CBS’s “60 Minutes” last month. “Franklin Roosevelt made the radical decision to embark on establishing programs like Social Security. That is radical.”

She added: “Yeah, if that’s what radical means, call me a radical.”

Honestly, Trump fans, given the scope of the American family’s economic problems, the Green New Deal doesn’t seem radical enough.

I’m talking about President Obama.

Obama left office with a 59 percent approval rating and a 37 percent disapproval rating, according to Gallup.

In late January, the Gallup poll ratings for President Trump were the exact inverse of Obama’s numbers — 59 percent disapproval and 37 percent approval.

A July 2018 poll from the Pew Research Center found 31 percent of Americans rank Obama as the best president of their lifetimes. In fact, close to half of Americans, 44 percent, said Obama is either the best or the second-best president they’ve known.

As Democrats begin their campaign for the party’s 2020 nomination, Obama is the party’s unrivaled powerbroker.

He will be the biggest speaker at the party’s 2020 convention.

Her book, “Becoming,” has been the best-selling book in the country for the last three months. If she ran for her party’s nomination, it would be hard to stop her. Even the Trump-friendly Rasmussen poll shows her beating the current president in a general election.

And don’t forget, President Obama has his own book coming out on his time in the White House. It will likely be published in the heat of the 2020 campaign. He will have a huge national platform and every reason to finally drop all restraint and take on Trump.

Just seeing him again will boost Democrats. He provides a striking contrast to Trump’s era of alleged pay-offs to porn stars, chaos at the White House and allegations of collusion.

In a Democratic primary that will almost certainly have more than a dozen candidates, being anointed by Obama — if he makes an endorsement — will be rocket fuel for one lucky candidate.

How times change.

Obama was not always the far left’s hero.

They used to complain that the first black president so feared being defined as a black radical that he moderated liberal policies and muted his responses to GOP obstruction.

Now, with Trump as president, those same liberal voices are raised to defend Obama’s record.

Trump set them off by attacking Obama’s policies while taking credit for the results.

The strong economy and low unemployment rate?

They are largely a continuation of Obama’s successful economic policies, which brought the country back from the Great Recession.

As the Washington Post noted late last year, the economy “added more jobs in every year of Obama’s second term than it did in Trump’s first year.”

Going after ISIS and other Islamic terrorists?

Obama had degraded them with drones and special forces before Trump became president.

And what about Trump’s attack on ObamaCare, while failing to produce a better plan?

Congressional Democrats are in charge of the House of Representatives because they campaigned in the midterms as fans of ObamaCare and its protections for people with pre-existing conditions.

Every one of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates is defending the Affordable Care Act, while several call for “Medicare for All.”

It is hard to name a Democrat running for the nomination who is not part of the Obama legacy.

Former Vice President Biden is the leading candidate for the nomination because of his eight years as Obama’s deputy.

On one side is Trump’s appeal to fear and grievance — on immigration, for example. On the other side, the Democrats are returning to Obama’s hallmarks of hope and change — for example, creating a better health care system.

In his farewell address, Obama rolled out his party’s answer to Trump:

“If you are tired of arguing with strangers on the internet, try talking with one of them in real life,” Obama said. “If you are disappointed by your elected officials, grab a clipboard, get some signatures, and run for office yourself. Show up. Dive in. Stay at it.”

For every Democrat, the bottom line to winning the nomination is convincing fellow Democrats they know how to beat Trump.

But first they have to convince Obama.

And we know that when the Trump campaign was threatened by the release of the “Access Hollywood” tape in which the president boasted of grabbing women by the genitals, another barrage of emails was dumped, including documents stolen from Clinton’s campaign chairman.

Later, Trump Jr. exchanged messages with WikiLeaks on a private message server.

“Fifteen minutes later, candidate Trump tweets about WikiLeaks. Two days later, Trump Jr. tweeted to a link to WikiLeaks’ archive,” according to a timeline by PolitiFact.

Those are facts.

Now here is the view of those facts from the political left and right.

First, here is Jon Favreau, a former aide to President Obama, on the “Pod Save America” podcast summarizing the public record:

“We have laid out here that the Trump campaign knew there was a conspiracy on behalf of the Russian government to interfere with our election, to elect [Trump] president and not only agreed to it, but wanted that to happen and sought it out…agreed to participate.”

Next, here is Kim Wehle, a former assistant U.S. attorney, writing at the conservative website The Bulwark.

Pointing to grand jury indictments won by Mueller, she writes that Trump campaign officials may have been involved in more than ‘collusion.’ Public documents suggest they may have been party to the actual crime of conspiracy with a foreign government intent on breaking U.S. law to disrupt an American presidential election.

“The Trump campaign was involved,” she concludes. “That much is clear from the grand jury’s charging papers.”

Polls show the public has faith in Mueller.

Fifty-five percent of Americans told Pew last month that they have confidence in a fair report coming from the special counsel.

A Monmouth poll last month found 69 percent of Americans say they believe Russian government “definitely” or “probably” tried to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. Only 69 percent? You think?

It feels like we are entering the final act of this American tragedy.

What will happen to free and fair elections in our American democracy if Trump and his aides bury the report while his supporters persist in drinking the Kool-Aid and dismiss the whole thing as “fake” news?

That’s the look of liberals forming a circular firing squad to shoot at top Democrats running for the party’s 2020 presidential nomination.

Independent and swing voters also tell pollsters they disapprove of Trump’s policies on taxes, immigration and race relations. And the Party of Trump — formerly the GOP — lost 40 House seats in the midterms.

That political reality makes Trump a weak candidate for reelection.

But the Democrats still have to find a good candidate with an attractive message to beat even a bad candidate.

The president’s supporters can see what’s up.

Right-wing websites and Trump cheerleaders on talk radio are attacking possible Democratic candidates as budding socialists who will increase taxes and let every illegal immigrant run across open borders.

Trump’s white, working-class base is being warned on racial grounds that any Democratic nominee will ignore them while playing ‘identity politics’ that favor blacks, Latinos, immigrants, women and gays.

Trying to divide voters by race is so predictable for Trump’s team.

What is surprising is that Democrats are too often fueling the Trump camp’s caricature by insisting on race-based review of their candidates.

How painful and ironic will it be if racial debates inside the Democratic Party are allowed to weaken the focus on beating Trump and his racism?

For example, look at the attacks coming from the left against the leading candidate for the Democratic nomination in early polls, former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenObama, Clinton reflect on Mondale's legacy Biden, Harris commend Mondale in paving the way for female VP Mondale in last message to staff: 'Joe in the White House certainly helps' MORE.

Activists on the far left are bashing Biden for his support of President Clinton’s 1994 crime bill.

That bill had support from the Congressional Black Caucus at the time, being seen as an answer to high crime rates in black neighborhoods. But the old crime bill is now condemned by today’s activists, who take their cues from the Black Lives Matter movement.

They fault the bill for pushing more black people into jail as a result of increased sentences for selling crack cocaine, and mandating longer sentences for repeat offenders and violent crime.

Biden is trying to get past this line of attack by asking for forgiveness:

“It was a big mistake that was made,” Biden said at a Martin Luther King Day celebration last week in Washington.

Next in line for allegedly failing the racial test is a black woman, Sen. Kamala Harris Kamala HarrisBiden, Harris commend Mondale in paving the way for female VP Overnight Energy: Treasury creates hub to fight climate change through finance | Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez introduce 'Green New Deal for Public Housing' | Harris: Americans able to 'breathe easier and sleep better' under Biden MORE (D-Calif.).

Her sin is that she was a prosecutor and California’s attorney general.

“To become a prosecutor is to make a choice to align oneself with a powerful and fundamentally biased system,” according to an essay on The Intercept, a liberal website.

It is hard to take that argument seriously.

Also in line for the gauntlet of race-shaming are white candidates who did not show an interest in racial injustice early enough in their careers.

Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who supported controversial ‘stop-and-frisk’ police tactics, as well as Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand Kirsten GillibrandIntelligence leaders warn of threats from China, domestic terrorism Jon Stewart accuses VA of being 'an obstacle' to burn pits medical care Family policy that could appeal to the right and the left MORE (D-N.Y.), Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersOvernight Energy: Treasury creates hub to fight climate change through finance | Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez introduce 'Green New Deal for Public Housing' | Don't attack Zoom for its Bernie Sanders federal tax bill Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez introduce 'Green New Deal for Public Housing' MORE (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth WarrenWorld passes 3 million coronavirus deaths Poll: 56 percent say wealth tax is part of solution to inequality Democratic senators call on Biden to support waiving vaccine patents MORE (D-Mass.) are all vulnerable on this point.

Gillibrand is taking preemptory action by saying her lack of a track record on racial issues while she served as a congresswoman from upstate New York is no indication of who she is now.

“White women like me must bear part of this burden [of dealing with the rise in racial violence and racism during the Trump era] and commit to amplify your voices,” Gillibrand told a black audience at a Martin Luther King Day celebration last week in Harlem.

Meanwhile Warren, to the delight of the far-right, is still dealing with criticism for taking a DNA test to support her claim of Native American heritage. Trump repeatedly mocks her as ‘Pocahontas.’

The criticism of Warren for taking a DNA test — which showed a very distant element of Native American ancestry — comes from tribal leaders who want to be the sole arbiters of anyone’s claim to belong to a tribe.

That led Warren to tell a black audience “I’m not a person of color,” and make it clear she knows she never dealt with prejudice due to racial discrimination.

More broadly, this year's Women's March was a case study in how explosive racial issues — and, in that case, accusations of being soft on anti-Semitism — can splinter the unity of anti-Trump activists.

Blacks, Latinos and liberal women are at the heart of today’s Democratic base. There are record numbers of Latinos, Asians and blacks now in Congress, and they are almost all Democrats. Honest debate about racial justice is overdue for both parties.

That debate will happen in the South Carolina primary, the first contest with a high percentage of minority voters. Early attention to that race indicates its importance for any Democrat trying to win the party’s nomination.

Democrats across the racial spectrum have to keep in mind that they have far more in common with each other than they do with Trump, a man whose racist rhetoric and white identity policies are damaging people of every color daily.

After a Black Lives Matter leader refused to talk with President Obama in 2016, Obama made the point that activists sometimes feel “so passionately…they never take the next step and say, ‘How do I sit down and try to actually get something done?’”

The most important ‘something’ to get done right now is beating Trump.

As liberal comedian Bill Maher is fond of saying, there is a big difference between a disappointing friend and a deadly enemy.

That’s pretty silly.

But it was no joke when the top-rated news show on television, CBS’s “60 Minutes,” did a real interview with the 29-year-old congresswoman just days after she was sworn in.

And no one laughed when she gave a four-minute speech on the House floor last week that became the most-viewed video of a House speech ever on C-SPAN.

Remember, this is a first-term congresswoman. She is no committee chairwoman. She is not in the leadership. And she has been known to mangle facts.

The puzzling level of fascination with her led The Washington Post to explain that Rep. Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) is at the “center of the political zeitgeist” of American politics today.

In other words, she rivals the leading character, President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE.

How?

Well, among politicians, Ocasio-Cortez’s Twitter reach (@AOC) is second only to that of President @realDonaldTrump.

“A freshman congresswoman who has held office for less than two weeks is dominating the Democratic conversation on Twitter, generating more interactions — retweets plus likes — than the five most prolific news organizations combined over the last 30 days,” according to Axios.

While Trump loves to tweet directly to his older, white, male base, Ocasio-Cortez tweets and uses Instagram to reach directly to the growing number of young voters, especially energized anti-Trump Democrats, who are describing themselves in record numbers as liberals.

This is especially true for Latina, black, Asian and young white women. That audience sees themselves in Ocasio-Cortez.

And right-wingers follow her, too, because they love to hate on her.

They envy her ability to talk to young people who are not available to Trump and the Republicans. And her ideas on raising taxes, universal healthcare and reducing the cost of college tuition invite conservative rage because she gives energy to left-wing ideas that are already popular and now going mainstream.

And she is having fun skewering the old guard on Capitol Hill.

Just last week she made an adventure out of looking for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong 15 Senate Republicans pledge to oppose lifting earmark ban It's not 'woketivism,' it's good business MORE (R-Ky.) — while on Instagram Live — to call him out for not allowing a vote on bills passed in the House to end the government shutdown.

McConnell was nowhere to be found.

But it was interesting to watch Ocasio-Cortez and her gang of three other happy congresswomen hell bent on breaking rules and confronting the powerful Senate Majority Leader.

Even when she is on a traditional political platform — television — Ocasio-Cortez succeeds by being unpredictable, again in Trump-like fashion.

Her “60 Minutes” interview made news for days after she proposed taxing people making more than $10 million a year at a 70 percent rate. Immediately, right-wing talk shows sliced into her as a socialist trying to turn America into a Venezuela-type economic pit with a toilet paper shortage.

But 59 percent of registered voters agreed with her call for a high marginal tax rate, according to a poll released last week by The Hill and HarrisX.

In fact, 45 percent of Republicans said they support her idea as well as 60 percent of independents and 71 percent of Democrats.

“Oh? What’s that?” the congresswoman tweeted. “The majority of Americans respect when you break down reasonable policy proposals that are designed to combat runaway income inequality and help fund priorities they value most.”

But here is an important point: Ocasio-Cortez is compelling because Republicans — even more than Democrats — know the power of political disruption from their recent experience with a social media savvy, brash outsider with no political experience.

The link between Ocasio-Cortez and Trump made news last week when a Rasmussen poll put her head-to-head with the president in a fantasy 2020 race for the White House.

The poll found Ocasio-Cortez on even footing with Trump in a poll of likely voters. He got 43 percent and she got 40 percent with “a sizeable 17 percent undecided.”

Oh, there’s more.

The Daily Caller, a conservative publication, had to retract what it headlined as a “photo some people described as a nude selfie of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.” It turned out the photo was a fake.

“It’s encouraging because this is my sixth day in Congress and they’re out of all their artillery,” Ocasio-Cortez was quoted as saying in The Washington Post. “The nude is supposed to be like the bazooka…dude, you’re all out of bullets, you’re all out of bombs…what have you got left?”

That led to even more coverage of Ocasio-Cortez.

Laura Bassett wrote in Huffington Post that “some experts say conservative men are obsessed with Ocasio-Cortez because they are threatened by her.” Bassett said conservatives are sexualizing the young woman to “undercut her influence.”

But her influence is still growing due to the Democrats’ presidential primaries. She is too young to run for the White House but an endorsement from Ocasio-Cortez will be very real news.

259,Williams,Juan,thehill,"Congressional Republicans know the president’s push for a border wall is a political fake.

The best evidence is that no one in Congress representing a district on the southern border supports the wall. That includes the lone Republican, Rep. Will Hurd William Ballard HurdPence autobiography coming from Simon & Schuster Prince Harry joins Aspen Institute commission on misinformation Congress's latest hacking investigation should model its most recent MORE of Texas.

“A giant barrier from ‘sea to shining sea’ is the most expensive and least effective way to do border security,” Hurd recently told CNN. He voted with Democrats last week to end the government shutdown without giving Trump money for a wall.

ADVERTISEMENT

By the way, polls show most Texans oppose the wall. Polls also show most Americans — a majority of Democrats and independents — blaming the president and his enablers in Congress for the shutdown.

The polls do show Trump has overwhelming support from his base. But that is a shrinking share of voters. Trump is dizzy from his own spin when he tweets that even as the party loses the current fight, “We have the issue, Border Security. 2020!”

Doug Heye, a former strategist for the GOP leadership on Capitol Hill, told the Washington Examiner last week that congressional Republicans are locked in a trap of their own making.

“Republicans have pulled a gun and taken themselves hostage,” he said of the damaging, downward political spiral brought on by a president who openly declared last month he would be responsible for this government shutdown.

It is a bad look for Republicans on Capitol Hill to promise to deliver tax refunds and food stamp checks even though their leader is the one who closed government offices.

Republicans also know they are open to charges of hypocrisy if their president declares a national emergency to get around his failure to get GOP majorities in the House and Senate over the last two years to fund a wall.

Conservatives have long opposed executive orders by presidents to enact new federal rules without congressional approval. And not one of the 58 emergency orders in U.S. history was used by a president to circumvent Congress’ constitutional power to control federal funding.

So, if Trump takes the radical step of declaring an emergency, he will have to violate another long-standing Republican pledge to oppose federal agents seizing private land for public use under the claim of “eminent domain.”

Trump’s border wall would require the federal government to assert sweeping new eminent domain powers to literally seize Texans’ land. Where are those small government, pro-private property Republicans now?

And remember that leading Republicans are on the record admitting that the wall will not make the border more secure.

“By the way, the bottom line is the fence doesn't stop anybody who really wants to get across,” Mulvaney, then a congressman, told a South Carolina radio show.

“You go under, you go around… And that's what the ranchers tell us, is that they don't need a fence. What they need is more manpower, and more technology… So it's easy to tell people what they want to hear — ‘build the darn fence, vote for me.’""

The most incredible honesty about the deceit comes from Trump himself. The man who repeatedly promised to get Mexico — not American taxpayers — to pay for the wall did an about-face last week. He said he knows Mexico is not going to write a check to “build the wall,” as his supporters used to chant at rallies.

“When during the campaign I would say ‘Mexico’s going to pay for it,’ obviously I never said this and I never meant they’re going to write out a check…They are paying for it with the incredible [new trade] deal…we made,” Trump said last week.

A Washington Post/ABC News poll released on Sunday found 53 percent of Americans believe that Trump and Republicans are ""mainly responsible"" for the shutdown, while only 29 percent blame Democrats in Congress. A CNN poll conducted by SSRS, also released on Sunday, indicated that 55 percent of adults believe Trump bears primary responsibility while 32 percent point the finger at Democrats.

A Quinnipiac University poll taken in December found 54 percent of voters opposed to building the wall and just 43 percent supporting the idea.

But Trump keeps digging a deep hole for Republicans even with illegal border crossings at a 20-year low.

He wants to thrill conservative media figures like Ann Coulter and Rush Limbaugh with talk of an “invasion” and fear mongering over terrorists and drug dealers.

“Fox News Sunday” host Chris Wallace busted White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders this month when she claimed “nearly 4,000 known or suspected terrorists come into our country illegally, and we know that our most vulnerable point of entry is at our southern border.”

“Do you know where those 4,000 people…where they’re captured?” Wallace asked Sanders. “Airports. The State Department says there hasn’t been any terrorists that they’ve found coming across the southern border with Mexico.”

The editors of USA Today similarly called out Trump’s claim of drugs ""pouring"" over the border.

“But federal data show the majority captured at the border come through legal entry points, which a wall won't stop. Same goes for criminals: 60% of those caught also came through legal entries,” USA Today reported.

Republicans in Congress know all these facts.

The only wall being constructed is the one separating Trump and his supporters from reality.

261,Williams,Juan,foxnews,"Editor's note: The following column originally appeared in The Hill newspaper and on TheHill.com.



Here’s the dangerous state of play on the political chessboard as the battle over President Trump’s nominee for the Supreme Court intensifies.

Republicans hold the clear advantage.

Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.), the Senate’s minority leader with 48 votes, is facing a political trap.



If he moves to employ a filibuster against the nominee, federal Judge Neil Gorsuch, he opens the door to a devastating counter: The so-called “nuclear option,” whereby the GOP could change the rules and end the use of filibusters against Supreme Court nominees.

On the right side of the board, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), with 52 votes, sees the opening. But he also knows if he makes that move, it will have consequences far beyond this game.

It will give added energy to Democrats going into the 2018 midterm elections, possibly hurting Republican efforts to grow their Senate majority. And there is an even greater danger for McConnell. He could go down in history as the man who blew up the Senate, destroying an institution that first met in 1789.

Staring across the board at each other, Schumer and McConnell are looking for a way out.

Schumer is trying to persuade onlookers and McConnell that any nominee who can’t get 60 votes for confirmation is not a good candidate.

“There will be 60 votes for confirmation,” Schumer said on the Senate floor last week. “On a subject as important as a Supreme Court nomination, bipartisan support should be a prerequisite. It should be essential. That's what 60 votes does.”

Meanwhile, McConnell is content to wait and see what comes of Schumer’s move. But history and the populist rage on the right — typified by President Trump’s election — is making him sweat.

First, there is history: “Without [the filibuster rule], the majority in the Senate will do what majorities do – take full control,” historian Richard Arenberg recently wrote in The New York Times. “The Senate will become another House of Representatives.”

A broken Senate will facilitate the “tyranny of the majority,” that John Adams warned against in the early days of the republic.

Trump and his populist movement are not focused on Senate history. Trump wants his man on the high court now.

“If we end up with that gridlock, I’d say, ‘If you can, Mitch, go nuclear,’” Trump told reporters last week. He was clear that his focus is solely on winning confirmation when he added that it “would be an absolute shame if a man [Gorsuch] of this quality” gets “caught up in this web” of Senate politics.

But McConnell is a man of the Senate. He is a Republican – not a populist. The Senate is where his legacy will be made. He heard Trump’s disdain for the entire Washington political establishment in the president’s inaugural speech.

“What truly matters is not which party controls our government,” Trump said, dismissing the Republicans as well as the Democrats on Inauguration Day, “but whether our government is controlled by the people.”

Trump also knows that if McConnell lowers the threshold to 51 votes for a Gorsuch nomination, he will have a clear road ahead for future nominees who have an even more hard-right pedigree.

Looking ahead, the president sees three possible Supreme Court openings in view. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is 83; Justice Anthony Kennedy is 80; and Justice Stephen Breyer is 78. With the prospect of putting the gold “Trump” brand on the front of the Supreme Court for generations to come, the president is not concerned with damage to the Senate.

But there is concern over blowback from the populist left. That includes the possibility of creating what is being called a “Tea Party of the Left,” an energized Democratic opposition that will turn out in record numbers in the 2018 midterm elections and punish Republicans.

McConnell has a built-in advantage going into the midterms with Democrats having to defend 25 of 33 Senate seats up for election. In addition, Democratic-leaning groups typically do not turn out for midterms in the numbers seen at presidential-elections.

But that could change if liberal horror at Trump stays at its current level, or even grows. McConnell does not want to see his Senate majority become collateral damage to Trump’s presidency.

The anger building on the nation’s political left can be seen in the Senate.

Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley (Ore.) says the open Supreme Court seat was “stolen” from then-President Obama long before Gorsuch was named. He is referring to the refusal of Senate Republicans to even give a hearing to Merrick Garland, the nominee Obama put forth in his last year in office. Merkley has been trying to rally Senate Democrats for an all-out filibuster on Trump’s nominee.

Merkely’s voice is close to the position taken by Republicans before last November’s election when it appeared that Democrat Hillary Clinton was likely to win. Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Ted Cruz (R-Texas) both said they could live with an empty seat on the nine-member court, allowing an even split of justices appointed by Republicans and Democrats to continue.

Democrats still reeling from Trump’s election are now demanding political payback for the treatment of Garland. They are looking for the Democratic leadership in Congress to match their outrage and avenge Garland by putting up a fight — even if they don’t win.

Schumer, in his new role as leader of the Democrats in Congress, knows the base of his party wants to see their leaders fight hard against a president many view as corrupt, radical and illegitimate.

For now, there is a waiting game on the Senate chess board.

The real story of the Gorsuch nomination is the prospect that it could cause the Senate permanent damage.",-1,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/juan-williams-why-the-battle-over-trumps-supreme-court-pick-could-ruin-the-senate

The New York Times recently reported that Facebook’s senior leadership knew about the poison being spread on their site by the Russians and did close to zero to stop it.

But Facebook did find time to hire a high-priced D.C. public relations firm to launch a smear campaign against Facebook’s critics — specifically by linking criticism to financier George Soros, a man demonized by the far right.

The outrage does not stop there.

Just last week, it was reported that Facebook allowed other high-tech firms Spotify and Netflix to make use of private Facebook messages.

Once again, we have evidence of giant tech companies selling their customers’ private information without their knowledge or, in some cases, permission.

Only in March, 16 months after the presidential election, was it confirmed that the political strategy firm Cambridge Analytica used personal data from Facebook to create “psychographic” profiles of Facebook customers.

With that information, they launched a campaign to politically twist the minds of as many as 87 million people, more than 80 percent of them in the U.S., before the 2016 race.

Karl Racine, the District of Columbia’s attorney general, recently filed the first lawsuit against Facebook for allowing Cambridge Analytica to use personal data from its subscribers.

But Congress and the Federal Trade Commission remain deaf and silent to the abuse.

How can that be?

And the Democrats apparently swallowed talking points from social media titans who say it is unfair to blame them for political lies and distortions, even if the target is their customers.

“It appears that Facebook has not been honest with Congress or the public about how it treats its users’ data,” Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) told The Washington Post earlier this month.

When Democrats take the House majority in January, Pallone will be chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees much of the tech industry.

“I’m concerned that Facebook may have provided [Congress] with inaccurate, incomplete, or misleading responses to our questions, and we’ll be following up,” Pallone added.

The FTC, under the control of a Trump majority of commissioners, remains silent.

The only action from the federal government against this attack on democracy came in the Senate.

It would regulate online campaign ads on websites like Facebook and Google that are paid for by foreign entities.

But neither the House nor Senate voted on that small potato. House and Senate leaders from both parties have given no indication they will take up the limited legislation in the new Congress.

Wall Street money managers have taken notice of the scandal. Facebook’s stock price has dropped by more than 25 percent in the last year, a decline that is estimated to have cost Zuckerberg more than $15 billion.

Even with that depreciation, the financial power of the social media companies and their political donations continue to muzzle Congress.

“It’s a business, and providing dubious access to user data, engaging in and allowing shady political activity, and hiding errors until the last minute, it seems, is perceived as more lucrative than the alternative,” wrote Emily Stewart at Vox.

Meanwhile, the American public is increasingly aware that they are being abused.

A November poll taken by Survey Monkey for Axios and HBO found that 55 percent of respondents are concerned the government will not do enough to regulate big technology firms. The number represents a 15-point increase from when the question was asked one year ago.

On the flip side, the poll also found that 40 percent are concerned that the government will go too far in regulating the tech companies.

But if American democracy is to survive, these FAANG companies need to be brought to heel.

The free market has not been able to curb the industry’s abuses and excesses. That leaves government as the only viable route to stop these companies from destroying democracy for profit.

To see the President of the United States described as an opponent of liberal democracy and open society is alarming. But the FT also made the case that the president has “peddled allegations” against Soros that “appeared to have partly inspired” murders at a Pittsburgh synagogue.

“I don’t know who [is funding it] but I wouldn’t be surprised — a lot of people say yes,” said Trump, leaving the door open to the possibility the Jewish billionaire was to blame. That came after a pipe bomb was sent to Soros’ home by a Trump supporter.

Then Rep. Kevin McCarthy Kevin McCarthyWhite House readies for Chauvin verdict McCarthy to introduce resolution to censure Waters House GOP's McClain responds to Pelosi calling her 'that woman' MORE (Calif.), soon to be the GOP’s House Minority Leader, tweeted that Soros and two other wealthy Jews, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Tom Steyer, a political activist, tried to “buy” the midterm elections for the Democrats. (Amid an outcry, McCarthy deleted the tweet.)

“There are so many anti-Semitic conspiracy theories targeting Mr. Soros that it is difficult to keep count,” the FT wrote. “Hardly a day goes by without a statement, a tweet or an image depicting him as a master manipulator of global politics.”

It is now time for every American to say this has gone far enough.

As a columnist and television host, I celebrate the First Amendment. But the rise of hate speech today is drowning honest political debate. And it is stirring hatred against immigrants, blacks, and Jews. The FBI report shows an overall increase in hate crimes between 2016 and 2017 of 17 percent, with Jewish people the religious group most frequently targeted.

There is no looking away from this reality. In Charlottesville in 2017 white nationalists, including some Trump backers, chanted “Blood and Soil,” a Nazi slogan, and “Jews will not replace us.”

“We see people bringing a kind of toxicity into political conversations that we’ve never seen before,” Jonathan Greenblatt, the head of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), told CBS in November.

And a former head of the ADL has specifically pointed at Trump. “He didn’t create them,” Abe Foxman told The Times of Israel last month. “But he emboldened them. He gave them the chutzpah, that it’s okay.”

Foxman is right. Trump uses conspiracy theories to unleash acid political passions to win elections.

He could also point to the soulless tech companies like Facebook, Twitter and Google. They say they have no responsibility while their platforms are used to spread hate.

Even now the hateful, looney conspiracy claims continue, with many falsely targeting special counsel Robert Mueller Robert (Bob) MuellerWhy a special counsel is guaranteed if Biden chooses Yates, Cuomo or Jones as AG Barr taps attorney investigating Russia probe origins as special counsel CNN's Toobin warns McCabe is in 'perilous condition' with emboldened Trump MORE and the “Deep State.”

We have always had conspiracy theorists in U.S. politics. Recall the far-right John Birch Society grew in the late 1950s by suggesting that President Eisenhower was a secret communist agent and that fluoridation of drinking water was a communist mind control plot.

But history will soon record that 2018 was the year when these type of insane, destructive lies went beyond the political fringes to be regularly amplified by right-wing media.

This month, a popular conspiracy theory on the right argued former Trump National Security Adviser Michael Flynn was the victim of entrapment by the FBI and had been coerced into committing perjury.

But when Flynn went to court last week, he openly admitted his guilt. And said he was not trapped by the FBI. The conspiracy crowd is on the hunt for their next fever dream.

The Russians, meanwhile, are using conspiracy theories to undermine the FBI and Mueller as they probe Russia’s role in the 2016 election. The Russians, according to reports done for the Senate Intelligence Committee, went online to dismiss the investigation — as “nonsense,” according to The Washington Post — and to say stories of Russian interference are pushed by “liberal crybabies.”

The time has come to face the truth that constitutional democracy cannot last under such a steady barrage of lies.

Will the new congress do anything about this? Speaker Pelosi? Majority Leader McConnell? History is calling.

That’s Rep.

Keep in mind that the House GOP caucus is more than 90 percent male. When the 116th Congress convenes in January, Stefanik will be one of just 13 Republican women in the House, the lowest number in 20 years.

It is hard to ignore the contrast with Democrats.

There will be 89 Democratic women in the House next year — 35 newly elected in the midterms, including the first two Muslim congresswomen and the first two Native American congresswomen. The GOP has only one woman in an overwhelmingly white freshman class.

But Rep. Tom Emmer Thomas (Tom) Earl EmmerDemocrats debate timing and wisdom of reparations vote Trump digs in on attacks against Republican leaders GOP campaign chief confident his party will win back House MORE (R-Minn.), the campaign chairman, complained Stefanik was playing identity politics based on “gender, race and religion,” instead of looking for the best candidate.

He tried to “mansplain” by saying she was still looking for support in her caucus to be elected as Speaker and therefore did not have the power to make a deal in any negotiation over funding for a border wall.

She did not back down, telling Trump he was out of line to question her ability to speak for House Democrats.

In the Senate, the Republican problem with women is only slightly better than it is in the House.

Sen. Joni Ernst Joni Kay Ernst15 Senate Republicans pledge to oppose lifting earmark ban Child care advocates seek to lock down billion in new federal funding GOP senator: Raising corporate taxes is a 'non-starter' MORE (R-Iowa) was recently chosen by her colleagues to serve as vice chairwoman of the Senate Republican Conference, giving a woman a seat at the table in Senate GOP leadership for the first time in eight years.

But Ernst’s rise can’t hide the reality: Of 24 female senators next year, just seven will be Republican, even though the GOP has a 53-member majority.

After Arizona Rep. Martha McSally Martha Elizabeth McSallyArizona state senator announces bid for Kirkpatrick's seat Democratic Arizona Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick says she won't seek reelection Senate GOP faces retirement brain drain MORE (R) lost her bid for a Senate seat — to Democrat Kyrsten Sinema — McSally’s campaign strategists detailed how Trump’s toxicity among female voters contributed to her loss.

“In internal polling during the primary, President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE never broke 80% favorability among Republican voters. A certain segment of [Arizona] Republicans was outright hostile to President Trump, and was against the Kavanaugh appointment,” read a post-mortem memo obtained by The Washington Post.

In fact, female voters nationwide favored Democrats by 19 points according to exit polls, while male voters favored Republicans by four points — a 23-point gender gap.

The problem is Trump, and it goes back to his win in the 2016 election.

According to the 2016 exit polls, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton carried all female voters by 13 points over Trump in 2016 — though Trump won white women by 9 points.

Keep in mind this was after the infamous “Access Hollywood” tape surfaced, on which Trump boasted about grabbing women’s genitals.

An American University/Benenson Strategy Group poll released this month found that 71 percent of white suburban women were “concerned” about the way Trump speaks about women.

The poll found 60 percent of female voters view Trump unfavorably. And perhaps most challenging for the president’s reelection hopes, almost two-thirds of independent female voters view him unfavorably.

Trump’s supporters are heavily male but among women who still self-identify as Republican, 55 percent said they agree with Trump on important issues.

Those women are among the small but stable base of about 40 percent of voters who support Trump. The problem for the GOP is the growing number of women who are independents or Democrats. They are moving away from him.

In the age of Trump, Republican strategists know the party’s lack of support from women spells trouble for 2020 and beyond.

Democratic strategists argue support from female voters — especially minority women — is at the heart of the party’s future.

Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand Kirsten GillibrandIntelligence leaders warn of threats from China, domestic terrorism Jon Stewart accuses VA of being 'an obstacle' to burn pits medical care Family policy that could appeal to the right and the left MORE (D-N.Y.), was ridiculed by conservatives earlier this month for tweeting, “Our future is: Female Intersectional Powered by our belief in one another.

They can make fun of her talk about “intersectional” issues. But political analysts from every point on the political spectrum can see Gillibrand is right about the rising political power of female voters.

Wake up, dudes. Seriously.

269,Williams,Juan,thehill,"Trump supporters are rare among black people. President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE won just 8 percent of the black vote in 2016.

His family business’ sordid history of housing discrimination and his racially insensitive comments — “look at my African American over here” — leave black Trump supporters open to mockery and charges of self-hate.

ADVERTISEMENT

A few black people thought they had a winning strategy for dealing with Trump. In exchange for access to his presidential power, they’d ignore warning signs and jump on his bandwagon. How did that work out for you, Omarosa?

Trump reacted to her critical book by calling her a “dog” and a “crazed, crying low-life.”

Kanye West similarly went to the White House in a red “Make America Great Again” hat before realizing he was being “used” by Trump backers “to spread messages I don’t believe in.”

The rapper then announced he was done with politics. He also tweeted that, unlike Trump, he favors gun control and support for immigrants, including “love and compassion for people seeking asylum.”

All that was bad enough. Now it is getting worse for the black conservatives trying to find a place in the party of Trump.

Exhibit A is how Trump went out of his way to trash the first black Republican congresswoman, Utah’s Mia Love Ludmya (Mia) LoveVoters elected a record number of Black women to Congress this year — none were Republican Democrats lead in diversity in new Congress despite GOP gains McAdams concedes to Owens in competitive Utah district MORE, after she lost a hard-fought reelection battle last month.

“Mia Love gave me no love. And she lost,” Trump sneered. “Too bad. Sorry about that, Mia.”

After Trump insulted her, Love told supporters: “This election…shines a spotlight on the problems Washington politicians have with minorities and black Americans.”

No, this is not a race problem afflicting all Republicans or all Washington politicians. It is more accurately labeled a ‘Trump politician race problem.’

It is Trump who emboldened racists by saying that a march of white supremacists — and the people who protested against them — featured “fine people on both sides.”

Trying to make sense of Trump’s bad record on dealing with people who are not white, Love argued: “It’s transactional. It’s not personal.”

Wrong, congresswoman. It is personal.

His family business was sued in the 1970s for refusing to rent apartments to black people. He never apologized for wrongly blaming five black and Latino teenagers for a brutal attack on a woman in New York’s Central Park. How can it not be personal for Mexicans when Trump described Mexican immigrants as criminals and “rapists”?

As Colin Powell, a black Republican, once wrote, Trump is a “national disgrace.” As Condoleezza Rice, another black Republican, said, she is “uncomfortable [with] what I see and hear,” from Trump.

It is personal.

Next year, the 116th Congress will be the most racially diverse in history due to a record number of black and Latino Democrats.

There will be just two black Republicans — Rep. Will Hurd William Ballard HurdPence autobiography coming from Simon & Schuster Prince Harry joins Aspen Institute commission on misinformation Congress's latest hacking investigation should model its most recent MORE of Texas and Sen. Tim Scott Timothy (Tim) Eugene ScottBass 'hopeful' on passing police reform: 'Republicans that I am working with are operating in good faith' The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Tax March - CDC in limbo on J&J vax verdict; Rep. Brady retiring Tim Scott to participate in GOP event in Iowa MORE of South Carolina.

At the moment, Scott is performing a high wire act in dealing with Trump.

He recently opposed Trump’s nomination of Thomas Farr to a federal judgeship. Farr has a long history of defending racially discriminatory legislation — namely overly stringent voter identification and gerrymandering — in North Carolina. “We are not doing a very good job of avoiding the obvious potholes on race in America and we ought to be more sensitive when it comes to those issues,” Scott said in explaining his opposition to Trump’s nominee.

When criticized by the Wall Street Journal editorial page for buying into “racial attacks,” Scott responded with a letter calling on Trump and the GOP to “stop bringing candidates with questionable track records on race” up for Senate confirmation.

Scott similarly broke with his party earlier this year to oppose Ryan Bounds, another Trump judicial nominee with a troubling history on race. As a college student Bounds wrote articles in the Stanford Review that “ridiculed multiculturalism,” according to The Washington Post.

Scott also flies away from Trump by championing economic development for black America.

While Trump is cutting the Minority Business Development Agency and neighborhood block grants (as I detail in my new book, ""'What The Hell Do You Have to Lose?' — Trump’s War on Civil Rights""), Scott is crisscrossing the country on a national “Opportunity Tour.” He is pushing conservative ideas for boosting economic development in minority neighborhoods.

Scott insisted on a provision in last year’s Trump tax cut law that creates “opportunity zones,” making economically-disadvantaged areas eligible for new federal tax breaks.

But here again, up pops the problem of being a black conservative when all Republican politics is defined by loyalty to Trump.

While he got a good provision into the Trump tax bill as the price for his vote, Scott still ended up supporting a Trump tax cut that in the short run benefits the richest one percent of Americans.

That historic scam is exploding the deficit to pay for tax breaks for corporations and the rich. That means less federal dollars to help poor neighborhoods in need of revitalization.

I am rooting for Scott and other principled black conservatives to reclaim the mantle of the party of Lincoln. There is a lot to lose if black conservative approaches to racial progress are sunk due to Trump loyalty tests.

But the prospects for Scott and other black conservatives locked in the party of Trump look dim. They have nowhere to go as political polarization and racial divisions harden in advance of the 2020 election.

272,Williams,Juan,thehill,"President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE famously said, “Real power is…fear.”

Now it is Trump who is afraid.

Yes, he has to fear the new Democratic-controlled House of Representatives readying subpoenas.

ADVERTISEMENT

But the biggest political boogeyman is the very real fear that 2019 may be the year the U.S. economy goes into a “Trump slump.”

Trump showed fear last week with his attack on Jerome ‘Jay’ Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve. Trump told The Washington Post he made the wrong decision in putting Powell in control of interest rates, bonds and other levers controlling the economy.

“I’m not even a little bit happy with my selection of Jay,” Trump said, “not even a little bit.”

He added: “I think the Fed is a much bigger problem than China.”

And that scolding was before the Fed’s meeting last week when Powell and others suggested “further gradual increases” in interest rates are coming to protect against inflation.

Trump is lashing out at Powell because any sign of an economic slowdown will be political poison for his 2020 campaign.

The troubling indicators are already here. General Motors is laying off 14,000 people — 15 percent of its workforce. Housing sales are down. The global economy is slowing and Trump has started a trade war with China.

So, Powell has every reason to be cautious. He does not want inflation burdening the economy. Already, the U.S. stock market has given back most of its gains for the year.

If there is an economic slump, you can bet your bottom dollar that Trump will accept zero responsibility. He will blame Powell, Democrats, the media and the Chinese, probably all of them in the same tweet.

Trump’s defenders, specifically top economic adviser Larry Kudlow, are busy telling people to ignore warning signs. Talk of an impending recession is “nonsense,” he said, while noting that market corrections “come and go.”

But the politics can’t be ignored.

Republican business leaders already have their tax cut. The donor class has turned a blind eye towards Trump’s racism, misogyny, attacks on immigrants and even his refusal to call Saudi Arabia out for the murder of a journalist, because Trump has boosted their bottom line. If the economy gets shaky, look for those big dollar supporters to reassess Trump's value to them.

And what happens if the unemployment rate — now at 3.7 percent — starts going back up?

Also, recall that Trump dismissed the low unemployment rate during Obama’s presidency as fake. He said too many workers were discouraged and stopped looking for a job, artificially lowering the unemployment rate.

Well, what does he say now?

The current labor force participation rate is 62.9 percent, meaning more than a third of Americans are either not working or have given up looking for work. Where are those same caveats and naysaying about the labor force participation rate now? Crickets.

Where is his concern that pressuring the Fed to keep interest rates artificially low is a danger to economic stability?

Why is there no alarm from Trump’s backers that his massive tax cut package will push the deficit to $1 trillion over the next decade, according to Trump’s own Office of Management and Budget? Where are those GOP deficit hawks from the Obama years?

At his rallies, Trump stirs fear of a return to the Obama economy and boasts about all the jobs he has created. But with Obama in the White House, the nation saw more jobs created in his last 21 months than in Trump’s first 20 months.

Trump critics, including me, have to be careful to separate opposition to Trump from concern about a possible recession. Every American, including those derided by the far right as socialists for pointing to growing income inequality, wants continued prosperity in the New Year.

It was wrong when conservative talk radio king Rush Limbaugh said in 2009 he hoped “Obama fails.” It was equally wrong when liberal comedian Bill Maher joked earlier this year, “So please, bring on the recession. Sorry if that hurts people, but it's either root for a recession or you lose your democracy.” To be fair, Maher later elaborated, “A recession is a survivable event, what Trump is doing to this country is not.”

But Trump’s lower taxes and cuts to regulation have not stopped GM, Harley-Davidson and Carrier, among other big manufacturers, from taking American jobs overseas.

So it is not reckless for the Federal Reserve, under Powell or any other chairman, to keep close tabs on the economy to make sure the markets do not repeat the blow up of 2008 that led to recession.

It is not up to Powell to hide the fact that Trump is hurting farmers and factory workers he promised to help during his campaign.

274,Williams,Juan,thehill,"As 2018 draws to a close, it’s time for my annual pick of the top political player on Capitol Hill.

First let’s acknowledge that, at the end of 2018, Rep. Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiWhite House readies for Chauvin verdict House GOP's McClain responds to Pelosi calling her 'that woman' GOP struggles to rein in nativism MORE (D-Calif.) — for now the House Minority Leader but likely to return as Speaker in January — stands as a living legend.

The nearly 40 House seats the Democrats have picked up so far in the midterms, as well as the probability that Pelosi will retake the Speaker’s gavel, are proof of her sustained political success.

ADVERTISEMENT

Her past legislative triumphs include passage of the 2009 economic stimulus that helped bring the country out of recession and her stewardship of the Affordable Care Act, which President Obama signed into law in March 2010.

But this is not the Hall of Fame. I’m limiting this contest to top political performance in the last year.

There have to be two winners, since Republicans and Democrats can’t agree on much.

For the Republicans, the award goes to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong 15 Senate Republicans pledge to oppose lifting earmark ban It's not 'woketivism,' it's good business MORE (R-Ky) for his skillful, albeit shameless, use of the Senate to pack federal courts with right-wing judges.

McConnell’s big prize was confirming Brett Kavanaugh Brett Michael KavanaughBiden's court-packing theater could tame the Supreme Court's conservatives Trump knocks CNN for 'completely false' report Gaetz was denied meeting NY Times beclowns itself by normalizing court-packing 'to balance the conservative majority' MORE to the Supreme Court. Despite powerful testimony alleging Kavanaugh, as a youth, had committed sexual assault, McConnell used brutal politics to force confirmation for President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE’s nominee.

In 2018, McConnell also increased the size of his Senate majority despite the blue wave that swept the Democrats back into control of the House.

By the way, this is the second time I have made McConnell the politician of the year. In 2016, he similarly used brutal but effective strategies to deny Obama the right to appoint a Supreme Court justice to fill a seat that sat vacant for nearly a year.

His blowtorch approach paid off when Trump filled the seat instead, with conservative jurist Neil Gorsuch. And it paid off again in 2018 when Trump got a second pick — Kavanaugh — and cemented a far-right majority on the high court.

According to an October 2018 Morning Consult poll, McConnell is America’s least popular senator, with 52 percent of Kentucky voters disapproving of the six-term incumbent. And conservative activists and talk radio hosts still abuse McConnell for not staking out hardline positions, such as building a border wall.

Despite the backstabbing, McConnell stands as the main mover of the conservative agenda in Congress for 2018.

Far on the other side of the political divide, the winner as the top liberal force of 2018 is Sen. Kamala Harris Kamala HarrisBiden, Harris commend Mondale in paving the way for female VP Overnight Energy: Treasury creates hub to fight climate change through finance | Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez introduce 'Green New Deal for Public Housing' | Harris: Americans able to 'breathe easier and sleep better' under Biden MORE (D-Calif.).

She is both the woman of the past year and a good bet as the future of her party.

At Senate hearings in 2018, Harris stood out with her pointed questioning of Trump officials and nominees. These jousts have made her a social media sensation. Harris honed those skills as a former San Francisco District Attorney and Attorney General of California.

Harris also positioned herself as a leader on the explosive issue of income inequality. She put forward a bill to give a $6,000 tax break to families making less than $100,000 per year. She is also a co-sponsor of Sen. Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersOvernight Energy: Treasury creates hub to fight climate change through finance | Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez introduce 'Green New Deal for Public Housing' | Don't attack Zoom for its Bernie Sanders federal tax bill Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez introduce 'Green New Deal for Public Housing' MORE’s (I-Vt.) Medicare for All healthcare bill.

The only black woman in the Senate — and the daughter of two immigrants — Harris is a leading voice challenging the GOP’s anti-immigrant policies. That has put her in good standing with immigration advocates. Her strong support for Planned Parenthood has also won applause among white women on the left.

Her leadership on these top liberal priorities is helping Harris with union leaders and far-left activists. They still openly worry she is too moderate, not the fiery leftist they feel would be sure to excite their base.

But so far Harris is attracting the anti-Trump energy of 2018 that made stars out of more leftist Democrats such as gubernatorial candidates Stacey Abrams in Georgia and Andrew Gillum in Florida, and Senate candidate Beto O’Rourke in Texas.

Harris got rock star treatment during a trip to Iowa in October. With ties to deep-pocketed donors in California’s Silicon Valley and Hollywood, she did her part in midterm fundraising for Democrats, building a national network to support a presidential run.

As the 2020 nomination fight begins, Harris barely shows up in the polls. But as Perry Bacon Jr. wrote in Fivethirtyeight.com this summer, the “betting markets have her near the top, reflecting the view among political insiders that Harris could win the Democratic nomination with a coalition of well-educated whites and blacks, the way Obama did in 2008.”

McConnell and Harris are in the driver’s seats for the futures of their respective parties.

The 76-year-old McConnell wants to cement his legacy as the man who made the federal judiciary a stronghold for the right.

The 54-year-old Harris, meanwhile, is pushing left-leaning ideas with centrist appeal. She is redefining the party while Democratic activists are still reacting to Trump’s excesses.

The real fireworks will begin when these two winners in political wars of 2018 become the face of conflicting agendas on the Senate floor in 2019.

As Trump nears two years as commander in chief, he has never visited American troops fighting in a war zone. He recently told the Associated Press he doesn’t think visiting the troops is “overly necessary.” He added, “I’ve been very busy with everything…doing a lot of things – but it’s something I’d do.”

In an interview with Chris Wallace on ""Fox News Sunday,"" Trump promised — albeit a bit vaguely — that he would put this right. ""I think you will see that happen,"" Trump told Wallace. ""There are things that are being planned.""

President Obama and President George W. Bush both visited with Americans in combat early in their first terms in the White House.

And now the Veterans Day snub.

Imagine if Obama had not honored America’s military on Veterans Day because of rain.

Imagine if he had refused to march with a group of world leaders to celebrate the sacrifice of American soldiers in helping to win the First World War.

Imagine if the Democrat had been in France and blamed the rain for not going to a French cemetery where 2000 American Marines are buried.

This is the core of what stumps me about Trump’s base.

Why do they close their eyes when he violates conservative standards of flag-waving patriotism?

This is the same base that excused Trump for demeaning a Gold Star family during the 2016 campaign.

Right-wing media ranted for months about NFL players who protested police brutality by kneeling during the national anthem. Trump said it was disrespectful of the military and unpatriotic.

So how do the same talk show hosts excuse his dismissive behavior toward our troops?

This is even harder to understand than ignoring his demagoguery about a caravan of poor, desperate immigrants.

What if Obama had sent troops to the U.S. border in the middle of a political campaign with no clear purpose but to get his base to the polls by stirring fear and alleging there was a need to protect against a rag-tag group still far from the border?

This unthinking support is even more confounding than when the president excuses racist violence in Charlottesville or lies about payoffs to porn stars.

Unfortunately, Trump’s snub of America’s military fits with a pattern of disrespectful behavior toward our veterans throughout his public life.

Trump famously demeaned the military service of the late Sen. John McCain John Sidney McCain'Real Housewives of the GOP' — Wannabe reality show narcissists commandeer the party George W. Bush: 'It's a problem that Americans are so polarized' they can't imagine him being friends with Michelle Obama Congress brings back corrupt, costly, and inequitably earmarks MORE (R-Ariz.), who spent five years as a prisoner of war in Hanoi during the Vietnam War.

“He’s not a war hero. He's a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren’t captured,” Trump sneered.

During the Vietnam War, Trump received four draft deferments for college and one for supposed bone spurs in his feet.

He joked with radio host Howard Stern that avoiding sexually transmitted diseases was his personal version of the Vietnam War.

""It's Vietnam,"" he said of STDs in the New York dating scene. ""It is very dangerous. So, I'm very, very careful.""

Last year Trump suggested the widow of a fallen Army sergeant was a liar when she recounted a disrespectful call Trump placed to her after her husband’s death while fighting in Niger.

Never mind that the widow’s account of the phone call, including Trump's failure to call the soldier by name, was backed up by Rep. Frederica Wilson Frederica Patricia WilsonCongressional Black Caucus members post selfie celebrating first WH visit in four years Rep. Frederica Wilson shares her famous hat collection with Netflix Florida Rep. Alcee Hastings dies at 84 MORE (D-Fla.) who was with the widow at the time. Trump dismissed the congresswoman as “wacky” and accused her of a “total lie on content.” But Sgt. LaDavid Johnson’s mother also confirmed that “Trump did disrespect my son.""

And it is not just Trump’s civilian base of supporters who close their eyes to his disrespectful treatment of the military. Even after insulting McCain, Trump still enjoyed strong support among people in the military.

According to 2016 exit polls, Trump carried 60 percent of veterans compared to Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' Cuba readies for life without Castro Chelsea Clinton: Pics of Trump getting vaccinated would help him 'claim credit' MORE’s 34 percent.

A Military Times poll released in October of this year found that since he won the presidency, there is declining support for Trump among active military personnel. But about 44 percent of troops still view Trump favorably while 43 percent disapprove.

Trump cheerleaders are quick to point out the $717 billion national defense bill Trump signed this summer.

Trump’s defenders also cite the fact that Obama signed into law “sequestration” measures which reduced defense spending.

What the Trump base fails to mention is that sequestration was passed by a Republican Congress with broad Republican support and signed into law by a Democratic President. Republicans backed the bill in the name of getting control of runaway federal spending.

This distortion of the facts is yet another example of Trump rewriting history.

This Thanksgiving, we should all show our thanks for our veterans. Their commander-in-chief is AWOL in the appreciation department.

He is now the sole proprietor of what I call the Trump Party.

Brit Hume, my conservative colleague, disagreed. He said Trump is fulfilling longstanding GOP priorities by nominating right-wing judges, lessening government regulation on business, opposing abortion, opposing gun control and more.

But the GOP before Trump stood for free trade, not tariffs. They supported legal immigration. They fought high deficits. They backed NATO allies and opposed Russian aggression. And they did not embrace the politics of put-downs — including lying, nasty comments about women — while emboldening racists and anti-Semites.

It is hard for me to believe that so many people who once called themselves Republicans, specifically in Indiana, Missouri and Florida, decided to vote for Trump’s candidates despite the president’s daily words and actions debasing honest political debate.

Those voters had no problem with a political ad so racist that Fox, NBC and Facebook eventually pulled it. They had no issue with his fear-mongering over a caravan of desperate immigrants. They saw nothing wrong with him demonizing Democrats who stand up to him as a “mob.”

It is hard to understand how close to 40 percent of the country and 90 percent of Republicans approve of this man.

To choke off dissent from the old GOP, the day after the midterms Trump dumped on Republicans who did not embrace him. He named candidates who lost to shame them. He cut down proud Republican lawmakers including Reps. Peter Roskam Peter James RoskamPostcards become unlikely tool in effort to oust Trump Bottom line Lobbying world MORE of Illinois, Barbara Comstock Barbara Jean ComstockRepublicans quietly say Gaetz's days in Congress are numbered Former GOP lawmaker says party should denounce Marjorie Taylor Greene Former GOP congresswoman calls on Republicans to back impeachment MORE of Virginia and Mia Love Ludmya (Mia) LoveVoters elected a record number of Black women to Congress this year — none were Republican Democrats lead in diversity in new Congress despite GOP gains McAdams concedes to Owens in competitive Utah district MORE of Utah.

“Mia Love gave me no love, and she lost. Too bad. Sorry about that, Mia,” the president said.

As retiring Rep. Ryan Costello Ryan Anthony CostellloRep. Brendan Boyle decides against Pennsylvania Senate bid Pennsylvania's Democratic lt. governor files to run for Senate Bottom Line MORE (R-Pa.) tweeted, it is tough enough that so many House Republicans lost their seats but then to “have him piss on [you] — angers me to my core.”

In fact, of the 75 candidates endorsed by Trump, only 21 won, according to an analysis by the Brookings Institution. That is 28 percent; a losing record. Even in the Senate, where Republicans retained their majority, the party saw Democrats win the popular vote by more than 9 million votes.

Somehow, Trump described those results as “very close to complete victory.”

He must be talking about the party of Trump, because the election results in the House, in governors’ races and state legislature races were good news for Democrats.

But Trump was sending a message to Republicans. Like a mob boss, he demands absolute loyalty and will turn his back on any Republican who fails to fall in line.

Jeff Flake Jeffrey (Jeff) Lane FlakeFive reasons why US faces chronic crisis at border Senate GOP faces retirement brain drain Former GOP lawmaker: Republican Party 'engulfed in lies and fear' MORE (Ariz.), and Sen.

When the House GOP conference choses its leaders next week, it will be a contest among zealous Trump acolytes.

Jim Jordan James (Jim) Daniel JordanTop House Republicans ask Harris for meeting on border The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Facebook - All US adults can get vaccine; decision Friday on J&J vax Waters: Fauci 'was being bullied' by Jordan during hearing MORE (R-Ohio) announced his bid for Minority Leader last week, saying it is House Republicans’ job to defend the president from Democratic investigation.

Kevin McCarthy Kevin McCarthyWhite House readies for Chauvin verdict McCarthy to introduce resolution to censure Waters House GOP's McClain responds to Pelosi calling her 'that woman' MORE (R-Calif.), who is a longtime Trump apologist who brags about his personal relationship with the president.

Forget House Republicans.

The Republican resistance — such as it is — could find new voices among kinder, moderate GOP governors in blue states who eschewed the Trump brand of politics. Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker was reelected with 67 percent of the vote. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan was reelected with 56 percent of the vote in Maryland.

Neither man has shown an appetite to take the fight directly to Trump.

Mitt Romney Willard (Mitt) Mitt RomneyAdvocacy groups pushing Biden to cancel student debt for disabled 15 Senate Republicans pledge to oppose lifting earmark ban The Hill's 12:30 Report - Presented by Facebook - All US adults now eligible for COVID vaccines MORE, who once stood with the anti-Trump resistance, just won a Senate seat in Utah. But in 2018 Romney praised Trump, saying his polices are “pretty effective.” Trump then endorsed Romney.

What a change from the days when Romney, the GOP’s presidential nominee in 2012, said: “Here's what I know: Donald Trump is a phony, a fraud. His promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University. He's playing members of the American public for suckers: He gets a free ride to the White House, and all we get is a lousy hat.”

Obviously, Romney changed his tune for a place in the party of Trump.

Sticking with Trump cost Republicans the House majority and over 300 state legislative seats this time around. How many more seats in Congress and statehouses across the country are they willing to sacrifice on the altar of Trumpism? Will any Republicans step forward to try to reclaim the soul of their party before Trump further corrupts it?

Amazingly, The Wall Street Journal’s conservative editorial page came to a similar conclusion about the danger of Trump replacing the Republican brand with his name.

“Unlike Richard Nixon or Ronald Reagan, Mr. Trump has made no effort to build a larger coalition than the minority who helped win the Presidency narrowly over Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' Cuba readies for life without Castro Chelsea Clinton: Pics of Trump getting vaccinated would help him 'claim credit' MORE,” the Journal wrote. “Instead he has played constantly to his base who are already loyal. If he wants to be re-elected, he will have to win over more suburban Republicans and independents.”

Let’s hope the blue wave comes in 2020.

639,Williams,Juan,foxnews,"After the final results came in on election night 2016, I walked away from the bright lights of Fox Election Headquarters and into the dark night more than a little upset, even angered by Donald J. Trump’s victory.

I could not believe that my fellow citizens would elect a president with zero experience in government, a history of racist and misogynistic statements, and a volatile personality that invites legitimate questions about his fitness for office.

I was not alone in my feelings.

Like the majority of Americans, I voted for Hillary Clinton two years ago. Trump lost the popular vote and only won because of the anachronistic rules of the Electoral College.

But that was then and the midterm elections being held Tuesday are being played by different rules.

Unlike 2016, there is no Electoral College in the midterm elections to distort the popular will of the American people.

In every congressional district, in every race for the U.S. Senate, in every gubernatorial race and in every race for seats in state legislatures and other state and local offices, the candidate who gets the most votes wins.

But the elections underway Tuesday do come with one big – or to use Trump-like language, “HUGE” – similarity to 2016.

Trump’s name was on every ballot last time. And Trump’s name might as well be on every ballot this time.

“Sixty percent of registered voters, the highest in recent midterm elections, say they are using their vote this year to send a message about the president,” according to a Gallup Poll released last week.

Gallup found a plurality of Americans – 34 percent – planned to use their vote to signal opposition to President Trump. Another 26 percent said they planned to cast a vote to support the president.

And a Wall Street Journal/NBC News Poll released last week found “59 percent of registered voters say they want a ‘great deal’ or ‘quite a bit’ of change from the way President Trump has been leading the country.”

If you like the direction that Trump has moved the country towards and want more of what you have seen over the last two years, you will vote Republican.

If you do not like the direction Trump has taken us and believe he needs to be checked and his divisive brand of politics arrested, you will vote Democratic.

It’s just that binary. It’s just that simple.

If the midterm elections play within that framework it is good news for the Democrats.

In fact, the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll – also released last week – found 52 percent of voters said they will vote Democratic and 44 percent said they will choose the Republican.

That’s why the polls strongly favor an outcome in which the Democrats win the 23 seats necessary for them to claim the majority in the House.

But with so many Senate races in states that went big for Trump in 2016, I am still predicting Republicans will hold the Senate majority.

Democratic Speaker of the House Tip O’Neill once famously said that all politics is local.

So even with President Trump dominating the political landscape, the Democrats have focused on political messages for the midterms that speak to local issues – specifically, the high cost of health care and prescription drugs.

And Democrats have largely stayed away from direct attacks on the president. Instead, their focus has been on fielding good candidates – including a lot of veterans and women – who have strong local appeal.

One such candidate is Lizzie Pannill Fletcher, the Democrat running in Texas’ 7th Congressional District – the western suburbs of Houston. She is running against nine-term incumbent Republican Rep. John Culberson.

In 2016 voters in the district re-elected Culberson, while at the same time voting for Hillary Clinton over Trump. The district is one of 23 represented by a GOP incumbent that went for Clinton.

Like many of the 2018 class of Democratic House candidates, Fletcher has focused on protecting the Affordable Care Act and bringing much-needed federal infrastructure dollars to the district. These Democratic candidates are connecting the dots to show how the Trump-led GOP has hurt, not helped, efforts to solve these important local problems.

This has put Culberson and Republicans like him in an extremely difficult position. He needs to walk a political tight rope – trying to turn out his hardcore, Trump-loving base of Republicans and not turn off the suburban independent voters he needs to put him over the top.

Culberson explained it this way to my friend and Fox News colleague Leland Vittert on “America’s Election Headquarters” this past weekend.

“This election is especially important to Texas, to the country, because if Democrats win District 7, Nancy Pelosi will be speaker of the House,” Culberson said. “This is one of the decisive races for the entire nation and so I'm working hard to turn out every Republican vote to make sure that doesn't happen.”

But despite the GOP’s best efforts, the midterm elections will not be a referendum on Nancy Pelosi. They will be a referendum on President Trump.

Culberson’s name appears on the ballot. But his name and the name of every other Republican candidate serves as a stand-in for Donald Trump.

In the final weeks of the campaign, President Trump has been barnstorming for GOP candidates saying plainly, “A Vote for (insert GOP candidate) is a Vote for Trump.”

For once, Trump is right. And the voters are now having their say.",-1,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/juan-williams-midterm-elections-are-all-about-president-trump

797,Williams,Juan,thehill,"The results are in!

No, not the outcome of tomorrow’s midterm elections.

I’m talking about the winner of 2018 when it comes to political advertising, stump speeches and social media campaigns.

ADVERTISEMENT

On every platform for political messaging, the number one issue driving voters is healthcare.

Talk about a comeback.

In 2010, Tea Party opposition to ObamaCare led the GOP to pick up 63 seats in the House and expand their Senate majority by six seats. At that time, polls showed the Affordable Care Act was viewed unfavorably by a plurality of Americans.

Fast forward to the 2018 midterms. With support for ObamaCare as their top talking point — and some among them even calling for a more extensive, single-payer system — Democrats are projected to capture the House majority.

An October survey from National Nurses United found 225 Democratic House candidates running campaigns with explicit calls for a single-payer, government healthcare plan.

An American Barometer poll taken for The Hill.TV last month found that a majority of self-described Republicans, 52 percent, support single payer.

The polling explains why healthcare is the hot potato of 2018 politics.

It also explains why Democrats are reminding voters of the 60 times Republicans in the House voted to repeal ObamaCare. Of course, the Democrats are also mentioning that, despite the current GOP majorities in both the House and Senate, the Republicans failed to create a better plan.

“We’re making sure that the American people know about the voting records of our Republican colleagues when it comes to health care — voting to take away protections for people with pre-existing conditions.” Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Ben Ray Lujan of New Mexico recently told Chris Wallace on “Fox News Sunday.”

It is obvious what is driving the surge in popularity for the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Americans like being able to buy insurance even if they have a pre-existing condition; they do not want insurance companies to increase premiums when they get sick; and they want insurance to cover essential health services like ambulance rides, substance abuse treatment and mental health counseling.

In August, Kaiser Family Foundation polling found a whopping 75 percent of Americans saying it is “very important” that ObamaCare stops insurance companies from denying insurance coverage to people with a pre-existing condition.

By the way, that includes 86 percent of Democrats, 75 percent of independents, and 58 percent of Republicans.

This incredible rebound in support for the ACA comes despite eight years of Republicans in Congress shamelessly trying to sabotage it.

It was just last December that the GOP majority in Congress repealed the ACA’s mandate for all Americans to have health insurance — a provision which financially stabilized healthcare markets by requiring people to get insurance before they got sick.

In addition to undoing the mandate in an attempt to kill off ObamaCare on the national level, several Republican governors refused to expand Medicaid in their states. They turned away money from the ACA to pay medical bills for the sickest, most vulnerable residents of their states.

That rejection proved unpopular.

It is currently hurting one such Republican governor, Florida’s Rick Scott, as he runs for the U.S. Senate. And even in deep red states such as Utah and Nebraska, voters are now projected to pass ballot initiatives to expand Medicaid over the objections of GOP state officials.

Far from wanting an end to the ACA, voters in both parties are telling pollsters they want a single-payer, government health system, opening the door to a plan that provides a safety net for people in need of health insurance. That’s the plan Sen. Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersOvernight Energy: Treasury creates hub to fight climate change through finance | Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez introduce 'Green New Deal for Public Housing' | Don't attack Zoom for its Bernie Sanders federal tax bill Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez introduce 'Green New Deal for Public Housing' MORE (I-Vt.) has backed for years despite complaints about “socialism” from the GOP.

Sanders currently has 16 co-sponsors in the Senate for a bill to make single payer into law.

His backers include many of the Democratic Party’s 2020 presidential frontrunners, including Sens.

Even President Obama is now giving his support to the single-payer proposal.

“Democrats aren't just running on good old ideas like a higher minimum wage, they're running on good new ideas like Medicare for all,” Obama said in September.

An August Reuters/Ipsos poll found 70 percent of Americans support Medicare for all. It found 52 percent Republican support and 85 percent support among Democrats.

But with polls moving in the direction of support for the plan there is going to be rising pressure on Democrats to deliver a floor vote on the single-payer plan.

The first two years of the Trump presidency have been a rollercoaster. Wouldn’t it be the ultimate twist and turn if Trump’s wild ride comes to a stop because a pro-health care argument puts Democrats back in charge of Congress?

1470,Williams,Juan,thehill,"Seventeen U.S. intelligence agencies — including the CIA and the NSA — long ago concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 elections.

So what about next week’s 2018 midterm elections?

Are we heading for part two of this horror movie?

“I am concerned that the Russians never left,” Rep. Mike Quigley (D-Ill.), a member of the House Intelligence Committee, told CBS News over the summer.

In a classic example of closing the barn door after the horses have run out, the U.S. Cyber Command belatedly announced last week the start of an effort to slow Russian interference in the midterms. In February, Mike Rogers Michael (Mike) Dennis RogersFive questions about Biden withdrawal from Afghanistan Congress brings back corrupt, costly, and inequitably earmarks Biden defense budget criticized by Republicans, progressives alike MORE, the former head of the NSA, said Trump had not asked intelligence agencies to do anything to counter the Russians.

Meanwhile, National Security Adviser John Bolton looks to be preparing to avoid blame for any foreign interference in this year’s election. He recently announced that he warned the Russians that any more interference is “intolerable.”

But in September, the Trump White House blocked passage of the Secure Elections Act which had bipartisan support and aimed to keep this year’s election safe from cyberattacks.

The failure to act came as Facebook admitted that phony social media postings by the Russians reached 126 million people on its platform; Twitter has acknowledged 50,000 fake foreign accounts.

The Justice Department charged another Russian national this month with interfering in the 2016 election, specifically through a “troll farm.”

The criminal complaint said Russia wants “to inflame passions on a wide variety of topics, including immigration, gun control, and the Second Amendment, the Confederate flag, race relations, LGBT issues, the Women’s March, and the NFL national anthem debate,” to undermine trust in government and elections.

Then last week someone sent bombs in an attempt to murder Democrats — including President Obama, Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' Cuba readies for life without Castro Chelsea Clinton: Pics of Trump getting vaccinated would help him 'claim credit' MORE, several sitting members of Congress, a former attorney general, and a former CIA director.

President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE, incredibly, blamed reporters for the attempted assassinations.

""The media also has a responsibility to set a civil tone and to stop the endless hostilities…false attacks and stories,"" Trump tweeted, as bomb-sniffing dogs were still scouring New York.

Somehow, Trump failed to mention the Russians’ ongoing effort to foment distrust by setting Americans against Americans.

And he made no mention of his own words supporting violence against his political critics, such as implying during the 2016 race that “Second Amendment people” — gun owners — might take care of Hillary Clinton. And don’t forget his continuing attack on the American press as the “enemy of the people.”

“You rev people up and what happens?” Ohio’s Republican Gov. John Kasich said, in comments directed at Trump after the bombs were discovered. “Somebody out there who is unstable does something crazy. And that is what I think we are seeing here.”

Last week, I saw firsthand the power of the bad example set by Trump and the Russians.

“Hi. I’m one of your trolls!” a middle-aged man said to me in Dallas. I was there filming Fox News’ “The Five” on the campus of Southern Methodist University.

A manic grin on his face, he pulled out his iPhone and asked, “Can I have a picture?”

Usually, I’m happy to oblige fans. Their request is usually preceded by some version of “I disagree with you, but I enjoy watching you fight it out on Fox.”

I’ve always thought of it as a small celebration of free speech. We are able to disagree without being disagreeable.

But this was the first time someone was brazen enough to identify themselves as a troll and tell me with a laugh that he had fun trashing my new book in nasty, fake online reviews without reading it.

Then, as if he was sharing a harmless insiders’ joke, he whispered about having described me online with a racial epithet. There were too many people around for me to respond. I let him take his selfie picture and go away.

The Russian despot Vladimir Lenin once spoke of “useful idiots” who could help the Soviet Union spread its propaganda in the West without knowing they were helping America’s enemy.

Now, Russia has a new army of “useful idiots” — including the guy in Dallas — in their new war against the U.S.

These trolls may not know they’re being used. Or worse, they may not care. A popular meme in conservative circles these days is “better a Russian than a Democrat.”

Radio talk show host Alex Jones famously charged that the massacre of children at the Sandy Hook elementary school was “completely fake” and that the terrorist attacks on September 11th were an “inside job.” Most Americans shunned him. Yet then-candidate Donald Trump appeared on Jones’ show and praised his “amazing reputation.”

This digital swamp of toxic rhetoric and conspiracy theories proved a fertile breeding ground for the Russian cyberattack on the 2016 elections.

Is the US too polarized to defeat this hostile foreign threat? We will get our first clear answer when Americans vote next week.

2182,Williams,Juan,thehill,"Just 15 days from Election Day, the GOP is still looking for a message beyond tribal, blind support for President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE.

The cornerstone of the GOP’s midterm campaign plan was supposed to be the Trump tax cuts. But that message failed so badly that GOP candidates have stopped mentioning it.

More than 80 percent of the law’s benefits went to the wealthiest one percent of Americans. And thanks to a Treasury Department report last week, even Trump supporters now have to admit that the tax cuts have pushed the federal budget deficit up nearly 17 percent since 2017.

So political advertising about the issue has virtually disappeared.

“Of the 31,200 broadcast ads the [GOP’s Congressional Leadership Fund] put out in the first nine months of 2018, just 17.3 percent referred to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the most significant piece of legislation this Congress has passed,” Vox calculated last week.

The Democrats, meanwhile, are having success with political ads focused on lowering the high cost of prescription drugs and healthcare while keeping insurance plans for people with preexisting illnesses. ObamaCare is now more popular than the Trump tax cuts with voters.

“Fifty percent of Democratic ad spending is on health care. In September alone, Democrats ran more than 130,000 ads on health care,” according to the group “Protect Our Care,” which did an analysis of this year’s political TV advertising.

Keep in mind that voters concerned with healthcare prefer Democrats on the issue by a staggering 24 percentage points, according to a Fox News poll.

With the demise of their tax cut message — and the success of the Democrats’ health care message — the GOP switched to claims that Justice Brett Kavanaugh Brett Michael KavanaughBiden's court-packing theater could tame the Supreme Court's conservatives Trump knocks CNN for 'completely false' report Gaetz was denied meeting NY Times beclowns itself by normalizing court-packing 'to balance the conservative majority' MORE was treated unfairly by Democrats. The intent was clearly to stir up the conservative base.

But an ABC News/Washington Post poll last week found that 51 percent of voters disapprove of the Senate’s vote to confirm Kavanaugh. Just 41 percent approve.

The lack of a potent political message from the GOP is reflected in the latest polls.

Democrats hold a 7.7-point advantage when voters are asked which party they want to control Congress. The RealClearPolitics average of polls also finds 71.9 percent of voters disapprove of the GOP-led Congress’ job performance. And a majority, 52 percent, also disapprove of Trump’s performance.

These bad polls and the lack of a message has left Republican candidates with only the fear card left to play.

The GOP is running television advertisements in some of its tightest House races suggesting that Democratic challengers with brown skin and foreign-sounding names support terrorism.

Here are some of the lowlights as reported by the New York Times:

— In California, Republican incumbent Rep. Duncan Hunter Duncan HunterTrump denies Gaetz asked him for blanket pardon Gaetz, on the ropes, finds few friends in GOP Trust, transparency, and tithing is not enough to sustain democracy MORE is running an ad accusing his opponent of being a “radical Muslim” who tried to “infiltrate Congress.”

Ammar Campa-Najja, the Democrat, is an American of Palestinian and Mexican ancestry who worked in President Obama’s White House.

Hunter labeled him a “security threat” because a distant relative may have had some connection to the 1972 Munich Olympics attack. A Washington Post factcheck called Hunter’s advertising false and misleading.

— In Ohio, Republicans ran an ad against Democrat Aftab Pureval, suggesting that he supported terrorism backed by the late dictator Muammar Gaddafi’s regime in Libya. The only basis for that claim is that Pureval worked at a law firm that handled some Congressionally-mandated settlements for terrorism lawsuits against Libya.

Pureval never worked on the settlements in question but the GOP is desperate to protect incumbent Rep. Steve Chabot Steven (Steve) Joseph ChabotREAD: The Republicans who voted to challenge election results House Republicans who didn't sign onto the Texas lawsuit Top GOP lawmaker touts 'more flexible' PPP loans in bipartisan proposal MORE.

— In Virginia, Republicans are trying to save Rep. Dave Brat by running an ad claiming his opponent, a former CIA operative, “doesn't want us [voters] to know that she taught at an Islamic school nicknamed 'Terror High,' a terrorist breeding ground.”

In reality, the school is an elite religious, prep school of Islamic Americans — the kind of religious private school Republicans typically support through voucher programs.

Republicans going low to stir anxiety about terrorism and fear of Muslim immigrants is nothing new.

In 2002, Republicans famously ran an ad in Georgia likening Democratic Sen. Max Cleland, who lost limbs in the Vietnam War, to Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein. Cleland lost his race to Republican Saxby Chambliss Clarence (Saxby) Saxby ChamblissLive coverage: Georgia Senate runoffs Trump, Biden face new head-to-head contest in Georgia Ex-GOP senator from Georgia suffers mild stroke: report MORE.

The difference this year is that the GOP’s ugly ads come on top of constant attacks on immigrants from Trump.

In the final weeks of this campaign, Trump is still defending his barbaric policy of separating immigrant children from their parents at the border — even though the policy failed to slow the rate of people crossing the border.

A new report by Amnesty International counted more than 6,000 people, including 3,000 children, who have been separated from their families this year since Trump began enforcing this policy.

There are still hundreds of children who have not been reunited with their families. Over the summer, immigrant toddlers — some under the age of 3 — were being ordered to appear in court alone for their deportation proceedings.

With just over two weeks to go, we are now getting a clear picture of what the GOP’s closing argument will be to voters in the 2018 Midterms.

It will be anti-immigrant bigotry.

This is the frightening, ghoulish state of American politics in October 2018.

2385,Williams,Juan,foxnews,"Around this time last month, I wrote a piece for Fox News headlined “Why I am still betting on Republicans to hold the Senate (but check with me in a month).”

Since then, readers have been checking in via email and social media to see what I think will happen with House races in the Nov. 6 midterm elections. Let me remind everyone to take what I say with a lot of salt – after all, I predicted a Hillary Clinton win in 2016!

So while leading pollsters, such as FiveThirtyEight.com, forecast a 6 in 7 chance of Democrats winning enough seats to control the House, you can also turn those numbers around. It is also true that FiveThirtyEight.com is predicting a 14.2 percent chance that Republicans hold the House majority.

That means the GOP has better odds of winning than gamblers holding lottery tickets. That gives Republicans reason to hope that the “Blue Wave of 2018” will go down in history along with Clinton’s fabled Electoral College “Blue Wall” of 2016.

OK, now – with a big helping of humility – here are my predictions based on the best available polling, fundraising data and 40 years of experience covering political campaigns.

Like the baseball umpire said, “I calls ‘em like I sees ‘em.”

At the moment, the Democrats look to have the wind at their backs as they try to gain the House majority.

The Republicans, similarly, have the lead as we enter the homestretch of the campaign in their fight to hold onto their majority in the Senate. But having written about the Senate races last month, let’s stick with the House races this time.

The Democrats need at least 24 seats to flip the House majority. Let’s go to the map to see how they can get there.

For starters, there are seven districts in deep blue California that are currently represented by Republicans but that went for Clinton in 2016.

California law requires congressional districts to be drawn by a nonpartisan citizens’ redistricting commission. This has all but eliminated any gerrymandering edge California Republicans could have counted on in previous elections.

By my count, the Democrats have every reason to be confident of winning seven House seats in California. Add to that 16 more GOP-held districts outside of the Golden State where Clinton beat Trump.

Let’s be extremely generous and say that GOP manages to hold onto four of those 16, leaving the Dems with a pickup of 19 seats.

The GOP is also defending nine House districts where Trump won by less than eight points.

And Republicans are also defending the seats of two members – Chris Collins in New York and Duncan Hunter Jr. in California – where the incumbent is under indictment on federal corruption charges.

In addition, The Hill newspaper reported last week that “ more than 70 Democratic House hopefuls outraised Republican incumbents in the third quarter of 2018 … giving them a sharp financial edge in the final stretch of the midterms.”

Then there are the wildcard House races – and there are more of those than in past midterms.

The reason is that Democrats have fielded some impressive candidates who are surprisingly competitive in red Trump congressional districts. These Democrats include:

Amy McGrath, a former Marine fighter pilot. She could well knock off incumbent GOP Rep. Andy Barr in Kentucky’s 6th Congressional District.

St. Clair County State’s Attorney Brendan Kelly, also a Navy veteran. He is well-positioned to win his bid to replace incumbent Republican Rep. Mike Bost in Illinois’ 12th Congressional District.

Richard Ojeda, an outspoken retired U.S. Army officer. He is polling within the margin of error against the Republican in West Virginia’s 3rd Congressional District.

Republicans have only one path to preserving their majority in the House: they need to run the table. Meanwhile, Democrats have multiple plausible paths to net the 24 seats they need.

And never forget, a Democratic majority in the House means that key House committees – Intelligence, Government Operations, and Judiciary – will have subpoena power that will enable them to keep an eye on the Trump White House.

President Trump told The Associated Press recently that he thinks it would be unfair to blame him if the GOP loses the House majority. Even as many of the races become referendums on the Trump presidency – and disapproval of his presidency remains higher than his approval numbers – the president described himself as “helping people.”

But it is hard to see how continually insulting women by demeaning their looks – the president recently stirred that pot by referring to Stormy Daniels as “Horseface” – is going to help Republican candidates with women voters.

President Trump’s most loyal supporters may try to ignore such nasty remarks or even find them funny – definitely not politically correct – but polls already show college-educated white women voting against Republicans in November.

As for the Senate, I am still betting that Republicans hold that chamber and that Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky will continue to be the Senate Majority Leader in the 116th Congress.

The Senate races in Texas, Tennessee and North Dakota all seem to be breaking for the Republicans.

In North Dakota, for instance, the latest Fox News poll showed Republican Rep. Kevin Cramer beating incumbent Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp by 12 points. Heitkamp’s vote against confirming Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court seems to have sealed her fate in a state Trump won by more than 36 points.

The most recent polls also show Republicans Sen. Dean Heller in Nevada and Rep. Martha McSally in Arizona in close Senate races in states with a history of voting for conservatives. An Emerson College poll shows Heller with a 7-point-lead. The latest RealClearPolitics average shows McSally ahead but well within the margin of error.

So Republicans can breathe a sigh of relief – the Senate looks safe even as the House looks to be a good bet for Democrats.

But midterm elections are still more than two weeks away – an eternity politics, especially in the Trump era.",-1,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/juan-williams-republicans-theres-almost-no-way-you-will-hold-the-house-dems-have-the-wind-at-their-back

Having undermined trust in major American institutions, from the CIA to the FBI, last week Trump stuck a knife in the heart of the public’s trust in the Supreme Court.

After a series of polarizing confirmation hearings for a nominee whom polls show to be broadly unpopular, the president staged a crass political rally at the White House, including a superfluous swearing-in ceremony for Justice Brett Kavanaugh Brett Michael KavanaughBiden's court-packing theater could tame the Supreme Court's conservatives Trump knocks CNN for 'completely false' report Gaetz was denied meeting NY Times beclowns itself by normalizing court-packing 'to balance the conservative majority' MORE.

Incredibly, the justices of the highest court allowed themselves to be used as front-row props for the cameras while Trump took credit for crushing Democrats.

Victorious Senate Republicans patted each other on the back at this East Room hootenanny while sharing laughs with conservative ideologues from the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation.

In an era of extreme political division, the cynics have been proven right: The Supreme Court has become just another partisan arm of government, a rubber stamp for whichever party has the power to force its allies into the majority.

The Supreme Court is supposed to be an independent branch of government, equal to the Congress and the executive branch. The justices are given lifetime seats on the court as a buffer from political pressures.

Trump took a hammer to all that pretense.

He began by apologizing to Kavanaugh “on behalf of the nation,” ignoring the plurality of Americans still opposed to having him on the bench. Then he falsely claimed that Kavanaugh had been “proven innocent.”

There was not one word of sympathy for Christine Blasey Ford or any other American woman living with the trauma of sexual assault. Keep in mind that Trump said he found Ford’s testimony “compelling,” before later mocking her at one of his rallies.

Kavanaugh was no better. He used his time at the White House to heap thanks on Trump and Senate Republicans — by name.

Such a submissive show of political allegiance invites doubt about Kavanaugh’s ability to be impartial when a case comes before him with Trump as a named litigant.

The complete lack of grace also cements the current Supreme Court’s reputation as Trump’s rubber stamp on the most contentious issues of the day – from abortion to immigration to voting rights to his right to refuse subpoenas and stop the Russia probe.

Trump and Kavanaugh’s pitiful performance stands in contrast to the calls for reconciliation by another Republican president and a newly-confirmed conservative Supreme Court Justice 27 years ago.

Justice Clarence Thomas’ confirmation hearings were every bit as divisive as Justice Kavanaugh’s hearings.

The difference is that President George H.W. Bush and Thomas understood the importance of preserving trust in the court.

“This is more a time for healing, not a time for anger or animus or animosity. We have to put these things behind us and go forward,"" Justice Thomas said outside his suburban house after being confirmed in 1991.

Thomas and Bush did not spike the football. They did not turn the hearings into a political weapon and brandish it to excite their conservative base.

Trump’s damage to the court fits with the damage he has done to the CIA, the FBI, the Justice Department and the House Intelligence Committee under Chairman Devin Nunes Devin Gerald NunesFormer GOP operative installed as NSA top lawyer resigns Sunday shows preview: Russia, US exchange sanctions; tensions over policing rise; vaccination campaign continues Overnight Defense: Administration says 'low to moderate confidence' Russia behind Afghanistan troop bounties | 'Low to medium risk' of Russia invading Ukraine in next few weeks | Intelligence leaders face sharp questions during House worldwide threats he MORE (R-Calif.).

The Trump playbook is clear — if an institution or an individual does not agree with him, it is to be dismissed as part of the “deep state” conspiracy against him.

“Law and order” now joins “free trade” and “deficit hawk” in the ash heap of once-sacred GOP slogans jettisoned by Trump.

Trump has been called the “great disruptor” but it would better to label him as the “great destroyer” of trust in government as he goes about dividing Americans from each other.

Former Republican Secretary of State Colin Powell recently said this about Trump: ""My favorite three words in our Constitution is the first three words: 'We the People…

""But recently it's become, 'Me the president,' as opposed to, 'We the People.' And you see things that should not be happening…

""I hope the president can come to the realization that he should really stop insulting people. ... I don't think that's what should be coming out of a president of the United States,"" Powell added.

Sadly, Powell’s plea fell on deaf ears.

At a public rally after Kavanaugh was confirmed, Trump led the crowd in a familiar chant of “Lock her up!” — this time directed at the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, Sen. Dianne Feinstein Dianne Emiel FeinsteinSenate Democrats call on Biden to restore oversight of semiautomatic and sniper rifle exports Overnight Defense: Army moves to combat sexual crimes | Eight West Point cadets expelled | Democratic senators want to restrict F-35 sale to UAE A proposal to tackle congressional inside trading: Invest in the US MORE (D-Calif.).

He accuses the Democrats of being an “angry mob.” But faced with a real and menacing mob in Charlottesville, Va., last year he backed the white nationalists by saying they were “fine people.”

In the classic 1962 movie The Manchurian Candidate, a fictional senator warned against ignoring a politician who finds political advantage in falsely charging other Americans with being communists and socialists.

He explained the damage to America: “I think, if John Iselin were a paid Soviet agent, he could not do more to harm this country than he’s doing now.”

Well, if Trump were a paid Soviet agent, he could not do more harm to this country than he did last week.

3629,Williams,Juan,thehill,"The odds favor the GOP keeping its Senate majority in November.

But what if Republicans beat the odds and also keep the House?

Can anyone unite the bitter, dysfunctional GOP House conference, which remains at the heart of the federal government dysfunction and has the lowest public approval rating of any branch of government?

Since Ryan became Speaker in 2015, one major thing has changed: the takeover of the GOP by Donald J. Trump.

Since then, the same House conservatives who rendered Ryan and Boehner incapable of governing or passing major legislation have kept their seats. Meanwhile, GOP moderates have fled in a season of record Republican retirements.

Most of the Freedom Caucus members hail from safe red districts, often gerrymandered, and they are likely to return in the 116th Congress with increased seniority.

They will be representing the Rush Limbaugh-Sean Hannity-Drudge Report fans who say Republicans need to be even more combative and enthusiastic in their support of President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE.

To win favor with the far-right corner of the House GOP, McCarthy developed a close personal relationship with Trump. He has remained one of the few members of Congress to regularly talk, visit and golf with the president.

McCarthy is a Trump apologist and makes no apologies about it.

With that crass strategy in play, McCarthy has stiff-armed House Majority Whip Steve Scalise Stephen (Steve) Joseph ScaliseRepublicans who backed Trump impeachment see fundraising boost Wall Street spent .9B on campaigns, lobbying in 2020 election: study Scalise: House would 'take action' against Gaetz if DOJ filed charges MORE (R-La.) and other hard-right members for the top spot.

McCarthy will inherit a GOP majority that since the 2010 elections has proven itself incapable of delivering on its campaign promises. In the last two years, they have fallen flat on almost all of President Trump's campaign promises as well.

Here's their sad record:

They didn't pass ""repeal and replacement"" of ObamaCare as they said they would.

They did nothing to bring down the national debt or balance the federal budget. In fact, they blew another trillion dollar hole in it with recent tax cuts for the wealthy.

There is no plan or funding to build a border wall.

And they have no plan for comprehensive immigration reform or a permanent fix for young people who grew up here or even served in the military — the so-called Dreamers.

Finally, they have no plan to get control of entitlement spending. That was Ryan's dream from his first day in Congress and it never happened.

The House GOP did, however, vote to raise the debt ceiling and voted to fully fund Planned Parenthood.

Are far-right voters screaming yet?

After the GOP Congress sent Trump a $1.3 trillion spending bill in March, he signed it saying ""I'll never sign another bill like this again.”

Last week, lo and behold, the president signed another bill just like the March omnibus. This one has more deficit spending and again, no border wall.

The Congressional GOP did pass the Trump tax cuts but they have been a dud with voters who realize that 80 percent of the benefits go to the wealthiest one percent of Americans.

A voter who backed any of these so-called conservative Republicans in the last four elections deserves to get his or her vote back. Conservative voters were given a lot of red meat on the campaign trail and in their media diet but only now can see they bought the sizzle and never got the steak.

A McCarthy-led House GOP would have one job and one job only: to defend Trump from Democratic attacks, investigations, and impeachment proceedings. They have already shown they are willing to do that.

Let’s not forget it was Ryan who allowed House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes Devin Gerald NunesFormer GOP operative installed as NSA top lawyer resigns Sunday shows preview: Russia, US exchange sanctions; tensions over policing rise; vaccination campaign continues Overnight Defense: Administration says 'low to moderate confidence' Russia behind Afghanistan troop bounties | 'Low to medium risk' of Russia invading Ukraine in next few weeks | Intelligence leaders face sharp questions during House worldwide threats he MORE (R-Calif.) to run wild. Nunes protected Trump from the Russia probe.

Ryan spent eight years carping about the need for more oversight of President Obama but when it when he came time to provide oversight of Trump, he did nothing.

And when Ryan's political obituary is written — or when he attempts a political comeback as, say, Governor of Wisconsin — he will have to explain his failure to stand up to Trump.

Since Article One of the Constitution requires impeachment proceedings begin in the House of Representatives, the most consequential political battle of 2019 will not be between Donald Trump and Bob Mueller.

It may well be between two Californians — House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiWhite House readies for Chauvin verdict House GOP's McClain responds to Pelosi calling her 'that woman' GOP struggles to rein in nativism MORE (D) and McCarthy — as they try to control their members in the 116th Congress.

4277,Williams,Juan,thehill,"Is it really shocking that so many black Americans think the White House is currently occupied by a white supremacist?

The better question is this: Why do so many white Republicans look past Trump’s racist comments and policies?

The facts are evident.

ADVERTISEMENT

Rapper Snoop Dogg expressed his feelings in profane terms during a Sirius XM interview last week, saying that he believed anyone who liked Trump was “[expletive] racist.”

Here’s Mandela Barnes, the Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor of Wisconsin, expressing the same frustration albeit in more erudite terms:

“The Trump administration has shown they have this over-willingness to make people feel less than human,"" Barnes said.

He pointed to Trump separating migrant children from their parents as well as a litany of racist comments.

""It speaks to the way they treat people at the border, it speaks to the whole concept of building a wall. It’s like a race to create a superior race in many aspects, and it can seem very extreme but that is the direction that we are headed. We have to do everything that we can to stop it.""

In my new book “‘What the Hell Do You Have to Lose?’ — Trump’s War on Civil Rights,” I document the racial division created by the president through his words and deeds.

Trump is distorting American identity by making it into a club that only admits his fans.

The alarm among black Americans is reflected in a USC/Los Angeles Times poll released last week showing 91 percent of African-American voters disapproved of his handling of race relations. Just 26 percent of Americans of all races approve of Trump’s handling of race relations.

Those findings confirm a Fox News poll that found 58 percent of Americans disapprove of Trump’s handling of race relations. Another poll by Politico/Morning Consult found that 55 percent say race relations are worse under this president. And 49 percent say outright Trump is a racist, according to a Quinnipiac University poll done this summer.

But Trump has persuaded his followers to treat his racism as a minor issue, a quirk not sufficient for any white Republican to stop backing him.

He pushes the fear button to stir anxiety among white Americans against people with different skin colors and then excuses it as just talk.

But there are new policies and practices behind the talk that can’t be ignored.

The reality is Trump has no senior black person in the White House advising him on issues of racial justice. Nor does he have any white advisers with a record of working to advance civil rights issues.

He does, however, have a cadre of current and former white advisers like the stridently anti-illegal immigration Stephen Miller, as well as Stephen Bannon and Sebastian Gorka Sebastian Lukacs GorkaGreitens Senate bid creates headache for GOP YouTube bans Sebastian Gorka's channel after repeated violations Lou Dobbs retweets supporters blasting decision to cancel show MORE, who have disturbing ties to the alt-right movement, which is associated with white nationalism.

In this way, Trump is an outlier to all modern Republican presidents. The absence of constructive advisers on racial issues stands in contrast to Republican past presidents.

President Eisenhower had E. Frederick Murrow advising him at the dawn of the civil rights movement. President Nixon had Bob Brown advising him in the White House.

If Trump had advisers in this tradition, they might be able to challenge him on the policies that are ripping at the fabric of racial comity that has held Americans of all colors together for most of my lifetime.

These policies include proposals to cut the number of legal immigrants; eliminating programs to spur the growth of minority-owned businesses; and even removing requirements for all contractors to prove they have good records of hiring women and black people.

Trump doesn’t see the real harm these policies cause to people of color. He only sees an opportunity to roll back more Obama-era regulations.

The Trump administration has repeatedly targeted community development institutions and initiatives as well as block grants for community development. He’s also opposed protections to guarantee white-collar workers overtime pay, something that hits especially hard against minorities climbing the economic ladder.

In Trump’s distorted view, there are only two types of black people: wealthy entertainers and athletes on one side, and poor people on the other. He has no appreciation of the growing black middle class.

He seems to have never dealt with black entrepreneurs or top black policymakers. He has no idea that the majority of black Americans are now firmly in the middle class, with 40 percent earning between $35,000 and $100,000 per year, and 12 percent more earning between $100,000 and $200,000.

That kind of ambition and industry should be celebrated, not derided, by the nation’s leader.

The new Trumpian brand of racialist politics is on full display in Florida’s gubernatorial race.

Trump-backed GOP nominee Ron DeSantis Ron DeSantisDeSantis signs 'anti-riot bill' cracking down on 'public disorder' WHO panel comes out against requiring vaccination proof for travel Parade of 2024 GOP hopefuls court House conservatives MORE, a former congressman, is running against the mayor of Tallahassee, Andrew Gillum, who is African American.

DeSantis kicked off his campaign by saying Gillum would “monkey up” the state’s economy. DeSantis denied any racial connotations to his remark.

Though I’m only at the start of my book tour, the question I am most frequently asked by interviewers and readers is whether I think Trump is a racist.

I try, as best I can, to avoid that label because I don’t think labels are particularly helpful at this point in our history. Moreover, that label might shut down real and important conversations about race relations with white Americans.

The better question, to my mind, remains how so many white Republicans can close their eyes to the damage Trump is doing to American race relations.

4475,Williams,Juan,foxnews,"Editor's note: Excerpted from “What The Hell Do You Have to Lose? Trump’s War on Civil Rights.

After President Kennedy was shot and killed on November 22, 1963, President Lyndon Baines Johnson made the passage of the Civil Rights Act into an almost spiritual affair, a way to do justice to the dead president.

On the twenty-seventh of November, he told a joint session of Congress: “No memorial oration or eulogy could more eloquently honor President Kennedy’s memory than the earliest possible passage of the civil rights bill for which he fought so long.” On February 10, 1964, the bill passed through the House, 290 to 130.

But sympathy for the assassinated president did not move Southern Democrats.

Richard Russell, the powerful Georgia senator, had long condemned the plan while the president was alive. He called it “a threatened crime against the whole philosophy of liberty,” because it would force white people to associate with black people against their wishes.

Senator John Stennis of Mississippi had called it a “vicious proposal.”

Lister Hill, a senator from Alabama, accused President Kennedy of putting “our most sacred rights . . . on the altar of political expediency.”

Editorials in the South’s leading papers denounced the bill as “another step in the direction toward a dictatorship in this country,” as Mississippi’s Meridian Star newspaper put it.

The Johnson administration knew there would be a Senate filibuster by the Southern segregationists. With the loss of those Democrats they’d need Republican support. The bill had to have sixty-seven votes, the super majority necessary to end the filibuster. Specifically, they’d need more than half of the thirty-three Republicans currently serving in the Senate.

Republicans, almost exclusively from the Northern and Western states outside the South, generally favored civil rights. But they opposed government telling white people that they had no choice but to follow orders and mix with black people. That was seen as an encroachment on individual liberties.

President Johnson identified one Republican as the senator able to convince fellow Republicans in the Senate to back the bill: Everett Dirksen.

Dirksen had promised to support the civil rights bill when the late President Kennedy announced it the previous June. And yet, as a conservative, Dirksen was not completely on board with Title II, the public accommodations provision.

He also took issue with Title VII, which banned employment discrimination. Dirksen wasn’t sure whether it was the job of the Department of Justice to determine and punish the individuals and businesses that were being discriminatory. The central problem posed by the bill, as Dirksen wrote in his private notebook in capital letters, was whether: “congress [can] destroy FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION in the case of privately owned and operated businesses.” With a taste for the dramatic, during a February 1964 press conference, Dirksen said that he took his freedom the way he took his drinks: “Straight.”

A diehard believer in the Senate as an institution, Dirksen also had some major qualms about breaking filibusters. Dirksen had once said they were “the only brake on hasty action.”

And yet, tentatively, and with major reservations, Dirksen went to work.

It’s hard to overestimate the spectacle of it all. On the one hand, the whole world watched as the Senate began to debate the most anticipated bill of the 20th century.

When the expected Southern filibuster began on March 30, 1963, Americans watched as senator after senator from the Southern segregationist bloc delivered racist tirades at the lectern.

At one point, Senator Russell Long of Louisiana argued: “The good Lord did as much segregating as anyone I know of when he put one race in one part of the world and another race in another part of the world.” During a later speech, the senator debated whether “it not be fair to ask what kind of fix the colored folks would be in if they had not been brought to this country, but had been allowed to roam the jungles, with tigers chasing them.”

Senator Jim Eastland of Mississippi said that he had “lived in the south my whole life” and had “not seen the first instance of economic discrimination.”

Senator George Smathers, a Florida Democrat, claimed it was the Southerners who where the real victims of discrimination: “No southerner has been elected president of the United States for more than 100 years. Why? Because of discrimination.”

And Senator Olin Johnston of South Carolina asked whether desegregation was the right move, given that there was more crime in the desegregated North than in the Jim Crow South.

And yet, as all of this absurdity was happening on the Senate floor, here was the sixty-eight-year-old Everett Dirksen, who hadn’t really given much thought to civil rights during his career, suddenly working day in and day out to engineer revisions to the version of the civil rights bill that the House had passed that winter.

His goal was to make it acceptable to small-government conservatives in the Midwest. He assigned a group of lawyers from the Judiciary Committee— nicknamed Dirksen’s Bombers— to go through the bill line by line, looking for wiggle room, particularly in the portions that dealt with public accommodations. They looked for places where the bill’s language could be broadened just enough to assure conservatives that the bill was not an encroachment on individual liberties.

Simultaneously, Dirksen needed to be sure that the changes he proposed were acceptable to Democrats, specifically Majority Leader Mike Mansfield and Majority Whip Hubert Humphrey. They were under pressure from President Lyndon Johnson to make a deal with Dirksen, but the Senate Democrats also faced pressure from NAACP lobbyist Clarence Mitchell and the powerful Washington union lawyer Joe Rauh Jr. not to allow Republicans to gut the bill and repeat the mistakes that had weakened the previous civil rights acts.

All the while, Dirksen maintained a dynamic mental map of his caucus: thirty-three Senate Republicans, seven of whom tilted liberal, five of whom were moderate, and twenty-one of whom, including himself, were conservative. A majority of them would be needed to successfully invoke cloture, a procedural rule designed to counter filibusters by forcing a vote.

And so Dirksen and his Bombers tossed out some amendments while insisting on others. A key instance of the kind of work Dirksen performed was the way he and Majority Leader Mansfield chose to define “discrimination.”

This was crucial, because if the Justice Department found instances of discrimination in public accommodations or employment, they’d be able to bring criminal charges against people and businesses. The issue, as author Charles Garrettson put it in a biography of Senator Humphrey, was “delineating when and to what degree the federal government in general, and the Attorney General specifically, would be authorized to intervene.”

Dirksen and the Democrats’ staff decided that the bill would use the phrase “pattern and practice of discrimination” to describe which businesses and employers the Justice Department would charge with breaking the law.

Dirksen also called for language to prevent the Justice Department from instituting racial quota systems, even for businesses that were found to demonstrate a “pattern and practice of discrimination.” If and when allegations of employment discrimination came up, Dirksen provided for a grace period when state and local governments—not the Justice Department—would have the chance to punish or otherwise deal with the employer who was breaking the law.

Dirksen knew that, in order to get Senate Republicans on board, he also needed them to believe that it wasn’t being shoved down their throats by big-government Democrats.

Meetings were held in Dirksen’s office to reassure Republican senators that he was in charge. In fact, many of the changes that Dirksen made to the House bill weren’t even that major. They were meant to assure Republicans that they controlled the final version of the bill.

By mid-May, Dirksen was feeling confident that he’d be able to get enough votes to invoke cloture. When President Johnson asked Senator Humphrey in a telephone conversation whether “Dirksen [can] get the votes for cloture,” Humphrey responded: “Yes sir, he can get 25 votes. I had dinner with him last night and, Mr. President, we’ve got a much better bill than anybody ever dreamed possible.”

On June 10, the day that had been set to attempt cloture, Dirksen lumbered to the front of the Senate to deliver the most important speech of his career.

The senator was weak on his feet. As he spoke, an aide had to hand him some pills to swallow. Only a few weeks earlier he’d been bedridden with a cold. It wasn’t anything serious. But for the last several months, this sixty-eight-year-old had been working nonstop.

Now that all of this heavy lifting was done, Dirksen decided to skip the nitty-gritty details and frame the bill instead as a biblical battle between Good and Evil: “It is said that on the night he died, Victor Hugo wrote in his diary, substantially, this sentiment: ‘Stronger than all the armies is an idea whose time has come.’ ”

The time had come. When Senator Lee Metcalf, a Montana Democrat, asked the room whether “the debate shall be brought to a close,” seventy-one senators voted to invoke cloture, with only twenty-nine voting “nay.” It was four more votes than President Johnson needed.

Nine days later, the bill passed through the Senate with seventy-three votes.

In a brief White House speech on July 2, President Johnson urged the nation to “hasten that day, when our unmeasured strength, and our unbounded spirit, will be free to do the great works ordained to this nation by the just and wise God, who is the Father of us all.”

He then signed the Civil Rights Act into law. At the end of the ceremony, the president gave souvenirs to the people in attendance, He had used seventy-five pens to sign the law. He handed the first pen to Dirksen, the Republican Senator without whom the bill would not have become a law.

4853,Williams,Juan,dailyamerican,"Under President Donald Trump, the Republican Party has become a very white party.

And going into the midterms, the president and the GOP seem uninterested in protecting black voting rights. They'd rather stir up their base by vilifying black Democrats like Rep. Maxine Waters of California and shouting ""socialist"" at minority Democratic candidates like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Andrew Gillum of Florida.

Trump’s GOP also delights in criticizing black football players for taking a knee during the national anthem to protest police brutality.

Trump considers African-Americans who criticize him unpatriotic, ungrateful and, in the case of the nation’s first black president, Barack Obama, literally un-American.

With the exception of Ben Carson, the secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and Jerome Adams, the surgeon general, the only African-Americans close to the president seem to be people charged with deflecting criticism that Trump’s rhetoric and policies are racist.

Trump missed the rise of the black middle class

From Kanye West to Omarosa Manigault Newman, Diamond and Silk, Jim Brown to Ray Lewis, the African-Americans identified with Trump are neither knowledgeable about Washington politics nor experienced in social policies that affect black America.

They also tend to be upper-class or rich athletes and pop stars. For Trump, the black policy expert does not exist. The black academic does not exist.

To hear Trump talk, America’s black population is synonymous with poverty, unemployment and gunfire in bad neighborhoods. That prompted him to ask the famously disdainful question when trying to persuade black voters to support his 2016 campaign, “What the hell do you have to lose?”

Somehow, he has missed the rise of a striving black middle class in America over the past half-century — the greatest accomplishment of the civil rights movement.

It’s not as if there aren’t prominent, skilled black conservatives who have worked with Republican presidents. What about Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice? Black conservative intellectuals like Thomas Sowell, Glenn Loury, Walter E. Williams and Shelby Steele don’t play major roles in this administration, either.

White people, just mind your business and let people of color exist

Ron DeSantis can't explain away 'monkey this up' comment on Andrew Gillum

Only 3 percent of registered black voters identify with the Republican Party, and just 8 percent of black voters lean Republican. During the 2016 election, according to the Pew Research Center, Trump received just 8 percent of the black vote.

Compare that with the 84 percent of black voters who lean Democrat, the 70 percent who identify as Democrats, and the 88 percent who picked Hillary Clinton in 2016.

There are two black Republicans in the House and one in the Senate. Compare that with the 43 African-American Democrats in the House and two in the Senate.

Thus, there are few black people able to advance Trump’s understanding of black America: no one to tell him that most African-Americans are not “living in hell,” as he said during a 2016 debate; no one to tell him that blaming Charlottesville, Virginia, on “both sides” is both factually incorrect and morally reprehensible.

It is not just the absence of smart black voices around Trump that creates a vacuum. He does not hire white people who have appreciation for the history of the civil rights movement and an understanding of today’s key racial issues.

We need black voices in the White House

To the contrary, Trump hired people like Steve Bannon and Sebastian Gorka, people with ties to the “alt-right” universe of skinheads, neo-Nazis and white supremacists.

The importance of having informed, well-connected, capable black and white voices speaking on civil rights near the president has been demonstrated across U.S. history. At a key moment in the racial turbulence of the 1950s and 1960s, Presidents Dwight Eisenhower, John Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon had skilled black advisers. E. Frederic Morrow served in the Eisenhower administration, Clifford Alexander in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, and Robert Brown in the Nixon White House.

When black children were killed in a bombing in Birmingham, Alabama, and blacks began rioting in big northern cities, Kennedy’s brother, Attorney General Robert Kennedy, made time to meet with leading black scholars, activists and writers.

James Baldwin, the famous writer who led the meeting, told the attorney general that black people could not be pleased with gradual steps toward racial equality. He reminded Kennedy that African-Americans had arrived in America in large numbers before Kennedy’s Irish ancestors — yet here he was asking Kennedy to protect his rights as a U.S. citizen.

The meeting ended abruptly, with the attorney general writing them off as radicals with little to offer in practical solutions. And yet RFK became far more vocal in his support for civil rights following the meeting. It was, in part, due to his prodding that JFK delivered legislation to Congress that would become the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

Trump has no one comparable to James Baldwin anywhere near the Oval Office. Instead, he has a few smiling black faces who are either afraid or unwilling to tell him how to avoid tearing the country apart by race.

What African-Americans “have to lose” — to answer the question Trump himself once posed — are black people willing to teach him these tough lessons.

Here, he recounts new stories of key leaders such as Martin Luther King, Jr. and James Baldwin, as well as profiling the achievements of less well known figures, including Bob Moses, A.

Structured by the major areas of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, Williams’s book is as much a history lesson as it is a call to action not to let Trump roll back the substantial, if still imperfect, civil rights gains made over the last several decades.",-1,https://www.politics-prose.com/event/book/juan-williams-what-hell-do-you-have-to-lose-trumps-war-civil-rights

He has complained of being treated unfairly by an American-born judge because the judge’s parents are Mexican.

He has described people immigrating from the Caribbean, Latin America and Africa as “these people from shithole countries.”

And before he ran for president, he fueled false theories that the first black president, President Obama, was not born in the United States.

There is no way to ignore this president’s racist talk.

In fact, 49 percent of Americans, including 11 percent of Republicans, believe Trump is a racist, according to a Quinnipiac University poll earlier this summer. And 22 percent of Republicans told Quinnipiac the president has “emboldened people who hold racist beliefs to express those beliefs publicly.”

So how is it possible that Trump retains nearly 90 percent support among Republican voters?

How can good people excuse such bitter, divisive talk from the nation’s leader as if it is a minor issue, a distraction for overly sensitive snowflakes?

Even more troubling is the ugly reality of Trump’s policies.

In my new book which comes out this week, “What the Hell Do You Have to Lose? — Trump’s War on Civil Rights,” I write about the story behind his tweets and tirades.

That hidden story is this administration’s systematic effort to turn back the clock on minority voting rights, cut protection against employment discrimination, diminish efforts to get more young black people into college, and push to end consent decrees with local police intended to ease tensions with black Americans.

The legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, and the civil rights movement is on the line.

When Trump first asked the question, “What the hell do you have to lose?,” he was speaking to an overwhelmingly white audience, expressing disdain for black people who favored Democrat Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' Cuba readies for life without Castro Chelsea Clinton: Pics of Trump getting vaccinated would help him 'claim credit' MORE over him.

He never went into a black neighborhood and he never said that to a black audience.

The condescending question revealed that, in his thinking, black people have nothing to lose by voting for him since, in his bigoted mind, all black people live in neighborhoods with constant gunfire, bad schools and no jobs.

The incredible story of the sacrifices made to produce today’s black middle class and black political power — the civil rights movement’s great achievements — went right over Trump’s head.

To this day, he dismisses questions about his demeaning attacks on blacks by talking about the low black unemployment rate.

The fact that about half of black Americans have been able to rise into the middle class or beyond in the last 50 years somehow escaped his notice. He wants to talk about black poverty, misery and crime in front of white audiences. His intention is to paint himself as the hero keeping the barbarians at bay.

But forget the vile rhetoric for a moment.

The heart of the racial divide Trump is exploiting has to do with how he governs and the poisonous signals he sends about the acceptability of white indifference to the nation’s history of slavery, legal discrimination and ongoing racial bias.

Take voting rights as a top-of-mind example heading into the midterm elections.

Trump has packed the federal judiciary with right-wing judges who have shown zero sympathy for — and in some cases outright hostility to — the legislative victories of the civil rights movement.

There is little in the record of Justice Neil Gorsuch, or embattled Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, to suggest they would defend the Voting Rights Act from further attempts to gut it.

Trump’s Attorney General Jeff Sessions Jefferson (Jeff) Beauregard SessionsGarland rescinds Trump-era memo curtailing consent decrees Biden picks vocal Trump critics to lead immigration agencies The Hill's Morning Report - Biden assails 'epidemic' of gun violence amid SC, Texas shootings MORE, unlike his predecessor Eric Holder Eric Himpton HolderVoter suppression bills are the first move in a bigger battle Holder, Yates lead letter backing Biden pick for Civil Rights Division at DOJ Senate panel dukes it out over voting rights MORE, has done nothing to curtail efforts by Republican-majority state legislatures to suppress and disenfranchise minority voters through schemes like Voter ID and the cancellation of early voting.

This rollback is taking place at a time of fearful racial division in the country.

A Fox News poll taken late last month found that 58 percent of Americans disapprove of the way Trump is handling race relations. Just 33 percent approve.

As the author of a major book on the civil rights movement, “Eyes on the Prize — America’s Civil Rights Years 1954-1965,” one question I am often asked is, “Who will be the next Dr. King?”

There have been some obvious contenders over the years. Rev. Jesse Jackson and Rev. Al Sharpton used media attention to spotlight real issues of racial injustice in our society.

But in many ways, they ended up being celebrities who lacked King’s moral authority to speak to problems inside the black community, such as black-on-black crime, family breakdown due to high rates of out-of-wedlock births, and bad schools in poor, segregated black neighborhoods.

Now the more pressing question, beyond who will be the next King or even the next Obama, is who will protect America’s civil rights achievements, both symbolic and tangible, from the Trump administration’s siege?

Will America need a new civil rights movement to protect us from the Trump war on civil rights?

Juan Williams is an author, and a political analyst for Fox News Channel. His new book, ""What The Hell Do You Have To Lose? — Trump's War on Civil Rights,"" will be published on Sep. 25 by Public Affairs Books.",-1,https://thehill.com/opinion/civil-rights/408029-juan-williams-trumps-war-on-civil-rights

5091,Williams,Juan,sfchronicle,"President Trump has a reliable comeback when questioned about racist statements and policies. He points to record low black unemployment.

When Jay-Z charged Trump with racism on CNN in January, the president tweeted back: “Somebody please inform Jay-Z that because of my policies, Black Unemployment has just been reported to be at the LOWEST RATE EVER RECORDED!”

At best, Trump is partly right.

The whole truth is that most of the decline in black unemployment took place under President Barack Obama, plummeting from nearly 17 percent in 2010 to 7.8 percent as Obama left office. Trump has further reduced it by just over a point to the current rate of 6.3 percent.

And Trump fails to mention that black unemployment rate remains roughly double that of white unemployment.

He also fails to mention that his administration’s policies have made it harder for most black Americans to get good jobs and build wealth.

Trump famously talked about blacks during his campaign as a group with no jobs, bad schools and violent neighborhoods. “What the hell do you have to lose?” he said, suggesting that black people fail to see their best interest by not voting for him.

Trump’s overwhelmingly white rallies cheered his condescending question and its implication that black Americans can’t find their way out of desperate lives.

At those rallies, Trump preferred to focus on the 22 percent of blacks in poverty. At one point during his campaign, he falsely claimed that more than half of black youth are unemployed when the true number was 27 percent.

In fact, 40 percent of black Americans have jobs paying between $35,000 and $100,000. An additional 12 percent earn between $100,000 and $200,000. African Americans are 9.1 percent of Americans in management and professional jobs; 12.6 percent of sales and office jobs; 10 percent of elementary and middle school teachers.

In other words, about half of black America is in the middle class or beyond. They go to work every morning. The growth of this striving black middle class over the past half century is the cornerstone of America’s effort to achieve racial equality.

Economic growth in the first year of the Trump administration disproportionately benefited rural and small-town America. Most of this growth, at a rate of 3.3 percent in mining, construction and manufacturing — the highest rate since 1984, according to the Washington Post — took place in sectors dominated by white men. Meanwhile, there was only 1.3 percent growth in the service industries, education and retail in central and big cities, areas with large minority populations.

According to the Brookings Institution, white rural America received “a slightly disproportionate share of U.S. job growth, while the nation’s big cities slightly underperformed.”

Today, the critical economic question from black America to any president is: What are you doing to bring blacks up to par with opportunities and wealth in white America, by helping the black middle class climb the ladder of upward mobility through better education, more earnings and greater wealth?

In his time in office, Trump has built a legacy as the president who is undermining the rise of the black middle class.

In the face of racial bias in the private sector, government jobs have proved to be a reliable means for African Americans to get stable jobs with middle-class salaries. A UC Berkeley Labor Center study found blacks are 33 percent “more likely to be employed in the public sector compared with a nonblack worker.” Black America is disproportionately represented in the federal workforce — 18.1 percent. They are 18 percent of U.S. Postal Service workers and 17 percent of active-duty soldiers.

In his first six months in office, Trump cut more than 10,000 federal jobs; both Presidents George W. Bush and Obama added jobs in their first six months. Last month, he wrote that pay raises for federal workers scheduled for 2019 should be canceled. Trump also made a point of eliminating Obama-era rules protecting minority workers.

In April 2017, he ditched President Obama’s Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces Executive Order, which ensures that the government works only with federal contractors that have good records on labor and civil rights violations.

And Trump has pulled away from federal plans to help blacks become business owners.

His 2018 budget proposed eliminating the Minority Business Development Agency. And he’s repeatedly asked to drop the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund and Community Development Block Grants, which support jobs, businesses and housing in lower-income neighborhoods.

Trump has also opposed raising the federal minimum wage and opposed Obama-era protections for overtime pay for white-collar workers.

The growth of the black middle class, despite the history of slavery, legal segregation and ongoing discrimination, began with A. Philip Randolph, the black labor leader. He pressured President Franklin D. Roosevelt to let African Americans into booming World War II defense industries. It continued with the passage of the landmark 1964 Civil Rights Act, which made race-based employment discrimination illegal.

But President Trump doesn’t know any of this. Thus, he’s ignoring the very policies and programs that have steadily helped African Americans enter and rise within the middle class.

The answer to the insulting question — what the hell do you have to lose? — is that American blacks no longer have a president who understands their desire to follow in the footsteps of television’s fictional George Jefferson and get “movin’ on up” to better jobs, more money, and claim their rightful piece of the American Dream.

Juan Williams, a co-host of Fox News’ “The Five,” is the author of “What the Hell Do You Have to Lose? Trump’s War on Civil Rights.” He will speak at 6 p.m. Thursday at the Commonwealth Club, 110 The Embarcadero, San Francisco. For tickets, go to www.commonwealthclub.org/events.

5479,Williams,Juan,thehill,"Here’s Whoopi Goldberg Whoopi GoldbergJill Biden to appear in 'Sesame Street' documentary Fox News's Dean says 'View' won't book her over Cuomo criticism Whoopi Goldberg goes viral for reaction to Meghan McCain's comments on Meghan Markle's Oprah interview MORE on America’s schools today: “To me, bad teachers don’t do anybody any good. So the unions need to recognize that parents are not going to stand for it anymore.”

Here’s New York Times Columnist Frank Bruni: “There’s no sense in putting something as crucial as children’s education in the hands of a professional class [teachers] with less accountability than others and with job protections that most Americans can only fantasize about.”

Note that these voices shouting for school reform are coming from the left. For the first time, moderate Democrats — from Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo Andrew CuomoNew York AG asked to investigate if Cuomo used state resources on his book On The Money: Treasury creates hub to fight climate change | Manchin throws support behind union-backed PRO Act | Consumer bureau rolls out rule to bolster CDC eviction ban Cuomo: Congress must include SALT cap repeal in future legislation MORE — are gaining support from the cultural left for school reform. For the first time, Congress is facing rising calls to reject the status quo in education from both ends of the political spectrum.

Another new dynamic this school year is the success of a California lawsuit that led to a ruling this summer against tenure systems that protect ineffective teachers.

The new reality creates new political possibilities in Congress.

In both the Senate and the House, new players are primed to bring open minds and new energy to the debate over the subpar performance of American schools against global competition.

The biggest change is coming in the Senate.

Sen. Tom Harkin Thomas (Tom) Richard HarkinWe need a voting rights workaround Romney's TRUST Act is a Trojan Horse to cut seniors' benefits Two more parting shots from Trump aimed squarely at disabled workers MORE (D-Iowa) is retiring at the end of this term as chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.

That could open the chair to pro-reform centrist Democrats such as Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado, the former superintendent of Denver schools and a supporter of school reform. Bennet favors paying teachers based on performance.

If Republicans gain the Senate majority, Harkin’s replacement could be one of the senior Republicans on the committee, Sens. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee or Mike Enzi of Wyoming. Both support charters and vouchers.

Change is also coming to the education debate in the House.

Rep. John Kline (R-Minn.) is term-limited in the position as head of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. The frontrunners to succeed Kline as Chairman are Reps. Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.), Joe Wilson (R-S.C.) and Tim Walberg (R-Mich.) — all of whom have long histories of supporting school choice.

This change in Congressional leadership stirs optimism for getting beyond the tired old fights over efforts to renew President Bush’s reform plan — No Child Left Behind — and GOP efforts to obstruct President Obama’s plan to use federal dollars to attract states toward education reform — Race to the Top.

One example of a new idea that might now get a second look is the Scholarships for Kids Act. Earlier this year I wrote about Sen. Alexander’s efforts, in partnership with Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), to pass the legislation that directs existing federal education money to voucher programs for low-income families. It has been stalled in committee.

Under new Senate leadership, the Scholarships for Kids Act and similar reforms will have new life.

The coming changes on Capitol Hill reflect the shifting politics of education reform around the country.

Even in politically liberal New York City the change is evident.

In March, 11,000 parents took to the streets to protest a plan by New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio Bill de BlasioWhat the statistics show about police shootings and public safety US cities beef up security ahead of Chauvin verdict Yang expands lead in NYC mayor race: poll MORE (D) to push charter schools out of city-owned property. Education reform activists in New York were able to sustain that momentum and now there are plans to expand some of the city’s most successful charter schools.

The New York Times has speculated that the successful calls from parents for the city to support charters sets the stage for future fights to get the city to approve even more charter schools.

Black and Hispanic parents played a major role in those marches. Their heavy participation represented a break with a history of uncritical alliance between minorities, as represented by the NAACP and other civil rights groups, and New York’s major teachers’ unions.

Goldberg, the black comic and TV commentator, told her large audience on ABC’s “The View” that she is not abandoning teachers but calling on them to support students.

“And teachers,” Goldberg said, “in your union, you need to say these bad teachers are making us look bad and we don’t want it.”

Bruni, the Times columnist, made a strikingly similar point: “We need to pay good teachers much more. We need to wrap the great ones in the highest esteem. But we also need to separate the good and the great from the bad.”

Goldberg and Bruni echoed a June ruling in Los Angeles County Superior Court that found teacher tenure rules are unconstitutional because they protect ineffective teachers and harm low-income children, especially racial minorities. Judge Rolf M. Treu wrote that tenure protections for bad teachers “impose a real and appreciable impact on students’ fundamental right to equality of education.”

Treu concluded: “The evidence is compelling. Indeed, it shocks the conscience.”

Secretary of Education Arne Duncan Arne Starkey DuncanProviding the transparency parents deserve Everyone's talking about a national tutoring corps; here's what we need to know to do it well More than 200 Obama officials sign letter supporting Biden's stimulus plan MORE, a Democrat and former head of the Chicago schools, voiced support for the ruling: “The students who brought this lawsuit are…[a few of] millions of young people in America who are disadvantaged by laws, practices and systems that fail to identify and support our best teachers and match them with our neediest students,” Duncan said. “Today’s court decision is a mandate to fix these problems.”

This year’s opening school bell is ringing loudly in Congress. It is time for America’s top legislature to act on the crisis in the nation’s schools.

5666,Williams,Juan,thehill,"Have you noticed a lot of Democrats are saying the s-word lately?

“We have to say yes to socialism — to the word and everything,” legendary comedian and Trump critic Jim Carrey told Bill Maher recently. “We have to stop apologizing.”

This was more than two comedians looking for laughs. This debate is the beating heart of what liberal voters hope for — and Trump voters fear — if Democrats take control of the House after this year’s midterm elections.

In Democratic primaries for House seats, the party’s biggest stars of 2018 stood up to GOP screams about the dangers of “socialism,” by saying they ran for office to defend ObamaCare and support a living wage for workers, as well as to protect Social Security for the elderly.

Congressional candidates Ayanna Pressley in Boston and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York, as well as Andrew Gillum in Florida’s gubernatorial primary, won by running on the message that government should provide an economic safety net for Americans.

All Americans deserve the “minimum elements necessary to lead a dignified American life,” Ocasio-Cortez told voters to standing ovations.

These candidates are following in the footsteps of Sen. Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersOvernight Energy: Treasury creates hub to fight climate change through finance | Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez introduce 'Green New Deal for Public Housing' | Don't attack Zoom for its Bernie Sanders federal tax bill Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez introduce 'Green New Deal for Public Housing' MORE’ (I-Vt.) 2016 presidential campaign.

The Vermont senator has proudly identified as a democratic socialist throughout his career. In his presidential run, he gave Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' Cuba readies for life without Castro Chelsea Clinton: Pics of Trump getting vaccinated would help him 'claim credit' MORE a surprisingly tough race by winning a high level of support from young supporters who embraced his calls for universal healthcare, free college tuition and higher taxes on the wealthiest one percent of Americans to pay for social welfare programs.

“When I use the world ‘socialist’ — and I know some people aren’t comfortable about it — I’m saying that it is imperative [to] create a government that works for all and not just the few,” Sanders said in a 2015 interview.

“I don’t believe government should own the means of production, but I do believe that the middle class and the working families who produce the wealth of America deserve a fair deal.”

A Gallup poll last month found that a majority of Democrats and left-leaning independents view Sanders’ style of socialism more favorably than capitalism. Fifty-seven percent have a favorable view of socialism, whereas only 47 percent have a favorable view of capitalism.

Democrats are quick to point out that modern American governance has long been a hybrid of capitalism and socialism. They are not talking about a government takeover of business.

Nearly two-thirds of the federal budget goes to ‘socialist’-type programs — Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. These programs are wildly popular and politicians who threaten them are punished by the voters. Republican Congresses rejected Republican President George W. Bush’s plan to privatize Social Security — just as they rejected then-Rep.

The big-ticket item for Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez Democrats is Medicare-for-All, a.k.a. “BernieCare,” a.k.a. “universal health care,” a.k.a. “Canadian-style single payer.”

A Reuters-Ipsos poll from last month found that a whopping 70 percent of Americans support Medicare-for-All — including 52 percent of self-described Republicans. This socialist proposal is wildly popular among the electorate — and it now has Democrats running toward it instead of away from it.

“I grew up in Canada, OK, we have socialized medicine,” Carrey explained to Maher. “And I’m here to tell you…It is not a failure, and I never waited for anything in my life. I chose my own doctors. My mother never paid for a prescription — it was fantastic.”

In two of the most hotly contested gubernatorial races — Florida and Wisconsin — the Democratic candidates are unapologetically running on a platform of Medicare-for-All, with Medicaid expansion as the first step.

Gillum, in Florida, is telling voters he will raise taxes on corporations to pay for the program. The state’s current Gov. Rick Scott (R) — now running for the U.S. Senate — refused to expand Medicaid under ObamaCare. His Democratic opponent, Sen. Bill Nelson Clarence (Bill) William NelsonHas the Biden administration abandoned the idea of a moon base? Cuba readies for life without Castro Why does Rep. Johnson oppose NASA's commercial human landing system? MORE, is using that refusal to attack Scott as lacking concern for working families and as a puppet for big business.

In Michigan and Nevada, Republican Govs. Rick Snyder and Brian Sandoval did expand Medicaid. The Republicans running to replace them are on record saying they opposed that decision and their Democratic opponents are clobbering them for it, while also campaigning on Medicare-for-All.

Big business has long made “socialism” a dirty word in American politics. It has been a rhetorical cudgel Republicans used to bash Democrats as soft on the threat of Soviet communism, and to portray the left as wanting to raise people’s taxes to give money to undeserving, lazy, shiftless, poor people.

The Democrats’ energized base of young, female, immigrant and racially mixed voters see Trump and Congressional Republicans as damning working people by trying to end ObamaCare and giving huge tax cuts to corporations and the rich.

Even as the GOP drives up the debt with tax cuts, the Trump party is intent on cutting programs that make up the social safety net, such as Social Security.

With Trump in the White House and Republicans controlling both the House and the Senate, Democrats are no longer afraid to stand behind popular programs for the middle and working class — even if the GOP yells ‘Socialist.’

5892,Williams,Juan,foxnews,"We’re taking all bets – put your money down now: Will Republicans hold their U.S. Senate majority after the Nov. 6 midterm elections? My bet is that they do. But the odds that I’m wrong keep going up.

Ever the master of the political expectations game, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., wouldn’t answer “yes” or “no” when asked this week if he thinks his party will hold the Senate come November.

Instead, McConnell said the midterms are going to be “very challenging” for his party and then added that Senate races have turned into “a knife fight in an alley!”

If you believe McConnell, there are “dead even” Senate races taking place in Arizona, Nevada, Tennessee, Montana, North Dakota, Missouri, Indiana, West Virginia and Florida.

“It's just a brawl in every one of those places,"" McConnell said.

Even if McConnell is spinning to get bigger campaign contributions for his candidates, there is a real question here. Do the Democrats really do have a shot at taking back control of the Senate when voters go to the polls?

It wasn’t that long ago when a Democratic takeover of the upper chamber seemed pie-in-the-sky unlikely. But with less than eight weeks to go before Election Day, things really do seem to be breaking the Democrats’ way.

How did we get here? The Democrats, after all, are still defending 24 seats – including 10 in states that Donald Trump carried in 2016.

To my mind, the tide turned with the surprise victory of Democrat Doug Jones in the special election to fill the Senate seat from Alabama formerly held by Republican Jeff Sessions, who is now attorney general. Republicans now hold a 51-49 Senate majority because they lost that seat.

Moreover, the Jones victory re-energized a Democratic base still depressed over Trump’s victory in the 2016 presidential election. It also showed how a credible, moderate Democrat could overtake a flawed Republican candidate even in the reddest of red states.

Democratic senators once thought to be headed for political death are now somehow full of new life.

Indiana’s Joe Donnelly, West Virginia’s Joe Manchin, Montana’s Jon Tester, North Dakota’s Heidi Heitkamp and Missouri’s Claire McCaskill are all polling ahead or within the margin of error of their Republican opponents, according to the latest Real Clear Politics averages.

At this juncture, what once seemed like a sure thing has turned into a question mark. That means the GOP is spending time, money and resources in places once thought to require no attention to win.

In short, the GOP is now playing defense rather than offense to protect its incumbents. Republicans are defending a president with historically low approval ratings and combatting the daily drip-drip-drip of negative headlines about him.

The negative headlines deal with stories about hush-money payments to women who claim they had affairs with Trump (claims he denies); guilty verdicts against former Trump advisers investigated by Special Counsel Robert Mueller; and best-selling books accusing the president of corruption, having a limited intellect, and suffering from mental instability. President Trump has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and attacked negative books about his presidency as fiction.

The Democrats need to pick up only two seats to win control of the Senate. Here are four races where they could do it:

Tennessee

Popular former Democratic Tennessee Gov. Phil Bredesen is polling within three points with his Republican opponent, U.S. Rep. Marsha Blackburn, according to a Fox News poll released Wednesday. Blackburn’s 47-44 percent lead is within the poll’s margin of error.

Bredesen is focusing on his own moderate, center-right record as governor and vowing to work in a bipartisan manner in the best interests of his state. He is avoiding mentioning President Trump.

By contrast, Blackburn has become Trump’s most outspoken female supporter in Congress. She is a frequent guest on cable news shows, talk radio and conservative media. The fact that she has not been able to pull ahead of Bredesen in a state that Trump won by 26 points has Republicans nervous, for good reason.

Texas

Texas is the biggest surprise on the midterm horizon. And it is forcing establishment Republicans in Washington to hold their noses and try to save one of their party’s biggest in-house headaches – Sen. Ted Cruz.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., once famously remarked if you killed Cruz on the floor of the Senate and had a trial with only his fellow senators serving as jurors, nobody would vote to convict his killer.

During the 2016 Republican presidential primaries, Trump branded Cruz “Lyin’ Ted” and suggested the senator’s father could have been involved in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.

But Cruz has remained a supporter and reliable vote for President Trump in the Senate. His Democratic opponent in his re-election race – U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke of El Paso – is getting a ton of national media exposure and reported an impressive fundraising haul earlier this month.

Texas Sen. John Cornyn told Politico that Cruz is in a tight race, explaining that “we’re not bluffing, this is real, and it is a serious threat.” Real Clear Politics shows Cruz leading O’Rourke by just three points in polling.

Nevada

Republican Sen. Dean Heller is running for re-election in a state that went for Hillary Clinton and elected a Democratic Latina to the U.S. Senate in 2016.

Heller tries to portray himself as a moderate on immigration issues. But his association with President Trump and the party of “build the wall” is doing him no favors in a state with a 28 percent Hispanic population.

Heller’s opponent – popular Democratic U.S. Rep. Jacky Rosen – is leading by one point according to a Suffolk University poll last week. The political machine of former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., and the strong political influence of unionized workers in Las Vegas and Reno will make it very difficult for Heller to hold on.

Arizona

The Republican Senate candidate, U.S. Rep. Martha McSally, survived a brutal GOP primary against firebrands former Sheriff Joe Arpaio and hard-right former state Sen. Kelli Ward. Polls show McSally tied with a popular, moderate Democratic U.S. Rep. Krysten Sinema.

Trump carried Arizona by less than four points in 2016, down from the nine-point margin of victory for Republican Mitt Romney over President Obama in 2012. This is a seat now held by Republican Sen. Jeff Flake – a stand-out GOP critic of Trump – who is retiring from Congress to avoid having to run as a critic of his party’s troubled leader.

For two years, the question in Washington has been: “What will it take for Republicans to turn on Donald Trump?”

If Republicans lose control of the U.S. Senate because of the president’s political toxicity – even in reliably red states – that could do it.",-1,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/09/14/juan-williams-why-am-still-betting-on-republicans-to-hold-senate-but-check-with-me-in-month.html

But so far none of it is moving votes for Republicans.

The biggest loser for the GOP messaging plan is turning out to be President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE’s rants about those NFL players who kneeled during the national anthem to protest police brutality and racial injustice, including the fatal shootings of unarmed black people.

For two years, Trump has stoked racial divisions by stirring his overwhelmingly white rallies — calling out team owners for not punishing the mostly black players for continuing Colin Kaepernick’s protest.

“Get that son of a bitch off the field right now. Out! He's fired. He's fired!"" Trump said at a rally in Alabama more than a year ago.

He continued in that vein for a long time. But last week it was Trump who started backpedaling.

At a rally in Montana on the night of the NFL’s first game, he barely mentioned the protests. “We’re standing up for your values,” he said briefly, “We are standing for our national anthem and our flag.”

And when Pete Hegseth of Fox News asked him who is winning the “culture war” over the NFL protests, the president pivoted away by limiting himself to saying “We are... I don’t know what the NFL is doing.”

That’s it?

What drained the political power from Trump’s racially divisive fire and brimstone attacks on the NFL protests?

Trump gave a clue last week in an interview with The Daily Caller. He said that while he disagrees with Nike’s decision to celebrate Kaepernick as a hero in a new ad campaign — “It’s a terrible message” — he quickly added that freedom to speak out “is what this country is all about, that you have certain freedoms to do things that other people think you shouldn’t do.”

The new tone from Trump came after the Ford Motor Co., owner of the NFL’s Detroit Lions, took a shot at Trump by saying the players’ right to express views is part of “what makes America great.”

“Our game has long provided a powerful platform for dialogue and positive change,” said Martha Ford, pushing back at Trump. “Negative and disrespectful comments suggesting otherwise are contrary to the founding principles of our country.”

For the first time the NFL, whose owners once seemed to fear Trump, is also pushing back.

“The social justice issues that Colin and other professional athletes have raised deserve our attention and action,” the league said in a statement.

The NFL’s use of the words “social justice” in their statement indicates that even the league is now having the debate on Kaepernick’s terms — acknowledging the validity of his right to stand up for his beliefs.

Another score for Kaepernick.

But the game goes on.

Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) is still following the Trump culture war playbook for the November election.

On the NFL’s opening night, he tweeted a challenge to Tony Evers, his Democratic opponent, asking if Evers supports “NFL players blatantly disrespecting our flag and the Wisconsin men and women in uniform?”

Evers responded that he is “proud to stand” for the anthem and “proud to respect our first amendment rights to peacefully protest. Scott Walker wants to distract and divide us — anything to avoid talking about his record.”

Evers’ running mate, Mandela Barnes, who is black, hit even harder. He told reporters Walker is “trying to stoke the same tensions that President Trump is trying to stoke.”

And Barnes tweeted at Walker “you could have served in THREE wars, why didn’t you stand up then?”

But the same Trump-style play is being run in Texas by Republican Sen. Ted Cruz Rafael (Ted) Edward Cruz15 Senate Republicans pledge to oppose lifting earmark ban 'Real Housewives of the GOP' — Wannabe reality show narcissists commandeer the party Is the antidote to bad speech more speech or more regulation? MORE against his Democratic opponent, Beto O’Rourke.

Cruz ran an attack ad after O’Rourke, speaking at a veterans’ event, supported the players’ right to protest.

“Liberal Hollywood was thrilled. But do Texans agree?” asked a Cruz political ad that showed a retired Marine who lost his legs in combat saying: “I sure expect you to stand for me when the national anthem is being played.”

The ad closed by asking voters, “Where will you stand?”

But since O’Rourke took the players’ side while conceding that “reasonable people can disagree on this issue,” his poll numbers have gone up. He is now within single digits of the incumbent, Cruz.

The video showing O’Rourke speaking in defense of the players’ “non-violent protests” attracted national attention. He appeared on Ellen DeGeneres’ morning talk show. He also won approving tweets from celebrities like LeBron James who tweeted “A Must Watch!!! Salute @BetoORourke for the candid thoughtful words!”

“We don’t know if Beto can pull this off,” former Obama speechwriter Jon Favreau said on his podcast, “but the campaign that he is running and how he answers questions, and how he talks about issues, that is the model for candidates in 2018 and 2020, whether or not he pulls this off.”

“I can’t imagine there is a single voter who will cast a ballot exclusively on the issue of NFL kneeling,” Josh Holmes, a Republican strategist and former Chief of Staff to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong 15 Senate Republicans pledge to oppose lifting earmark ban It's not 'woketivism,' it's good business MORE (R-Ky.), told BuzzFeed last week.

At best, Holmes thinks attacking the players might work “against liberals who are trying to make cultural inroads into a conservative electorate.”

Last week, Kaepernick got a standing ovation while watching the U.S. Open tennis tournament with a largely white crowd.

In the immortal words of Bob Dylan, “the times they are a-changin’.”

6930,Williams,Juan,thehill,"President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE likes to complain about “Fake News.”

So, here’s some very real news for him:

Republican control of Capitol Hill and the White House is based on a “fake majority.”

“A majority of the Senate now represents just 18 percent of the nation’s population,” David Wasserman, an editor for The Cook Political Report, wrote in a recent New York Times column.

He added that the crucial Senate seats this November would be “much whiter, more rural and pro-Trump than the nation as a whole. In effect, geography could again be Mr. Trump’s greatest protector: After all, the Senate — not the House — would have the final say on any impeachment proceedings,” Wasserman argued.

Think about this — America’s politics are being run by a cabal in the Senate that fails to represent 82 percent of the American people.

For starters, the 18 percent controlling the Senate have their own right-wing agenda beyond protecting an unpopular president.

They want a Supreme Court majority that reflects their views and not the views of the majority of the people.

To take control of the court they blocked President Obama — a Democrat twice elected with a majority of the popular vote as well as a majority of the electoral college — for close to a year from appointing a centrist judge to the high court.

And now having already replaced Garland and installed a solid conservative — Neil Gorsuch — the Senate Republicans, who represent fewer than 1-in-5 Americans, are about to force another conservative on the Supreme Court.

If they succeed in locking in another conservative, this time Judge Brett Kavanaugh, they will cement a conservative majority on the court for decades in an act that might be described as tyranny.

It is not just the Senate that is acting against the will of the majority.

Remember that both Gorsuch and Kavanaugh were nominated by a president who lost the popular vote by almost three million votes.

If Kavanaugh is confirmed, there is nothing stopping the 5-4 conservative majority on the Court from overturning Roe v. Wade and denying millions of American women the right to an abortion.

This despite the fact that only 29 percent of Americans want abortion to be illegal in all or most cases, according to a July Quinnipiac poll. The vast majority of Americans, 64 percent, want it legal in all or most cases.

Then there is the tyranny of Trump-led GOP efforts to cripple the Affordable Care Act (ACA).

With Sen. John McCain John Sidney McCain'Real Housewives of the GOP' — Wannabe reality show narcissists commandeer the party George W. Bush: 'It's a problem that Americans are so polarized' they can't imagine him being friends with Michelle Obama Congress brings back corrupt, costly, and inequitably earmarks MORE’s (R-Ariz.) death, there is nothing stopping the 18-percent-Senate-majority from passing their bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act and strip health care from millions of Americans — even though the latest Kaiser poll taken over the summer shows that 50 percent of Americans have a favorable opinion of the ACA compared to 41 percent who view it unfavorably.

A June Quinnipiac poll similarly found that 51 percent want the ACA to remain in place and 44 percent want it repealed. McCain famously killed the repeal effort because, for all their complaints, Republicans never came up with a better bill to help Americans with the high cost of healthcare.

Will the Arizona Republican who is appointed to fill his seat display the same courage?

Then there is the tyranny of GOP tax cuts.

The 18-percent-Senate-majority passed tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefit the wealthiest one percent of Americans.

Forty-six percent of Americans disapprove of the Trump tax law, according to Quinnipiac polling.

An August Fox poll found that ObamaCare is now more popular than the Republican tax cuts. More than half of voters, 51 percent, favor ObamaCare compared to 40 percent who approved of the tax cuts.

That finding is bolstered by another poll, a CNBC survey from June, which found that 49 percent of working American adults — a plurality of all the people polled — said they do not have more take-home pay because of the law.

How about the president’s aggressive focus on border security?

Again, a majority in the Fox poll said they disapprove. Overall, 57 percent of Americans disapproved of Trump’s handling of immigration policy.

And when it comes to the Republican president’s handling of race relations, 58 percent in the Fox poll said they disapproved.

So, to recap: The lives of over 300 million Americans are being affected by policies foisted on them by a Senate “majority” that represents less than one-fifth of them and a president who was elected with three million fewer votes than his opponent.

Meanwhile, even as daily controversy, including federal convictions of his associates, surrounds Trump, the 18 percent represented by the GOP majority in the Senate protects the president from impeachment.

What is wrong with this picture?

Liberal comedian Bill Maher has long said that the Constitution is in need of a “page one rewrite.”

That’s funny, but the joke has a bite to it.

Trump has normalized many horrible things in our politics: racism, lying, scapegoating and corruption.

Future historians may look back and conclude one of the most corrosive things he normalized was minority-posing-as-majority tyranny that cheats the majority of the American people out of their democracy.

7588,Williams,Juan,thehill,"I write. You decide.

How do Republicans think they will do in the November midterm elections?

President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE is predicting a “giant Red Wave” for his party.

Last week, Trump promised to hold rallies and fundraisers nationwide as Election Day draws closer. He is bragging about the power of his endorsements in GOP primaries and going “8 for 9 in Special Elections. Red Wave!”

Now for a different Republican view of the upcoming election we go to Stephen Bannon, the president’s former chief strategist. He predicts Trump’s GOP would lose up to 40 House seats if the election were held right now.

Bannon is launching a new political group, Citizens of the American Republic, and told the Associated Press the midterms are “all about turnout and what I call base-plus.”

Democrats have turned out in big numbers for special elections to express their distaste for Trump. That leads Bannon to forecast trouble for the GOP.

A Pew poll last week supported Bannon’s thinking with a finding that “voters who back Democratic candidates for Congress are reporting higher levels of political activity than GOP voters.”

But wait. There is another GOP perspective from President Reagan’s top political advisor Ed Rollins, who is now co-chair of Donald Trump Great America PAC.

He sided with the president last week. “There’s no blue wave out there,” Rollins said on Fox Business Network. Rollins predicted Republicans would hold the Senate and the House.

There is some daylight between Trump and Rollins on the November outcome. Rollins does not see a “red wave.” He thinks Republicans could lose seats in the House even as they win enough seats to hold the majority.

Rollins’ more limited enthusiasm about GOP prospects in the elections is in line with predictions from Anthony Salvanto, the top pollster for CBS News.

“Right now I think this election looks like a toss-up,” Salvanto told the New York Post last week. “We see a Democrat pickup in the House of Representatives in the 20-odd seat range, but Republicans could certainly hold on to the House.”

Salvanto lines up with Bannon in saying election turnout is the key. He thinks Republican voters will maintain their tradition of showing up for the midterms in bigger numbers than Democrats.

“Even though Republicans have not fared well in special elections so far this cycle, it does look like they will be turning out for the midterms,” Salvanto explained. “So far we do not see a large number of Republicans saying they will flip and vote for a Democrat.”

The Democrats “have to bring new voters in” to win the House majority, Salvanto asserted.

At the moment, the Real Clear Politics polling average has Democrats holding a 6.8-point lead over Republicans when voters are asked which party they prefer to control Congress.

But what if a higher than normal number of Democrats go to the polls, as Bannon suggests?

A Fox News poll last week concluded “Democrats are in a strong position for the midterms,” largely because “more 2016 Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' Cuba readies for life without Castro Chelsea Clinton: Pics of Trump getting vaccinated would help him 'claim credit' MORE voters are ‘extremely’ interested in the midterms than Trump voters [51 vs. 37 percent] and more certain they will vote [76 vs. 67 percent].”

In counties where Trump and Clinton finished within 10 percentage points of each other, the Fox poll found Democrats leading 45 to 39 percent.

“The Democratic edge in battleground counties is telling,” said Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who does Fox News' polling with Democrat Chris Anderson. “These are where the competitive districts are that they need to flip to put Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiWhite House readies for Chauvin verdict House GOP's McClain responds to Pelosi calling her 'that woman' GOP struggles to rein in nativism MORE back in the Speakers’ chair.”

Part of the battleground county problem for Republicans is the GOP has 43 seats in which the incumbent decided to leave. The loss of the advantage of incumbency has led Cook Political Report to increase the number of GOP-held seats in danger of shifting to Democrats from 20 at the start of the year to nearly double that number today, at 37.

In addition, last week’s conviction of Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort Paul John ManafortThere was Trump-Russia collusion — and Trump pardoned the colluder Treasury: Manafort associate passed 'sensitive' campaign data to Russian intelligence Hunter Biden blasts Trump in new book: 'A vile man with a vile mission' MORE, and guilty plea from his former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, along with the constant stories of corruption in his administration make it difficult for Republican candidates to talk about traditional conservative issues instead of being asked about Trump’s troubles.

Democrats will need to win 23 seats to claim the House majority. On average, the party in the White House loses 32 seats in the incumbent’s first midterm elections.

And with 71 days left before the elections, most independent pollsters give Democrats a strong edge.

FiveThirtyEight.com still forecasts a 5 in 7 chance that Democrats win control of the House. The indictments of Reps. Duncan Hunter Duncan HunterTrump denies Gaetz asked him for blanket pardon Gaetz, on the ropes, finds few friends in GOP Trust, transparency, and tithing is not enough to sustain democracy MORE (R-Calif.) and Chris Collins Christopher (Chris) Carl CollinsTrump denies Gaetz asked him for blanket pardon Gaetz, on the ropes, finds few friends in GOP Schumer to recommend three Black lawyers to head US attorney offices in NY MORE (R-N.Y.) on corruption charges in the past two weeks have made their districts more competitive.

So, there is your range of Republican opinion on the midterms.

The only certain prediction for the fall races is that Trump will take full credit for a “red wave” if the GOP manages to hold on to their majority by a single seat.

You can take that to the bank.

8254,Williams,Juan,thehill,"There is always backstabbing and shady money in politics.

But nothing I’ve seen in 40 years covering national politics comes close to what we have with President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE.

For all her credibility problems, Omarosa Manigault Newman Omarosa Manigault NewmanJudge denies Omarosa Manigault Newman request to depose Trump, John Kelly in lawsuit Tanden seeks to defuse GOP tensions over tweets Juan Williams: The GOP's problem with women of color MORE’s account of White House corruption in her new book tracks closely with the climate of routinized dishonesty, paranoia and corruption described in Michael Wolff’s book “Fire and Fury.”

It also matches The Wall Street Journal’s reporting on Trump’s lawyer admitting payoffs to silence a porn star and a Playboy model. It fits with Trump’s changing story about his son’s meeting with a Russian lawyer at Trump Tower.

It fits with a lawsuit charging the president with making money from his Washington hotel while in the White House. It fits with financial reports showing Trump’s daughter and son-in-law made $81 million in outside income in the president’s first year in office.

Democrats fighting to gain a majority in the House are appealing to voters to let them be a check on Trump and corruption.

“Money just doesn’t talk in Washington. It shouts… But let’s never lose sight of the fact that the Trump administration is the most corrupt administration in our lifetime,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth WarrenWorld passes 3 million coronavirus deaths Poll: 56 percent say wealth tax is part of solution to inequality Democratic senators call on Biden to support waiving vaccine patents MORE (D-Mass.), a potential 2020 presidential candidate told NBC’s Seth Meyers last week.

She was referring to the reports that President Trump’s former chief economic advisor Gary Cohn Gary David CohnOn The Money: Wall Street zeros in on Georgia runoffs | Seven states sue regulator over 'true lender' rule on interest rates | 2021 deficit on track to reach .3 trillion Former Trump economic aide Gary Cohn joins IBM The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by the UAE Embassy in Washington, DC - Trump OKs transition; Biden taps Treasury, State experience MORE received a $284 million payout from Goldman Sachs before taking a job at the White House, where he led the effort to write and pass the Trump tax cut. Goldman Sachs and their wealthy clients benefitted to the tune of billions of dollars.

Of course, Warren could have picked any of the myriad examples or allegations of public corruption we’ve seen from administration officials over the last 20 months.

There was former EPA administrator Scott Pruitt Edward (Scott) Scott PruittScientific integrity, or more hot air? OVERNIGHT ENERGY: Biden proposes billions for electric vehicles, building retrofitting| EPA chief to replace Trump appointees on science advisory panels | Kerry to travel to UAE, India to discuss climate change EPA chief to replace Trump appointees on science advisory panels MORE’s use of $43,000 in taxpayer’s money to install a private, soundproof telephone booth in his office.

Ross still has his job.

The Washington Post reported on Friday that the Department of Justice is looking into whether a well-known Republican fundraiser, Elliott Broidy, ""sought to sell his influence with the Trump administration.""

And one of Trump’s biggest supporters in Congress, Rep. Chris Collins Christopher (Chris) Carl CollinsTrump denies Gaetz asked him for blanket pardon Gaetz, on the ropes, finds few friends in GOP Schumer to recommend three Black lawyers to head US attorney offices in NY MORE (R-N.Y.) recently suspended his reelection campaign after being arrested on charges of insider trading.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiWhite House readies for Chauvin verdict House GOP's McClain responds to Pelosi calling her 'that woman' GOP struggles to rein in nativism MORE (D-Calif.) sent a letter out last week calling on voters to put Democrats in office to fix the GOP’s “brazen corruption, cronyism and incompetence.”

A “culture of corruption” campaign message against the GOP has worked before. Pelosi became Speaker in 2006 when former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay’s (R-Tex.) shady dealings with lobbyist Jack Abramoff dominated the headlines.

The Wall Street Journal editorial board noted last week that Democrats might have a problem casting stones from their glass house where Sen. Bob Menendez Robert (Bob) MenendezBiden rebuffs Democrats, keeps refugee admissions at 15,000 Bottom line The Memo: Biden's five biggest foreign policy challenges MORE (D-N.J.) resides.

But the problems Menendez poses for Democrats are small ball compared to the big political story — the daily drumbeat from the Trump White House.

The heart of the corruption stems from Trump’s failure to divest from his sprawling international business empire. His family has not divested, either. All of that is compounded by his stubborn refusal to release his tax returns.

As Paul Waldman wrote for the Washington Post last week: “Not only has he failed to find the best people; he attracts the most corrupt and incompetent people around, who see in Trump a vehicle to wet their own beaks or at the very least carry out a retrograde agenda in an environment where ethical behavior is actively discouraged.”

Omarosa agrees:

“There’s a lot of very corrupt things happening in the White House and I am going to blow the whistle on a lot of them,” she said while promoting her new book. She revealed she was offered a $15,000 a month job on the Trump 2020 campaign to stay silent about what she saw in the White House.

And in keeping with the odor of scandal, she has secret tapes of conversations with Trump family and White House officials.

“I protected myself because this is a White House where everybody lies,” she said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”

“The president lies to the American people. Sarah Huckabee stands in front of the country and lies every single day. You have to have your own back because otherwise you'll look back and you'll see 17 knives in your back.”

It is easy for Democrats to say the Trump administration is the most corrupt administration in history.

But keep in mind that corruption is more than old-fashioned political graft. The far more serious crime is Trump’s corruption of our collective civic soul as Americans. There is the normalization of cynicism, paranoia, hatred of immigrants, racism, lying and stealing.

To me, that is the real crime. Every Republican who has enabled it will be judged by the voters in November.

8944,Williams,Juan,thehill,"As a young reporter for the Washington Post covering the corrupt administration of D.C. Mayor Marion Barry, I knew what it meant to be targeted by a powerful politician.

Barry and his supporters trashed my reputation in D.C.’s black community, casting me as a sellout working for a white paper. I got calls telling me not to start my car and reminding me where my children went to school.

Then my house was broken into and nothing taken — but my wife found a butcher’s knife left on the bed.

At one point, Barry told the paper’s publisher, Katharine Graham, he wanted her to hire more black reporters but “not like Juan Williams.”

Those bad days from the 1980s come to mind because of President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE’s current thuggish efforts to intimidate reporters. He reminds me of Marion Barry.

In many ways, Trump is the white Marion Barry.

They share a willingness to play racial politics, an authoritarian bent, and an open hostility towards journalists. There is one important difference: Trump is doing his damage at the national level.

Trump started his attacks on the media during his 2016 presidential campaign. Supporters at his rallies were heard shouting the word “Lügenpresse” at reporters. “Lügenpresse” is a German phrase that translates as “lying press” in English.

It was popularized by Hitler’s Nazi party to fire up crowds against reporters who covered the demagogue’s rise to power.

Then in 2017, Trump tweeted: “The fake News media […] is not my enemy — it is the enemy of the American people.”

This year, Trump is back at it again. After the press accurately quoted him as accepting Russia’s denial of interference in the 2016 elections — in direct contradiction of the U.S. intelligence community’s own assessment — he attacked the press.

“The Summit with Russia,” he tweeted, “was a great success, except with the real enemy of the people, the Fake News Media.”

This is more than an angry outburst from an impulsive president.

It is the same strategy of bullying and name-calling that polls show has already succeeded in diminishing trust in special counsel Robert Mueller Robert (Bob) MuellerWhy a special counsel is guaranteed if Biden chooses Yates, Cuomo or Jones as AG Barr taps attorney investigating Russia probe origins as special counsel CNN's Toobin warns McCabe is in 'perilous condition' with emboldened Trump MORE’s investigation into possible Russian collusion with Trump’s presidential campaign.

Similarly, Trump doesn’t want his followers to trust the press. By tarnishing news reporters, he is telling his fans to ignore reporting on possible collusion and his possible obstruction of justice.

He thinks that if his followers ignore the media reports on the corruption probe, they will also ignore reports on his failure to keep campaign promises to build a wall, implement a better healthcare plan than ObamaCare and end the nuclear threat from North Korea.

Polls show most Americans don’t think reporters are bad. But Trump has succeeded in demonizing reporters among Republicans.

A July Quinnipiac poll asked voters: “Which comes closer to your point of view: the news media is the enemy of the people, or the news media is an important part of democracy?”

Overall, 21 percent of American voters agreed with Trump that the news media is the enemy of the people.

But 45 percent of Republicans held this view.

Among Democrats, 94 percent viewed reporters as an important part of democracy. Among independent voters, 74 percent did so. By contrast, only 44 percent of Republicans now agree that the free press is an important part of America’s functioning democracy.

As a journalist who is critical of Trump, I can testify to his success in insulating himself from criticism by tarring reporters as “the enemy.”

I have had death threats. My social media pages generate a daily stream of hateful, racist comments from self-described Trump supporters.

I’m a big boy. I’m able to shut out the hate. But Trump’s war on the media is not really about harassing me or any one news outlet.

He is going after a pillar of the nation’s liberties — the protections for a free press.

Thomas Jefferson famously wrote that a scenario where there would be newspapers but no government would be preferable to one where there was a government but no newspapers.

Recently, the publisher of the New York Times, A.G. Sulzberger, came to Washington to “raise concerns about the president’s deeply troubling anti-press rhetoric,” as he put it.

Sulzberger said he warned Trump that his attacks on the media are “not just divisive but increasingly dangerous.”

It was supposed to be a private meeting. But Trump leaked it with a tweet, in which he mischaracterized the meeting as time spent “talking about the vast amounts of Fake News being put out by the media & how that Fake News has morphed into phrase, 'Enemy of the People.' Sad!”

No, Mr. President. You are asking your fans to close their eyes to true stories you don’t like.

It will be a tragedy for the nation if you succeed.

9000,Williams,Juan,latimes,"It was one year ago this weekend that hundreds of neo-Nazis and white supremacists descended on Charlottesville, Va., for the now-infamous “Unite the Right” rally. We all know what happened next. Counter-protesters showed up to condemn their hateful message and the rally descended into violence, leading to the senseless death of Heather Heyer, a 32-year-old activist and paralegal. Afterward, unbelievably, President Trump placed blame on “both sides.”

Many prominent Republicans denounced the president’s remarks. “There is no moral relativism when it comes to neo-Nazis,” House Speaker Paul D. Ryan said at the time. Rep. Mark Meadows, who chairs the House Freedom Caucus, also issued a rebuke: “We must stand united in opposition to this hate in no uncertain terms.” Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., addressed Trump directly: “Mr. President, we must call evil by its name.”

But in the year since Charlottesville, Republicans in Congress have increasingly turned a blind eye to the president’s racial animus. They also appear to have lost interest in a host of urgent policy issues related to racial inequity: enforcing the Voting Rights Act, reforming the criminal justice system, finding a real fix on immigration.

Meanwhile, their party’s candidates exhibit ever more blatant racism. Seth Grossman, a Republican nominee for Congress in New Jersey, has called the idea of diversity “a bunch of crap.” Corey Stewart, the Senate nominee from Virginia, flaunts his ties to an organizer of the Charlottesville rally and displays the Confederate flag at his campaign events. Arthur Jones and John Fitzgerald, House nominees in Illinois and California, respectively, are proud Holocaust deniers.

Trump, in turn, is embracing candidates like Grossman, who has stated that he believes minorities, immigrants, young women and elites are waging a war on white men. And as Trump slowly turns the GOP into a white identity party, congressional Republicans continue to do nothing.

Their cowardice stands in stark contrast to Republican leadership during the racial turmoil of the 1960s. Without Republican support, there would have been no Civil Rights Act of 1964, no Voting Rights Act of 1965 and no Fair Housing Act of 1968.

America has lost a Republican Party that was willing to work on racial division.

It’s almost as if Republicans have forgotten the central role they played in civil rights history. Here’s a reminder.

To pass the Civil Rights Act, President Johnson needed the support of Republicans in the Senate. He knew that Democrats from the South, strong segregationists, could block the bill. So he asked top Democrats in Congress to reach out to influential Republicans. “The bill can’t pass unless you get Dirksen,” Johnson told Senate Majority Whip Humbert Humphrey, referring to Senate Minority Leader Everett Dirksen.

Dirksen came from a conservative Illinois town where few blacks lived, but he admired the legacy of his party’s founder, Abraham Lincoln. He agreed to pull in Republican support for the bill.

Dirksen saw to it that the phrase “pattern or practice” was inserted before “discrimination” in the text of the bill, ensuring that Washington could not shut down private businesses unless they were systematically engaging in discrimination. He also added language to guarantee that when allegations of employment discrimination came up, state and local governments had time to take action before the Justice Department stepped in.

The strategy worked. Dirksen got enough Republicans to invoke cloture, and the Civil Rights Act was passed. Republican support proved equally critical to the Voting Rights Act and the Fair Housing Act.

In the decades that followed, Republicans made it clear that there was no place in their party for racists, even as white segregationists fled the Democratic Party.

When, in 1981, members of the Ku Klux Klan lynched a black teen named Michael Donald in Alabama, President Reagan condemned them in a speech to the NAACP, saying they “perverted notions of what America is about.”

In 1996, Bob Dole, then the Republican presidential nominee, told his convention crowd that any bigots in the audience should be aware: “The exits, which are clearly marked, are for you to walk out of.”

Even in recent years, some Republicans have led bipartisan efforts to address racial inequality. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, introduced legislation in 2015 to reform the criminal justice system, which imprisons black men at alarmingly disproportionate rates, by reducing mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent crimes. When President Obama said he would sign the bill if it came to him within the year, Grassley joked that he was “not used to the president calling for the rapid passage of my bills.”

Although both parties backed the legislation, the election of Trump and other factors got in the way. Grassley re-introduced the bill in 2017. After Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions called it a “grave error,” Grassley responded that he was “incensed” by the remark. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., also criticized Sessions, explaining that “mandatory minimum sentences have unfairly and disproportionately incarcerated a generation of minorities.”

Enter the Fray: First takes on the news of the minute from L.A. Times Opinion »

The party is continuing to hold back well-meaning individuals within it. Paul and another Republican senator, James Lankford of Oklahoma, joined three Democrats — Dick Durbin, Bob Casey, Cory Booker — to re-introduce a bill last year that would eliminate juvenile solitary confinement. But Republicans in Congress have left the bill for dead.

And Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, a Republican from Wisconsin, joined Rep. John Conyers, a Democrat from Michigan, to re-introduce the Voting Rights Amendment bill. The legislation would update the formula used to determine which states need to get federal permission before changing registration and voting practices. The bill has gone nowhere.

During the final stretch of his presidential campaign, Trump posed a condescending question to African Americans: By voting for him, “What the hell do you have to lose?”

We now know a very important part of the answer.

America has lost a Republican Party that was willing to work on racial division. We have lost a GOP that, less than a decade ago, was capable of issuing a report calling for more outreach to black, Latino and Asian voters. We have lost a party that once knew how to reject racial bigotry and heinous shows of force by white supremacists.

According to a poll conducted in June by Quinnipiac University, 55% of Americans agree that “President Trump has emboldened people who hold racist beliefs to express those beliefs publicly.” Another recent poll found that 64% of Americans think racism is a “major problem,” and that 45% think race relations are getting worse.

This country was once capable of uniting against racism. If we want that America to return, we will need the efforts of both parties.

9618,Williams,Juan,thehill,"What kind of message does it send to voters just before the midterm elections if the GOP can’t keep the lights on while in control of the White House, the Senate and the House of Representatives?

For the past few weeks, Congressional Republicans have been scrambling behind the scenes to head off a government shutdown.

“I’m optimistic we can avoid a government shutdown,” promised Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong 15 Senate Republicans pledge to oppose lifting earmark ban It's not 'woketivism,' it's good business MORE (R-Ky.).

Not so fast, Mr. Majority Leader. President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE has some other ideas — and they center on immigration.

Here is the president talking with right-wing radio host Rush Limbaugh last week:

“I happen to think it’s a great political thing because people want border security,” Trump told Limbaugh, after explaining why he wants to force a shutdown.

Trump’s political gut tells him he can blame any such shutdown on the Democrats.

“I actually think… there’d be more pressure on the other side because we’re doing it because the Democrats are not giving us the votes.”

Republican leaders on Capitol Hill feel trapped. They thought they had a deal with Trump. They have the votes to pass a budget so long as he does not insist on funding for his mythic border wall to separate the U.S. from Mexico.

Trump’s wall is a symbolic rebuff to immigrants and refugees at a cost of $25 billion. It is an emblem built upon Trump’s attacks on immigrants as rapists, gang members and people from “shithole” countries. He wants to cut back both legal and illegal immigration.

Trump’s demonization of immigrants at his rallies led to chants of “Build the Wall!” Nearly two years into his presidency, the wall has not been built.

Now Trump wants to blame congressional Democrats for not giving him the money for his wall. But Republican leaders in Congress, and most GOP lawmakers, are thinking beyond applause lines for Trump at midterm rallies.

Trump’s tax cut and escalating trade wars threaten one of the cornerstones of Republican identity. Republicans have consistently held an advantage over Democrats when voters are asked which party is better at handling the economy. Trump is undermining that advantage.

The Trump tax cut has not spurred a rapid rise in wages for workers or capital investment by big corporations. And pollsters are finding that it is not proving to be politically persuasive with voters as Republicans campaign to hold House and Senate seats in the upcoming elections.

That horror show could get worse for the Republicans who are still in Congress after the midterms.

In July, the Office of Management and Budget reported that the tax cut passed without restraint on federal spending is now estimated to “add $101 billion more to the 2019 deficit, pushing it above $1 trillion,” The Hill reported.

The tax cut “is helping to drive up the federal deficit and push the national debt as a percentage of annual economic output to levels not seen since just after World War II,” USA Today reported, in an article on a study by the non-partisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget earlier this year.

Major Republican financial donors — including those in the vast network helmed by libertarian billionaire Charles Koch — now share the concern over how the nation’s spiraling debt could damage the economy.

Koch officials cite the $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill passed by Congress in March as a key reason for their refusal to help their usual Republican allies on Capitol Hill.

Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel, standing by Trump, took the extraordinary step of warning the RNC’s donors against donating to the Koch network last week.

With polls showing that the Republicans can expect a rough ride in November, the party’s congressional leaders are sufficiently worried about the political future to begin distancing themselves from the president.

“Our hope is [that] by the end of August, the Senate will approve nine of 12 appropriations bills, which means 90 percent of the funding of the federal government — from the Senate point of view — will be done through the regular order before we get to Labor Day,” McConnell told reporters last week.

Long before Trump entered politics, McConnell proved his worth as a tactician.

Now, with an unpopular Republican president and an approval rating of just 15 percent for the GOP-controlled Congress, the last thing McConnell needs is a big flashing reminder to voters of his party’s inability to do a basic task — keep the government running.

Trump remains stubborn about his border wall; the Koch network is ready to retaliate against any Republican who passes a spending bill not to its liking; and don’t forget those fractious House conservatives itching for a public fight to show they are still relevant.

Some Republicans are going to be disappointed here. The real loser if this shutdown happens — as with all previous shutdowns — will be the American economy.

As Trump might say: “Sad!”

10324,Williams,Juan,thehill,"Here’s a sentence I never thought I’d write: The majority of American voters now believe the President of Russia has compromising information on the President of the United States.

In other words, they think our president is being blackmailed.

That shocking political reality comes from a Quinnipiac University poll published last week. Fifty-one percent of American voters said yes, Russia has kompromat, or compromising material, that allows them to control Trump.

ADVERTISEMENT

The precise nature of the blackmail remains a mystery.

But the critical point here — less than four months before the midterm elections — is that a majority of American voters say the only way to make sense of Trump’s submissive behavior toward Vladimir Putin is that Trump is under Russian control for some mysterious reason.

Rep. Will Hurd William Ballard HurdPence autobiography coming from Simon & Schuster Prince Harry joins Aspen Institute commission on misinformation Congress's latest hacking investigation should model its most recent MORE (R-Texas) wrote last week that as a former CIA agent, he has seen Russian intelligence officers manipulate people but “I never thought I would see the day when an American president is one of them.”

The prime example of why Americans are pointing to blackmail is Trump’s incredible statement — as he was standing next to Putin at the recent Helsinki summit — that he had no reason to doubt Putin’s denials of Russian interference in the 2016 campaign.

That docile performance in Helsinki required Trump to turn his back on American intelligence officials who have briefed him on the overwhelming evidence of Russian interference in the 2016 election.

And there is more.

What else but blackmail can explain why Trump would exclude his own staff from his two-hour meeting with Putin?

Blackmail also seems the best explanation for why Trump has yet to tell his fellow Americans what happened in that encounter.

USA Today’s editorial board noted last week that Russian-controlled media outlets are reporting Trump agreed to help pay for the reconstruction of Syria while President Bashar Assad — a Russian pawn who has used chemical weapons on his own people — remains in power. Is that true?

Is it true, as the Russian media suggest, that Trump is open to allowing Putin, the man behind interference in the 2016 U.S. election, to stage a referendum in the Ukraine in order to claim that nation as Russian territory?

Maybe that is why a new NBC News/Marist Poll, conducted from July 19-22, found that 53 percent of voters say Trump has done something either “unethical” or “illegal” in his relationship with Russia.

Blackmail is also the easiest explanation for Trump’s stumbling effort to invite Putin to the White House this fall without consulting his key national security and foreign policy advisers.

Other than blackmail, what reason is there for Trump to have White House aides denigrate Dan Coats Daniel (Dan) Ray CoatsExperts see 'unprecedented' increase in hackers targeting electric grid Intel heads to resume worldwide threats hearing scrapped under Trump Lack of cyber funds in Biden infrastructure plan raises eyebrows MORE, his Director of National Intelligence, as having “gone rogue”? All Coats did was react with genuine surprise at being told Trump wanted to invite Putin onto American soil.

“Did I hear you right?” Coats asked NBC’s Andrea Mitchell when she read news of the invitation out loud while conducting a public interview with him in Aspen. “OK, that’s going to be special,” Coats added with a laugh.

Honorable men like Coats are in an impossible situation serving this president. But respectfully, Mr. Coats, this is no joke. Any other national security official in the nation’s history would have resigned in protest.

Blackmail also might explain why Trump threatened former U.S. intelligence officials with loss of their security clearances for being critical of his dealings with Russia.

Trump’s attack on those critics sent a warning to Coats and others now serving in the administration that if they speak out, they too will have their good names dragged through the mud with charges that they are part of the fictional “deep state conspiracy.”

Sen. Bob Corker Robert (Bob) Phillips CorkerFox News inks contributor deal with former Democratic House member Senate GOP faces retirement brain drain Roy Blunt won't run for Senate seat in 2022 MORE (R-Tenn.) slammed Trump’s threat against former intelligence officials as a “banana republic” tactic and likened it to the actions of the corrupt regime in Venezuela.

“I can't say it more forcefully. We really need a clear understanding as to what is going on, what our president is agreeing to, and what our strategy is on a number of issues,"" said Corker, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Mike PompeoThe Hill's 12:30 Report - Presented by Facebook - All US adults now eligible for COVID vaccines Parade of 2024 GOP hopefuls court House conservatives Pompeo violated ethics rules, State Dept. watchdog finds MORE came to brief the panel.

Pompeo asked the senators to close their eyes to Trump’s actions in Helsinki and pledged that Trump “accepts our intelligence community's conclusion that Russia meddled in the 2016 election.”

Really? If that is true, then why does the president seem incapable of saying that in front of Putin?

Last week, Trump told his supporters: “Stick with us. Don’t believe the crap you see from these people [journalists].” He also advised: “What you are seeing and what you’re reading is not what’s happening.”

If the past two years have taught us anything, it is that Trump’s cult of remaining supporters revel in their willful ignorance.

Even so, a majority of Americans now suspect the answer to the puzzle of Trump’s relationship with Russia is simple: blackmail.

Trump’s insults reveal an insecurity.

He knows Biden is the best Democrat to take back the White House.

Why?

The Democrats’ political fortunes in the 2020 presidential race hinge on winning back the white, working-class voters in the middle of the country. At the moment, Biden is the best Democrat to speak to those voters.

Last week, a Harvard/Harris poll showed Biden had a lead — 32 percent to 18 percent over Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' Cuba readies for life without Castro Chelsea Clinton: Pics of Trump getting vaccinated would help him 'claim credit' MORE — as the Democrats’ favorite candidate to face off against Trump.

Biden’s rise has a lot to do with his appeal to the white working class. According to the Reuters-Ipsos weekly presidential approval ratings, Trump still has the support of 52 percent of non-college educated whites. Quinnipiac has him with a 54 percent approval rating in the same demographic.

That’s still a majority — but a far fall from the nearly 70 percent of whites without a college degree who supported him in 2016.

In the short run, Trump’s loss of a big slice of those voters opens the door to major political problems for this year’s GOP congressional candidates. They are facing high voter enthusiasm among Democrats who want to rein in Trump.

Declining support among white working-class voters also makes the GOP more vulnerable in the midterms because Trump has already lost favor with a lot of educated, suburban swing voters, especially white women. They have not reacted well to Trump separating children from parents at the border, nor to a year and half of chaotic tweets, trade wars and an embrace of Russian president Vladimir Putin.

Note that the Democrats have a record number of women running in the midterms.

Meanwhile, black and Latino anti-Trump voters have more reason than ever to get out to vote. Trump’s attacks on immigrants and distaste for federal policies to curb police brutality against blacks or help minority students go to college has fired up those voters.

To counter the energized Democrats, Trump will try to revive support among the white working class by bashing immigrants and lambasting NFL players for protesting brutal cops.

But Trump’s team was really counting on last year’s tax cut to stir the white, working-class base in the midterms.

So far, it is a dud.

“Real average hourly compensation actually fell in the first quarter after the tax reform was passed,” Bloomberg Opinion writer Noah Smith recently explained. Wealthy shareholders have seen gains in their stocks, he added, but there is no major rise in business investment. He concluded that it is possible the “tax cuts have run their course as economic policy.”

That conclusion is supported by an analysis by Americans for Tax Fairness that found the tax cuts have led to only 4.3 percent of workers “getting any one-time bonuses or wage increases from their employers.” A recent Morning Consult/Politico poll found 52 percent of voters said they got no wage hike from the tax cut.

That makes it easy for Democrats running this year and in 2020 to make the case that Trump’s tax cuts benefitted the wealthiest one percent of Americans while doing almost nothing to put more money in the pockets of the working class of any race.

Incredibly, congressional Republicans went to the White House last week to try one more time to make the tax plan more attractive, this time by making permanent individual tax cuts in the initial bill.

Right now, however, working-class whites in the Midwest and the south are feeling economic pain caused by the trade wars Trump has started.

Retaliatory tariffs have raised prices on American exporters — particularly agriculture, but also on cars and manufacturing. Harley-Davidson, a white working-class favorite, is moving jobs overseas to avoid the trade wars. And Trump is criticizing the Federal Reserve for raising interest rates.

These are bad signs for the GOP.

And then there is healthcare.

The Trump tax cuts included a repeal of the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate, which is leading to higher premiums and lower coverage rates for working-class Americans. Outright repeal of the whole law would make healthcare even more expensive.

Trump may soon regret wishing for Biden as an opponent.

Biden’s white working-class roots make him a strong messenger to ask Trump’s voters the 2020 version of Ronald Reagan’s famous question in 1980, as he challenged an incumbent president — are they better off today than they were four years ago?

Biden is not the only Democrat ready to ask that question.

Last week another white male Democrat, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, won the chairmanship of the National Governors Association. Bullock won reelection in his state even though Trump carried Montana by 20 points.

Bullock’s pitch would essentially be the same as Biden’s but from a younger candidate.

From there, it becomes easier to imagine a Democrat — be it Biden, Bullock, or even Sens. Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersOvernight Energy: Treasury creates hub to fight climate change through finance | Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez introduce 'Green New Deal for Public Housing' | Don't attack Zoom for its Bernie Sanders federal tax bill Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez introduce 'Green New Deal for Public Housing' MORE (I-Vt.) or Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth WarrenWorld passes 3 million coronavirus deaths Poll: 56 percent say wealth tax is part of solution to inequality Democratic senators call on Biden to support waiving vaccine patents MORE (D-Mass.) — winning back the white working-class voters Trump branded the “forgotten.”

Perhaps they will be forgotten no more.

Right now, the Russians are already busy hacking into the 2018 midterms.

“With the U.S. midterms approaching, Russian trolls found ways to remain active on Twitter well into 2018, trying to rile up the American electorate with tweets on everything from Roseanne Barr’s firing to Donald Trump Jr. Don TrumpTrump Jr. shares edited video showing father knocking Biden down with golf ball Trump: 'I can't imagine' any Republican would beat me in 2024 primary if I run Trump Jr.: There are 'plenty' of GOP incumbents who should be challenged MORE’s divorce,” the Wall Street Journal reported last week.

But President Trump doesn’t see a problem. “Russia continues to say they had nothing to do with Meddling in our Election,” the president tweeted June 28.

And a Gallup survey released last week found Trump’s view is leading his fellow Republicans to embrace Russia. “The percentage of Republicans calling Russia a friend or ally is up sharply since 2014, from 22 percent to 40 percent,” the pollsters reported.

Last week in London, Trump was pushed to say he will bring up Russian interference in U.S. politics but he predicted little would come of it.

“I don’t think you’ll have any ‘Gee, I did it, I did it, you got me,’” Trump said downplaying Russian interference. “There won’t be a Perry Mason here…But I will absolutely firmly ask the question. And hopefully we’ll have a very good relationship with Russia.”

Democrats are pointed in explaining why Trump sees no problem.

Engel added: “If we allow foreign interference in our elections so long as it supports our political objectives, then we’ve put party before country and put our democracy in crisis.”

That did not stop a delegation of seven Republican senators and a congresswoman from going to Russia recently on what looked like a water carrying mission for Trump’s alternative reality.

Sen. Ron Johnson Ronald (Ron) Harold Johnson15 Senate Republicans pledge to oppose lifting earmark ban 'Real Housewives of the GOP' — Wannabe reality show narcissists commandeer the party Republicans fret over divisive candidates MORE (R- Wis.), the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, came back to Capitol Hill to say that Russian interference in U.S. elections, while not acceptable, is “not the greatest threat to our democracy,” and “we’ve blown it way out of proportion.”

He later said the Republican visitors had warned the Russians about interference.

That led Sen. Ben Cardin Benjamin (Ben) Louis CardinSenators in the dark on parliamentarian's decision When it comes to the Iran nuclear deal, what's a moderate Democrat to do? Battle lines drawn on Biden's infrastructure plan MORE (D- Md.) to say the delegation’s trip made it clear “there are members of the Senate who are either naïve or they don’t recognize the real risk factors that Russia imposes on our system of government.”

And last week the president appeared to distance himself from U.S. allies as if pursuing a Russian agenda.

A translated clip from Russian state-run television has gone viral in progressive media circles showing a Russian commentator marveling at Trump’s trashing of NATO.

“I never thought I’d live to see this!” the Russian commentator exclaims. “Neither the USSR nor Russia, who tried many times to drive the wedge between transatlantic allies, but the main player, Washington, and President Trump himself is doing everything to break down the foundations of transatlantic alliance and unity.”

In fact, Trump falsely claimed that Germany was a “captive” to Putin because “60 to 70 percent of their energy comes from Russia.”

The insulting mischaracterization drew a sharp rebuke from German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

“I myself experienced a part of Germany that was controlled by the Soviet Union, and I am very happy today that we are united in freedom as the Federal Republic of Germany,” Merkel said. “We decide our own policies and make our own decisions, and that’s very good.”

By contrast, Trump never misses an opportunity to say nice things about Vladimir Putin.

As a candidate, he said Putin was “a leader far more than our President (Obama)” and a “strong leader.”

And despite pleas from his aides, Trump congratulated Putin on his election victory earlier this year — legitimizing what many international observers believe to be a sham election.

Meanwhile, Trump’s former campaign manager awaits trial for illicit ties to Russia and his former National Security Adviser stands a felon for lying about his contacts with Russia.

Trump is banking on Soviet-style propaganda in the U.S. to make Russian interference, along with the Mueller investigation, into a partisan issue.

The winner in all of this madness is Putin. He is dividing Americans against themselves and America against her allies.

Only the American voters can stop it.

12389,Williams,Juan,thehill,"What can diminish faith in America as a beacon of democracy to the world?

How about the emerging realization of an awful pattern in which the American political party that wins the most votes at the ballot box is denied control of the House of Representatives, Senate and White House?

ADVERTISEMENT

Even more damaging to democracy is having the party that wins with fewer votes celebrate extremist elements while ignoring the will of the majority of voters.

Take a look at today’s major political issues. Time after time, a minority of Republican voters is overruling the will of our nation’s majority of voters:

Appointments to the Supreme Court: Having blocked President Obama from exercising his right to put a pro-choice judge on the court, the 2016 Republican Party platform called for the appointment of judges who will end legal abortion by overturning Roe v. Wade.

But last month, a Kaiser poll found a clear majority of Americans, 67 percent, want judges to uphold a woman’s right to choose to have an abortion. Those results track with a recent Quinnipiac University poll that found 63 percent of Americans favor keeping Roe v. Wade.

Health care: Even as President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE and Congressional Republicans have repealed the individual mandate, and bad-mouthed the rest of the Affordable Care Act, a Quinnipiac poll found 51 percent of Americans want ObamaCare to remain in place.

Tax cuts: President Trump’s signature legislative achievement is disapproved of by 41 percent of Americans versus the 34 percent who approve, according to a Monmouth poll. Quinnipiac found 46 percent disapproval of the tax cuts, which primarily benefit the wealthy and corporate interests. Among Americans with a job, nearly half, 49 percent, tell pollsters the tax cuts have not raised their wages.

On major issues from abortion, to health care, taxes and certainly on separating children from parents at the border, the majority of Americans stand with Democrats and against President Trump.

Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank recently put a fine point on this idea.

“Now we have a Supreme Court nomination — the second in as many years — from an unpopular president who lost the popular vote by 2.8 million. The nominee will be forced through by also-unpopular Senate Republicans, who, like House Republicans, did not win a majority of the vote in 2016,” Milbank argued.

This is not a matter of Democrats whining about losing the 2016 election. This is an ongoing outrage against majority rule.

Gerald Seib wrote in the Wall Street Journal last week that if faith in the fairness and integrity of the electoral system is lost, “the chances that citizens will resort to other darker means for venting their frustration go up significantly.”

The filmmaker Michael Moore expressed deep anger at the decline of democracy when he recently told late night talk show host Stephen Colbert that Democrats have won the popular vote in six of the last seven presidential elections but have won the White House only four times.

In 2000 and again in 2016, a Republican won the presidency while receiving fewer votes than his Democratic opponent.

“The Republicans have only won once since 1988,” Moore said. That was in “in 2004, with Bush, that’s the only time they’ve won the popular vote! The country we live in doesn’t want the Republicans in the White House! They don’t want them running this country! We’re the majority!”

This corrosion of American democracy has reached the point that some big Republican voices are finally rebelling against the current Trump-led GOP.

George Will, the dean of conservative columnists, has asked Republicans to vote for Democrats this fall to “affirm the nation’s honor,” and to isolate Trump.

Last week, Max Boot wrote in the Washington Post that, as a principled conservative, he is “rooting” for Democrats to win the House and Senate in the midterm elections because “like postwar Germany and Japan, the Republican Party must be destroyed before it can be rebuilt.”

Wow. When was the last time you heard a conservative writer link Republicans to Hitler’s Third Reich and Hirohito’s empire? Boot also said the GOP under Trump is no longer “a conservative party with a white-nationalist fringe” but has become a “white-nationalist party with a conservative fringe.”

The week before, Steve Schmidt, who led the GOP’s presidential campaign in 2008, warned that with Trump as the top Republican, the party is a threat to the nation.

“The American people are fed a daily diet of nonsense-talk and lies… Nobody should underestimate the threat posed by a political party where conservatism is now defined by absolute obedience to a leader with autocratic tendencies who fetishizes dictators and autocrats all over the world,” he said.

Former Florida Republican Congressman David Jolly issued a similar warning last October. He said the country would be “better off” with Democrats in the House majority because Trump might “put this nation at risk, and this Republican Congress has done nothing to check his power.”

Dissident Republicans voting for Democrats may well be the best hope democracy has if it is to survive.

The Democrats — and American democracy — need all the help they can get.

13012,Williams,Juan,thehill,"Hats off to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong 15 Senate Republicans pledge to oppose lifting earmark ban It's not 'woketivism,' it's good business MORE (R-Ky.).

His manipulation of Supreme Court nominations is proving to be a big winner for Republicans.

It is also a big loser for Americans who still believe the nation’s highest court should be guided by the law and not politics.

ADVERTISEMENT

The Pew Research Center reports that the Supreme Court’s favorability rating with the public hit a 30-year low in 2015.

That was the year the court upheld ObamaCare and legalized same-sex marriage. After those decisions, there was a sharp drop in support among Republicans. Only 33 percent of Republicans held a favorable view of the court.

Now support for the court among Republicans — and independent voters who lean right — has shot up. More than 70 percent have a favorable view of the court.

What happened to cause Republicans to more than double their favorable rating for the court?

The answer is that Republicans began stacking the court with right-wing judges who are in lockstep opposition to ObamaCare and same sex marriage.

And now the high court is on the verge of abandoning all claims to offering a fair reading of the law. If Trump names another far-right judge, the court will be nothing more than a reliable rubber-stamp for the Republican Party’s conservative agenda.

McConnell began this partisan transformation by refusing to allow a Senate vote on President Obama’s final nominee to the court, Merrick Garland Merrick GarlandGarland warns domestic terrorism 'still with us' on anniversary of Oklahoma City bombing Mazie Hirono: Asian American, Pacific Islander community 'feels under siege' amid rise in hate crimes ABC lands first one-on-one TV interview with Garland since confirmation MORE, for nearly a year. He wanted to see if a Republican might win the White House. He won that bet.

Once Donald Trump won the White House in 2016, McConnell changed the Senate rules for considering Supreme Court nominees.

He did away with the need for 60 votes to end a filibuster against a high court nominee. Instead, McConnell allowed a simple majority, largely along partisan lines, to confirm the right-winger Neil Gorsuch for the court.

Gorsuch’s name was selected by the Trump White House from a list prepared by the conservative Federalist Society.

Now McConnell, the top Senate Republican, is shamelessly rushing a vote on President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE’s nominee even though we are only four months from the midterm elections.

Hypocrisy? Yes, definitely.

Still, it is hard to argue with winning tactics.

But there are consequences to playing political hardball with the Supreme Court. The court’s standing as an independent, nonpartisan third branch of the federal government, is falling fast among Democrats.

Until now, a steady 60 percent of Democrats held a favorable view of the court and its integrity. But with the prospect of a lightning-fast confirmation process for another openly partisan right-wing nominee, the court is reduced to just another untrustworthy institution in American life.

When Sen. Kamala Harris Kamala HarrisBiden, Harris commend Mondale in paving the way for female VP Overnight Energy: Treasury creates hub to fight climate change through finance | Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez introduce 'Green New Deal for Public Housing' | Harris: Americans able to 'breathe easier and sleep better' under Biden MORE (D-Calif.) was asked about Trump’s upcoming nominee to replace retiring Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, she said: “We’re looking at a destruction of the Constitution of the United States.”

Harris added, of Trump: “He’s been appointing ideologues, he’s been appointing people who have refused to agree that Brown v. Board of Education [the ruling that found racial segregation in public schools to be unconstitutional] is settled law.”

The California senator was referring to Wendy Vitter, one of Trump’s far-right nominees to the federal bench.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiWhite House readies for Chauvin verdict House GOP's McClain responds to Pelosi calling her 'that woman' GOP struggles to rein in nativism MORE (D-Calif.) said that Kennedy’s resignation had created a situation where “President Trump and Senate Republicans now threaten to destroy a generation of progress.”

Even political moderates fear the court is becoming the property of one party. Steve Schmidt, who managed John McCain John Sidney McCain'Real Housewives of the GOP' — Wannabe reality show narcissists commandeer the party George W. Bush: 'It's a problem that Americans are so polarized' they can't imagine him being friends with Michelle Obama Congress brings back corrupt, costly, and inequitably earmarks MORE’s 2008 presidential campaign — but has now shed his GOP affiliation to protest Trump’s excesses — is calling on Democrats to do “everything” possible to stop a rush vote on Trump’s upcoming nominee.

“They stole a Supreme Court seat from the Democrats,” Schmidt said. “For the fabric of our democracy, Democrats should dig in hard here with everything they [can do] to block this nomination...until we see what happens in the midterm elections.”

Schmidt noted that Trump is a unique president. His disdain for the justice system makes the stakes of this nomination even higher.

After all, he claims he can pardon himself while he is constantly badmouthing law enforcement, including his own Justice Department, the FBI, the CIA and the special counsel investigating his campaign’s ties to Russian interference in the 2016 presidential contest.

Even before Kennedy’s retirement, the court’s conservative majority was testing public faith in the court’s impartiality.

Just this term, the court’s 5-4 conservative majority did away with 40 years of law to gut the financial base of public sector unions — strong financial backers of Democrats.

They also allowed more states to take names off of voting rolls without any evidence of voter fraud while preserving GOP-gerrymandered districts. And they approved the Trump travel ban despite his campaign trail rhetoric which, critics say, revealed an anti-Islam bias.

“It feels like for the next 30 years, America is going to change in a horrible direction. And in some ways, it feels like all hope is dead and nothing could bring it back,” said Trevor Noah, host of Comedy Central’s The Daily Show.

With hopelessness on the horizon, it is time for people who treasure an independent Supreme Court to stand up, get to the polls and vote.

13140,Williams,Juan,foxnews,"This will be a strange July Fourth.

Sure, there will be the normal cookouts and fireworks. But this July Fourth it seems the country is more deeply divided over politics than I can recall.

Majorities of Americans say they have a negative view of the president, the House and the Senate.

Bitter disputes over Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into the Trump campaign and Russian interference in the 2016 election dominate national headlines.

Then there is a further divide over black NFL players kneeling during the national anthem to protest police brutality.

And who can avoid the loud arguments over immigration and the recent outrage at the policy of separating children from their parents?

With all that negativity in the air, some people may wonder if it is the right moment to celebrate the country.

That is especially true among people on the liberal side of politics, since conservatives control the White House, Congress and increasingly the courts. Some people might legitimately ask the depressing question: What the hell is happening to my country?

But even for the people most anxious about current American politics, there remains one central achievement to celebrate.

The Constitution written by the Founding Fathers has been able to survive crooked politicians, the Civil War, two world wars, economic depression and international terror. To this day, the U.S. Constitution stands as an ageless marvel – the schematic for the greatest political system in world history.

And this, I believe, is an achievement worthy of fireworks.

To me, the Fourth isn’t about honoring any particular political party or administration, no matter how much any politicians might try to drape themselves in red, white and blue.

The joy of the Fourth is that it celebrates the people who created a system that is bigger than dark political moments; big enough to withstand change and evolve through time.

Two years ago I wrote a celebrated book – “We the People: The Modern-Day Figures Who Have Reshaped and Affirmed the Founding Fathers’ Vision of America.” In it, I asked readers to imagine what our Founding Fathers would have thought if they visited America today, in the early 21st century.

How would they react to learning that women – who could not own property or vote in the colonial period – hold 107 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives?

How would they react to President Obama and the reality that a black man had been president for eight years? In their Constitution, blacks could not vote and were legally enslaved.

How would they react to a racially diverse America? At the time they wrote the Constitution the citizens of the new nation were nearly all white. Blacks and Native Americans were not considered citizens.

Today about 40 percent of the nation is not white.

Today gay people can legally marry.

Today the U.S. is the world’s greatest military power and part of a global economic system.

Yes, so much has changed since the Declaration of Independence was read out loud 242 years ago on July Fourth.

But the power of an idea – the American idea – that all people are equal under law and that all people have individual rights, “among them life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,” including a guaranteed voice in democratic politics, remains the brightest beacon of political stability ever known.

And the key reason for the durability of the American idea is that the Founding Fathers 11 years later wrote a Constitution that put trust in future generations of Americans to continue the work needed to “establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for common defense, promote the general welfare and secure the blessing of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.”

Their Constitution is flexible, allowing for amendments to cope with future political realities, such as ending slavery.

Their Constitution allowed for changes that enabled women to gain the right to vote in the 20th century.

And their Constitution allowed for changes to immigration law that have made America a land of immigrants from every corner of the world.

I’m certain the Founding Fathers would be surprised that two Irish-Catholics who would have been outcasts in the colonies – President Kennedy and his brother, Sen. Ted Kennedy – pushed Congress to allow people from all over the world to become Americans. They were the brains and muscle behind the famous Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965.

In the founders’ era, only “free white person(s) … of good character” could become American citizens. Over the next 150 years, Congress passed law after law making it difficult for all but Western Europeans to gain citizenship – sometimes through national quotas; sometimes through outright bans.

The Kennedy brothers grew up with stories about how hard it had been for their Irish-Catholic ancestors when they arrived in Boston during the previous century. As the first Catholic president in a largely Protestant nation, JFK knew personally what it meant to be an outsider, and identified with the families blocked from entry into the United States.

So the Kennedy brothers – as well as President Lyndon Johnson; Sen. Philip Hart, D-Mich.; and Rep. Emanuel Celler, D-N.Y. – lobbied for and eventually won passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965. This new law replaced the old, discriminatory quota system with a process that favored skilled workers and family reunification.

The result is a stronger America that benefits from the drive and ambition of people who want to join the American family.

As different types of people were welcomed in America, the nation’s face changed; whites dropped from 84 percent of the population in 1965, to 62 percent in 2015. And the immigrants enriched the country with different languages, food and culture.

Despite seismic shifts in demographics, economics and politics, we still live by the Constitution. We remain a nation of laws.

Time for fireworks worthy of that good news.",-1,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/06/30/juan-williams-july-fourth-finds-americans-deeply-divided-yet-with-something-incredible-to-celebrate.html

13690,Williams,Juan,thehill,"Raffi, my youngest child, wore his grandfather’s watch on his wedding day.

The classic with a sepia-toned dial symbolized the idea that, even as time passes, family bonds of love endure.

So what a painful contrast to my moment of joy a week ago to now see families being torn apart on the southern border.

ADVERTISEMENT

How could an American president intentionally separate children from parents — break up families — as a new policy to deter immigrants from coming to the USA?

I understand that Trump plays politics with immigrants. He has even proposed cutting legal immigration in half. And he displayed indifference to family bonds when he proposed ending the family reunification standard that has been the hallmark of American immigration.

Last year, he went after immigrant children when he tore up the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program that allows youngsters brought here illegally — but who grew up in America, attended school here and even served in the U.S. military — to legally remain here.

This is being done by a president who recently described immigrants coming to America as an “infestation”? Of course, he began his run for president by demonizing Mexican immigrants as rapists and criminals.

Well, Mr. Trump, let me tell you a great American story: I came to this country as a child immigrant.

My mother left Panama in 1958 after it became clear to her and my dad that the rule of dictator Arnulfo Arias had narrowed the doors of education and economic opportunity for my sister, my brother and for me.

My mom was nearly 50 when she left behind everything she knew to give her kids a chance at a better life. She did not want us growing up amid the gut-wrenching poverty, anti-black bigotry and the violence that was festering in our hometown of Colon.

My dad stayed behind as she took the children — then aged 4, 11 and 14 — to America as added cargo on a banana boat bound for New York. Yes, a banana boat.

Fast-forward 60 years to last weekend’s wedding.

My brother, sister, and I are now the elders in three blessed, successful families.

When I say we are successful, I am saying we have earned our way as Americans.

My mom worked for minimum wage in a sweat shop in lower Manhattan to support us.

But that immigrant with the fourth grade education lived to see her daughter get a doctorate from Harvard. She saw my brother get his law degree from New York University. She read my writing in The Washington Post and The Hill, and watched me do political commentary on Fox News Channel. She even took a trip with me to a rural Virginia factory to watch as one of my best-selling books rolled off the presses.

None of this would have been possible had a demagogue like Trump been president. Imagine if President Eisenhower talked about “shithole” countries and separated me from my mother as our family sacrificed to become part of the great American story.

Former First Lady Laura Bush understands:

“I appreciate the need to enforce and protect our international boundaries, but this zero-tolerance policy is cruel,” she wrote in the Washington Post. “It is immoral. And it breaks my heart.”

Former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger (R) understands the deep bonds of family under attack by Trump.

“As an immigrant, I know the magnetic power of America's greatness… As an American, I know that kids shouldn't be pawns while the ‘adults’ figure it out,” Schwarzenegger tweeted.

Other Republicans, however, are in the grips of Trump’s anti-immigrant mania.

Ann Coulter said crying children were “child actors.”

Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski Corey LewandowskiThe Memo: The mystery of post-presidency Trump Trump frustrated with pace of super PAC Dozens of Trump appointees 'burrow' into Biden government MORE dismissed a story about a child with Down’s Syndrome being separated from his parents by making a mocking sound: “Womp, Womp.”

At rallies, Trump compares refugees to poisonous snakes that will eventually kill anyone that takes them into a home. And he highlights any criminal act by an immigrant as if immigrants have a higher rate of criminal activity than native-born Americans. That is just another Trump lie. But it is damaging to real people trying to join the American family.

Trump at first said breaking families apart was a deterrent to illegal immigrants. When statistics showed that was not true, he said it was up to Congress to change the law. But when he signed an executive order ending his family separation policy, that was revealed to be another lie.

At no point did Trump act out of concern for families and children.

He reversed himself only after a CBS News Poll found 67 percent of Americans said it was unacceptable to cut children away from their parents. Even 39 percent of self-described Republicans said it was unacceptable — along with 90 percent of Democrats and 66 percent of independent voters.

“It is fitting that President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE has been forced into retreat by babies. Cruelty should never be mistaken for strength,” Karen Tumulty wrote in the Washington Post.

My family came here as legal immigrants. But illegal immigrant children are the most vulnerable. And now Trump reduces them to collateral damage as he attempts to force Congress to give him money for a symbolic border wall.

The facts show the wall is all about politics because most illegal immigrants overstay visas and most illegal drugs come through legal ports of entry.

Raffi and his bride Morgan’s wedding was a celebration of the strength of family bonds and children yet to be born. That is America the beautiful.

But in the same week, our country lost the moral high ground that once allowed President Reagan to single us out to the world as the “shining city on the hill.”

Mr. Trump, have you no heart?

During the presidential campaign, candidate Donald Trump reached out to African-American voters by asking, “what the hell do you have to lose?” Here is a cogent response from a veteran journalist.

Williams (Muzzled: The Assault on Honest Debate, 2011, etc.), currently a columnist at The Hill, provides detailed answers to Trump’s question regarding six different realms of government discrimination against African-Americans, using the Civil Rights Act as approved by Congress in 1964 as his guide for selecting those elements. Other key laws include the Fair Housing Act and the Voting Rights Act. In each area, the author documents the dreadful early record of the Trump administration, followed by a succinct history of the civil rights gains made against stiff opposition during the second half of the 20th century. As Williams focuses on the gains, he singles out a primary advocate in each of the six realms: voting rights (Bob Moses), education (James Meredith), public accommodations (Everett Dirksen), equal rights legislation (James Baldwin), employment (A. Philip Randolph), and housing (Robert Weaver). Williams is an accomplished storyteller; as a result, the oft-documented historical gains in each chapter feel fresh again. Trump has been shamed countless times for translating his racist tendencies into abhorrent public policy, so Williams does not mount any groundbreaking attacks. However, his skillful succinctness makes his anti-Trump commentaries often devastating. Some readers might consider the author’s account of past gains overly enthusiastic. He notes that while never deviating from accepted factual accounts, he intends for the historical context of the gains to spawn inspiration. Williams writes that he feels optimistic about the post-Trump future for civil rights because those on the correct side of the law can rely on far more resources, digital and otherwise, than their predecessors.

As he ends this relevant and well-grounded book, Williams tells Trump that African-Americans have “a lot” to lose, “far more, it appears, than [Trump] will ever know.”",-1,https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/juan-williams/what-the-hell-do-you-have-to-lose/
14403,Williams,Juan,thehill,"The Kool-Aid is spilling over those bright red “Make America Great Again” cups these days. All but a few brave Republicans are imbibing like there’s no tomorrow.

The message from last week’s GOP primaries in Virginia and South Carolina was encapsulated in the words of one upset winner, Katie Arrington: “We are the party of Donald J. Trump.”

Since the days of President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE’s 2016 campaign, observers have been asking what it would take for Republicans in Congress, in the right-wing media, and in evangelical pews to turn against him.

""We are in a strange place. I mean, it’s almost, it’s becoming a cultish thing, isn’t it?” Sen. Bob Corker Robert (Bob) Phillips CorkerFox News inks contributor deal with former Democratic House member Senate GOP faces retirement brain drain Roy Blunt won't run for Senate seat in 2022 MORE (R-Tenn.) told reporters last week.

“And it’s not a good place for any party to end up with a cult-like situation as it relates to a president,"" Corker added in exasperation.

Corker’s lament for the broken state of the GOP — a party that once stood for free trade, lowering the deficit, family values and the power of a western alliance that opposed dictators — fits with a recent message from McCain:

“To Our allies: bipartisan majorities of Americans remain pro-free-trade, pro-globalization & supportive of alliances based on 70 years of shared values. Americans stand with you, even if our president doesn’t,” he tweeted.

Sen. Jeff Flake Jeffrey (Jeff) Lane FlakeFive reasons why US faces chronic crisis at border Senate GOP faces retirement brain drain Former GOP lawmaker: Republican Party 'engulfed in lies and fear' MORE (R-Ariz.) put it more succinctly:

“Fellow Republicans, this is not who we are. This cannot be our party.”

Flake’s tweet came after Peter Navarro, one of the president’s economic advisors, said there is a “special place in hell,” for Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, simply because Trudeau accurately described Trump’s unilateral tariffs as “insulting.”

Last month, former Speaker John Boehner John Andrew BoehnerGOP struggles to rein in nativism Former GOP lawmaker calls idea of 'America First' caucus 'racism in a jar' The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Facebook - All US adults can get vaccine; decision Friday on J&J vax MORE (R-Ohio) put the GOP’s crushing identity crisis this way:

“There is no Republican Party. There’s a Trump party. The Republican Party is taking a nap somewhere.”

According to the Gallup tracking poll, Trump was enjoying a 90 percent approval rating among self-described Republicans during the first week of June.

But those numbers may be an illusion.

“Right now, Trump is popular, obviously, among Republicans…but I think it is overstated,” Bill Kristol, editor at large of the conservative magazine The Weekly Standard, told a Republican business group in New Hampshire last month.

Kristol explained that “about half of those people strongly approve, about half of those people somewhat approve,” and he said a lot of Trump’s popularity is a “retrospective judgment” in which many Republicans are still saying they prefer Trump to Democrat Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' Cuba readies for life without Castro Chelsea Clinton: Pics of Trump getting vaccinated would help him 'claim credit' MORE and appreciate that he put a conservative on the Supreme Court.

In an interview with National Review, Kristol said focus groups show that Trump-supporting Republicans, like most Americans, are not happy “with the divisiveness and the sense of just bitterness and everything is always a hyperpartisan fight, a personal fight, a fight in which you demean your opponents, and Americans really don’t like that.”

One line of criticism does seem to get traction — anxiety that Trump is starting trade wars that could hurt the economy. This is a strong concern with the midterm elections approaching, and with suburban white women holding the key to districts that could swing control of the House to Democrats.

GOP mega-donors and business political action groups are launching a full court press to push back on the Trump tariffs. The Koch political network announced this month it will begin a “multiyear, multimillion dollar” campaign to tout the benefits of free trade and the dangers of tariffs.

A new group called Republicans Fighting Tariffs is taking the lead.

“Republicans Fighting Tariffs was formed to remind everyone why the Republican Party is the party of free trade,” said senior policy advisor Scott Lincicome in a press release. “Implementing unwarranted tariffs is a direct threat to our growing economy and presence on the world stage.”

In fact, polls show most Americans and Republicans disagree with Trump on trade.

A Pew poll published last month found that 56 percent of Americans believe that free trade agreements have been a good thing for the United States.

Those results track with those of a Quinnipiac poll from earlier this month which found 50 percent oppose the steel and aluminum tariffs.

I covered the Ronald Reagan White House as a reporter for the Washington Post. Reagan remains the patron saint of economic conservativism, a cornerstone of which is free trade.

“A creative, competitive America is the answer to a changing world, not trade wars that would close doors, create greater barriers, and destroy millions of jobs,” Reagan said in his final State of the Union address back in 1988. “We should always remember: Protectionism is destructionism. America's jobs, America's growth, America's future depend on trade…that is free, open, and fair.”

And yet the GOP is prepared to jettison the Reagan legacy to embrace the cult of Trump. History will soon record this as a Faustian bargain for the GOP.

A bad trade.

Or as Trump might say: Sad.

15160,Williams,Juan,thehill,"Time to weep. Time to scream. Time to register to vote.

Under a barbaric policy, hundreds of immigrant children are being taken away from their parents — some of whom are seeking legal asylum — as part of the Trump administration’s efforts to deter families from trying to get into the U.S.

Last week, a friend told me she was on a flight when an Immigration and Customs Enforcement official got on board with crying children being transported to a detention center far from their parents.

This businesswoman began to cry, too, out of shame at seeing children forced to suffer severe psychological trauma.

And for what?

Are Americans really allowing President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE to use children as pawns in his ongoing attacks on illegal immigrants and his demand that Congress pay for a wall?

At best, the mythic Trump wall is a political symbol. It will not stop illegal immigration or crime, as the facts show most undocumented immigrants overstay visas and most drugs come through legal ports of entry.

The administration may claim its policy of separating families at the border is aimed at discouraging illegal immigration, but the number of border crossings has risen since the policy was implemented.

Also, the New York Times reported last week that many of the families being detained “enter at official border crossings and request asylum, which is not an illegal entry.”

When a member of Congress tried to exercise some oversight, he ran into a stone wall. Sen. Jeff Merkley Jeff MerkleyA proposal to tackle congressional inside trading: Invest in the US Democratic senators call on Biden to support waiving vaccine patents Lobbying world MORE (D-Ore.) posted a video of himself being turned away when he attempted to enter a Texas detention center.

“You’re seeking asylum, and the first thing that happens when you get here is you’re torn away from your parents?” Merkley said in the video. “America has never done this before… The intention is to hurt the children, cause the children trauma and discourage people from seeking asylum in the United States of America.”

Congress’s only role, according to Trump, is to take blame for failing to pass immigration reform. Specifically, the president wants to blame Congressional Democrats — like Merkley.

“Put pressure on the Democrats to end the horrible law that separates children from [their] parents once they cross the Border into the U.S. … DEMOCRATS ARE PROTECTING MS-13 THUGS,” Trump tweeted late last month.

Now all immigrant children are gang members?

Merkley shot back on Twitter:

“Mr. President, the only ‘horrible law’ is YOUR policy. YOU have the power to change it. If you saw what I saw today, you would,” Merkley said.

As the Associated Press reported last week, “No law mandates that parents must be separated from their children at the border, and it’s not a policy Democrats have pushed or can change alone as the minority in Congress.”

Trump is right about one thing: Congress has repeatedly failed to pass immigration reform. But the failure is the result of Congressional Republicans and their allies on right-wing talk shows, who have trashed every proposal as “amnesty” for law-breakers.

Until last week, Speaker Paul Ryan Paul Davis RyanOn The Money: Senate confirms Gensler to lead SEC | Senate GOP to face off over earmarks next week | Top Republican on House tax panel to retire Trump faces test of power with early endorsements Lobbying world MORE (R-Wis.) even sought to appease the far-right Freedom Caucus by refusing to have a vote on an immigration bill.

Now, Ryan says the House will vote on legislation to end deportation of “Dreamers,” people who were brought to the country illegally as children by their parents.

Ryan’s hand was forced by more than 20 moderate House Republicans who threatened to side with the entire House Democratic caucus in signing a discharge petition that would compel the Speaker to bring a bill to the floor for a vote.

Note that the Speaker has no actual legislation in hand. And even if a compromise bill is eventually put on the table, it is unclear whether a majority of the House GOP will support it.

The hard right killed a bipartisan 2013 Senate immigration reform bill and has rejected proposals coming from the Trump White House. And in 2006, those same forces derailed Republican President George W. Bush’s attempts at immigration reform.

In fact, Republican strategists are saying that with the midterm elections approaching, the GOP is counting on whipping up anti-immigrant, anti-free trade fervor to get out its base voters.

That kind of harsh rhetoric worked to elect Trump.

But a new political dynamic surrounds the immigration debate.

Job growth has created a shortage of American workers. And the Koch brothers’ political network recently announced it will put money into political advertising to pressure GOP members of Congress to pass a fix for Dreamers.

Let’s assume the big GOP donors scare enough Congressional Republicans to finally prompt action on full immigration reform. That still leaves the question of whether or not Trump will sign any bill.

He risks a potential backlash after all the anti-immigrant red meat he has fed his supporters.

Recall, Trump lambasted former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush during the 2016 GOP primaries for saying that many illegal immigrants come to the US as an “act of love” for their struggling families, especially the children.

Right now, passing any bill to end the brutality against immigrant children at U.S. detention centers would be an act of love by the GOP-controlled Congress.

Let’s hope love trumps anti-immigrant hate.

15932,Williams,Juan,thehill,"""If you look at the policies of Donald Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE, anybody — Martin Luther King — would be proud of him,” former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon Stephen (Steve) Kevin BannonThere was Trump-Russia collusion — and Trump pardoned the colluder MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell's new free speech site to ban certain curse words Trump denies Gaetz asked him for blanket pardon MORE told the BBC’s “Newsnight” recently. “You don't think Martin Luther King would sit there and go: ‘Yes, you're putting young black men and women to work?’""

No, Steve, Dr. King would not be proud of Trump for shamelessly taking credit for the economic policies of his predecessor, the first black President of the United States.

As FactCheck.org reported in January, black unemployment reached nearly 17 percent in 2010, in the wake of the financial crisis that began in 2008. It then dropped under Obama to 7.8 percent — “the lowest it had been in nearly 10 years” — before Trump took office and the rate dropped another point.

And Steve, black unemployment remains close to twice as high as white unemployment.

These facts fit with the damaging reality of the Trump tax cuts. They disproportionately benefit the overwhelmingly white, wealthiest one percent of Americans at the expense of the poorest half of Americans, who are disproportionately brown and black.

Similarly, Trump’s sabotage of the Affordable Care Act will raise premiums on — and strip health insurance coverage from — those same black and brown people along with working-class whites.

Invoking Dr. King to excuse away the naked racism of this president plays to ignorance of the fight for racial equality in America.

But Bannon is the man who said at a conference of the racist National Front party in France earlier this year, ""Let them call you racist... Let them call you xenophobes. Wear it as a badge of honor. Because every day, we get stronger and they get weaker.”

I have been thinking a lot about Trump and racism over the last few weeks as I put the final touches on my new book, “What the Hell Do You Have to Lose? — Trump’s War on Civil Rights,” which will be published in September.

Since Trump emerged as a national political figure hawking racist conspiracy theories about Obama’s birth certificate, people have asked me — as the author of a bestseller on the civil rights movement, “Eyes on the Prize,” — whether I think Trump is a racist.

The answer is “Yes.” But it’s not up to me. The facts are evident to all.

The federal government sued Trump family’s real estate business for racism and Trump had to settle. Years later, Speaker Paul Ryan Paul Davis RyanOn The Money: Senate confirms Gensler to lead SEC | Senate GOP to face off over earmarks next week | Top Republican on House tax panel to retire Trump faces test of power with early endorsements Lobbying world MORE (R-Wis.) said Trump’s claim that a federal judge with Mexican heritage could not be fair fit the textbook definition of racism.

And as president, Trump has stirred racism, as evidenced by the spike in racial and anti-Semitic hate crimes.

The hateful behavior includes his shamefully equivocal response to the neo-Nazi march in Charlottesville, Va., last summer, after which a woman was killed. It also includes his decision to focus not on last week’s racist tweet from Roseanne Barr but on ABC’s failure to apologize for unspecified comments that he contends were unfair to him.

As New York Times columnist Charles Blow put it: “It is not a stretch to understand that Donald Trump’s words and deeds over the course of his life have demonstrated a pattern of expressing racial prejudices that demean people who are black and brown and that play to the racial hostilities of other white people.”

Trump’s racist behavior has continued in the past few weeks.

""You have to stand proudly for the national anthem or you shouldn't be playing... Maybe you shouldn't be in the country,"" Trump recently said about black NFL players kneeling during the national anthem to protest police brutality.

Sadly, the NFL buckled to Trump and set a new policy last month requiring players on the field to stand during the anthem.

It is remarkable how the acid of Trump’s racism has even corroded the NFL — one of America’s most racially inclusive institutions — to the point it feels free to tell black men to shut up about racial injustice.

“They [black players] were not disrespecting the flag or the military,” Steve Kerr, the NBA coach said of the NFL’s new rule, “but our president decided to make it about that.”

Trump’s NFL rant came shortly after he described some illegal immigrants as “animals.” Trump and his allies tried to walk back his comments, saying he was talking about MS-13 gang members. Even if critics are generous to the president, his words called to mind his smearing Mexican immigrants as rapists and drug mules when he began his run for president.

As if all that wasn’t clearly racist, the Washington Post reported last week that Trump once laughed it up in the Oval Office with Jared Kushner Jared Corey KushnerTrump alumni launch America First Policy Institute Fauci fatigue sets in as top doc sows doubt in vaccine effectiveness The Memo: Biden's five biggest foreign policy challenges MORE and Stephen Miller as he made up fictitious Hispanic names and crimes while editing an immigration speech.

If you want more proof of how Trump’s racism is tearing apart the fragile fabric of racial comity woven by Dr. King and civil rights activists over the last five decades, just note that racist Louis Farrakhan recently praised Trump for “destroying every enemy that was an enemy of our rise.”

Case closed.

16570,Williams,Juan,thehill,"With less than six months to go to the midterm elections, Republicans think they have Democrats in an impeachment trap.

Seventy percent of Democrats in recent polling from Quinnipiac University say they will vote for a midterm candidate who plans to impeach President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE.

But 84 percent of Republicans say they’re ready to oppose any candidate planning on impeachment.

And overall, the Quinnipiac polling shows 55 percent of voters don’t want Democrats to begin impeachment proceedings.

An April NPR/PBS/Marist survey found 47 percent voters would ""definitely"" vote against a candidate who campaigned on impeaching Trump while 42 percent said they would “definitely” vote for the candidate who ran on impeachment.

So, with the president’s consistently low approval ratings and a record number of retirements, desperate Republicans have fixated on the threat of impeachment to fire up GOP voters.

But House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiWhite House readies for Chauvin verdict House GOP's McClain responds to Pelosi calling her 'that woman' GOP struggles to rein in nativism MORE (D-Calif.) is making clear she is not getting on the impeachment bandwagon. Even as she has referred to the president as a “jerk,” she has also said talk of impeachment is a “distraction” and a “gift” to Republicans.

She recently told the Dallas Morning News that impeachment doesn’t appeal to swing voters — read that as moderate, white suburbanites — ready to vote against Republican House candidates to show their disappointment with Trump.

“What people want to know,” Pelosi said, “is what are you doing to help me in my life? How [am I] going to educate my kids or pay the rent or mortgage, medical bills…They think [impeachment] is an excuse not to have solutions.”

Still, GOP ad-makers will use impeachment as a boogeyman to frighten their voters to the polls.

Now the tough question for Democrats is, why should they give up talking about impeachment when it might help rouse their voter turnout?

The party’s base of educated white women, young people, blacks, Hispanics and gays are notorious for not showing up at the polls in midterms. But their fury with Trump is real; hearing House Democrats pledge to stop Trump is a sure bet to energize the anti-Trump resistance.

This spring’s Democratic primaries have made it clear that populist, anti-Trump candidates are the choice for Democratic voters. Centrist candidates in the Democratic primaries — even with backing from the Democratic National Committee — are losing to unapologetic, anti-Trump liberals.

Rep. Al Green Alexander (Al) N. GreenBipartisan lawmakers call for action on anti-hate crime measures House Democrat sits on Capitol steps to protest extremist threat Biden pledges support for Texas amid recovery from winter storm MORE (D-Texas) speaks with passion about the need for impeachment.

Calling Trump a “jerk,” as Pelosi did, only “trivializes the impact of his bigoted policies on Jews, Latinos, African Americans, women and the LGBT community,” Green said in a statement earlier this month. In fact, he thinks Trump represents “the quintessential” president that “impeachment was designed for.”

The same powerful message is coming from Rep. Maxine Waters Maxine Moore WatersWhite House readies for Chauvin verdict McCarthy to introduce resolution to censure Waters House GOP's McClain responds to Pelosi calling her 'that woman' MORE (D-Calif.), another black Democrat.

Last month, after Trump pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal, she tweeted: ""How long do we have to suffer his gigantic ego and narcissistic behavior? Impeachment is the only answer.""

The impeachment camp also has a strong supporter in billionaire Tom Steyer, who is buying abundant television advertising intended to advance that cause. He is also holding a series of rallies calling for impeachment.

“Are we actually going to do what the writers of the Constitution, the founders of our country gave us to do if we have a reckless and lawless president? Or are we going to try and slip it under the rug and pretend it's not happening?” Steyer told ABC News this month.

But note that last year, the House voted to kill an impeachment resolution by a vote of 364-58. The vote tally showed that 126 Democrats joined all House Republicans in voting it down.

And Democrats, including Pelosi, can read the polls.

A recent Reuters/Ipsos poll showed Congressional Republicans leading for the first time this cycle on the important generic ballot question.

According to Reuters, 38 percent of voters said they would vote for a Republican if midterms were held today, compared to 37 percent who said they would vote for a Democrat. The result shows the Democrats’ polling lead on generic preference for Congressional candidates is all but gone.

But the game is far from over. As November gets closer, the Democrats’ base is primed to extend their current enthusiasm advantage over GOP voters. In special elections, the Senate race in Alabama and several gubernatorial races, the Democrats have turned out and produced wins.

And don’t forget, even Trump’s base voters are disappointed by his failure to build the border wall, repeal ObamaCare, drain the swamp and bring back the jobs lost to international trade.

Republicans are also disappointed that Trump’s tax cuts for the rich have increased the deficit.

Republican strategists don’t want to talk about those problems; they prefer to rally the base with talk about impeachment.

Last week, Trump tried to lower expectations by saying with a smile he is “not sure I really believe,” that the midterms will be as important as his 2016 win.

Unless Trump fires the special prosecutor, talk of impeachment remains a sideshow. It is not going to decide the outcome in November.

Trump is too big. The election will be a referendum on him.

17313,Williams,Juan,thehill,"“Ideas that were fringe are now in the mainstream of the Democratic Party,” Jeff Weaver, who managed Sen. Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersOvernight Energy: Treasury creates hub to fight climate change through finance | Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez introduce 'Green New Deal for Public Housing' | Don't attack Zoom for its Bernie Sanders federal tax bill Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez introduce 'Green New Deal for Public Housing' MORE’s (I-Vt.) 2016 presidential campaign, told The Washington Post last week.

It’s true.

Check out the once-edgy ideas now being embraced by Democrats:

— Calling for the legalization of marijuana and universal healthcare made John Fetterman an upset winner last week in Pennsylvania’s race for the Democratic nomination for Lieutenant Governor.

— Medicare for everyone — universal healthcare — was also a winner for Kara Eastman, a social worker who last week won the Democratic nomination for a House seat in Nebraska. She also wants universal background checks for people buying guns, an idea Democrats typically keep at a distance for fear of antagonizing gun owners.

“I’m tired of hearing Democrats don’t have a backbone…don’t stand for anything,” Eastman said in one political advertisement. “That changes now.”

Yes, and it is changing because of the anti-Trump fury fueling Democrats going into the 2018 midterm elections.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth WarrenWorld passes 3 million coronavirus deaths Poll: 56 percent say wealth tax is part of solution to inequality Democratic senators call on Biden to support waiving vaccine patents MORE (D-Mass.) said last week the upcoming midterms would be one “massive uphill climb” for Democrats and added the key to victory would be unapologetically standing up for liberal ideas.

“We can’t climb that hill by ignoring the millions of Americans who are angry and scared about the damage this president and this Republican Party have done to our democracy,” Warren said.

In that spirit, Warren endorsed Richard Cordray Richard Adams CordrayWill the Biden CFPB clamp down on innovation and regulatory sandboxes? Biden picks for financial agencies offer preview of regulatory agenda Biden's Wall Street watchdog picks to offer clues on regulations MORE, who last week won the Democratic nomination for Ohio Governor.

She told voters that Cordray, a low-key candidate who once headed Warren’s brainchild, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), is a quiet warrior for the working man, standing against Wall Street bankers and the greedy rich.

“They’ve got the money…but there’s a whole lot more of us than there is of them,” Warren said at a Cordray campaign event.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiWhite House readies for Chauvin verdict House GOP's McClain responds to Pelosi calling her 'that woman' GOP struggles to rein in nativism MORE (D-Calif.) is also flying without fear. An emboldened Pelosi is saying that if Democrats take back the House, she wants revisions to President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE’s new tax law.

“Wouldn’t it have been better if we had spent over a trillion dollars on infrastructure” and not “tax breaks for the wealthy,” she recently said.

And there are more “fringe” ideas exciting Democrats.

— Free community college tuition, an idea Sanders pushed in the 2016 campaign, is gaining ground. With Democrats rallying support, 17 states have recently adopted some form of free higher education and Democrats are talking it up nationally.

— Sanders is now also pushing for a federal government guarantee of a $15 an hour job for all citizens who want one. The idea builds on the push for raising the minimum wage that is now widely backed by Democrats.

Populist Democrats are no longer afraid to call themselves liberals.

According to a March Pew Research Center poll, 46 percent of Democrats now identify themselves as “liberal.” In 1998, that number was just 28 percent.

The surge in Democrats’ passion for liberalism comes as 56 percent of women now say they are Democrats or lean Democrat. That is the highest percentage since 1992. Also according to Pew, a whopping 70 percent of women millennials (women between 22 and 37 years old) now identify as Democrats.

The latest high-profile evidence of the party’s pride in liberalism can be found in the Democratic primary for Governor of New York.

Actress Cynthia Nixon, best known for playing Miranda on HBO’s “Sex and the City,” is making the case that Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D), has set back progressive causes by working too closely with Republicans and conservative Democrats in the state legislature.

""We're a blue state, we're a proudly Democratic state, but we have a governor in there who governs like a Republican,"" Nixon told Stephen Colbert last month. ""He says he wants to work with the Republicans, but often times it looks more like he works for the Republicans... He's pleasing his big-money donors.""

Nixon calls Trump’s election “a real wake-up call,"" motivating her to run.

""If we don’t like the direction our government is going in, we have to step up and we have to get involved like never before, so that's what I'm doing,” Nixon said.

A Quinnipiac University poll from last week showed Nixon has her work cut out for her. She trails Cuomo 28 percent to 50 percent.

So here we have a long-shot candidate with no political experience whom most voters know as a celebrity TV star trailing in the polls but saying controversial things that excite the base of the party.

Does this plot sound familiar to anyone?

Trump has revamped the GOP. It was once the party of free trade, low deficits and support for immigration.

Now it is clear Trump has also changed the Democrats. He has made them so mad they’re finally speaking up.

17978,Williams,Juan,thehill,"Martin Luther King Jr. once said there is nothing in the world more dangerous than sincere ignorance.

Well, sincere ignorance had a banner day last week when President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE unilaterally withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal.

A CNN/ORC poll taken shortly before Trump’s decision found that a majority of Americans — 63 percent — wanted the U.S. to stay in the deal. But get this: 62 percent of Americans believed Iran had violated its terms.

ADVERTISEMENT

To me, the second result is the more alarming.

That poll is proof of sincere ignorance of the deal on the part of nearly two-thirds of Americans. They are under the spell of Trump’s distortions.

The president’s partisan attacks on the Democrats who negotiated the deal — President Obama and former Secretary of State John Kerry John KerryOvernight Energy: Treasury creates hub to fight climate change through finance | Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez introduce 'Green New Deal for Public Housing' | Blinken says US falling behind China as global leader on climate change The shipping industry needs to move in line with the Paris Agreement MORE — have left people with the sense that this is nothing more than one more political fight among many.

Trump has turned national security into just another political act in the Trump reality show.

No matter how provably false Trump’s claims about the Iran deal, he has succeeded in producing a fog of public confusion and uncertainty about the truth — more of that sincere ignorance.

For the record, Iran never violated the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). And there is no evidence the deal is “defective at its core,” as Trump likes to say.

Trump’s own State Department has repeatedly certified — as recently as last month — that Iran was living up to its end of the deal. In April, Defense Secretary James Mattis James Norman MattisBiden's is not a leaky ship of state — not yet Rejoining the Iran nuclear deal would save lives of US troops, diplomats The soft but unmatched power of US foreign exchange programs MORE described the pact’s verification provisions as “pretty robust.”

And the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has issued quarterly reports certifying that Iran is in compliance.

But the truth has not stopped Trump.

He keeps calling the deal “disastrous” and “a great embarrassment,” and telling Americans that it allowed Iran to eventually “reach the brink of a nuclear breakout.”

The Washington Post’s Fact Checker gave Trump a four Pinocchio rating — a “whopper” of a lie — for the claim that the deal frees Iran in seven years to “create nuclear weapons.”

But just as the facts are not in question, neither is the power of Trump’s false sales pitch. It is the only way to explain why 62 percent of Americans believe Iran violated the deal.

Trump’s success in twisting public thinking with brassy indifference to the truth on Iran and nuclear weapons fits with the distortions he used last year when he pulled the U.S. out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Paris climate accords.

For TPP, the lie was that the deal was harmful to American workers. In reality, American businesses and American workers lost out on opportunities in emerging Asian countries.

For the climate deal, the lie was that it would cost American jobs and raise American energy prices. In reality, the U.S. lost out yet again on the burgeoning green energy sector and all the jobs and clean, cheap energy it would have created.

But while TPP and Paris were missed economic opportunities, the decision to end the Iran deal endangers the national security of the United States and opens a box of evil spirits in the Middle East. Already, Israel and Iran are trading fire in Syria, opening the way for a new round of potentially deadlier warfare.

Here is a Democrat, Sen. Bob Menendez Robert (Bob) MenendezBiden rebuffs Democrats, keeps refugee admissions at 15,000 Bottom line The Memo: Biden's five biggest foreign policy challenges MORE (D-N.J.), a longstanding opponent of the original deal, pointing out that with the U.S. out of the deal, Iran is closer to having nuclear weapons:

""With this decision President Trump is risking U.S. national security, recklessly upending foundational partnerships with key U.S. allies in Europe and gambling with Israel’s security. Today’s withdrawal from the [Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action] makes it more likely Iran will restart its nuclear weapons program in the future.""

When he was running for president, Trump made a similar point.

Trump told NBC News in August 2015 that if he were president, he “would police that contract so tough that [Iran would not] have a chance [to cheat.] As bad as the contract is, I will be so tough on that contract.”

Now there is no deal to enforce and no chance to be “tough.” And it isolates the U.S. from its global partners.

French President Emmanuel Macron, probably the European leader closest to Trump, also called the decision a “mistake.”

And Arizona Republican Sen. Jeff Flake Jeffrey (Jeff) Lane FlakeFive reasons why US faces chronic crisis at border Senate GOP faces retirement brain drain Former GOP lawmaker: Republican Party 'engulfed in lies and fear' MORE pointed out the obvious when he said withdrawing from the Iran deal now makes no sense because “Iran has already realized the benefits of sanctions relief and the release of frozen assets.” Flake added that since Iran is free of international oversight, Tehran is “off the hook when it comes to honoring their nuclear obligations under the agreement.""

Flake is right. Even so, there are Middle Eastern leaders who want war. The New York Times Editorial Board declared last week that war in the Middle East does not matter to “anti-Iran hard-liners in [the Trump] administration, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Saudi Arabia, who all seem to believe their problems with Iran can best be solved by driving out the regime through economic crisis or military action.”

A cynic might look at this and conclude that those same hardliners pushed Trump to end the deal without cause in order to move the US closer towards a military confrontation with Iran.

National Security Advisor John Bolton, we’re looking at you.

Now, he is thrilling white nationalists and some Trump supporters by calling for black people to agree that 400 years of slavery “sounds like a choice” made by black people.

West is also being celebrated by Trump supporters as a free thinker for embracing the president as “my boy,” a break with 90 percent of black voters.

“The amount of Republicans with a favorable view of rapper Kanye West increased by 23 percentage points from 2015 to late April 2018, according to a poll from HuffPost and YouGov,” The Hill reported last week.

Meanwhile, Rubio’s once-shining image among Republicans has turned ugly.

Rubio’s sin, in the eyes of the Trump crowd, is saying out loud that the president’s tax cut plan has made corporations and one-percenters even richer, but has done little for American workers.

""There is still a lot of thinking on the right that if big corporations are happy, they're going to take the money they're saving and reinvest it in American workers,"" Rubio said last week. ""In fact…there's no evidence whatsoever that the money's been massively poured back into the American worker.""

A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll in April found a plurality of Americans agree with Rubio.

Thirty-six percent call the Trump tax cuts a “bad idea.” And 53 percent say much higher deficits caused by the tax cuts — as well as rising income inequality resulting from the windfall for rich people and big corporations — will have a negative impact on the American economy.

Even among Republicans, the Journal reported, only 56 percent think passing the tax cut “was a good idea.”

GOP campaign advertising focusing on the tax cut failed to help the Republican candidate in the recent special election in a Pennsylvania congressional district. The Democrat won the race despite Trump having held a 20-point edge there in 2016.

Rubio, in response to blowback from Trump Republicans, is now shrinking from his earlier critique. His new position is that the tax bill could have been “better for American workers.”

The distorted reflections of Rubio and Kanye among Trump supporters are both tied to economics.

The president told “Fox & Friends” last week that West is a supporter because black unemployment has gone down under his administration.

“Kanye looks and he sees black unemployment at the lowest it’s been in the history of our country,” Trump said. “He sees Hispanic unemployment at the lowest it’s been in the history of our country.”

West, however, never cited economic numbers to justify his support for Trump.

That is because the economic trends that led to the current low unemployment rates started under President Obama.

After peaking at 16.8 percent in 2010, the rate of black unemployment declined by 9 percentage points to 7.8 percent at the start of the Trump Administration.

Under Trump, it has declined close to another percentage point, to 6.9 percent.

“Record low unemployment rates among black Americans are a function of a steady, long-term drop that precedes Trump’s time in office,” wrote Philip Bump in The Washington Post recently.

Bump also noted that Trump’s approval among black voters is down from 15 percent when he took office to 9 percent, while Hispanic support is down from 24 percent to 20 percent.

“There’s no correlation, in other words, between increases in the number of people employed and their views of Trump,” Bump concludes.

In fact, Rubio’s initial assessment of the tax cuts’ failure to help workers gain higher wages is linked to Trump’s low standing with minorities.

The vast majority of the tax bill’s benefits went to the wealthiest Americans, who are disproportionately white. Hardly any of the benefits went to the poorest Americans, who are disproportionately brown and black. It is therefore clear that the policy is not designed to help the economic outlook for most minorities.

In addition, the tax revenue that will now be lost could have been spent on programs designed to keep people out of poverty or to better pay teachers.

But Kanye West is a rapper. He is not an economist. And he is certainly no historian if he thinks blacks made the choice to be slaves.

For years, I have been critical of liberals who demean conservative black intellectuals as sellouts or Uncle Toms. Frankly, it is hypocritical of liberals in the media and academia to dismiss brilliant black conservatives with different views — people like Justice Clarence Thomas, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and Sen. Tim Scott Timothy (Tim) Eugene ScottBass 'hopeful' on passing police reform: 'Republicans that I am working with are operating in good faith' The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Tax March - CDC in limbo on J&J vax verdict; Rep. Brady retiring Tim Scott to participate in GOP event in Iowa MORE (R-S.C.).

But a very important distinction needs to made between those serious, principled conservative thought-leaders and the growing class of black, pro-Trump provocateurs looking to cash in, such as Kanye and video bloggers Diamond and Silk.

How long will it take before the pro-Trump black provocateurs realize that funhouse mirrors can’t hide them from the scorn of people who judge their true reflection?

They are useful idiots for Trump and the corporate interests who throw up media distractions while they take the money and run.

19386,Williams,Juan,thehill,"Rep. James Clyburn, the Assistant Democratic Leader in the House, is pulling the fire alarm far ahead of the 2018 midterms.

“If we’re still in the minority [after the midterms], all of us have got to go,” the South Carolina congressman told reporters last week.

He’s right.

If the current Democratic leadership — in the House, the Senate and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) — can’t figure out how to motivate voters and raise the money to win the November 6 midterm elections, they all should quit.

The problem? Even with President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE’s currently low 41 percent approval rating in the Real Clear Politics polling average, Democrats continue to lag behind the GOP in fundraising.

As of this month, the Republican National Committee (RNC) has $157 million to work with while the DNC only has $79 million.

The money contest is closer between the National Republican Congressional Committee ($58.8 Million cash on hand) and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ($57 million).

But that’s before big outside donors like the Koch brothers begin to pump money into GOP campaigns.

Despite money troubles, Democrats have been doing well in special elections. There is also an unusually high number of Republicans retiring from Congress, surely out of fear of a coming Democratic wave.

Last week, The New York Times’ Nate Cohn reported that, based on results from elections going back 30 years, the president’s current approval rating fits with “an eight-point victory for the party out of power in the national House popular vote.” That would give Democrats the House majority.

But behind those positive signs, there are recurring signals flashing the message that the Democrats’ high hopes could be a mirage.

One brewing batch of trouble for the Democrats bubbled up in a Fox News poll.

“By a nine-point margin,” Fox News’ polling director, Dana Blanton, wrote last week, “more say the disruption Trump has brought to Washington is a bad thing [46 percent] rather than a good thing [37 percent]. That spread was 14 points last summer [51 bad vs. 37 good]. The shift comes mostly from a drop in the number of Democrats calling the disruption a bad thing — from 85 percent last July to 75 percent today.”

In other words, the fire and fury among Democrats upset over Trump’s 2016 victory remains a fact, but it is not building up. At the moment, it is coming down.

Additionally, polls targeting voter preference for Democrats or Republicans to control Congress are surprisingly close given the constant stream of chaos, name-calling, scandals and staff turnover in the Trump White House.

Last week, Reuters had the Democrats up 11 points in the generic poll on party preference while Quinnipiac University gave the Democrats an 8-point edge. An ABC News/Washington Post poll had them up only 4 percentage points. Not long ago, most polls had Democrats up by double-digits.

Part of the problem facing Democrats is low voter turnout in midterm elections. This is a big threat to Democrats because much of their base — particularly young people, racial minorities and highly educated voters — has a history of not getting out to vote in midterms.

In the last midterm election, 2014, only 36 percent of eligible voters cast a ballot.

Similarly, a USA Today/Suffolk University poll of “infrequent or unregistered voters” found that while 55 percent have an unfavorable opinion of Trump, an incredible 83 percent said they were either “not very likely” or “not at all likely” to go to the polls and vote in the 2018 midterms.

“It’s a chilling story to tell,” David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk University Polling Research Center, told USA Today. “These people don’t vote. They could hate Trump, but they could still not vote because they hate political parties, they hate Democrats, they hate the bureaucracy, they hate the infighting, the negativity, all of that.”

These polls are why Clyburn is calling an end to any show of complacency among Democrats about the upcoming midterms.

“Yes, polling data shows a coming ‘blue wave,’ but we’ve gotten overconfident about polling numbers before,” wrote former Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' Cuba readies for life without Castro Chelsea Clinton: Pics of Trump getting vaccinated would help him 'claim credit' MORE aide Annafi Wahed in the Wall Street Journal last week.

Questions of over-confidence also come to mind with news that the DNC has launched a massive lawsuit against the Trump 2016 campaign, Wikileaks and the Russian government, alleging that fraud cost Democrats the last presidential election.

It is important to prevent a repeat of election interference by the Russians. But the lawsuit raises the question of whether the party should be putting time and money into relitigating the last election just months before the midterms.

In the weeks before the 2016 election, liberal filmmaker and Michigander Michael Moore warned Democrats against “doing an end zone dance when they were only on the 50-yard line” because “everybody needs to have their game face on and realize that Trump can win, he can pull this off.”

In 2016 Trump pulled off the upset.

The question now is whether Democrats have learned their lesson.

If the Democrats lose this time, their roaring river of regret will be background noise as Trump sails happily into 2020 and beyond.

Here is Tillis, who votes with Trump 96 percent of the time, sending the message to his fellow Trump backers:

“The same people who would criticize me for filing this bill would be absolutely angry if I wasn’t pounding the table for this bill if we were dealing with Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' Cuba readies for life without Castro Chelsea Clinton: Pics of Trump getting vaccinated would help him 'claim credit' MORE,” he said last week. “So, spare me your righteous indignation.”

Well, that’s a first — one of the president’s strongest supporters telling other Trump supporters they are wrong to blindly back Trump.

The key here is that Tillis isn’t up for reelection until 2020.

I suspect that Tillis is getting a jump on distancing himself from the president in 2020. That is when Tillis’s name will appear below Trump’s name on the ballot (or if Trump is gone, below the name of Trump’s tainted-by-proximity vice president, Mike Pence Michael (Mike) Richard PenceSicknick had two strokes, died of natural causes after Capitol riot The Hill's 12:30 Report - Presented by Facebook - All US adults now eligible for COVID vaccines The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Facebook - All US adults can get vaccine; decision Friday on J&J vax MORE).

With less than seven months until the midterm elections, the most politically savvy Republicans are drawing the obvious conclusion from current polls: If the election were held today, they would lose the House and possibly the Senate because of Trump.

The latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll last week found Trump underwater, with a 39 percent approval and 57 percent disapproval rating. Trump’s approval rating is down 4 points since last month.

A Quinnipiac poll — taken before the raid on Trump attorney Michael Cohen’s office this month — found that 69 percent of Americans oppose Trump firing Mueller. Just 13 percent think Trump should fire him.

Even with those strong poll numbers backing Mueller, the top Republicans in the Senate and House remain protective of Trump.

They are politically paralyzed, displaying a ‘deer-in-the-headlights’ inability to stand up to Trump for fear of angering the president’s small but fevered base of supporters. Trump calls the probe a “hoax.”

Speaker Paul Ryan Paul Davis RyanOn The Money: Senate confirms Gensler to lead SEC | Senate GOP to face off over earmarks next week | Top Republican on House tax panel to retire Trump faces test of power with early endorsements Lobbying world MORE (R-Wis.) has said he does not think legislation to protect Mueller is necessary because he does not believe Trump will fire the special counsel.

McConnell is taking the same stand in opposition to a bill that would give Mueller a 10-day period for speedy judicial review of any dismissal.

“I don’t think [Trump] should [fire Mueller] and I don’t think he will,” McConnell told my Fox News colleague Neil Cavuto.

But McConnell remains opposed to even bringing any legislation to insulate Mueller to the Senate floor for a vote.

That imperious position is responsible for the first cracks in the GOP congressional stonewall defense of Trump.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley Chuck GrassleySenate aims to pass anti-Asian hate crimes bill this week 'Real Housewives of the GOP' — Wannabe reality show narcissists commandeer the party This week: Democrats move on DC statehood MORE (R-Iowa), a strong Trump supporter until now, is splitting from McConnell by scheduling a vote on the measure later this week in the committee.

“Obviously, the majority leader's views are important to consider, but they do not govern what happens here in the Judiciary Committee,” Grassley told reporters.

Two Republicans on Grassley’s Committee are spearheading the bipartisan legislative push to protect Mueller.

In addition to Tillis, South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham Lindsey Olin Graham'Real Housewives of the GOP' — Wannabe reality show narcissists commandeer the party Graham: 'I could not disagree more' with Trump support of troop withdrawal Wall Street spent .9B on campaigns, lobbying in 2020 election: study MORE, is also a sponsor of the measure. He is on record as saying that if Trump fires Mueller, it will “be the beginning of the end of his presidency.""

There is also the argument that Trump will veto any law protecting Mueller, so why bother? But Sen. Jeff Flake Jeffrey (Jeff) Lane FlakeFive reasons why US faces chronic crisis at border Senate GOP faces retirement brain drain Former GOP lawmaker: Republican Party 'engulfed in lies and fear' MORE (R-Ariz.) has countered that, even if Trump vetoes the bill, the purpose of putting it on his desk is “to send a message to the president…the message needs to be that we take this very seriously.”

Also, McConnell and Ryan don’t have an answer to the obvious flaw in their logic.

If there is no danger of Trump firing Mueller, then what is the harm in passing legislation to protect him?

If McConnell and Ryan are right that Trump won’t fire Mueller, they have nothing to lose and everything to gain by protecting fellow Republicans and shutting down critical Democrats.

The reality is that if Trump fires Mueller, the midterms could be even worse than the most pessimistic prognosticators imagine.

The harsh reality of extensive political turmoil leading to riots if Mueller is fired is already of concern to police.

The Pittsburgh police chief told his officers to be prepared for just that scenario in a department-wide memo last week.

How far we have come since the Republican National Convention that nominated Trump in 2016 adopted a party platform that read “the next president must restore the public’s trust in law enforcement and civil order by first adhering to the rule of law himself.”

20789,Williams,Juan,thehill,"Is it just me or does it smell like the swamp around President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE is overflowing?

Last week we learned that the president’s lawyer arranged a million dollar pay-off to a Playboy model from one of the president’s top donors. The donor had impregnated the model in an adulterous affair. The woman had an abortion.

What are those evangelical Christians supporters who close their eyes to the president’s alleged affair with a porn actress to say about this one?

Last week, Trump told those irritating reporters to ignore reality because “it may not look like it, but believe me we are draining the swamp.""

That’s funny. Last week, the FBI raided the home, office and hotel room of Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, after a federal judge, the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan and the Justice Department agreed there was sufficient indication of criminal activity to grant a warrant.

That added to the stench from the rising swamp of sex scandals, hush money and lies around the president.

So too did the president’s pardon for Scooter Libby, the former chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney.

After Libby was found guilty of lying and obstruction of justice, then-President George W. Bush, with the case fresh before him, refused to pardon Libby — despite persistent pressure from Cheney.

The facts of the Libby case have not changed. But Trump has his own trouble with a special prosecutor. Now is a good time for him to make the point that he has the power to take care of his friends in the spreading swamp.

It is an important message from this president to anyone talking to the current special counsel looking into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia.

That message fits with his pardon of former Sheriff Joe Arpaio, a big Trump booster, who was found guilty of defying a federal court order to stop using racial profiling to detain Latinos suspected of being illegal immigrants.

Is it any surprise that former FBI director James Comey James Brien ComeyShowtime developing limited series about Jan. 6 Capitol riot Wray says FBI not systemically racist John Durham's endgame: Don't expect criminal charges MORE says Trump reminds him of a “mob boss?”

Anthony Scaramucci Anthony ScaramucciAnthony Scaramucci joining CNBC as a contributor Biden doubles down on normal at White House Pence, other GOP officials expected to skip Trump send-off MORE, who briefly served as Trump’s communications director, has tried to redefine the meaning of “drain the swamp” by saying last month that the real target may be less a swamp and more like a “gold-plated hot tub,” in which “special interests and lobbyists curry favor with elected officials to maintain the order of what is sometimes called ‘Crony Capitalism.’”

Well, what are we to make of tax cuts that gave the three biggest banks record profits for the first quarter?

They are now able to charge people looking for a loan higher interest rates, while enjoying a sharp drop in corporate tax rates. Meanwhile, the federal deficit is rising to record levels to line the pockets of the banks and corporations.

It does not look like Trump is draining the “gold-plated hot tub.”

According to a Transparency International poll taken in December, 44 percent of Americans said they believe that “most or all of the officials in the Office of the President are corrupt.” Fifty-eight percent said the corruption had risen in the past year since Trump took office.

And day-by-day it has become more obvious that several of Trump’s cabinet secretaries have their hands in the old-fashioned type of swamp.

Let’s look at the record:

*Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price Thomas (Tom) Edmunds PriceA proposal to tackle congressional inside trading: Invest in the US Biden health nominee faces first Senate test Focus on cabinet nominees' effectiveness and expertise, not just ideology MORE resigned in disgrace last year after it was revealed that he bilked the taxpayers out of over $1 million for private charter jets and military air travel.

*Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke Ryan Keith ZinkeGuilfoyle named as national chair of Greitens' Senate campaign in Missouri Greitens Senate bid creates headache for GOP Missouri Senate candidate Eric Greitens tangles with Hugh Hewitt in testy interview MORE could well be in danger of losing his job and being brought up on charges when the Department of Interior Inspector General’s report comes out later this month. He is under review for his lavish taxpayer-funded travel — including for political purposes and a personal vacation.

*Then there is the profligacy and corruption of EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt Edward (Scott) Scott PruittScientific integrity, or more hot air? OVERNIGHT ENERGY: Biden proposes billions for electric vehicles, building retrofitting| EPA chief to replace Trump appointees on science advisory panels | Kerry to travel to UAE, India to discuss climate change EPA chief to replace Trump appointees on science advisory panels MORE. Pruitt received a sweetheart deal on rent for his luxury condominium in Washington. The condo is owned by the wife of a lobbyist whose clients had business before Pruitt’s EPA.

Pruitt paid an astonishing $50 per night to rent the condo, well below market value.

Also, he used taxpayer money to dole out big bonuses to his top aides and to pay for a 19-man security detail. When interviewed by my Fox News colleague Ed Henry, Pruitt said he could not believe he was even being asked about his shady deals.

That is pure Trump style.

The president still refuses to release his tax returns; he still refuses to divest from his sprawling business empire; and don’t forget his hiring of his daughter and son-in-law as senior White House advisers, as if he were running a family business to serve his bottom line instead of the national interest.

The New York Times reported in February that Apollo Global Management and Citigroup made risky loans to the president’s son-in-law’s real estate business after a White House meeting.

It is no secret that Kushner’s family business is up to its eyeballs in debt and the Washington Post reported last month that at least four countries view Kushner as susceptible to influence because of that debt.

“Drain the swamp,” has become as empty a promise as “Build the Wall.”

If you ever believed Trump, you got duped.

21493,Williams,Juan,thehill,"Is President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE more likely to start a war now that John Bolton is his national security advisor?

Bolton strongly supported the U.S. going to war in Iraq in 2003 when he was a State Department official in President George W. Bush's administration.

His militaristic viewpoint led him to write recently that a Trump administration first strike against North Korea would be “perfectly legitimate.”

Bolton also opposes a two-state solution to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.

And as a longstanding opponent of the six-nation deal to stop Iran from building nuclear weapons, he is open to a first strike against Iran, too.

Mike Pompeo Mike PompeoThe Hill's 12:30 Report - Presented by Facebook - All US adults now eligible for COVID vaccines Parade of 2024 GOP hopefuls court House conservatives Pompeo violated ethics rules, State Dept. watchdog finds MORE, Trump’s nominee for secretary of State, is also an opponent of the Iran deal. Both skate over the fact that there is no compelling evidence that Iran has violated the terms of the pact. It is up for recertification next month.

With Bolton and Pompeo as his top foreign policy advisors, Trump has created “the most radically aggressive foreign policy team around the American president in modern memory,” according to a New York Times news analysis.

Bolton’s appointment comes at a time when the president has no strategy for dealing with global conflicts.

He recently announced — with no explanation — sudden plans to exit Syria “very soon.” Trump, who has tripled the U.S. presence in Syria, made that declaration the same day his own Pentagon explained that keeping troops in Syria was necessary to preserve the gains in the fight against ISIS.

Last week, Trump tried to paper over the differences with his military advisors by saying he is open to keeping a short-term residual force there.

That confusing policy came after his dramatic announcement of a meeting with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un. Again, the president has no strategy for those talks.

But North Korea will surely be watching to see if the U.S. goes back on its word in the Iran deal as Trump attempts to negotiate an end to North Korea’s nuclear program.

That won’t upset Bolton. His position is that the only right purpose for Trump’s meeting with the North Korean is to deliver a face-to-face threat of military action.

And then there is Trump’s flip-flop decision to send more troops to Afghanistan, a war now entering its 17th year.

Trump called the U.S. involvement there a “complete waste” during his campaign for the White House.

“Why are we continuing to train these Afghanis who then shoot our soldiers in the back? Afghanistan is a complete waste. Time to come home!” Trump once tweeted.

Now he is sending more troops with the promise that they will train and advise Afghan troops fighting Taliban forces.

This incoherence across the map from a president with no foreign policy experience has left the American public with little trust in Trump as a world leader.

A CNN/ORC poll taken late last month found that 53 percent of Americans disapprove of the way Trump is handling foreign affairs.

The public also disagrees with Bolton’s steadfast defense of the U.S. war in Iraq. A Pew poll taken last month to mark the 15th anniversary of the start of the war asked Americans if they thought the U.S. “mostly succeeded” or “mostly failed” in “achieving its goals in Iraq.” A majority — 53 percent — said the U.S. mostly failed.

The most memorable speech of Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' Cuba readies for life without Castro Chelsea Clinton: Pics of Trump getting vaccinated would help him 'claim credit' MORE’s 2016 presidential campaign was a blistering attack on Trump’s chaotic, militaristic instincts on foreign policy.

“Donald Trump’s ideas aren’t just different — they are dangerously incoherent,” Clinton warned in a San Diego speech. “They’re not really ideas, just a series of bizarre rants, personal feuds and outright lies.”

Trump has now proven her right. He has shown time and time again that he makes impulsive decisions based on the loudest voice in the room.

Now that voice belongs to John Bolton, his third national security advisor in just 14 months.

Bolton’s record is so tainted that a Republican majority in the Senate refused to confirm him as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. Bush gave him a recess appointment but his sharp criticism of the U.N. and his disdain for international law, led to conflicts with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.

Personnel is policy in any White House. This is especially true when the president cannot explain to the American people what he is doing.

By appointing Bolton, Trump is embracing a hawk best known for shutting out other points of view while advancing isolationist polices that increase the likelihood of confrontation and war.

“Bolton played a key role in politicizing the [intelligence] that misled us into the Iraq War — We cannot let this extreme war hawk blunder us into another terrible conflict,” Sen. Edward Markey Ed MarkeyThe Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Facebook - All US adults can get vaccine; decision Friday on J&J vax Democratic Rep. Mondaire Jones calls on Breyer to retire Democratic senators call on Biden to support waiving vaccine patents MORE (D-Mass.) recently tweeted.

The New York Times editorial page put it bluntly: “There are few people more likely than Mr. Bolton is to lead the country into war.”

“I’ve heard that you’re actually the devil incarnate and I wanted to meet you”

That’s how Secretary of Defense James Mattis James Norman MattisBiden's is not a leaky ship of state — not yet Rejoining the Iran nuclear deal would save lives of US troops, diplomats The soft but unmatched power of US foreign exchange programs MORE greeted Bolton at the Pentagon late last month.

It was a joke, I think.

21841,Williams,Juan,thehill,"So far, 24 Republicans have announced their retirements from Congress this cycle. This number is the highest of any congressional cycle since 1973.

What was happening in 1973?

The Watergate scandal. It exposed the lies and cover-ups of Republican President Richard Nixon and forced his resignation.

In the 1974 midterm elections, 49 Democrats took House seats away from the Republicans, giving them more than a 2-1 majority in the lower chamber. Democrats also gained four Senate seats, bringing them up to a total of 60 seats.

Incredibly, Republicans seem to agree that 2018 will be a lot like 1974.

In addition to all the other retirements by House Republicans, there is now talk of Speaker Paul Ryan Paul Davis RyanOn The Money: Senate confirms Gensler to lead SEC | Senate GOP to face off over earmarks next week | Top Republican on House tax panel to retire Trump faces test of power with early endorsements Lobbying world MORE (Wis.) possibly quitting, too.

Talk of Ryan’s departure is significant because lesser-known House Republicans have no reason to think they will survive if Ryan isn’t inclined to try to hold on.

Brendan Boyle decides against Pennsylvania Senate bid Pennsylvania's Democratic lt. governor files to run for Senate Bottom Line MORE.

And that’s not the only sign of dread among Republicans.

Earlier this month, Sen. Dean Heller Dean Arthur HellerOn The Trail: Democrats plan to hammer Trump on Social Security, Medicare Lobbying World Democrats spend big to put Senate in play MORE (R-Nev.) offered another clue of Republican desperation. He promoted a baseless rumor that Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy was getting ready to retire — a naked ploy to gin up the conservative base to come out and vote for him in November.

Then there is Trump’s budget deal. It explodes the deficit he pledged to reduce.

Also, there is still no funding for any wall on the Mexican border.

And don’t forget, Trump’s flip-flop on his promise to push for stronger background checks for gun purchases and to stop the sale of guns to people under 21.

Oh, and keep in mind Trump’s low approval ratings — historically low for a president who has only been in the White House a little more than a year. Such bad numbers are usually reliable signs that the president’s party is in trouble in the midterms.

And who can ignore the resignation of Trump’s chief personal lawyer in the Russia probe, John Dowd? He announced he was resigning just before the New York Times reported he discussed presidential pardons with lawyers for Michael Flynn and Paul Manafort Paul John ManafortThere was Trump-Russia collusion — and Trump pardoned the colluder Treasury: Manafort associate passed 'sensitive' campaign data to Russian intelligence Hunter Biden blasts Trump in new book: 'A vile man with a vile mission' MORE — potentially proof of a conspiracy to obstruct justice.

Want more evidence of trouble? Trump’s White House counsel Don McGahn has had to obtain his own high-priced DC lawyer to defend him in the Russia probe.

This is the dark reality facing congressional Republicans with the midterms now seven months away.

The heart of their peril is fear of energized Democrats producing a big turnout. That fits with the big turnout for recent student-led marches for gun control.

The Democrats will be marching out to punish Trump, but it is Congressional Republicans who will get trampled.

And what about swing voters?

GOP losses in a special House race in Pennsylvania and the governor’s race in Virginia show support falling for GOP candidates among independent voters and suburban Republican women.

Republicans as well as Democrats see no end of talk about extramarital affairs, hush money and the tightening noose of the Mueller probe.

It is no secret that top Republican lawyer Ted Olson and other experienced DC legal powerbrokers have declined requests to represent Trump. Michael Cohen, Trump’s personal pit bull lawyer, is radioactive over his role in the Stormy Daniels affair and may face legal exposure of his own.

Cohen paid Daniels $130,000 in the closing stretch of the 2016 election campaign — money Daniels says was meant to keep her quiet about an affair with Trump. The White House has said that Trump denies the two had a sexual relationship.

The Stormy Daniels lawsuit is a game-changer because Trump could be forced to give her lawyers a deposition about his sexual past — something that has the potential to set off more scandals.

Trump’s silence about Daniels, after her interview on CBS’s “60 Minutes” was seen by 22 million viewers, is more evidence that he fears being deposed by her lawyer.

The 2018 elections will be a referendum on Donald Trump. This is not about the Trump presidency but the man himself.

21842,Williams,Juan,thehill,"Republicans need some new material. Seriously.

Their latest effort is a desperate attempt to use 84-year-old Louis Farrakhan, the racist leader of the cult-like Nation of Islam, to silence President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE’s critics in the Congressional Black Caucus.

Donald Trump Jr. Don TrumpTrump Jr. shares edited video showing father knocking Biden down with golf ball Trump: 'I can't imagine' any Republican would beat me in 2024 primary if I run Trump Jr.: There are 'plenty' of GOP incumbents who should be challenged MORE retweeted Farrakhan earlier this month, saying “Sounds like the Democrat’s [sic] front runner for 2020. I guess they finally embraced God... which is nice!”

ADVERTISEMENT

Trump Jr.’s tweet is aimed at pushing the lie that blacks in Congress are hypocrites for not calling out racism from a black man: Farrakhan. There’s also the suggestion that anti-white racism is key to black opposition to the president.

In fact, Farrakhan has been a known black separatist for the last half century. He condemns white people as “devils” in a twisted attempt to bolster the self-image of poor black people in the face of racism.

He also makes vile comment about Jews. And he regularly skewers mainstream black politicians and reporters who support racial integration.

In fact, he condemns all American politics as corrupt.

I know this because, as a Washington Post reporter, I covered some of Farrakhan’s speeches in the 1980s, as well as calls for black politicians to repudiate him.

I also know that, during the 2016 Republican primaries, Farrakhan admired Trump’s politically incorrect approach to Jewish donors. Trump rudely told a Jewish group: “You’re not going to support me because I don’t want your money.”

Farrakhan excitedly responded to that crass language by encouraging Trump, the Associated Press reported, to “push” a racially separate agenda “that will limit the freedoms of others.”

Farrakhan sees those policies as advancing his black separatist agenda. Farrakhan exhorted Trump to “push it so good that black people say, ‘I’m outta here – I can’t take it no more.’”

But Trump Jr.’s aim is to get everyone to believe that Farrakhan is a hidden hand behind anti-Trump politics and most incredibly, a leading Democrat.

Trump’s followers are similarly attacking the co-president of the Women’s March, Tamika Mallory, for attending a speech given by Farrakhan last month.

On Twitter, the far-right is calling on blacks in Congress, and Mallory, to denounce Farrakhan. Trump's fans think they’ve found a way to extinguish anti-Trump energy, including the marches that have swept the nation since he became president.

Keep in mind that this barrage from the Trump camp comes at a time when 57 percent of Americans say the president is a racist, according to an Associated Press/NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll. Eighty percent of blacks say Trump is racist, as do about 75 percent of Hispanics and close to half of all whites.

The people polled must recall the president’s incredible claim that “some very fine people,” were among the ‘alt-right’ mix of white nationalists and neo-Nazis who led a violent march in Charlottesville, Va., last year. A female protestor was killed by a car allegedly driven by a far-right extremist during that period.

Maybe some of the people being polled also recall the Ku Klux Klan newspaper’s support for Trump. Maybe they heard about the Nazi salutes given to Richard Spencer, a white nationalist and Trump supporter, when he celebrated Trump’s victory by saying: “America was until this past generation a white country…It belongs to us.” The group also chanted: “Hail Trump!”

In a brassy counterattack, Trump’s acolytes are now trying to score political points by damning black members of Congress for their reluctance to issue another round of condemnations of Farrakhan.

This political ploy is so transparent and preposterous that I strongly debated whether it was even worth a column.

But this appeal to racial fears fits exactly with the destructive strategy behind Russian-paid advertising on Facebook during the 2016 presidential race.

The Russians aimed to divide Americans by race and religion, as well as through specific hot-button issues such as gay rights and immigration.

The strategy was exposed last fall when Facebook turned over to Congress more than 3,000 ads, paid for by Russians. The Russians wanted to “sow chaos,” according to Sen. Mark Warner Mark Robert WarnerManchin throws support behind union-backed PRO Act New US sanctions further chill Biden-Putin relations Democrats brace for new 'defund the police' attacks MORE (D-Va.), vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee.

One flaw with the strategy became obvious when Russian President Vladimir Putin declared earlier this month that “Jews” might be behind the hacking and social media attacks during the 2016 campaign.

Trump never condemned Putin. When the leaders spoke, the U.S. president used his time to congratulate Putin on winning another term as Russian president.

Yet the far-right is still attacking black politicians by tying them to Farrakhan.

Last week. Rep. Todd Rokita Theodore (Todd) Edward RokitaWe need a Herbert Hoover to reel in Big Tech Juan Williams: The GOP's big lie on voting rights GOP AGs say House voting rights bill unconstitutional MORE (R-Ind.) introduced a House resolution condemning Farrakhan.

Minnesota Congressman Keith Ellison Keith EllisonDeSantis signs 'anti-riot bill' cracking down on 'public disorder' Sunday shows - Infrastructure in the spotlight Omar: Minneapolis community is 'on edge' around Chauvin trial MORE, who also serves as deputy chairman at the Democratic National Committee, tried to set the record straight in a blog post last week.

""I do not have and have never had a relationship with Mr. Farrakhan, but I have been in the same room as him,"" Ellison wrote. A fact-check by the Washington Post disputed Ellison’s claim to limited meetings with Farrakhan.

Rep. Danny Davis Daniel (Danny) K. DavisDemocrats have a growing tax problem with SALT Social Security gives IRS data to speed delivery of COVID-19 relief checks House Democrats demand answers on slow ,400 checks MORE (D-Ill.) also issued a statement condemning Farrakhan’s comments about whites and Jews.

All this reminds me of the old Soviet propaganda technique known as “Whataboutism.”

If someone said something critical about the USSR or communism, the retort would be “Well, what about [insert Western problem].”

We are now seeing the return of Soviet “whataboutism” in right-wing false equivalencies focused on Farrakhan.

While it is being done to help Trump, the real winner is Putin — in his efforts to boost Russia by dividing Americans, undercutting faith in democracy.

21843,Williams,Juan,thehill,"“You fool, those students are actors.”

“You secretly like it when there is a mass shooting because it helps you push gun control!”

My email inbox has been under siege since 17 people were killed and 17 more injured last month at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.

ADVERTISEMENT

The mass murder at this American school has put the National Rifle Association and gun manufacturers on the defensive as never before.

The reason is simple:

For the first time, high school and college students are the teary faces on the front line calling for gun control.

And they are shifting American public opinion.

“We don’t need to listen to President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE. President Trump needs to listen to the screams of the children and the screams of this nation,” Parkland survivor David Hogg told HBO’s Bill Maher after the massacre.

Last week, students across the nation walked out of school and called on Congress to give up political contributions from the NRA and end easy access to guns.

What did Congress do?

The House passed a nothing-burger bill that same day. It was limited to a few dollars for metal detectors and other small school safety measures. Their bill did nothing to improve background checks, limit private gun sales or halt the sale of assault weapons.

Congressional Republicans are waiting on time to pass. They count on everyone calling for more gun control to get frustrated and go silent again.

That is the Trump strategy too. After the shooting, he held a televised listening session with politicians and later with parents of the dead and traumatized students.

He promised to take action by limiting the sale of rifles to people under 21, as well as strengthening background checks for gun buyers.

A few days later, in the face of NRA opposition, he threw those ideas out, saying there is no public support for them.

Wrong.

Polls show support for those steps at record highs. And the support is likely to keep growing because later this week thousands of students and their supporters from all over the country will be in Washington for the “March for our Lives.” The American people are with the marchers.

A Gallup poll taken earlier this month asked Americans if they felt current laws covering the sale of firearms should be stricter, less strict, or kept as they are now.

A whopping 67 percent said they should be made stricter, while just 4 percent favored making them less strict.

Those results track with a Quinnipiac University poll from this month that found that 66 percent of all Americans support stricter gun laws while 32 percent oppose. This is the highest support for tighter gun laws in a decade, even higher than after the mass murder of elementary school children in Newtown, Conn. in 2012.

Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) and the GOP-controlled legislature in his state got the message. They bucked the NRA by passing modest gun control legislation this month that raised the age of gun purchase from 18 to 21 and banned bump stocks.

Scott is widely expected to announce his bid for the U.S. Senate, challenging incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson Clarence (Bill) William NelsonHas the Biden administration abandoned the idea of a moon base? Cuba readies for life without Castro Why does Rep. Johnson oppose NASA's commercial human landing system? MORE (D) in the coming days. He is one Republican who knows that he risks alienating independent voters in the Sunshine State if he is seen as tone deaf on gun control.

Meanwhile, the president told a room full of lawmakers, in front of television cameras, that he would like to “take the guns first, go through due process second.”

That must have been a moment of genuine frustration with gun violence. But it was only a moment; the president quickly returned to doing nothing but protecting the NRA.

On Capitol Hill, Republicans have decided they need NRA money to avoid a wipeout in the November midterm elections.

That’s why Congressional Republicans keep doing nothing; they believe they need the NRA more than the NRA needs them.

""Republicans will never do anything on gun control,"" former Florida Republican Congressman David Jolly said after the Parkland shooting. ""The idea of gun policy in the Republican Party is to try to get a speaking slot at the NRA and prove to that constituency that you are further right.""

Next month will mark the 19th anniversary of the Columbine High School shooting in Colorado that left 15 people dead. Since then, the nation has endured the tragedy of mass shootings at Virginia Tech; in an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut; and now Parkland.

I have covered the politics of guns in Washington, from the support for gun control after the shooting of White House Press Secretary James Brady to the rise of the NRA as a lobbying powerhouse.

The NRA still has deep pockets but they are no longer the loudest voices in the conversation.

Please, students, save us from this gun mania.

But the president has not done so. And the law says no one — especially the nation’s top law enforcement official — is free to selectively ignore Congress’s constitutional authority to exercise checks and balances on the executive branch.

In an editorial, The Washington Post called out the House GOP for its rank hypocrisy in how it behaves now by comparison to its conduct during the Obama administration.

“Republicans held Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. in contempt when they were pursuing their trumped-up investigation of the ‘Fast and Furious’ gunrunning scheme,” the Post editorialized. “Zealously defending the dignity of the legislative branch mattered to them when a Democrat was in the White House.

Note that they have no evidence of any wrongdoing by the court. Note that they have no proof of wrongdoing by the FBI in making its application to four judges.

But the request is in keeping with Nunes’s priorities.

Previously, he kicked up dirt about former President Obama in an attempt to support Trump’s claim that Obama wiretapped his campaign.

Nunes also created a distraction by casting aspersions on legitimate requests by Obama’s national security officials to ""unmask"" the names of Trump officials talking with the Russians.

In every case, Nunes has tried to discredit any law enforcement agency that might reveal what happened between the Trump campaign and the Russians. His efforts have been primarily focused on undercutting special counsel Mueller’s investigation.

This is unprecedented contempt by House leadership for Congress’s role in protecting the nation from the threat of a lawless president.

Can you recall an instance in congressional probes into Watergate, Iran-Contra or President Clinton’s conduct where a member of Congress leaked confidential communication with another member of Congress?

It is sad that Nunes has prostituted his committee’s bipartisan commitment to national security — all to protect Trump.

It will take a generation — if not more — before the intelligence community regains trust in sharing information with the House Intelligence Committee. After Nunes’s dispiriting performance, they have every reason to fear their sources and methods will be compromised and their integrity impugned if it serves a future chairman’s partisan agenda.

These sad developments come as public concern about Russian interference persists.

A Suffolk University/USA Today poll last month found that 69 percent of Americans believe the Russians made “a serious effort to meddle in the 2016 election.” Seventy-six percent believe the Russians will continue to meddle in our elections. Sixty percent think Trump is not doing enough to respond to the Russian meddling.

A majority — 57 percent of Americans — say they have “little or no trust” in Trump’s denial that there was any collusion between his campaign and the Russians.

And yet, Congressional Republicans are sanguine even as Michael Rogers, head of the National Security Agency, reports that Trump has not ordered him to stop the Russians from interfering in U.S. elections.

When is Congress going to listen to the American people — their constituents — and begin to assert itself as a co-equal branch of government? When will its members see the ongoing threat to America’s national security as bigger than Trump?

This utter breakdown of democratic government is not sustainable for much longer.

Just in time for the two-year anniversary of the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments on the law’s constitutionality this week.

This is a political column. So let’s leave the litigation and questions of constitutionality to the lawyers.

21846,Williams,Juan,thehill,"During the 2016 election cycle, the nation’s largest teachers’ union, the National Education Association (NEA), gave $29.7 million in political contributions.

Most of the money went to Democrats, including presidential candidate Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' Cuba readies for life without Castro Chelsea Clinton: Pics of Trump getting vaccinated would help him 'claim credit' MORE.

There is no denying the outsized role of union dollars in Democratic politics.

For example, I get mad at Democrats who can’t see the urgent need to improve public schools because they are blinded by money coming from teachers’ unions. To my mind, the unions are more intent on protecting jobs for adults than improving schools for children.

But last week, conservative activists and Supreme Court justices lost me.

They suggested it is corrupt for union money to pour into Democratic coffers while ignoring all the corporate money pouring into Republican campaigns.

It is outright hypocrisy to protect your own donors while demonizing the people giving money to your opponent.

The amount of money contributed to Republicans by big corporations, anonymous wealthy individuals, the Chamber of Commerce and billionaire activists like the Koch brothers and Sheldon Adelson swamps the money unions give to Democrats.

As we saw with the recent cut in the corporate tax rate, those corporations and the richest Americans have a very clear, self-serving political agenda.

But you’d never know the truth by listening to oral arguments at the Supreme Court last week.

Justice Anthony Kennedy thinks only unions have a political agenda.

“If you don’t prevail… unions will have less political influence; yes or no?” Kennedy asked the lawyer representing public sector union AFSCME.

When the lawyer said yes — the union will be less politically influential with diminished dues collections — Kennedy responded: “Isn’t that the end of this case?”

Talk about political distortions coming from the mouth of a supposed impartial Justice.

The truth is that this case is not supposed to be about limiting the amount of political influence coming from unions.

It is a review of past court rulings requiring public sector workers to pay dues to unions even if they don’t join.

Its official title is Janus v. AFSCME. The plaintiff is Mark Janus, who works at the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services.

Over the last 40 years, several Supreme Court rulings have affirmed that all workers — even those who don’t agree with their union’s political agenda — should at least pay an “agency fee” to support collective bargaining by unions to help all workers.

As Roman Catholic bishops argue in the current case, all workers benefit when unions are strong enough to negotiate for higher wages, better working conditions and increased benefits. It also satisfies the national interest in having peaceful labor relations.

Kennedy’s wayward comment about “political influence” reflects right-wing delight at the prospect of hurting Democrats.

If the Supreme Court rules against the union, reversing decades of its previous rulings, it will choke off a key stream of money for Democrats. Meanwhile, the price of campaigns continues to balloon and big business steadily ramps up its political contributions to Republicans.

All of this is distorting American politics and weakening our two-party political system. And it comes at a time of rising income inequality. Such a “partisan political issue…should be decided state by state…not once and for all, by unelected justices,” the Washington Post editorialized.

Kennedy’s purely political view of the Janus case is getting a big assist in the court of public opinion from conservative groups. They argue for individual workers to not pay dues when they disagree with union politics, claiming this is a matter of freedom of speech.

These same forces tried to deliver a killer blow to mandatory union dues in 2016 in a similar case. They were thwarted when Justice Antonin Scalia died before the case was decided, leading to a 4-4 deadlock between the court’s conservative and liberal justices.

Now, with Trump’s appointment of Justice Neil Gorsuch, the court’s 5-4 conservative majority is ready to deliver the deathblow to Democrats.

Since the Tea Party wave in the 2010 midterm elections, the GOP has been intent on choking off the cash flow to public sector unions in order to limit financial support for Democratic candidates.

A majority of U.S. states — 28 to be exact — are so-called “right to work” states. They prohibit mandatory union membership dues.

Those states are overwhelmingly led by Republican governors and GOP-dominated state legislatures. Recall how Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) became a conservative hero in 2011 for pushing a bill that ended collective bargaining for public employee unions.

With the midterms just eight months away, the Democrats find themselves high on polls showing strong anti-Trump passions. They are also buoyed by recent victories in state special elections including two last week in Connecticut and New Hampshire.

But for all the enthusiasm, the Democratic Party finds itself at a major cash disadvantage compared to Trump’s GOP.

According to January 2018 filings with the Federal Election Commission, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) raised $67 million in 2017 while the Republican National Committee (RNC) raised a whopping $132.5 million.

Of that haul, the RNC has $38.8 million cash on hand and no debt. The DNC has $6.5 million cash on hand but is in hock to the tune of $6.2 million.

One of the most underappreciated revelations in Donna Brazile’s tell-all book last year was her disclosure that, when she assumed the chairmanship of the DNC in 2016, she found a party languishing in over $24 million in debt.

Trump announced last week he is running for reelection in 2020. If the Supreme Court affirms a GOP monopoly on big dollar donations, the Democrats’ chance to defeat the incumbent will be grim.

Former White House chief strategist Stephen Bannon has said Oprah and the ""Me Too"" movement pose an “existential threat” to the Trump presidency.

Obama left the White House with a 68 percent approval rating. She got a new wave of positive attention this month when record crowds showed up to see her newly unveiled official portrait at the National Gallery of Art.

Conservative columnist and Trump booster Ann Coulter confidently predicted last fall that if Harris ran, she would be the Democratic nominee.

A black female candidate would attract a lot of attention with a challenge to Trump. Ninety-four percent of black women voted against Trump in 2016 as did 69 percent of Latina women and 43 percent of white women. Women of all races have led the biggest anti-Trump marches.

April Reign, an activist who founded the #OscarsSoWhite campaign, worried during a recent NBC interview that the clamor for a black female presidential candidate could be a trap.

“Stop begging strong black women to be president: Michelle, Oprah, whatever,” Reign said. “It’s weird. And Lord knows when black women try to lead, y’all attempt to silence and erase us. So how would that work, exactly?”

Well, black women are already thriving at the top of the political ladder in lots of places.

Black women are in charge as mayor of at least seven big cities: Atlanta; Baltimore; Charlotte, N.C.; Flint, Mich.; New Orleans; Toledo, Ohio; and Washington.

In addition, a record 21 black women are serving in Congress, including Harris. All but one — Rep. Mia Love Ludmya (Mia) LoveVoters elected a record number of Black women to Congress this year — none were Republican Democrats lead in diversity in new Congress despite GOP gains McAdams concedes to Owens in competitive Utah district MORE (R-Utah) — are Democrats.

Winfrey and Obama stand out among all these black women because their political strength is only a subset of their power as cultural icons.

They have fans among Republicans and Democrats. They attract people of all races. Their broad appeal, including among suburban white women, crosses the nation’s deep political divide

Trump is attuned to a potential challenge from Winfrey.

After Winfrey conducted a focus group on Trump for CBS’s “60 Minutes,” the president quickly lashed out at her.

“Just watched a very insecure Oprah Winfrey, who at one point I knew very well, interview a panel of people on 60 Minutes,” he tweeted. “The questions were biased and slanted, the facts incorrect. Hope Oprah runs so she can be exposed and defeated just like all of the others!”

Oprah responded last week by telling Ellen DeGeneres: “I woke up, and I just thought — I don't like giving negativity power — so I just thought, what?”

Oprah said that she asked CBS to add a response from a pro-Trump member of the focus group to give the piece more balance. “So I was working very hard to do the opposite of what I was hate-tweeted about,” she told Ellen.

Meanwhile, if Obama runs, she would inherit her husband’s formidable political machine.

Perhaps only an Obama can successfully use the Obama political machine to hold together the Obama coalition and win back the White House?

Even longtime Trump political adviser Roger Stone Roger Jason StoneThere was Trump-Russia collusion — and Trump pardoned the colluder On The Money: Moderates' 0B infrastructure bill is a tough sell with Democrats | Justice Dept. sues Trump ally Roger Stone for unpaid taxes Justice Dept. sues Trump ally Roger Stone for unpaid taxes MORE recently told the Oxford Union that Obama would be the strongest Democratic candidate.

The then-first lady’s “When they go low, we go high” speech was one of the most memorable of the 2016 Democratic National Convention.

The big question with Obama is whether she is willing to go low and put her family through another brutal presidential campaign.

Harris lacks the name identification of Winfrey or Obama. But California’s junior senator comes from the most influential state in Democratic politics.

Harris would have a strong claim to the deep-pocketed donors in Hollywood and Silicon Valley who helped fund her Senate election in 2016. The former state attorney general’s unflinching television interviews and TV grilling of Trump administration witnesses at congressional hearings have made her a national favorite.

Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa (D) said in an interview last August, ""She's going to be knocking on doors in Iowa.""

In 1968, New York’s Shirley Chisholm became the first black woman elected to Congress.

Four years later, she became the first black candidate to run for a major party’s presidential nomination.

“I am not the candidate of black America, although I am black and proud,” Chisholm told supporters at her announcement. “I am not the candidate of the women’s movement of this country, although I am a woman, and I am equally proud of that.



“I am the candidate of the people of America. And my presence before you now symbolizes a new era in American political history.”

It's looking more and more likely that 2020 will be the year that a woman finishes the journey and shatters not one but two glass ceilings.

21848,Williams,Juan,thehill,"When it comes to the Stormy Daniels story, it is hard for me to understand the silence from evangelical Christians.

Let it sink in: It is now confirmed that the president’s personal lawyer paid a porn star for her silence.

After the story broke, a friend sent me an old article from a left-wing website.

Democrats, the story said, beat themselves up for not better understanding white, Christian support for President Trump Donald TrumpSt. Louis lawyer who pointed gun at Black Lives Matter protesters considering Senate run Chauvin found guilty as nation exhales US says Iran negotiations are 'positive' MORE.

ADVERTISEMENT

But that is a fool’s errand, the writer argued, because there is no understanding people who don’t accept facts.

The facts on the porn star and Trump became clear last week when Michael D. Cohen, the president’s lawyer, said he personally paid $130,000 to Daniels.

The money changed hands just before the 2016 election to allegedly stop her from talking about a sexual affair with candidate Trump that took place in 2006, just after Trump’s wife had a baby.

There is no longer any way to deny the fact of the payment and the nature of the tawdry story.

Also, there is no way to deny a former Playboy playmate’s telling of another extramarital affair with the president in 2006 and 2007.

The New Yorker magazine has now confirmed that the woman in question, Karen McDougal, wrote an account of the relationship. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier that she was paid for her story by the National Enquirer’s publisher, a Trump friend, and the tabloid sat on the story, presumably to protect Trump.

And there is no way to deny that FBI Director Christopher Wray testified to Congress last week that Trump’s White House knew about two serious charges of domestic abuse against top aide Rob Porter but let him keep his job. Porter resigned only when those allegations became public.

Yes, the injunction to let he who is without sin cast the first stone is an important one. But it now seems clear that evangelical Christians, who hold up biblical edicts on lying, cheating and adultery, don’t care about the word of God when it comes to Trump.

A January poll for The Washington Post and ABC News “found 68 percent of white evangelical Protestants approve of Trump’s job performance — a figure that is nearly double that of the population as a whole and that is higher than any other religious or demographic group.”

Let’s not forget that according to exit polls, 80 percent of white, born-again evangelical Christians supported Trump in the last election. Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' Cuba readies for life without Castro Chelsea Clinton: Pics of Trump getting vaccinated would help him 'claim credit' MORE only received 16 percent support. Voters from this demographic cast 26 percent of all votes for president in 2016.

For a group that regularly preaches about the “sanctity of marriage” and inveighs against the evils of divorce, it was a major political puzzle to me when evangelicals first backed the thrice-married, adulterous Trump over Hillary Clinton.

She suffered years of public humiliation rather than breaking up her family, turning away from marriage vows and divorcing her philandering husband.

And now the puzzling behavior of evangelicals is pushed to the limit by their support for Trump despite the slimy facts of the Stormy Daniels story.

Imagine for one moment if President Obama’s personal lawyer had paid six figures in hush money to a porn star.

The same evangelicals would have condemned him as not being Christian and possibly believing in Muslim law that allows multiple wives. They would have said he was a bad example to the nation’s youth.

Imagine if Obama had endorsed a candidate despite credible allegations that he sexually molested young girls.

Well, there is no denying that Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore Roy Stewart MooreThe Hill's Morning Report - Biden assails 'epidemic' of gun violence amid SC, Texas shootings Trump faces test of power with early endorsements CPAC, all-in for Trump, is not what it used to be MORE (R), who faced just such allegations, got Trump’s full endorsement.

Again, evangelicals continued to support Trump.

Hypocrisy that deep can’t be excused by Trump’s convenient switch from supporting abortion rights to opposing abortion.

What we are seeing is a hollow core in evangelical faith as practiced by its leaders.

Tony Perkins, head of a Christian conservative evangelical group, The Family Research Council, said recently that his supporters give Trump a “mulligan” on sex with the porn star.

Evangelical leader Franklin Graham, the son of the nation’s most famous evangelical preacher, Billy Graham, also defended Trump.

“That was a long time ago,” Graham told CNN’s Don Lemon in dismissing the porn star story. “I’m more interested in who a person is today. I believe he’s a changed person.”

Graham saves his fiery condemnations for what he calls the “godless progressive agenda of Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaMinneapolis mayor on Floyd: 'Ultimately his life will have bettered our city' Lawmakers react to guilty verdict in Chauvin murder trial: 'Our work is far from done' Obamas praise Floyd jury, urge more action: 'We cannot rest' MORE and Hillary Clinton.”

Robert Jeffress, a leading Trump supporter among evangelicals and senior pastor of First Baptist Dallas, told The New York Times earlier this month he “can’t look into the president’s heart.”

Jeffress said he doesn’t “care” if Trump is a religious phony but only that Trump has “embraced and enacted” policies favored by Jeffress and other evangelicals.

That led Tara I. Burton to conclude in an article on Vox that Jeffress’ indifference about Trump’s nasty earlier comments about ""shithole countries"" in fact “revealed the dark heart of Christian nationalism: It is as much…about jingoism and ethno-nationalism as it ever has been about Christian values.”

When it comes to Trump, the nation’s political, social and historical norms do not matter anymore. Now the acid of the Trump presidency is eating away at the integrity of leading evangelists and their supporters.

God help us.

Last week, Trump remained high on his pledge during his State of the Union speech.

The fabled promise to build the wall is now blocking the president from making an immigration deal with Democrats — a deal that is needed in order to prevent a government shutdown on Friday.

ADVERTISEMENT

Any agreement to keep the government open depends on allowing the president to save face as he falls away from the wall.

There are two big questions at play:

Firstly, how much money do the Democrats have to give the president in the name of border security to get him to climb down?

Secondly, will right-wing talk radio allow him to make an immigration deal with the Democrats if he shifts to talking about a ""virtual"" wall?

The first to offer the president a helping hand off the ledge was White House Chief of Staff John Kelly John Francis KellyMORE.

Kelly reportedly told members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus in January not to worry about the wall because “a 50-foot wall from sea to shining sea isn’t what we’re going to build.”

The next day, Kelly explained to my Fox News colleague Bret Baier that he was simply pointing out to the Hispanic Caucus that all politicians “say things during the course of campaigns that may or may not be fully informed.”

Trump didn’t take kindly to that. So he tweeted: “The Wall is the Wall, it has never changed or evolved from the day I conceived of it.”

The president did come down a little bit, however. He conceded in his tweets that part of the wall may be “see through,” adding that he does not intend to build a wall across “mountains, wastelands or tough rivers.”

Then another offer to help the president off the wall came from the Department of Homeland Security. They reported last month that 2017 saw the lowest level of border-crossing arrests since 1971.

That fits with other statistics from federal officials that could give Trump a helping hand. They offered him numbers showing that during President Obama’s second term, net migration from Mexico fell below zero. That means more people were exiting the U.S. to go south than entering from the south.

The government also reported a sharp increase in fencing on the border. Between 2005 and 2017, the U.S. increased 135 miles of fencing and barriers to 653 miles of fencing. Even better, during the Bush and Obama administrations, spending on border patrols went from $1.1 billion to $3.8 billion.

In addition, federal records show more immigrants are in the U.S. illegally because they overstayed their visas than because they illegally crossed the southwestern border.

Trump can fudge the timeline and brag to his supporters that all this happened due to his hard rhetoric — and without a real wall.

If he takes that path down, Trump will find a very broad political safety net open to soften his fall.

An ABC News/Washington Post poll taken last month found that 63 percent of Americans oppose building a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. Just 34 percent support the wall. Those numbers track with another poll from CBS News also taken last month that found 61 percent oppose the wall and 35 percent support it.

The president’s fellow Republicans in the Senate are also sticking out helping hands.

In Nevada, Sen. Dean Heller Dean Arthur HellerOn The Trail: Democrats plan to hammer Trump on Social Security, Medicare Lobbying World Democrats spend big to put Senate in play MORE — arguably the most vulnerable Republican senator up for re-election this year — is no fan of the wall.

Heller can see that Democrats are targeting his state and congressional districts where the Latino population has increased in recent years. A wall will not help Republicans hold those seats.

Former Ariz. Gov. Janet Napolitano (D), who also served as Obama’s Homeland Security secretary, gave the Democrats a good line for political advertising in the southwest when she famously said, regarding a border wall: “Show me a 50-foot wall and I'll show you a 51-foot ladder.”

Another problem for Republicans is that much of the land along the U.S.-Mexico border is privately owned, meaning the Trump administration would have to assert sweeping new eminent domain powers to seize the land and build the wall on it.

This kind of unprecedented government land grab would tie the government up in years of costly litigation as landowners fight back in the courts.

And then there is the fact that Trump is not getting help to pay for the wall from Mexico.

Whenever Trump says that Mexico will eventually pay for the wall, former Mexican President Vincente Fox tweets back: “We are not paying for that stupid f-in wall.”

At this point, the wall is at best a majestic symbol in the culture wars and a wedge issue for Trump’s GOP.

It is not a viable policy and thus it does not belong in a serious policy debate over immigration and funding the federal government.

The only “big beautiful wall” being constructed these days is the barrier between reality and the mindset of Trump supporters.

Who among them will help Trump avoid a crashing fall?

21853,Williams,Juan,thehill,"Did you see #SchumerShutdown trending on Twitter two weeks ago?

You got used.

Fake Twitter accounts linked to Russia — hundreds of fake accounts — pushed the #SchumerShutdown, according to a group monitoring foreign internet activity.

President Trump Donald TrumpSt. Louis lawyer who pointed gun at Black Lives Matter protesters considering Senate run Chauvin found guilty as nation exhales US says Iran negotiations are 'positive' MORE and Congressional Republicans reaped the political benefits of this Russian intelligence offensive. Schumer and congressional Democrats backed down out of fear that they were losing public support as based on social media activity.

In fact, subsequent polling showed most Americans blamed the shutdown on Trump as well as the Republican majorities who control the Senate and the House, but still cannot pass a budget or immigration reform.

Russia’s backing for Trump and the Republicans who support him on Capitol Hill gives the GOP no incentive to investigate, punish or disrupt the Russian interference.

And the Russian social media attacks continue with shameless regularity.

Around the same time they pushed #SchumerShutdown, armies of Russian bots and trolls on social media were also pumping up the #ReleaseTheMemo hashtag, in support of the right-wing conspiracy theory that a classified memo on usage of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) reveals a shadowy “Deep State” cabal against President Trump.

The #ReleasetheMemo offensive, pushed in part by Russian President Vladimir Putin’s operatives, is the latest effort to help Trump by disparaging the FBI and Special Counsel Robert Mueller Robert (Bob) MuellerWhy a special counsel is guaranteed if Biden chooses Yates, Cuomo or Jones as AG Barr taps attorney investigating Russia probe origins as special counsel CNN's Toobin warns McCabe is in 'perilous condition' with emboldened Trump MORE with bogus political narratives.

Russia paid little price for that brazen interference in a presidential election. In fact, their intrusion achieved their desired outcome — Trump was elected. It worked. They got away with it.

They have no reason to stop doing it and every reason to keep doing it.

In addition, congressional Republican leaders have continued to conveniently close their eyes to the Russian meddling with American democracy while Trump benefits from it. As the midterm elections approach, with control of Congress at stake, Russia can be expected to make a push to keep Trump-friendly Republicans in power.

This is already taking place, as the Russians have picked up the pace of their internet attacks by pitting Americans against Americans on race, religion, and immigration. The Russian goal is to polarize public opinion, undermine trust in elections and weaken the U.S. as a world power.

Last week, Congress offered more proof of Russia’s success in damaging America by releasing documents from Facebook showing Russian agents behind 129 “phony event announcements during the 2016 presidential campaign, drawing the attention of nearly 340,000 users — many of whom said they were planning to attend,” according to The Washington Post.

In a December report, a former deputy director of the CIA and the former Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee wrote that there is “a perception among the media and general public that Russia ended its social media operations following last year’s election… Wrong.” Michael Morell and Mike Rogers Michael (Mike) Dennis RogersFive questions about Biden withdrawal from Afghanistan Congress brings back corrupt, costly, and inequitably earmarks Biden defense budget criticized by Republicans, progressives alike MORE said the Russian attacks on American politics “continue to this day.”

It is no surprise that, in the last year, the Russians smeared the FBI, according to Morell and Rogers, as well as lashing out at ABC News, and stirring fevered anti-immigrant passions by highlighting all violent acts by illegal immigrants.

The Russians even went after Congressional Republicans who dared to criticize Trump. The Russian social media attacks, Morell and Rogers wrote, targeted Sen. John McCain John Sidney McCainBush says he doesn't criticize other presidents to avoid risking friendship with Michelle Obama 'Real Housewives of the GOP' — Wannabe reality show narcissists commandeer the party George W.

“This was a Russian attack on a U.S. company and on our economy,” Morell and Rogers wrote in The Washington Post.

“This hashtag has been used as yet another attempt to discredit Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe,” Blumenthal and Whitehouse wrote. “We find it reprehensible that Russian agents have so eagerly manipulated innocent American citizens and undermined our democratic processes though our elections and public policy debates.”

The Russian social media effort in support of Trump now enters a perilous stretch as Mueller readies for an interview with the president regarding his campaign’s ties to the Russians, and questions of possible subsequent obstruction of justice.

Public opinion, so ably influenced by the Russians, will play an important role. Last week, a CNN poll found 78 percent of Americans believe Trump should testify under oath as part of Mueller’s probe. Just 18 percent said he should not.

If Trump refuses to cooperate with the investigation, creating a clash over constitutional powers, public opinions and support for the rule of law — across political lines — will be critical.

But those opinions will be under the influence of a hostile foreign power: Russia.

The real news is that most Democrats have decided to attend.

Congressional Republicans, meanwhile, have no choice but to show up and smile for the cameras. They have to be there because Republican prospects in the midterm elections look dreadful and the most reliable Republican voters remain largely loyal to Trump.

ADVERTISEMENT

That’s why the audience that matters for this State of the Union speech is Trump’s small base of supporters — the most loyal Republicans, especially the older, whiter, less educated, and evangelical voters. Historically, they have high turnout in midterm elections, which should help Republicans.

But enthusiasm among Trump populists is down based on their poor turnout in the Virginia governor’s race and Alabama special election. Last week, Democrats won a 9-point victory in a special election for a state Senate race in a Wisconsin district that Trump won by 17 points.

The big question for this State of the Union is whether Trump can deliver a message to stir his base and avoid a GOP wipeout in the midterms.

The best message available to the president is a celebration of his only major legislative accomplishment — the tax cut plan which gives some benefits to middle-class workers even as it overwhelmingly rewards corporations and the wealthiest Americans.

Here is the problem with that strategy:

A New York Times poll last week found a majority of Americans agree that Trump’s economic “policies had either hurt the economy or had little effect on it; only 38 percent said his policies had made it better.”

Also, talk about the economy might remind Republicans that Trump can’t pass a budget even though the GOP controls both chambers of Congress.

So, the odds are that Trump will make his address into a sales pitch for Americans who have doubts about the tax cut.

It will be an uphill climb.

A Quinnipiac University poll last week found the new law with a 52 percent disapproval and 32 percent approval rating among all registered voters. Among independent registered voters, who the GOP needs to turn out for them in November, the tax law is polling at 52 percent disapproval and just 27 percent approval.

The New York Times poll released last week saw the tax plan’s support at 46 percent, a 10-point jump since December, but still less than the 49 percent disapproval.

While both polls showed some improvement in public opinion since the bill passed, the plurality of voters in all polls remain opposed.

One option might be for Trump to talk about his plan to upgrade the nation’s aging infrastructure.

But the infrastructure plan is highly unlikely to come to fruition because the tax cuts drained the Treasury of the money necessary to fund it. A suggestion, from the Chamber of Commerce and others, that these measures should be paid for by raising the gas tax is unlikely to gain traction in an election year.

Another option for the president is to reiterate his famous plan to build a wall on the Mexican border.

The problem with bringing up the wall is that no progress has been made on it. And his own chief of staff, John Kelly John Francis KellyMORE, publicly rebuked him as “uninformed” when he made campaign claims on the subject recently.

Bringing up immigration also risks reminding even the most loyal GOP voters about Trump’s hateful comments about immigrants from “shithole countries.” Those words blew up any good-faith negotiations between Congress and the White House to protect the young illegal immigrants brought here by their parents. Close to 80 percent of Americans support allowing the Dreamers to stay.

While the TV audience is critical, there is a second important audience for Trump’s speech — Republican politicians.

They know the president has a 39.5 percent job approval in the latest average of polls by RealClearPolitics. And they know the history of presidents with approval ratings below 50 percent consistently losing seats. President Obama lost 63 House seats with a 45 percent approval rating in 2010. With a 42 percent approval rating in 1982, President Reagan lost 28 seats.

Democrats need to win back 25 seats to claim the House majority. Most political forecasts now indicate there is at least a 50 percent chance that the Democrats will hit that target, or do even better.

As the Weekly Standard noted last week: “In local and statewide races, Democrats are outperforming Hillary [Clinton] and Republicans are underperforming Trump in 2016.”

Last week’s Quinnipiac poll found Democrats with an 11-point advantage on the generic Congressional ballot question asking which party voters prefer to control Congress. And 56 percent gave Trump’s first year in office an “F” or “D” grade — failing or near failing.

The Republican-led House and Senate have even lower approval ratings.

So much of Trump’s first year in office has been consumed by his reality TV showmanship. Right now his audience is turning off the show. Finding the right message for the big audience watching the State of the Union is Trump’s best chance to flip a reality show on the verge of being cancelled.

Trump said last week he’d beat Winfrey in the 2020 presidential race. And he dismissed the burst of talk about her possible 2020 candidacy with a belittling comment: “Oprah will be a lot of fun.”

Of course, that opened the door for a poll. Winfrey beat Trump by 10 percentage points, 48-38, according to Rasmussen.

Even with the polling, my initial reaction to the ‘Oprah for President’ excitement was skepticism. After the disastrous first year of the Trump presidency, and his historic low standing in the polls, I thought Americans would have a new thirst for stable, experienced leadership.

American voters also have a habit of picking a president who is the opposite of the incumbent. So why trust another TV celebrity as commander-in-chief?

But all the polling indicates that people still want an outsider — someone to shake up Washington. They remain fed up with the polarized, do-nothing Congress, the chaos in the White House and the partisan media. That means policy background and political experience are not necessary.

By that logic, our presidential elections will necessarily shift to contests among high-profile political outsiders focused on character, intelligence and integrity.

If that is the new norm for presidential politics, then Oprah is the greatest threat to Trump’s reelection other than the president himself.

Meanwhile, he continues to demonstrate that he is a threat to implode.

Last week began with the nation debating his mental fitness to be president. It ended with debate on whether “the stable genius,” as he called himself, is a racist. That sad conversation started after he stated his preference for immigrants from Norway over those from “shithole” countries in Africa, the Caribbean and Central America.

While Trump continues to damage himself with everyone except those voters who would turn a blind eye even if he shot a man on Fifth Avenue — here, I’m using Trump’s own description of his core base — Oprah starts with equally passionate support from women voters.

In the Rasmussen poll, she beat Trump among women by 52 percent to 34 percent.

Oprah’s popularity among white women, particularly in suburban and rural America, makes her uniquely well positioned to succeed where Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' Cuba readies for life without Castro Chelsea Clinton: Pics of Trump getting vaccinated would help him 'claim credit' MORE failed as a presidential candidate.

Let’s remember that in 2016, white women made up 37 percent of the electorate. They voted for Trump over Clinton, 52 percent to 43 percent.

If Clinton had won — or even narrowed her margin of loss — with white women, she would be president today instead of Trump.

“For decades, Oprah has cultivated an extraordinarily intimate relationship with an audience that captures the entire Obama coalition,” David Burstein wrote in Vanity Fair last week. “That includes two key groups where Hillary wasn’t as strong as she could have been: non-college-educated white women and suburban white women.

“Put these voters together and Oprah can be competitive in every state Obama won in 2012…No other prospective 2020 candidate can make as clear a claim,” Burstein concluded.

Also factor in the tremendous turnout by minority women — specifically black women — that carried Democrats to victory in the 2017 Virginia gubernatorial race and the Senate special election in Alabama. Those are Oprah voters.

Oprah would make history as the first black woman president. Now that is the definition of a political outsider.

President Obama proved that race is no longer a barrier to the presidency. Clinton proved that gender still is a barrier, even with the backing of allies from her husband’s two terms in the White House.

In contrast to Clinton, Oprah’s central appeal has always been her bond with white women. They formed the audience base of her daytime talk show for decades. She is a trusted, confident, credible and comforting figure for women. She helped them make sense of the most controversial social and political issues of the time on that show.

I first appeared on Oprah’s show back in 1990. I was on a panel with rapper Ice-T, debating violent and sexual lyrics in music, and whether such graphic and explicit records should come with a warning label. I still remember how Oprah moderated the heated discussion, seeking to build consensus and advance the conversation towards something constructive.

I really got to know her when I wrote her first primetime television special. I worked directly with her and took her to visit my aging in-laws. For a star of her magnitude, she was always genuine, caring about others and, most of all, smart. Once they got over being starstruck, my family took to her like one of our own. The star I got to know really is a good person.

Another factor in Oprah’s favor is the ongoing failure of the Democrats to find a compelling candidate to run against Trump. Oprah’s path to the presidency and the Democrats' path back to the White House are the same — they both need white women.

“There’s an argument for choosing someone outside the circle,” said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiPelosi criticized after thanking Floyd for 'sacrificing' his life Waters on Chauvin guilty verdict: 'I'm not celebrating, I'm relieved' Minneapolis mayor on Floyd: 'Ultimately his life will have bettered our city' MORE (D-Calif.).

She added: “Oprah has read books, she knows how to identify talent. So if we are going into a place where they are devaluing experience in terms of substance and legislative acumen…you may as well have someone who knows what they don’t know and would get the best possible people there.”

Go, Oprah!

21859,Williams,Juan,thehill,"As we begin 2018, President Trump Donald TrumpSt. Louis lawyer who pointed gun at Black Lives Matter protesters considering Senate run Chauvin found guilty as nation exhales US says Iran negotiations are 'positive' MORE claims he is picking up speed after the late December passage of tax cut legislation.

But the tax cut is even less popular than the president. And his approval rating is the lowest in history for any first-year president.

The real problem is that tax cuts for the rich are not what candidate Trump promised his populist supporters.

ADVERTISEMENT

Trump said he was going to raise taxes on the rich and eliminate deductions that favored the investor class, while cutting taxes on the middle class.

He also said he was going to end the carried interest deduction that allows hedge fund millionaires to pay at a lower tax rate than working-class Americans.

The bill Trump signed does the exact opposite. It gives a big tax cut to the rich and allows the carried interest deduction to remain.

Trump has distracted the nation with his clown show while the “too big to fail” crowd of corporate lobbyists, the Chamber of Commerce and the Koch brothers passed a tax bill to make themselves even richer.

This is a triumph for establishment Republicans.

For most of 2017, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellMcConnell vents over 'fake news' The Hill's 12:30 Report - Presented by Facebook - Tensions rise as U.S. waits for Derek Chauvin verdict Trump looking 'beyond seriously' at 2024 run MORE (R-Ky.) and Speaker Paul Ryan Paul Davis RyanOn The Money: Senate confirms Gensler to lead SEC | Senate GOP to face off over earmarks next week | Top Republican on House tax panel to retire Trump faces test of power with early endorsements Lobbying world MORE (R-Wis.) were ridiculed on right-wing talk radio and conservative websites for not advancing the Trump agenda. The Republican Congress’s approval ratings sank lower than Trump’s.

But in retrospect, it looks as if McConnell and Ryan never cared about their low ratings. They wanted the president to fill up the front pages with his attacks on them, as well as bluster, bullying and scandal.

It allowed them to work without the glare of public scrutiny for a rushed tax bill that gives small, temporary breaks to Trump’s “forgotten” working people while the wealthiest one percent of taxpayers get 83 percent of the benefit.

Establishment Republicans also let Trump have the spotlight while working in the dark to advance three other long-held agenda items.

Firstly, allowing drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve; secondly, repealing the individual mandate in the Affordable Care Act; and thirdly, pushing poorly qualified but pro-business and anti-regulation judges onto federal courts.

Establishment Republicans plan to use Trump as a distraction once again in 2018.

While Trump is caught up battling the special counsel probe into alleged collusion between his 2016 campaign and Russia, McConnell and Ryan plan to cut federal spending on social safety net programs, including welfare, Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.

These are politically popular programs. Trump promised during the 2016 campaign not to cut Social Security. But now the populist politician will again be reneging on a pledge.

He is being repositioned by the GOP establishment into demanding smaller government and making their case that starving big government begins by cutting spending on domestic programs.

Trump and the Republican majority in Congress will not mention their 2017 tax cuts that drove up the deficit by more than $1 trillion.

These Republican bait and switch games are urgent with the midterm elections approaching. Democrats are likely to make gains that could halt the GOP establishment agenda.

A Quinnipiac poll taken before Christmas found Democrats with a 15-point advantage on the 2018 generic Congressional ballot question, 52 to 37.

Charlie Cook wrote recently in the Cook Political Report that the GOP is facing “enormous” problems heading into the new year. “The odds of them losing the House are now at least 50-50 and the Senate is in real doubt.”

Democrats need a net gain of 24 House seats to wrest back control.

Twenty-three districts currently represented by GOP congressmen voted for Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' Cuba readies for life without Castro Chelsea Clinton: Pics of Trump getting vaccinated would help him 'claim credit' MORE over Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election. Seven of them are in deep-blue California.

When control of the House flipped from Democrats to Republicans in 1994, the GOP picked up 54 seats. In 2006, the Democrats won control of the House by picking up 31 seats. In 2010, control switched again with the GOP netting 63 seats.

The GOP has something of a ""red wall"" in the House through years of gerrymandered districts by Republican governors and state legislatures.

But as the 2016 election proved with Hillary Clinton's fabled ""blue wall"" in the electoral college, walls work great — until they are breached.

One of the most underreported stories of 2017 was the failure of Republicans to recruit top-tier candidates with name recognition and fundraising prowess to run for these seats. Democrats are growing in confidence as they see the second and third-rate Republican contenders.

And Democrats need a confidence boost. They are defending an unenviable 26 Senate seats — one more than expected, because there will be a special election in Minnesota as a result of Sen. Al Franken Alan (Al) Stuart Franken#MeWho? The hypocritical silence of Kamala Harris The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Facebook - Senate Dems face unity test; Tanden nomination falls Gillibrand: Cuomo allegations 'completely unacceptable' MORE's (D) resignation — while the GOP is defending only eight.

Trump gave his conservative supporters heartburn earlier this year when he struck a temporary spending deal with Congressional Democrats.

It is good that Trump appears to get along so well with “Chuck and Nancy” — Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer Chuck SchumerLawmakers react to guilty verdict in Chauvin murder trial: 'Our work is far from done' Overnight Health Care: Johnson & Johnson pause seen as 'responsible' in poll | Women turning out more than men for COVID-19 vaccines 'Real Housewives of the GOP' — Wannabe reality show narcissists commandeer the party MORE (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiPelosi criticized after thanking Floyd for 'sacrificing' his life Waters on Chauvin guilty verdict: 'I'm not celebrating, I'm relieved' Minneapolis mayor on Floyd: 'Ultimately his life will have bettered our city' MORE (D-Calif.).

The smart money says he will be spending a lot more time with them when they are Senate Majority Leader and Speaker this time next year.

By then, the Republican Establishment will be done with the Trump show.

21862,Williams,Juan,thehill,"Republicans say the big news on Capitol Hill last week was that they passed tax cuts.

Wrong.

The bigger news on Capitol Hill was that Americans now trust Democrats more than Republicans to handle taxes and the economy, according to a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll.

For the last 40 years, Republicans have consistently outperformed Democrats when voters were asked which party is the better steward of taxes and the economy.

Now, the Journal poll has voters favoring Democrats by 33 percent to 29 percent on taxes, and by 35 percent to 30 percent on the economy.

ADVERTISEMENT

This is a total 180-degree, world is upside down, hell just froze over reversal.

How can this be happening when Republicans are lining up to praise the president and the tax cuts?

“Exquisite presidential leadership,” said Speaker Paul Ryan Paul Davis RyanOn The Money: Senate confirms Gensler to lead SEC | Senate GOP to face off over earmarks next week | Top Republican on House tax panel to retire Trump faces test of power with early endorsements Lobbying world MORE (R-Wis.). “One heck of a leader,” said Sen. Orrin Hatch Orrin Grant HatchPress: Forget bipartisanship — it's dead! Privatization of foster care has been a disaster for children Remembering Ted Kennedy highlights decline of the Senate MORE (R-Utah).

That sycophantic acclaim for a president who just destroyed voters’ trust in the GOP’s ability to deliver good economic results is strong evidence the party has lost its identity as the standard-bearer of fiscal conservatism.

The new Republican Party is a supporting cast for a bombastic salesman of a president who won the White House with a grand promise to cut taxes and create jobs to benefit working class people.

With his tax plan now signed into law, the curtains are finally pulled back on the Wizard of Trump Tower.

Voters can see that he has handed tax cuts to the very rich, the top 1 percent, and shareholders of large corporations — not the middle class or the poor.

Cutting corporate taxes — from 35 percent to 21 percent — is “probably the biggest factor in our plan,” and not tax reform to benefit the middle class, the president admitted as the bill made its way to his desk.

Voters can also see that Republicans who once trashed President Obama over increases in the federal deficit are now happy to look the other way.

And what about creating new jobs?

A Yale University survey of corporate chiefs in mid-December found only 14 percent planning to make new capital investments and hire more workers as a result of their tax cut windfall.

The man who did the survey of corporate leaders, Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, told CNN Money that Trump’s claim that tax cuts will result in more jobs is “a lot of smoke and mirrors.”

Sonnenfeld pointed to the already low rate of unemployment across the nation as well as record corporate profits to make the point that big firms could already be expanding and hiring more people if that was in their plans.

Not a single Democrat voted for Trump’s tax cuts.

House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiPelosi criticized after thanking Floyd for 'sacrificing' his life Waters on Chauvin guilty verdict: 'I'm not celebrating, I'm relieved' Minneapolis mayor on Floyd: 'Ultimately his life will have bettered our city' MORE (Calif.) summed up the new tax cuts in a fiery tweet last week:

“By the end, the #GOPTaxScam will… raise taxes on 86 million middle class households, hand 83% of the benefits to the wealthiest 1% of Americans. This will go down as one of the most scandalous, obscene acts of plutocracy ever,” Pelosi tweeted.

Pelosi was citing data from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center which found that under the law, the wealthiest one percent of Americans will get 83 percent of the tax cuts and the wealthiest zero point one (0.1) percent will get almost 60 percent of the tax cuts, both by 2027.

With so much money concentrated in the hands of so few Americans, it is no wonder that polls show this law is wildly unpopular, with support ranging in major polls only from 26 to 32 percent.

“Don’t let your Uncle Bob be fooled: Republicans are voting for this because their wealthy patrons demand it,” former Clinton Labor Secretary Robert Reich wrote last week on his website. “Their tax plan will weaken our economy for years — reducing demand, widening inequality, and increasing the national debt by at least $1.5 trillion over the next decade.”

And now for the political fall-out:

Before the tax cut vote, Democrats led Republicans on the generic Congressional preference ballot question by 15 points. Fifty-one percent said they would vote or lean towards voting Democratic, while just 36 percent said the same about Republicans, according to Monmouth University.

Look for those numbers to sink even lower when Trump voters realize they’ve been had. They were sold a bill of goods by his party when they voted for Trump-style economic populism in 2016.

And that is not the end of the story. The White House and Ryan intend to go after entitlement programs next year to cut federal spending. That means social programs for the elderly and the poor are now in immediate danger, including Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.

The Trump party argues they have to make the cuts to keep the deficit from ballooning.

So, the party of Trump has created a spending problem with a give-away to the rich — and now proposes to solve it by cracking down on the poor.

It is beginning to look a lot like a wave election coming in 2018.

Trump, who had begun pulling down the curtain on the Obama-era program called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), is himself now talking a different game.

The popularity of DACA has been on the rise. The program allows many people who arrived illegally in the U.S. as children to avoid deportation.

Last week, Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer Chuck SchumerLawmakers react to guilty verdict in Chauvin murder trial: 'Our work is far from done' Overnight Health Care: Johnson & Johnson pause seen as 'responsible' in poll | Women turning out more than men for COVID-19 vaccines 'Real Housewives of the GOP' — Wannabe reality show narcissists commandeer the party MORE (D-N.Y.) took to the Senate floor and said, “We are in the process of negotiating with Republicans to provide a significant investment in border security in exchange for DACA.

Many of those Republicans represent swing districts with a growing number of immigrants.

""We are compelled to act immediately because many DACA recipients are about to lose or have already lost their permits in the wake of the program's rescission,"" the letter read.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiPelosi criticized after thanking Floyd for 'sacrificing' his life Waters on Chauvin guilty verdict: 'I'm not celebrating, I'm relieved' Minneapolis mayor on Floyd: 'Ultimately his life will have bettered our city' MORE (D-Calif.) said flatly, “We will not leave here without a DACA fix.”

Powerful business interests ranging from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s immigration reform group have been lobbying Congress hard to pass a DACA fix.

“If ever there was an occasion to come together to help people improve their lives, this is it,” wrote Tim Cook, the left-leaning head of Apple, and Charles Koch, the conservative chief executive of Koch Industries, in a Washington Post op-ed last week.

While Trump has expressed sympathy for the children who were protected by DACA, the urgent question is whether he will have the courage to buck hard-right, anti-immigrant Republicans.

Just last week, Trump won plaudits from right-wing websites and TV commentators for tying immigration to terrorism and calling on Congress to end “chain migration” and “visa lotteries” in the wake of two recent attempted bombings by immigrants in New York City.

Today’s strong economy and vibrant American culture with 43 million immigrants, more than 13 percent of the population, clearly refutes King’s charge.

King obviously finds political advantage in Iowa by fanning anger at immigrants. Trump had success selling the same bitter brew nationwide in his winning 2016 presidential campaign.

He showed no change of heart when he quickly make political hay over a jury’s decision earlier this month to acquit an undocumented immigrant of killing a young woman in San Francisco in 2015. Trump used the tragedy to rail against “sanctuary cities” and renew his call for a border wall.

“No wonder the people of our country are so angry with Illegal Immigration,” he tweeted.

The facts tell a different story, with U.S. Customs and Border Protection reporting that border apprehensions of people seeking to enter the nation illegally are at the lowest level in 45 years.

Trump earlier called for legal immigration to be cut in half. And he pardoned former Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa Co., Ariz., who was found guilty of contempt of court for detaining people for no other reason than suspicion of being illegal immigrants.

Trump also endorsed an accused child molester in the Alabama Senate race because, he claimed, the Democrat would be “weak” on immigration and border security.

Trump’s drumbeat of demonization for immigrants gives him unimpeachable credentials among the GOP base.

Along with his March deadline, it creates an opening for him to have a “Nixon to China” moment in which a hardline president turns on a dime to make a surprising political deal.

Trump, unlike any other Republicans, can do his party colleagues in Congressional a huge favor by resolving the issue before the midterm elections. His base may trust him enough not to hold such a move against him.

President Bush couldn’t get this done in 2006 due to opposition from right-wing talk radio hosts who shouted “amnesty.” Republicans on Capitol Hill failed again in 2013 when the far right blocked the push.

Once again, time is running out. Will Trump and the GOP seize the opportunity or have it as another albatross around their neck for the midterms?

Anyone listening only to right-wing talk radio and television would assume Special Counsel Robert Mueller is “corrupt” (that’s according to Newt Gingrich); the leader of a “silent coup” (according to Rush Limbaugh); and a bad guy whose “credibility is in the gutter” (according to Sean Hannity). The Wall Street Journal’s editorial page has already said Mueller should “step down.”

The president is personally rallying his troops to help derail the investigation by throwing dirt at the FBI. On Twitter, he has said the FBI’s reputation is in “tatters” and “the worst in history.”

These baseless, partisan assaults on law enforcement are just a slice of the biggest unresolved problem in American politics — the power of propaganda.

Trust in American democracy as a “shining city upon a hill” for all freedom loving people, to quote President Reagan, is being unraveled by partisan echo chambers and internet-based propaganda.

The result is an endless airing of conspiracy theories and the equally relentless stoking of grievances against political foes.

America’s enemies know we have a problem.

In October, Facebook turned over to congressional investigators more than 3,000 advertisements placed by Russian sites during the 2016 presidential campaign. The company said 10 million people viewed those advertisements.

Twitter found 200 accounts tied to Facebook pages under Russian control. Google reported the Internet Research Agency, a company with ties to the Kremlin, put 1,000 videos on YouTube.

The New York Times reported in October that the “disinformation campaign spread well beyond Facebook to sites like Reddit, Instagram, 4chan and Imgur…making it more difficult to curb the tide of fake accounts.”

The goal of the Russian social media assault was to disrupt American democracy by splitting the country into warring camps, divided on hot button issues such as the Black Lives Matter movement, gun ownership, gay rights and immigration.

The Russians also promoted candidate Donald Trump.

Russia’s version of Facebook even offered to help the Trump campaign, according to a report last week in The Washington Post, by offering to “promote Trump’s campaign to its nearly 100 million users.”

In October, executives from Google, Facebook and Twitter were grilled by a Senate subcommittee on their underwhelming response to Russia’s success in manipulating American public opinion.

“The abuse of our platform to attempt state-sponsored manipulation of elections is a new challenge for us — and one that we are determined to meet,” Twitter’s acting general counsel said, asking for patience.

It’s unclear when, or whether, congressional leaders will advance the bill.

But Google, Facebook and Twitter have to be held to account for the enormous platforms they give to propaganda that is tearing down the country.

Yet not everyone agrees. A November Axios poll conducted by Survey Monkey found that 62 percent of American adults do not want the government to regulate social media companies like other media companies. Just 34 percent do. According to the poll, a majority of Democrats, Republicans and independents say they want government to stay out of it.

In that case, what is to stop Russia and other bad actors from continuing to screw with American elections?

“Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and Google have grown to encompass duties to the public trust — duties that these companies were never intended to handle in the first place,” Jim Geraghty wrote in the conservative National Review last week.

Before the 2016 election, little thought was given to how “empowering everyone to send short messages, post videos or create online communities meant it would empower terrorists, criminals, hate groups, garden-variety nut-jobs and child predators to do the same things,” he wrote.

And what about Russia and other foreign powers out to cripple American democracy?

“Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and Google realize that whether or not they intended to be media companies or want to be media companies, they have become media companies, and they need to take responsibility for what appears on their platforms,” he argued.

Geraghty is right. Now is the time to revive the doctrine of corporate social responsibility as hostile foreign powers are no doubt plotting to again use social media to disrupt next year’s election.

Unless the social media companies act to limit propaganda, the 2018 elections and a new year of Trump investigation are going to be a very rough ride.

He suggested — falsely, of course — that MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough is a murderer. And he injected himself into the firing of TV anchorman Matt Lauer after allegations of sexual harassment, while turning a blind eye to a GOP candidate suspected of pursuing a 14-year-old girl, Alabama’s Roy Moore.

At this hellish moment when the president is threatening to drag the country beyond chaos, why are congressional Republicans failing to restrain the Republican in the White House?

Some Republicans cower in fear of Trump’s supporters but a surprising number are just quitting Congress.

As of last week, 44 members of the House of Representatives and two members of the Senate have announced that they will retire, resign, or run for another office by the end of the 115th Congress.

Thirty of the 44 heading for the door are Republicans. Most of them are good-government Republicans like Reps. Charlie Dent Charles (Charlie) Wieder Dent22 retired GOP members of Congress call for Trump's impeachment Seven Senate races to watch in 2022 The magnificent moderation of Susan Collins MORE of Pennsylvania and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen Ileana Carmen Ros-LehtinenBottom line Bottom line Democrats elect Meeks as first Black Foreign Affairs chairman MORE of Florida. They deserve thanks for years of good public service.

But at the critical moment when the nation is dealing with an out-of-control Republican in the White House, GOP members are leaving instead of standing up to a dysfunctional president of their own party.

Of course, they’ve also said nothing about the do-nothing brand of Republican leadership in Congress.

“Those of us who came to Congress to change Washington for the better through good governance are now the outliers,” said New Jersey Rep. Frank LoBiondo Frank Alo LoBiondoVan Drew-Kennedy race in NJ goes down to the wire Van Drew wins GOP primary in New Jersey Amy Kennedy wins NJ primary to face GOP's Van Drew MORE in his retirement announcement. “Today a vocal and obstinate minority within both parties has hijacked good legislation in pursuit of no legislation.”

LoBiondo is right about that “obstinate minority.” But he is wrong in saying it is on both sides of the aisle. The hard-right Freedom Caucus belongs to only one party — the GOP.

I cannot help but wonder how different American politics might look if LoBiondo and other moderate Republicans had refused to allow all Republicans to be defined by the Freedom Caucus, talk radio conspiracy theories, Roy Moore and Trump’s latest tweet.

Every Republican in this Congress will have to reckon with the part they played in allowing Capitol Hill to devolve into a pit of political polarization.

Some did it to save their own seats from a more extreme Tea Party or Freedom Caucus candidate who threatened them with a primary.

As then-Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) said of House Republicans in 2011, “half of them think like Michele Bachmann Michele Marie BachmannBoehner says he voted for Trump, didn't push back on election claims because he's retired Boehner: Trump 'stepped all over their loyalty' by lying to followers Boehner finally calls it as he sees it MORE,” — the Tea Party firebrand who was then a congresswoman from Minnesota — “and the other half are afraid of [a primary challenge from] someone who thinks like Michele Bachmann.”

It is also true that some congressional Republicans played along with the extremists to get attention from conservative websites and talk radio shows, setting themselves up for post-Congress careers as paid speakers or TV talking heads.

Still others stood silent because gerrymandered congressional districts made it easier to win reelection even if it meant ignoring the best interests of the nation.

This descent into political cowardice did not happen overnight.

Where were the unequivocal denunciations of false and racist charges that President Obama was not born in the U.S.? Where was the rebuke of the man who used that conspiracy theory as a springboard to the presidency, Donald Trump?

Where were the Republican congressional leaders when the country needed them to stand up to and shout down the likes of Bachmann and Sen. Ted Cruz Rafael (Ted) Edward CruzOn The Money: Senate GOP faces post-Trump spending brawl | Senate confirms SEC chief Gensler to full five-year term | Left-leaning group raises concerns about SALT cap repeal Biden watching Derek Chauvin verdict from West Wing Cruz opposed to state lawmaker's bid to replace Wright in Congress MORE (R-Texas) when they caused a pointless government shutdown that tarnished the nation’s credit rating?

Silence is assent, ladies and gentlemen.

Russian President Vladimir Putin should send ‘thank you’ cards to Republicans in Congress for their silence. It opened the door to Russia’s “covert influence” campaign against our country.

“You can’t create fissures in a society,” former CIA Director General Michael Hayden told Bill Maher on HBO earlier this year.

“Covert influence works when fissures exist and you drive the wedge into the pre-existing fissures,” Hayden said.

Republicans in Congress through the Obama years led the way in creating those fissures, dividing the country by making a sport of finding ways to obstruct the Democrat’s agenda.

They also wasted time generating baseless outrage by spreading conspiracy theories in the guise of investigations — from Fast and Furious to Benghazi.

A September Gallup poll found that 71 percent of Americans are dissatisfied with the way their nation is governed with the GOP in control of Congress, the White House and Supreme Court. Just 28 percent said they were satisfied.

These numbers track with the reliably abysmal Congressional job approval numbers — 74 percent disapproval, 13 percent approval, according to the latest Real Clear Politics Average.

Journalist E.J. Dionne and scholars Norm Ornstein and Thomas Mann tackle polarization in the age of Trump in their new book, “One Nation After Trump.”

“Donald Trump was not really someone who emerged from the swamp on his own,” Ornstein told PBS NewsHour in an interview last month. “There were decades that built towards the Trumpism that led to all of this.”

When will Congressional Republicans stop this game and start restraining Trump?

Given the deep partisan divide in the country, you might be thinking: Why is a Democrat honoring two conservative Republican senators?

Well, I never shut my eyes to masterful political achievements by Republicans. I don’t think governing should be reduced to partisan sport.

Last year I gave the award to a Republican, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellMcConnell vents over 'fake news' The Hill's 12:30 Report - Presented by Facebook - Tensions rise as U.S. waits for Derek Chauvin verdict Trump looking 'beyond seriously' at 2024 run MORE (Ky.).

He even refused to hold hearings for the Democrat’s Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland Merrick GarlandBiden says Chauvin verdict is step forward in fight against racial injustice Senate confirms Biden's nominee for No. 2 official at DOJ Why Biden's gun policy doesn't go far enough MORE.

That shameless strategy won the day. It culminated in the theft of a U.S. Supreme Court seat and kept a Republican majority on the Supreme Court.

Now, as the first year of President Trump’s tenure draws to a close, there is no denying that he towers over national politics.

That’s why every member of Congress is to be ranked this year by their stand on Trump’s divisive leadership.

This is the year that Trump claimed good people marched on “both sides” of the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va.

He also set off alarms by accusing the widow of a fallen American solider of lying about the condolence call he placed to her.

Trump has historically low approval numbers for a first-year president. Still, most Republicans on Capitol Hill took no stand against his bad behavior. They feared he would turn his dwindling base of supporters against them with a tweet.

But the two senators from the Grand Canyon State took the risk of speaking out forcefully for political decency and against their own party’s president.

McCain, now 81 and battling brain cancer, laid out the moral case against Trump — without mentioning the president by name — in his October speech accepting the Liberty Medal at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia.

McCain called Trump’s brand of anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim and racist nationalism “as unpatriotic as an attachment to any other tired dogma of the past that Americans consigned to the ash heap of history.”

McCain warned that the U.S. must not “abandon the ideals we have advanced around the globe,” specifically human rights and democracy.

He said the world’s single economic and military superpower cannot ""refuse the obligations of international leadership...for the sake of some half-baked, spurious nationalism cooked up by people who would rather find scapegoats than solve problems.”

His speech was a moral challenge to Trump’s divisive nationalism, which continues to distort American politics.

The president’s support for Roy Moore, the Alabama Senate candidate facing allegations that he pursued teenage girls, is the latest example of the absence of any moral principle in Trump’s politics.

McCain is also to be saluted for casting the deciding vote against a mean-spirited repeal of the Affordable Care Act that would have left millions without health insurance.

To be fair, I have been critical of McCain in the past. His hawkish foreign policy is often counterproductive. History shows his vociferous support for the war in Iraq was a mistake.

His selection of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his vice-presidential running mate in 2008 was cynical. It mainstreamed the toxic populism that carried Trump to the White House.

But there is no question that McCain is a patriot. And contrary to what Trump once famously said, McCain is a war hero, without question.

When I ran into him at a baseball game in Washington shortly after his brain cancer diagnosis, I didn’t quite know what to expect. He is famous for having one of the worst tempers in Washington. But the senator was gracious. We even posed with my son for a photograph we shared on social media.

It was a reminder that, in today’s divided politics, it is hard to find anything like the cross-party alliances McCain made with Democrats such as former Sens. Joe Lieberman (Conn.) and the late Edward Kennedy (Mass.).

While I do not know Flake so well, he is also worthy of praise for an October speech he delivered on the Senate floor announcing his retirement.

“We must never regard as ‘normal’ the regular and casual undermining of our democratic norms and ideals,” the 54-year-old Flake said. “We must never meekly accept the daily sundering of our country — the personal attacks; the threats against principles, freedoms, and institutions; the flagrant disregard for truth or decency; the reckless provocations, most often for the pettiest and most personal reasons, reasons having nothing whatsoever to do with the fortunes of the people that we have all been elected to serve.”

Flake wrote a book this year about the danger of Trump’s politics. Its title was Conscience of a Conservative — a nod to his political hero, Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz.).

McCain and Flake have risen above name-calling and bitter self-interest by speaking out against the dark forces that are taking over their party and threatening the nation.

People of goodwill from both political parties should hope and pray this holiday season that their example will inspire their GOP colleagues to finally stand up to Trump and the politics of division.

21869,Williams,Juan,dailycaller,"An astonishing poll has signaled a new era in American race relations. It appeared just last week but if you read The New York Times or Washington Post you wouldn’t know about it because there was little or no coverage.

As the nation celebrates Martin Luther King’s birthday today the absence of coverage says a lot about people who don’t want things to change when it comes to the old us-versus-them racial politics.

The poll by the respected Pew Research Center for the People and the Press found that 70 percent of white Americans and 60 percent of black Americans “believe values held by blacks and white have become more similar in the past decade.” Those numbers are unprecedented. Clear majorities of black and white Americans are saying that the divide born or racial, cultural and educational divisions is closing fast. The history of slavery, legal segregation and suspicion that comes with black anger and white guilt is amazingly close to being eclipsed by agreement across racial lines on common values.

And it is not just values that black and white are agreeing on. The poll also found that 65 percent of whites and 56 percent of blacks believe the gap between standards of living for the two races has narrowed over the last ten years. Even as incomes between the races have slightly widened during those ten years there is the feeling among both races that the level of comfort – living standard – is increasingly similar.

And there is more good news about race in the Pew poll.

For example, 39 percent of black Americans in the Pew poll say the “situation for blacks in the U.S.” is better than it was five years earlier. That is nearly twice the 20 percent of blacks who told Pew in a 2007 poll that the racial climate for black people had improved over the prior five years. In this latest poll, a majority of black Americans, 53 percent, also said they expect life in the future to be even better for black people. In the 2007 poll only 41 percent of black Americans expressed such optimism.

And in what I think is the most amazing finding of the new poll 52 percent of blacks said that black people who are not getting ahead today are “responsible for their own situation.” Only one-third of black Americans said racism is keeping down the black poor.

Fifteen years polls found the exact opposite with most black people pointing to racism as the major impediment to black people rising up the ladder of social and economic opportunity in the U.S.

These are major shifts in opinion among black and white Americans but especially among black people. The Pew researchers, whom I consulted with as they did the poll, point to the election of the first black President, Barack Obama, as the spur for this jump in good feeling among black Americans.

There is no doubt that having a black man elected President has shaken the world view of black people. A lot of folks, especially older African Americans who lived through the bad old days of segregation, did not think they would live to see a black man in the White House. The poll finds their attitude on race has become much more upbeat in the past two years and that has contributed to the overall leap in black optimism.

But there is something else going on here. Since the intense years of civil rights activism in the 1950s and 1960s the rates of high school graduation, income and home ownership have all been climbing for black Americans. But despite those decades of change polls did not find any sudden rise in optimism among black people to match what this latest Pew poll has uncovered.

I think I know why.

Black Americans and especially black civil rights leaders did not want to acknowledge the progress being made on the race relations front. Blacks feared that white America — in the form of government, foundations, churches and educational institutions — might point to any admission of racial progress as evidence that there was no more work to be done to heal the damage done to contemporary American life by racism.

But with continued progress for all minorities but especially blacks over the past decades — and the election of a black President – the silencer is off. There is a new confidence among black and whites that values and opportunities now exist in close to equal measure for blacks and whites who get an education and work hard.

Imagine how sky high this optimism might be if the recession had not hit and unemployment was not 10 percent including 16 percent for black people.

These astounding findings in the Pew poll open a different racial discussion in America. In the past, the big news out of polls of the two races predictably showed that white people thought one way and black people thought another. Now here is a poll that finds black and white people finding common ground as never before.

Yet somehow the New York Times and Washington Post did not find space in their news columns to tell this uplifting story.

If there was a charge of racism against a policeman or a politicians uttered some racially insensitive language that surely would have been on the front pages; in fact, just last week Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ended up on the front pages for just such a racial stumble.

But there was no space for news of new racial attitudes that signal that so much of the bitter feelings and finger-pointing of the past has faded. It is enough to make you think that some newspapers only see racial division as newsworthy.

What would Dr. King say?

Maybe they, like the old race hustlers and racists, think racial progress is not good for business.

The party’s leaders don’t buy it.

That makes sense.

But the grassroots energy inside the party — from moderates to left-wingers — is all about taking the fight to Trump to the point of impeachment.

A late October poll by Public Policy Polling, a Democratic-leaning firm, found a “record level of support for impeaching Donald Trump,” with 49 percent calling for impeachment and 41 percent opposed.

That near-majority call reveals the deep split between the Democrats’ youthful, activist base and the party’s cautious, old guard, led by senior congressional leaders.

Both sides want to win in 2018. But in the run-up to next year’s election, it is the party’s establishment leaders who are losing the intraparty fight to restrain growing excitement at the prospect of impeaching Trump.

Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) recently ended a speech at Glamour’s Women of the Year Awards with a robust chant: “Impeach Him!”

Billionaire Tom Steyer, the party’s biggest donor in recent years, is running a multi-million dollar ad blitz that has led 1.5 million people to sign a petition calling for the president’s impeachment.

The advertisement says, “People in Congress and his own administration know that this president is a clear and present danger who is mentally unstable and armed with nuclear weapons.”

Pelosi, when pressed on the Steyer advertisement, said impeachment “is not someplace I think we should go.” Similarly, Schumer reacted to Steyer by saying, “I’m not against him doing it but I think it is premature.”

Tom Perez Thomas PerezClinton’s top five vice presidential picks Government social programs: Triumph of hope over evidence Labor’s 'wasteful spending and mismanagement” at Workers’ Comp MORE, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), has joined the congressional leadership in withholding support for impeachment. He told ABC’s Martha Raddatz flatly, “I am not talking about impeachment.”

“I think that he totally deserves to be impeached, but given the present composition of Congress, it’s not about to happen soon,” Ellison said, “so why not focus on things that are right in front of us.”

These establishment strategists also point out that the last time Democrats aimed their fire at Trump’s often erratic behavior, they were not successful.

Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' Cuba readies for life without Castro Chelsea Clinton: Pics of Trump getting vaccinated would help him 'claim credit' MORE made the case that Trump’s words and actions should disqualify him as a presidential candidate. Obviously, it did not work.

Now political insiders argue it will be more fruitful for the Democrats to wait on the findings of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into ties between the Trump camp and Russia before jumping on the impeachment bandwagon.

Without clear evidence of high crimes and misdemeanors, the start of impeachment hearings could create a backlash, as some voters rally to his side.

Another point to consider is fundraising.

At the moment, Federal Election Commission filings show the Republican National Committee having raised $93 million through August, with $47 million in cash available.

Democrats are nowhere near that sum. For all the big wins for Democrats this year and the talk of grassroots energy growing on the Democratic side, the party has raised far less than the GOP — $46 million through August with $6.8 million in cash on hand.

Top Democrats favor focusing on positive messaging — more jobs and better healthcare — aimed at increasing donor confidence.

But pragmatic strategies from the Democrats’ congressional leadership have not stopped calls for impeachment from growing inside the party.

In a revealing split with party leaders, six House Democrats announced proposed articles of impeachment against President Trump.

“We have taken this action because of great concern for our country and our Constitution, our national security and our democracy,” Tennessee Democrat Steve Cohen Stephen (Steve) Ira CohenLobbying world Buttigieg charms Washington with his accessibility Chris Christie joins board of New York Mets MORE said last week.

Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.) introduced articles of impeachment against Trump in July. He has told The New York Times his action was “speaking for and galvanizing those people who are appalled at the [president’s] recklessness and the incompetency.”

Two leading grassroots groups, Democracy for America and MoveOn.org, are pushing for immediate impeachment. They can push all they like. At the moment, the Republican majority in Congress is sure to block them.

The Democrats are heady with momentum on their side as the 2018 midterms begin. But political momentum can fade. That is a big danger heading into midterms where the Democrats often fail to turn out.

That’s why Pelosi, Schumer and Perez are wrong not to at least wink at the activists calling for impeachment. It comes at no cost and it energizes the base.

Republicans running in 2018 saw the reality of an anti-Trump wave among white suburban voters. House Republicans rely on votes from suburban areas to keep their majorities in states such as Pennsylvania, Georgia and Florida.

Republicans currently hold 23 seats in congressional districts won by Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' Cuba readies for life without Castro Chelsea Clinton: Pics of Trump getting vaccinated would help him 'claim credit' MORE in 2016 and 11 in districts she lost by fewer than 5 percentage points.

The anger at Trump was evident in exit polls conducted by Edison Media Research.

In Virginia, Republican Ed Gillespie won 91 percent of voters who “approve of the way Trump is handling his job as president.” Democrat Ralph Northam won 87 percent of those who disapprove.

In essence, Gillespie had all the Trump voters. But there just weren’t enough of them and Northam won easily, by 9 points.

People upset with Trump turned out in big numbers. In fact, exit polls showed one-third of the electorate wanted to send a message of opposition to Trump with their vote for governor.

Now the urgent fear among Republicans on Capitol Hill is a 2018 landslide for Democrats as voters turn on Trump.

The vote in Virginia comes on the heels of Trump’s disapproval hitting 57 percent in the latest Fox News poll.

The president’s support among white men without a college degree is down to 56 percent from the 71 percent who voted for him a year ago. He has lost support among white evangelicals, with 66 percent supporting him now instead of the 80 percent that voted for him. He has also seen his support among independents slide from 46 percent in 2016 to 30 percent today.

Trump’s support among self-identified Republicans remains high at 83 percent in the Fox poll, but fewer people overall are identifying themselves as Republicans.

That sets the stage for the battle to claim the future of the party going into the 2018 races.

On one side, you have Trump and Stephen Bannon, his former top political aide. On the other side are the Presidents Bush, both 41 and 43, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellMcConnell vents over 'fake news' The Hill's 12:30 Report - Presented by Facebook - Tensions rise as U.S. waits for Derek Chauvin verdict Trump looking 'beyond seriously' at 2024 run MORE (R-Ky.) and Speaker Paul Ryan Paul Davis RyanOn The Money: Senate confirms Gensler to lead SEC | Senate GOP to face off over earmarks next week | Top Republican on House tax panel to retire Trump faces test of power with early endorsements Lobbying world MORE (R-Wis.) trapped in the ring and ducking punches from both sides.

The fight comes down to a contest between Trump’s anti-immigrant, isolationist, white grievance politics and the Bush policies favoring immigration, free trade and growing the party through outreach to racial minorities.

After last week’s defeat in Virginia, Trump and Bannon quickly threw dirt on Gillespie. Trump said Gillespie did “not embrace me or what I stand for.” Bannon piled on by saying the “lesson” of the loss was that future Republican candidates must avoid campaigning with President George W. Bush and “embrace the entire Trump agenda,” to the point of taking Trump on the campaign trail.

But Gillespie, the former party chairman, did use Trump-like advertising that focused on stirring fear of immigrants by tying them to MS-13 gangs; he did defend Confederate statues; and he did attack athletes kneeling to protest police brutality.

Gillespie lost because Virginia voters rejected Trump’s politics.

The Bush team also punched back.

“This guy doesn't know what it means to be president,” the younger President Bush said of Trump in an interview for a new book.

“I don't like him,” the elder President Bush told author Mark Updegrove. “I don't know much about [Trump], but I know he's a blowhard. And I'm not too excited about him being our leader.”

The Bush comments drew a sharp rebuke from Trump’s White House

""If one presidential candidate can disassemble a political party, it speaks volumes about how strong a legacy its past two presidents really had,"" an unnamed White House official told CNN. “And that begins with the Iraq war, one of the greatest foreign policy mistakes in American history.”

The split between Bush-style establishment conservatism and Trump populism has already hurt the party with about two dozen House Republicans announcing this is a good time for them to leave.

That rush for the door comes as polls show “voters say they prefer Democratic candidates for the House of Representatives over Republicans by the widest margin in over a decade,” The Washington Post reported before Tuesday’s GOP collapse.

Ryan said last week that despite the intraparty fight, it is too late for his House caucus to do anything but side with Trump on the future of the party.

“We already made that choice,” Ryan said on Fox News Radio. “We're with Trump. We already made that choice. … That’s a choice we made during the campaign, which is we merged our agendas.”

What must Republican congressional candidates be thinking today when their Speaker tells them they are handcuffed to a president who has the lowest approval rating in 70 years? At what point do they ignore the Speaker’s directive, cut ties with the president and strike out on their own?

A recent Washington Post/ABC News poll found that just 37 percent of Americans approve of the way Trump is handling his job, while 59 percent disapprove. In the history of the poll, no American president has had a net negative rating so high in his ninth month in office since Harry Truman in 1945.

But Ryan has the real news: Every Republican on the ballot in 2018 will have Donald Trump as a running mate.

This is where our most respected politicians put aside party politics in service to the nation’s best interests.

So, how do you explain the naked politicization of national security now taking place in both the House and Senate?

The answer begins with President Trump. It is old news that Trump plays loose with facts.

What is new and chilling is witnessing senior Republican senators and congressmen debase themselves to play along with Trump in the name of party loyalty.

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) is the prime example of a politician abandoning an esteemed role on Capitol Hill to become a Trump stooge, gladly sinking in the morass of the president’s “alternative facts.”

In April, Nunes was forced to recuse himself from the investigation of Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election after he backed Trump’s bogus claim that President Obama had “wiretapped” him at Trump Tower.

Nunes made a secret visit to the White House without any other members of his committee to review classified information. He later stood in front of the White House to insist to reporters that Obama’s aides had members of the Trump team under illegal surveillance, if not technically wiretapped. Trump then claimed to be vindicated on the basis of that false claim.

Next, Chairman Nunes introduced the phony scandal of Obama administration national security officials improperly “unmasking” Trump campaign aides talking to Russians. It turned out to be another smokescreen to help Trump distract the public from Russia’s effort to divide the country and help Trump win the White House.

After Nunes recused himself, the House Intelligence Committee’s investigation of Russia matters was supposed to be led by Texas Republican Rep. Mike Conaway Kenneth (Mike) Michael ConawayEx-Rep. Mike Conaway, former aide launch lobbying firm Thompson named top Republican on Agriculture Bottom line MORE.

But last month, Nunes claimed the power of the chair to issue subpoenas for the financial records of Fusion GPS, the research firm. Fusion was the group that hired ex-British secret agent Christopher Steele to produce the infamous dossier purportedly showing Trump’s dealings with Russia and Russia’s desire to control Trump.

Nunes suggested that since the Democrats paid Fusion for opposition research on Trump, it is Clinton who is guilty of colluding with the Russians. And he smeared the FBI and its former head, James Comey, by insinuating they hid facts to help Clinton. Nunes told Laura Ingraham, my Fox News colleague, there “is no possible way the FBI did not know who paid for that dossier.”

But there was nothing to hide.

There is a big difference between paying for opposition research and coordinating with a foreign government while it attacks your political opponent. One is legal and one is not.

To Trump’s delight, Nunes’s empty charges echoed loudly on right-wing websites.

The dirt being kicked up by Nunes fits in with the smokescreen created by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte Robert (Bob) William GoodlatteBottom line No documents? Hoping for legalization? Be wary of Joe Biden Press: Trump's final presidential pardon: himself MORE (R-Va.).

In a July letter, Goodlatte said the special counsel needs to spend time looking at “many actions taken by Obama Administration officials,” and implicitly less time on Russia and Trump.

In the Senate, the story is not much better.

Last week, the Intelligence Committee held important hearings on Russia’s use of social media to manipulate public opinion. U.S. intelligence agencies confirmed earlier this year that the Russian interference was done for the express purpose of helping Trump and hurting Clinton.

In the case of Facebook, some of the anti-Clinton ads were actually paid for with rubles, the Russian currency. Yet, Sen.

Huh?

What does the number of ads in each state have to do with an act of cyberwarfare by Russia to disrupt the American elections?

Not only does Grassley believe the Democrats’ funding of the dossier is a legitimate line of inquiry but he has suggested the Justice Department is involved in a “cover-up.”

A cover-up of what?

As last week’s indictment of two Trump campaign officials and a guilty plea from a third showed, the Special Counsel investigating Russian meddling is steadily building a case.

Meanwhile, Trump has reduced members of Congress to partisan hacks throwing around distractions to deflect the public’s attention, and discredit the FBI and the Special Counsel.

The president’s strategy is evident in his Tweets. After news broke of last week’s indictments, he wrote: “Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign. But why aren't Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus?????”

The president no longer has to rely solely on tweets and fake news to distract the public. Sadly, leading Republicans in Congress have been reduced to Trump enablers.

They are giving him cover in the name of party politics — the country be damned.

21875,Williams,Juan,thehill,"Okay, you are covering the White House. What do you do when a retired four-star general who is now White House Chief of Staff tells lies in an on-the-record briefing?

You stick to the facts, and let readers and viewers realize the alarming dereliction of public trust from a high government official.

Then comes a response from Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary.

ADVERTISEMENT

""If you want to go after General [John] Kelly that's up to you, but I think that if you want to get into a debate with a four-star Marine general, I think that's something highly inappropriate,"" Sanders said.

Let’s review this effort to normalize lying by a White House official.

In a democracy — government by the people and for the people — it is now “highly inappropriate” to tell the truth about a Chief of Staff who tells confirmed falsehoods?

That appears to be President Trump’s opinion. He said in the Oval Office this month that it was “frankly disgusting” that the press is “able to write whatever they want to write.”

Clearly the president has an authoritarian bent when it comes to journalism. His latest comments fit with past labeling of straight news reporters as “dishonest,” “scum” and the “enemy of the American people.”

“I hate some of these people, I hate 'em,” Trump said about reporters at a Michigan rally late last year, a month after he won the presidency. “I would never kill them. I would never do that.”

He then paused smiled and joked, “No, I wouldn't. I would never kill 'em.”

But he did direct tirades at straight news reporters covering his campaign and have his supporters turn to curse and threaten them at rallies.

And Trump did ask his Twitter followers: “With all of the Fake News coming out of NBC and the Networks, at what point is it appropriate to challenge their License? Bad for the country.”

A corrupt President Nixon expressed similar thoughts about going after television stations owned by The Washington Post during the paper’s probe into the Watergate scandal.

Trump’s appetite for shutting down the free press is a reminder of his open admiration for strong men dictators like Russia’s Vladimir Putin, Turkey’s Recep Erdogan and the Philippines’ Rodrigo Duterte. Those strongmen limit the freedom of the press and, in some cases, kill and jail journalists.

Earlier this year, Sen. John McCain John Sidney McCainBush says he doesn't criticize other presidents to avoid risking friendship with Michelle Obama 'Real Housewives of the GOP' — Wannabe reality show narcissists commandeer the party George W. Bush: 'It's a problem that Americans are so polarized' they can't imagine him being friends with Michelle Obama MORE (R-Ariz.) responded to Trump calling the press the “enemy” of the American people by saying that is “how dictators get started.”

Trump, like those dictators, wants to control what the public knows. His goal is to shape reality in order to manufacture public approval of his leadership — which is at an all-time low for a president during his first year.

And as brazen as that strategy is in a country with constitutional protections for freedom of the press, the bigger shock is that it is having some success.

This is especially true among Republicans.

A Vanity Fair/60 Minutes poll from April found 36 percent of Republicans say they believe freedom of the press “does more harm than good.”

Recently, the president called attention to a Politico/Morning Consult poll that found 46 percent of Americans believe the media “fabricates stories” to damage him and his administration. In the same poll, 37 percent said the media does not fabricate and 17 percent said they didn’t know.

Trump’s desire to make the American news media into his version of Pravda — the Russian government’s propaganda sheet — is being criticized even by some on the right.

“This isn’t a game. It isn’t just Trump being Trump. It is a new front in his endless attack on a central pillar of our liberties — a free press,” GOP strategist Rick Wilson, a longtime critic of the president, wrote recently in the Daily Beast.

Bernie Goldberg, a Fox News commentator, wrote this rebuke on his website:

“As with so many things, this president is just plain wrong. Journalists have biases; they make mistakes; sometimes they’re sloppy; and worst of all, sometimes they have a political agenda. But fabricating stories that they know are not true, inventing fake news sources: that is so rare as to be virtually nonexistent.”

Bret Baier, the Fox News anchor and my colleague, said last week that Trump’s criticism of the press is now “way over the top.”

Another colleague, Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace, said in a separate interview he dislikes media personalities who join Trump in “bashing the media, because oftentimes what they are bashing is stuff that we on the news side are doing.”

As a journalist, I have been critical of President Trump. That has led to Twitter taunting against me by Trump. And then there are the countless racist and hateful comments posted to my social media pages by self-described Trump supporters.

When National Public Radio (NPR) fired me in 2010 for speaking my mind about fear of Muslim terrorism, principled conservatives — even those who disliked me — rose to my defense and called NPR out for their censorship and thug tactics to stifle free speech.

When the Obama administration’s press shop waged a campaign to delegitimize Fox News by excluding it from a White House pool interview in 2009, journalists — even those who didn’t like Fox — stood up and said that was wrong.

If people were outraged by what NPR did to me and what the Obama White House did to Fox, then their principles must dictate that they are similarly outraged by Trump’s treatment of the press.

Recall what President Jefferson wrote in his famous letter to Edward Carrington:

“Were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers, or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter.”

How far we’ve come from Jefferson’s wisdom to Trump’s ugly, ignorant threats.

Fake News, indeed.

21877,Williams,Juan,thehill,"“If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. If you like your plan, you can keep your plan.”

For years, Republicans used that exaggerated pledge to thrash the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and President Obama for not keeping his promise. Politifact labeled it as “lie of the year” in 2013.

Politifact will have a lot of lies to choose from this year, given the hurricane of falsehoods and broken promises on healthcare made by President Trump.

ADVERTISEMENT

Who can forget Trump’s oft-repeated promise that “We will repeal and replace ObamaCare, and we will do it very, very quickly”?

ObamaCare has not been repealed. It has not been replaced. Apparently in Trump-speak, “very, very quickly” means sometime during his tenure in office — or more likely, never.

After all, Republicans had seven years to come up with a plan that they promised would provide insurance to more people, more cheaply and with better protections for people with pre-existing conditions.

Here is another broken Trump promise: “We’re going to have insurance for everybody. We’re going to have a healthcare that is far less expensive and far better.”

Well, we are still waiting.

The Republican House can say they passed a plan, but it was inferior to ObamaCare. It left more Americans uninsured — 20 million more, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) — and pressed lower quality care on those who kept coverage.

But lacking a plan of his own, Trump initially endorsed the House plan and held a Rose Garden press conference to celebrate it as “incredibly well-crafted.”

Within a few weeks, the president admitted the bill was “mean” to people in need of healthcare.

Now Trump continues to attack ObamaCare — with no realistic plan to replace it.

Steve Bannon, the president’s former chief strategist, told the conservative Values Voter Summit recently that the president is taking action to “blow up those exchanges.”

Trump says he wants to “let Obamacare implode.”

This is far worse than a mountain of lies. This is subversion of an American law by the president.

Gallup reported Friday that 3.5 million fewer people reported having health insurance through the first nine months of this year as Trump’s threats and GOP congressional inaction provoked widespread uncertainty.

In Pennsylvania, insurance premiums on track for a 7.6 percent hike next year will instead be going up 30 percent thanks to Trump destabilizing the marketplace by ending subsidies to cover insurance for the poor.

The CBO estimates the cost of ending the subsidies will add $6 billion to the deficit in 2018 alone.

The administration attack on health care also includes cutting the ObamaCare enrollment period in half and cutting the advertising budget by 90 percent. And they are cutting money for the Navigator system to help people enroll.

This means fewer healthy people will sign up to balance out enrollment by people with medical needs — a dynamic that will further destabilize the system.

To the extent that the ACA currently has problems, it is the direct result of sabotage by Republican politicians.

Never forget that it was Florida GOP Sen. Marco Rubio Marco Antonio RubioOn The Money: Senate GOP faces post-Trump spending brawl | Senate confirms SEC chief Gensler to full five-year term | Left-leaning group raises concerns about SALT cap repeal Senate GOP faces post-Trump spending brawl 15 Senate Republicans pledge to oppose lifting earmark ban MORE who authored a measure to drain money from “risk corridors” created to protect insurance companies.

The original sin was when GOP governors and state legislatures refused to expand Medicaid, blocking 4 million poor Americans from benefitting from the ACA.

“I would ask what’s conservative about unaffordable premiums,” asked Sen. Lamar Alexander Lamar AlexanderSenate GOP faces retirement brain drain The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by the National Shooting Sports Foundation - CDC news on gatherings a step toward normality Blunt's retirement deals blow to McConnell inner circle MORE (R-Tenn.). “What’s conservative about creating chaos so millions can’t buy health insurance?”

And the American people want ObamaCare in its current form to work.

A poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation taken earlier this month found that a whopping 71 percent of Americans said the Trump administration should “do what they can to make the current health care law work.”

The same KFF poll found that 51 percent of Americans still have a favorable view of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and 40 percent have an unfavorable view.

Why is Trump defying the overwhelming majority of Americans who want the law to succeed?

Last week, Alexander, the chairman of the Senate Health Committee, and the ranking member, Sen. Patty Murray Patricia (Patty) Lynn MurrayHouse passes bill to combat gender pay gap Schumer kicks into reelection mode Democrats target Trump methane rule with Congressional Review Act MORE (D-Wash.), unveiled a bipartisan compromise bill to shore up a key ObamaCare subsidy to benefit low-income Americans for two years.

The bill came in reaction to President Trump’s threats to end these cost sharing reductions (CSRs).

Trump falsely claimed that these were “bailouts” to insurance companies, when they are help for poor people.

“The fact of the matter is the president is trying to sabotage the American health care system, trying to put a gun to the head of our constituents by taking away their health care or raising their costs in order to force us to repeal a bill the American public doesn’t want us to repeal,” Sen. Chris Murphy Christopher (Chris) Scott MurphyWe need laws to stop gun violence, but we need to stop glorifying it, too Senators in the dark on parliamentarian's decision Democratic senators call on Biden to support waiving vaccine patents MORE (D-Conn.) told Fox News Sunday recently.

The real problem here is that while Trump is playing politics he is treating people in need of health care as collateral damage, a cruel afterthought.

There is one true statement from Trump on ObamaCare that will stand the test of time.

“Now, I have to tell you, it’s an unbelievably complex subject,” he said in February. “Nobody knew that health care could be so complicated.”

21880,Williams,Juan,thehill,"An old proverb says a leader with no followers is “only taking a walk.”

If that’s the case, then the strutting President Trump has turned his presidency into a very lonely walk.

A Morning Consult poll released last week found Trump losing support in states he easily carried last year. He is down 23 points in Tennessee since his inauguration in January, down 21 points in Mississippi, down 20 in Kentucky, down 19 in Kansas and down 17 in Indiana.

Overall, 55 percent of the country disapproves of the job he is doing as president, according the most recent RealClearPolitics average. At the three-quarter mark of his first year in office, Trump is the least popular new president in history.

On Capitol Hill, House and Senate Republicans are also walking away from Trump.

In part, this is due to his attacks on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellMcConnell vents over 'fake news' The Hill's 12:30 Report - Presented by Facebook - Tensions rise as U.S. waits for Derek Chauvin verdict Trump looking 'beyond seriously' at 2024 run MORE (R-Ky.) and Speaker Paul Ryan Paul Davis RyanOn The Money: Senate confirms Gensler to lead SEC | Senate GOP to face off over earmarks next week | Top Republican on House tax panel to retire Trump faces test of power with early endorsements Lobbying world MORE (R-Wis.).

Then there are the threats to incumbent Republicans from Stephen Bannon, formerly Trump’s chief strategist.

“Creating a civil war inside the Republican Party may feel good, but I think as a strategy, it is stunningly stupid,” former Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) said of Bannon’s plan.

Speaking on Sean Hannity’s radio show, Gingrich stated the obvious: It would be better for the GOP if the president and his allies spent their time trying to beat incumbent Democratic senators.

Instead, Trump has whipped up a very public feud with Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker Robert (Bob) Phillips CorkerFox News inks contributor deal with former Democratic House member Senate GOP faces retirement brain drain Roy Blunt won't run for Senate seat in 2022 MORE (R-Tenn.). Trump tweeted that Corker lacks “the guts” to seek reelection. Trump also belittled Corker as having “begged” for his endorsement.

Corker denied that, shooting back that it is a “shame the White House has become an adult day care center.” He added that Trump has hurt U.S. foreign relations with his impetuous tweets on world affairs, including “things that are not true.”

Rather than let it go, Trump responded by tweeting: “The Failing @nytimes set Liddle' Bob Corker up by recording his conversation. Was made to sound a fool, and that's what I am dealing with!”

Corker was not “set up” by the Times. A transcript showed the senator stating, “I understand we’re on the record.”

Now, commentators who are open to Trump are starting to walk away from his parade as well.

“Last time I checked, you are the president of the United States, so tweeting out these tacky insults just seems beneath you,” Neil Cavuto of Fox News said on his show last week. “You are running out of friends faster than you are running out of time. You might not like Bob Corker, but a lot of senators do, and you need those senators, sir.”

Even Trump’s personal friends are turning away from him.

Thomas Barrack told The Washington Post he was “shocked” and “stunned” by Trump’s recent comments.

“I tell him all the time: I don’t like the rhetoric,” said Barrack, who has been friends with Trump for decades, since they were both Manhattan real estate developers.

To win back some followers, Trump needs a win.

Polls show Americans favor tax reform. They want a simpler tax structure, fewer brackets and loopholes to be closed. Trump repeatedly promised to deliver tax reform during the campaign.

But once again he is strutting with no one behind him as he abandons tax reform. He is focused on tax cuts for the rich.

Polls show that is not popular.

The New York Times analysis of the tax cut plan concluded it would be a “huge windfall for the wealthiest Americans” and “not directly benefit the bottom third of the population.” Polls show Americans oppose tax cuts for the rich.

A new Quinnipiac poll last week found that 49 percent of voters disapprove of the way Trump is handling taxes and just 37 percent approve.

Trump has also failed to deliver on his campaign promise to build a southern border wall and have Mexico pay for it. He continues to say it will get done. But, again, polls show voters don’t want a wall.

Similarly, Trump seems unaware that a majority of Americans now approve of the Affordable Care Act, also known as ObamaCare, and want its problems fixed so it can continue.

Instead, having failed to win a full repeal of the health-care law from the Republican majority in Congress, he signed an executive order allowing low-cost insurance to be sold across state lines.

That has been tried before and has a sad history of consumer fraud and regulatory confusion.

So it’s no wonder Trump now walks alone. He remains a celebrity figure for his hardcore base. But 10 months into his presidency, Republicans are starting to drift away as he fails to deliver on nearly every major campaign promise he made.

That’s not my opinion. That’s a demonstrable fact.

He once tried to order federal judges to ignore the law of the land and deny marriage licenses to gay couples. He says a Muslim should not be allowed to serve in Congress, simply because of his or her religion.

And in blasphemy that should send Republicans through the roof, Moore blames America for the terror attacks of September 11, 2001. He said they were God’s punishment for the nation’s “perverseness and oppression.”

Moore stands in a line of repugnant GOP candidates, such as former Missouri Rep. Todd Akin. As a candidate for Senate in 2012, Akin claimed that a woman's body is able to distinguish between “legitimate rape” and illegitimate rape, and shut down pregnancies from “legitimate rape.”

The critical difference for Republicans between Akin and Moore is that the party does not want to risk seeing its slim 52-48 majority reduced by one with a possible year-end vote on tax cuts approaching.

Moore’s support for the tax cut is not certain. Cutting the deficit is his priority and the current Republican plan will do the opposite.

There is a bigger picture here, however. Surely the GOP has bigger fish to fry than depending on Moore’s vote in support of a tax cut?

Is a legislative victory so important that it justifies promoting authoritarian government?

Moore’s outrageous statements invite ridicule from fair-minded Americans in all parties who believe in the nation’s founding principles — specifically, that there should be no government-sanctioned religion.

But to laugh at Moore’s attempts to undermine the Constitution is to dismiss the dangers his rhetoric poses.

A recent Huffington Post article revealed the depth of concern:

“A dangerous demagogue,” is how Rev. Barry Lynn of Americans United for Separation of Church and State has described Moore.

Larry Decker, head of the Secular Coalition of America, a group that stays out of politics, felt compelled to make an exception and oppose Moore.

Decker said in a statement that Moore has repeatedly “flaunted his disregard for the Constitution” by asserting “religious beliefs must take precedence over the law.”

The Southern Poverty Law Center, an Alabama-based group, also points to Moore’s disdain for the Constitution and history of “basing judicial opinions on his Biblical beliefs.”

Richard Cohen, president of the law center, has called Moore the “Ayatollah of Alabama,” suggesting that Moore’s goal of replacing the Constitution with the Christian bible is comparable with the view of Islamic extremists who would replace civil law with Sharia law based on the Quran.

But the man who needs to take the lead in repudiating Moore is Trump.

Trump rode a populist tide of rage to win the White House. He opened the door to dark forces in our politics with his vulgar talk about grabbing women by the genitals, and demonizing immigrants and Muslims.

Now he is in danger of being swallowed by the same anti-government populist wave. If Moore wins, he will unleash a tide of Republican candidates for House and Senate seats who care nothing about democracy and have no skill at governing.

Their penchant for waging culture wars and attacking the rule of law will break down the party’s unity on Capitol Hill and make it impossible to gather votes to pass Trump’s legislative agenda.

Recall that Moore’s key support in the primary race came from Steve Bannon, the president’s former top advisor.

Bannon wants to break apart the Republican Party to increase his power as the leader of a populist rebellion.

Moore is his instrument for throwing the GOP into a downward spiral of chaos.

The latest polling from JMC Analytics has Moore at 48 percent support with Democrat Doug Jones at 40 percent. Former Vice President Biden visited Alabama last week to campaign alongside Jones in Birmingham.

Jones is well-known for his years of service as a U.S. attorney and for prosecuting the perpetrators of the 1963 16th Street Baptist Church Bombing in Birmingham.

Both parties — Republican and Democratic — have a moral obligation to do everything they can to ensure Moore does not get to the Senate.

That is why McConnell’s Senate Leadership Fund PAC spent $10 million to defeat Moore in the Alabama primary. Even Trump opposed Moore.

Now Trump, McConnell and the GOP are biting their tongues bloody because they are being told to be pragmatic and focus only on the possible loss of a Senate seat.

Donald Trump was the test case for this new era of shameless politics.

Trump energized dark forces in our politics. Now he has a special responsibility to bring them to heel.

That’s the truth. But the president is still telling his core supporters there is no evidence of Russian interference — an assertion he will cling to, short of investigators finding proof of Russians hacking into voting machines or threatening people outside polling stations.

Trump’s denials continue even as House and Senate committees are finding evidence that Russia used social media to distort the American public’s view of Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, by demonizing her while lionizing Trump.

Twitter has revealed that it “shut down 201 accounts that were tied to the same Russian operatives who posted thousands of political ads on Facebook” during the race, according to The Washington Post.

And The New York Times reported Congressional panels learned that Russians, posing online as Americans during the campaign, used “large-scale automated messaging” on Twitter to “spread false stories and promote news articles about emails…obtained by Russian hackers.”

Earlier, the Times reported a “shadowy Russian company linked to the Kremlin” bought 3,000 Facebook ads that targeted “divisive social issues such as race, gay rights, gun control and immigration.”

The Russians showed special delight in encouraging racial bitterness in the country. They targeted ads at cities rocked by police shootings like Baltimore, Md., and Ferguson, Mo.

This new information goes beyond earlier reports from the U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia paid people to get on social media and defame Hillary Clinton.

In a more sophisticated assault, the Russians encouraged divisions by stoking America’s culture wars.

Their goal was to place stories on social media to anger and energize Trump supporters. They wanted to stir the belief among voters that politically correct mainstream news reports were covering up the threat posed to the country by Clinton, blacks, Muslims, immigrants, and gays.

Yes, a foreign power — Russia — warped our citizens’ voting behavior by poisoning our social media. Name a 2016 campaign that used the same playbook?

Despite the president’s efforts to get people to look away from any evidence of Russian interference in the campaign, the public is alert to the smell of corruption.

A CNN poll taken in September asked voters plainly, “How likely do you think it is that Russian-backed content on Facebook or in other social media affected the outcome of the 2016 presidential election?”

A majority, 54 percent said it was somewhat or very likely; 43 percent said it was not very or not at all likely.

And the public has yet to hear from Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating ties between Trump campaign officials and Russia.

In late July, Mueller’s team tightened its squeeze on former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, reportedly threatening him with an indictment and picking the locks on his home to execute a raid.

The Washington Post reported that Manafort offered “private briefings” on the campaign to a Russian oligarch with close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Mueller is also showing interest in possible obstruction of justice by the president and key members of Trump’s White House.

He is pushing for notes and e-mails from White House officials involved with the firing of former FBI Director James Comey and former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.

He also wants records on a Russian lawyer’s meeting with Donald Trump Jr., the president’s son, during the campaign.

It was one year ago this week when the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) and the Department of Homeland Security issued a rare public statement.

That statement expressed confidence “that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of emails from U.S. persons and institutions, including from U.S. political organizations…to interfere with the U.S. election process.”

That finding was followed up by a more detailed analysis from the DNI, the FBI, the CIA and the NSA.

“Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump. We have high confidence in these judgments,” their January 6, 2017 report stated.

Yes, Mr. President: Russia did help you. Mueller doesn’t seem to care if you label his investigation a “hoax.” And he has yet to be intimidated by your press secretary’s continued attacks on Comey.

The walls are closing in with the Mueller investigation.

The looming question is when will Congressional Republicans begin to distance themselves from Trump?

Will they believe the evidence in front of them or the fake news on their Facebook page?

21883,Williams,Juan,thehill,"There are no two ways about it.

By saying he is willing to “totally destroy” North Korea to defend the U.S. and its allies, President Trump Donald TrumpSt. Louis lawyer who pointed gun at Black Lives Matter protesters considering Senate run Chauvin found guilty as nation exhales US says Iran negotiations are 'positive' MORE last week opened the door to possibly launching a pre-emptive military strike, even a nuclear strike.

Did his threat work?

ADVERTISEMENT

His previous pledge to loose “fire and fury” on North Korea only accelerated the pace of threatening missile launches from “Rocket Man,” as Trump mockingly refers to Kim Jong-Un, the leader of the communist regime.

But in recent weeks, Trump won two unanimous votes in the United Nations Security Council to impose limited sanctions on North Korea. And China has halted its banks from doing business with North Korea.

Early in the year, Trump pressed China to apply even stronger pressure. In July, he admitted to being “very disappointed” with Chinese efforts to cripple Kim’s regime.

Did last week’s speech spur the Chinese to act?

To the contrary, China’s foreign ministry reacted by calling for “restraint” by the U.S.

“Trump’s political chest thumping is unhelpful and it will only push [North Korea] to pursue even riskier policies, because survival of the regime is at stake,” said a column in China’s People’s Daily newspaper.

What about Kim’s response?

The North Korean leader fired back at Trump by calling the president a “mentally deranged U.S. dotard.” That is to say, he dismissed Trump as an elderly, mentally weakened person, and promised to “tame” Trump with “fire.”

At the U.N., there was an equally juvenile put-down of Trump from North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho: “If he was thinking he could scare us with the sound of a dog barking, that’s really a dog dream.”

What about the Russians? Did the speech win new support from them?

“We are witnessing a very dangerous confrontation spiral,” Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said in response. Lavrov described the exchange between Trump and Kim as “military hysteria” and a foreign affairs “disaster.”

What did Americans think?

Congressional Democrats revived their push to restrain the president’s constitutional war powers.

“The more the president talks about the total destruction of North Korea,” Sen. Ed Markey Ed MarkeyLawmakers react to guilty verdict in Chauvin murder trial: 'Our work is far from done' Overnight Energy: Biden reportedly will pledge to halve US emissions by 2030 | Ocasio-Cortez, Markey reintroduce Green New Deal resolution Ocasio-Cortez, Markey reintroduce Green New Deal resolution MORE (D-Mass.) told a reporter, “the more it's necessary for the country and the Congress to have a debate over what the authority of a president is to launch nuclear weapons against another country.""

What about American experts on North Korea? What did they think?

“President Trump has handed the North Koreans the sound bite of the century [with this threat to destroy North Korea]. That footage will be used time and time and time again on North Korea’s state television channel,” Marcus Noland of the Peterson Institute for International Economics told a reporter.

Trump’s aggressive handling of North Korea fits into a pattern.

He is similarly bombastic — and similarly non-strategic — in calling the Iran nuclear deal an “embarrassment,” to the U.S.

No other country has joined Trump in expressing regret over the deal. And he has not really explained why it is a bad deal.

In fact, the other nations who signed the deal, as well as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), have all said Iran is in compliance.

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani fired back at Trump in his own speech to the U.N. General Assembly:

“Ugly, ignorant words were spoken by the US president against the Iranian nation, full of hatred and baseless allegations,” Rouhani said.

The New York Times editorial board noted another problem with Trump’s attack.

“If America withdraws from the agreement, it will outrage the other major powers that are party to the deal — France, Britain, Germany, Russia and China — and give Iran an excuse to resume a full-blown nuclear program.

“Why Mr. Trump would risk that when North Korea’s program is a full-time concern is a mystery,” the Times concluded.

This brings to mind one of Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' Cuba readies for life without Castro Chelsea Clinton: Pics of Trump getting vaccinated would help him 'claim credit' MORE’s most memorable speeches during last year’s campaign.

She said Trump’s foreign policy “ideas aren’t just different, they are dangerously incoherent. They’re not even really ideas, just a series of bizarre rants, personal feuds and outright lies. This is not someone who should ever have the nuclear codes, because it’s not hard to imagine Donald Trump leading us into a war just because somebody got under his very thin skin.”

Nine months into the Trump’s leadership, the unifying theme of his foreign policy is disrespect for any deal made by President Obama and a lack of core principles to shape his own view of the world.

Trump talks about the importance of putting America first but as the Wall Street Journal editorial page noted there is “no substitute for U.S. leadership… if he wants to build a more peaceful world.”

Political commentator Salena Zito famously wrote last year that journalists took Trump literally during the campaign but not seriously, and that his supporters took him seriously but not literally.

In a political campaign, that worked.

On the world stage with a nuclear crisis escalating, it is scary and possibly deadly.

I don’t know if drawing congressional district lines will ever be “sexy.”

Let’s just say that for the first time the issue is smoking hot.

In the past month some Republicans have broken ranks — from Sen. John McCain John Sidney McCainBush says he doesn't criticize other presidents to avoid risking friendship with Michelle Obama 'Real Housewives of the GOP' — Wannabe reality show narcissists commandeer the party George W. Bush: 'It's a problem that Americans are so polarized' they can't imagine him being friends with Michelle Obama MORE (Ariz.) to former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger — to speak out about the breakdown in national politics mostly caused by GOP gerrymandering of congressional districts.

The facts tell a damning story about the damage being done by partisan state legislatures drawing congressional maps with one goal — to grab power for themselves.

In the 2016 election, more than 400 of 435 House races were scored as “safe” for incumbent Republicans and Democrats because of gerrymandering.

That translates into a reality where most members of Congress do not have to listen to anyone in the other party.

Incumbents don’t even have to listen to people in their own party, so long as those people are not extreme voices posing a primary challenge.

The poison fruit produced by gerrymandering paralyses politicians. Nothing gets done in Congress. It contributes to Congress’s high disapproval rating from both Republicans and Democrats. About 72 percent of Americans disapprove of Congress, according to the RealClearPolitics polling average.

Next month, the pressure building in opposition to gerrymandering will be on display at the U.S. Supreme Court.

Wisconsin Republicans are being challenged for drawing state legislative districts to isolate likely Democratic voters — mostly minorities. They successfully created a map of congressional districts in 2011 that assured Republican supermajority control of the state Assembly even as Democrats won more votes.

The Washington Post editorial board described the map drawn by Wisconsin Republicans as an example of “how increasingly powerful technology allows partisan mapmakers to distort representation with ever-greater precision.”

Last week, the importance of the Wisconsin case grew as the U.S. Supreme Court put a hold on a lower court’s ruling on gerrymandering in Texas. It was a 5-4 decision along ideological lines.

The lower court found that the Texas GOP packed minority voters into two congressional districts in a violation of the voters’ constitutional rights to equal representation. The lower court directed the legislature to redraw the state’s congressional maps.

Now the Supreme Court, with the Wisconsin case pending, wants to have its say.

In briefs filed in the Wisconsin case, McCain, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse Sheldon WhitehouseOvernight Energy: Biden reportedly will pledge to halve US emissions by 2030 | Ocasio-Cortez, Markey reintroduce Green New Deal resolution Democrats seek Barrett's recusal from case tied to conservative backers For a win on climate, let's put our best player in the game MORE (D-R.I.) and Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) argue that gerrymandering is effectively killing public trust in the federal government by making it impossible for Congress to compromise and find solutions to national problems.

Another alarm about gerrymandering has been sounded by Schwarzenegger. The Republican has started an online funding campaign to fight partisan packing of congressional districts.

Picking up on the title of one of his movies, Schwarzenegger calls the effort “Terminate Gerrymandering.”

California did away with partisan redistricting in 2010 and gave the task to a nonpartisan independent panel, the California Citizens Redistricting Commission. The former governor said he wants other states to follow the example in order to restore balance to Capitol Hill.

This heightened concern about gerrymandering is also being felt in Florida. Two former Florida Congressmen — Patrick Murphy, a Democrat, and David Jolly, a Republican — are conducting a statewide tour offering their ideas for how to make Washington work again. At the top of their list is gerrymandering reform.

“Democrats and Republicans often fear primary election challenges more than an opponent from the opposite party,” wrote The Tampa Bay Times editorial board after talking with the pair. “That means there is little incentive in Congress to build bipartisan support for anything or to compromise.”

As if on cue, two prominent GOP moderates in the House — Reps. Charlie Dent (Pa.) and Dave Trott (Mich.) — said they would leave Congress at the next election.

Dent, head of The Tuesday Group of moderate House Republicans, explained his decision to walk away by lamenting the loss of the “sensible center” in Congress. That center has been squeezed by gerrymandering.

Meanwhile, Democrats, led by Holder, are for the first time putting money into the fight for honest redistricting.

“The most important turning point for the future of the Democratic Party will take place in 2021 when states redraw their Congressional and state legislative lines,” reads the group’s website.

21886,Williams,Juan,thehill,"“He’s just like he is on TV...He’s an a--hole, but he’s our a--hole.”

That’s how Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.), recently described President Trump to a group of young Republicans, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune.

The disparaging assessment of Trump’s character came days before the president gave his approval for ending Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).

ADVERTISEMENT

President Obama put that policy in place — in the absence of Congressional action on immigration reform — to allow undocumented immigrants who arrived in the U.S. as children to register with the government and build a life without threat of deportation.

Now Trump has those young people and their families in emotional turmoil. Their fears are climbing as Trump ramps up deportations and falsely demonizes immigrants as stealing jobs and hurting the economy.

Having set off so much fright, Trump then promised that none of the young people would be deported until March. He tweeted: “Congress now has 6 months to legalize DACA (something the Obama Administration was unable to do). If they can't, I will revisit this issue!”

Essentially, he pinned the blame on Congress for his decision to go after politically defenseless young people.

If he was sincere, Trump could have asked Congress to act while leaving the Obama rules in place. That would have avoided the current waves of desperation among 800,000 young people trying to do their best in school, on the job and in the military.

But in this test of character, Trump chose to focus only on the political pay-off for himself in fulfilling a campaign pledge he made to appeal to his anti-immigrant political base.

Talk about reducing people to political pawns. This must be the kind of behavior that Hunter had in mind with his insulting description of the president’s character.

But Trump was not done. Once a backlash started — with leaders of the Fortune 500 to Catholic bishops condemning his actions — Trump further displayed his lack of principles by saying he wants to sign a new DACA program into law. So now he believes the young people should be protected?

However, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders added the president will only sign a new plan as part of comprehensive immigration reform.

How cynical can Trump get?

As recently as July he dismissed the chances of Congress passing any immigration reform: “Our country and political forces are not ready yet,” he said.

He also knows Congress has failed to pass any signature legislation since he took office. So, what are the odds?

The big problem is that a GOP effort at immigration reform failed in 2006 and a bipartisan effort failed in 2013. In both cases, conservative talk radio attacked reform as “amnesty” for lawbreakers.

Already, Trump’s call for total immigration reform is generating outrage and skepticism from right-wing talkers.

Conservative columnist Ann Coulter, once one of Trump’s most enthusiastic supporters, lit into the president on Twitter.

“That's great. Sarah Huckabee Sanders says Trump wants COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM! Exactly what he used to denounce,” Coulter tweeted. “Weird how Huckabee Sanders obsessively attacks congress. Trump's not going to get out of betraying voters on the wall by blaming congress.”

While the right remains set against immigration reform, the president is hurting himself with mainstream voters.

A Politico/Morning Consult poll last week found that 58 percent of voters believe DACA kids should be allowed to stay and become eligible for citizenship. Eighteen percent said they should be allowed to stay and become “legal residents.”

According to the poll, support for allowing DACA kids to stay in the country is bipartisan: 84 percent of Democrats and 69 percent of Republicans want the young people here.

The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops said as much in denouncing the president’s decision as “a heartbreaking moment in our history that shows the absence of mercy and goodwill, and a short-sighted vision for the future.”

Writing in the Daily Beast, Frank Sharry, the executive director of America’s Voice, a pro-immigration group, similarly branded Trump’s DACA decision a “national disgrace” on the order of the internment of Japanese-Americans during the Second World War and the refusal to admit Jewish refugees from the Holocaust.

“America is a noble idea, and on Tuesday, President Trump crushed it,” Sharry wrote.

I know how important that “noble idea” is to a child. I came to the U.S. as a four-year-old immigrant from Panama.

My mother took my sister, brother and me to Brooklyn to get an American education and compete in the American economy. We came to America on a banana boat. That’s no joke: We literally came as added freight on a boat carrying bananas bound for New York.

My sister graduated from Harvard; my brother has a law degree; and I’ve been able to write this column and best-selling books, and succeed in American media.

That’s why my heart aches for these children and their families. Their story is my story.

The DACA decision was announced before Trump accepted the first deal on the debt ceiling offered to him by Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer Chuck SchumerLawmakers react to guilty verdict in Chauvin murder trial: 'Our work is far from done' Overnight Health Care: Johnson & Johnson pause seen as 'responsible' in poll | Women turning out more than men for COVID-19 vaccines 'Real Housewives of the GOP' — Wannabe reality show narcissists commandeer the party MORE (D-N.Y.) and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).

Would it surprise anyone if Trump also turns away from Republicans and works with Democrats on a comprehensive immigration deal with amnesty for all undocumented immigrants?

To quote Hunter, “he’s an a--hole.” Though after this week, his most ardent supporters have reason to wonder if he is still their “a--hole.”

21887,Williams,Juan,thehill,"At the 2016 Democratic National Convention, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg got belly laughs with a quip about Donald Trump’s penchant for overstating his wealth and business success.

The “richest thing about Donald Trump is his hypocrisy,” Bloomberg said.

On this Labor Day, after eight months under the man who promised to be “the greatest jobs president that God ever created,” it is time to reframe Bloomberg’s joke.

The richest thing about President Trump Donald TrumpSt. Louis lawyer who pointed gun at Black Lives Matter protesters considering Senate run Chauvin found guilty as nation exhales US says Iran negotiations are 'positive' MORE these days is that so many people are still buying his lies about job creation and wage increases.

It is true that the economy added 1.07 million new jobs in Trump’s first six months in office. It is also true that the GDP expanded by 3 percent in the second quarter.

That is very close to the good news that 1.08 million jobs were created in President Obama’s last six months in office.

“Indeed, no matter how you slice it,” the Washington Post reported last month, “there isn't even one six-month period after mid-2013 during which Obama didn't see at least 1 million jobs created.

“One million jobs in six months is not unprecedented — it has become the norm since the recovery from the Great Recession really kicked in,” wrote Post reporter Aaron Blake.

Remember how candidate Trump disparaged Obama’s strong economic indicators by charging the Federal Reserve with creating a “false economy” under the Democrat.

Has anyone asked him if the Fed is still creating a false economy. If not, exactly when did it stop?

Candidate Trump also promised that he would produce 25 million jobs in 10 years with 4 percent GDP growth. Last week, before news of job growth lagging for the month of August, he went back on that promise by claiming that if he can sustain 3 percent growth it will result in “12 million new jobs.”

But even Trump’s crowing about 3 percent GDP growth is misleading.

There were eight quarters during Obama’s eight years in office during which GDP growth rose above 3 percent. In the third quarter of 2014, growth surged to 5.2 percent.

To be fair, Obama never saw an entire year with three percent GDP growth. But most economists doubt Trump will get there either, on an annual basis, especially if he can’t get tax cuts through Congress.

In fact, 78 percent of registered voters agree with the skeptical economists, telling a Fox News poll last week that Congress is not likely to pass any tax reform this year.

That pessimism extends across party lines: 79 percent of Democrats and 76 percent of Republicans agree that tax reform is unlikely.

Much of Wall Street’s patience with Trump is based on his repeated promise to cut taxes.

So, what happens if that promise proves hollow?

At the moment, even the long heralded promise Trump made to cut the 35 percent corporate tax rate to 15 percent – a pledge he repeated as recently as April – has now reportedly been softened to a 20 or 25 percent rate in talks between White House officials and Congress.

Is that enough of a tax cut to generate new jobs for workers?

The New York Times quoted Michael Linden, policy director at the Roosevelt Institute, as saying that cutting corporate taxes will “have no effect on ordinary workers…Taxation of corporations falls entirely on the owners of capital, and not at all on workers and consumers.”

As for Trump’s promise to cut taxes for working people, the Times reported last week that Gary Cohn, the president’s chief economic advisor, and Steven Mnuchin Steven MnuchinDemocrats justified in filibustering GOP, says Schumer Yellen provides signature for paper currency Biden's name will not appear on stimulus checks, White House says MORE, his Treasury secretary, are considering leaving it at the current level of 39.6 percent.

Trump’s campaign boasts about his singular ability to pump up the economy — boasts made in tandem with dismissals of all that Obama did to get the country out of the Great Recession — call to mind an earlier empty promise made by another Republican.

During the 2012 presidential election, GOP nominee Mitt Romney promised he would get unemployment to 6 percent or lower by the end of his first term.

Obama succeeded in getting unemployment down to 5 percent by the end of 2015.

Yet to this day Republicans refuse to tip their hat to Obama’s record, which also includes saving the auto industry and generating consistent economic growth.

But what happens if Trump goes into total disruption mode and invites a government shutdown? Recent shutdowns have upset voters and damaged the Republican brand.

Now the question is whether the Trump brand is stronger than the GOP brand?

ADVERTISEMENT

At the moment, more than three-quarters of Republicans remain Trump fans.

Even after the violence in Charlottesville, Va. — and the president’s failure to immediately damn the racist and anti-Jewish marchers — Trump can still look at polls and see that he is far more popular than any other Republican.

Trump is betting he can leverage his populist appeal among the rank-and-file to blame the GOP majority in Congress for forcing him to shut the government.

“Believe me, if we have to close down our government, we’re building that wall,” the president told his supporters at a rally in Phoenix last week, as anti-wall, pro-immigrant protesters picketed the venue.

Later, he specifically targeted Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellMcConnell vents over 'fake news' The Hill's 12:30 Report - Presented by Facebook - Tensions rise as U.S. waits for Derek Chauvin verdict Trump looking 'beyond seriously' at 2024 run MORE (R-Ky.) and Speaker Paul Ryan Paul Davis RyanOn The Money: Senate confirms Gensler to lead SEC | Senate GOP to face off over earmarks next week | Top Republican on House tax panel to retire Trump faces test of power with early endorsements Lobbying world MORE (R-Wis.) for failing to do his bidding. They should have raised the debt ceiling as part of a recent Veterans benefits bill, as he “requested,” Trump tweeted.

“Could have been so easy – now a mess,” was the president’s damning conclusion.

“Trump Divorces the GOP Congress,” was the headline on an editorial in the Wall Street Journal last Friday.

“They physical wall is Mr. Trump’s personal preoccupation,” the Journal’s conservative editorial page editors wrote. “He can veto a bill without it but then he’d be responsible for the shutdown.”

Trump appears happy to do just that.

He can tell his supporters that enough-is-enough with do-nothing Republicans and obstruction from Democrats. He can portray himself as a hero, daring to take the risk of a shutdown to “drain the swamp.”

But how will that heroic image hold up if federal workers are told to stay home and benefit checks don’t go out?

The president’s men are trying to stop him from playing Russian roulette with a government shutdown — especially if it is being done to build a wall.

Polls show a large, clear majority of Americans oppose building the wall. Most Americans also oppose shutting down the government.

But the odds of a shutdown are increasing.

""Presidential approval continues to decline, and is the lowest for any first-term president in his first year in office,"" top Goldman Sachs economist Alec Phillips wrote in a memo to clients earlier this month. ""Low approval ratings raise legislative risks. In the near term, we believe there is a 50% chance of a brief government shutdown, as the president seeks to solidify support among his base by embracing more controversial positions.""

The president’s team is not as confident as Trump that any good will come of a shutdown.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin Steven MnuchinDemocrats justified in filibustering GOP, says Schumer Yellen provides signature for paper currency Biden's name will not appear on stimulus checks, White House says MORE, a former Goldman executive, appeared alongside McConnell last week and gave little attention to the president’s call for a wall. Instead, he assured Republicans there would be no government shutdown brought on by a failure to raise the debt ceiling.

“We’re going to get the debt ceiling passed,” Mnuchin predicted confidently. “Everybody understands, this is not a Republican issue, this is not a Democrat issue. We need to be able to pay our debts.”

McConnell agreed: “America is not going to default, and we’ll get the job done in conjunction with the secretary of the Treasury,” he said.

Ryan shares McConnell’s view: “I don’t think a government shutdown is necessary, and I don’t think most people want to see a government shutdown, ourselves included,” he said at a news conference in Oregon last week.

That leaves open the question of whether Republican voters agree.

Already some House Republicans seem reluctant to push back against Trump.

House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) is predicting that as part of a debt ceiling resolution, Congress will “find at least a billion or so dollars to make sure that we start the wall.”

Meanwhile, Democrats see political gold in a bloody intramural GOP fight over the debt ceiling this fall.

“Democrats have made clear we will not support funding for President Trump’s misguided, ineffective border wall,” Rep. Joseph Crowley (N.Y.), who chairs the House Democratic Caucus, told The Hill last week. “If President Trump and Republicans insist on wasting taxpayers’ money, they will be to blame for any government shutdown.”

For all his bravado, Trump knows he has not delivered the “winning” that he promised his base. That is why he held the Phoenix rally so quickly after Charlottesville. The latest polls show Trump losing swing votes in key states such as Pennsylvania and Michigan.

So, now we find out if Republican voters will abandon Congressional Republicans in order to stand by a man who sees himself as bigger than the GOP: Trump.

Let the fall games begin.

That ongoing fight has a few in the Republican majority on Capitol Hill privately raising the prospect of a formal censure of Trump over his response to the violence in Charlottesville, Va.

Censure of a Republican president by a Republican Congress remains highly unlikely. The prospect of impeachment or a concerted effort to pressure the president to resign over broader issues — including allegations of collusion with Russia during his campaign, or the suggestion he could have obstructed justice by his firing of FBI director James Comey — is even more remote.

Even so, fear of the populist president is giving way to anger among Senate Republicans. First of all, they can’t explain the politics of Trump going after the Republican leader of the Senate. Why is the president opening the question of whether McConnell should resign?

Why is the president delighting in taking down Republican senators? In recent days, he has labeled Sen.

Trump will need votes from these senators to get anything done in Congress. Even now, almost none of them are willing to go on television to defend the president.

McConnell’s strategy — walking away from fights with the president when possible — is an act of restraint that can only last so long.

At the moment, McConnell sees more advantage in not fighting back.

For now, he is keeping his distance from the president to protect his Senate majority. For example, McConnell did not name Trump when he issued a statement on Trump’s appalling failure to assign blame to the neo-Nazis and white supremacists he has stirred into violent action.

But there is no way for McConnell to look the other way on special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into possible ties between Trump and Russia. Again, the president is damaging the GOP brand ahead of the 2018 elections.

In the short term, McConnell also wants to protect his GOP caucus from the president’s failed legislative agenda and the potentially ugly mud-fight in September over the budget, the debt ceiling and an infrastructure spending bill.

McConnell’s shield against the president first came into view when the majority leader kept the Senate in pro forma session over the August vacation break.

That move blocked the president from making a recess appointment of a new attorney general. And it gave McConnell added favor with Capitol Hill Republicans by making it harder for Trump to fire former senator and current attorney general Jeff Sessions Jefferson (Jeff) Beauregard SessionsGarland rescinds Trump-era memo curtailing consent decrees Biden picks vocal Trump critics to lead immigration agencies The Hill's Morning Report - Biden assails 'epidemic' of gun violence amid SC, Texas shootings MORE.

Next, McConnell gave his Senate Republicans an answer to Trump’s self-serving rants about Congress’s failure to repeal ObamaCare.

“Our new president, of course, has not been in this line of work before,” McConnell said earlier this month in a speech. “And I think he had excessive expectations about how quickly things happen in the democratic process.”

Trump had every reason to let McConnell’s words roll off his back. But the president could not help firing back.

“Senator Mitch McConnell said I had ‘excessive expectations,’ but I don't think so,” Trump tweeted. “After 7 years of hearing Repeal & Replace, why not done?”

And Trump kept punching: “Mitch, get back to work and put Repeal & Replace, Tax Reform & Cuts and a great infrastructure Bill on my desk for signing. You can do it!” the president said in another jab via Twitter.

Trump is betting that he can turn Republican voters against McConnell because the GOP’s base sees McConnell as part of the establishment it sent Trump to D.C. to blow up.

Trump is getting support from conservative radio commentators in his war against McConnell.

My Fox News colleague Sean Hannity tweeted at McConnell, “YOU are a WEAK, SPINELESS leader who does not keep his word and you need to Retire!""

A July PPP poll found that voters give McConnell an 18 percent job approval rating and a 58 percent disapproval rating. And the whole Congress had a 75 percent disapproval poll number.

So even as disapproval of Trump’s job performance has risen to 55 percent, according to the Real Clear Politics average, he found short-term satisfaction in throwing dirt on McConnell in the hope of looking good by comparison.

It may be working with some GOP voters, but so far, McConnell’s GOP caucus is sticking with the Kentuckian.

“Passing POTUS's legislative agenda requires a team effort,” Sen. John Cornyn John CornynOvernight Health Care: Johnson & Johnson pause seen as 'responsible' in poll | Women turning out more than men for COVID-19 vaccines Cornyn places hold on Biden Medicaid nominee Stacey Abrams: Parts of new Georgia voting law have racist intent MORE of Texas, the number two Republican in the Senate, tweeted in McConnell’s defense. “No one is more qualified than Mitch McConnell to lead Senate in that effort.”

Let’s not forget it was McConnell who used the so-called “nuclear option” to hand Trump the only real win of his presidency by confirming Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.

And that was after McConnell kept a Supreme Court seat open for a year by refusing to hold hearings, much less a vote, on Merrick Garland, then-President Obama’s nominee to fill Antonin Scalia’s seat on the bench.

That open seat gave Trump a strong campaign talking point — his promise to appoint a conservative to the court.

It wasn’t too long ago that Republicans lived by Ronald Reagan’s 11th commandment: Thou shall not speak ill of a fellow Republican. But Trump, beginning with his name-calling during the GOP primaries, did away with all political niceties.

That’s why the Trump-McConnell version of the “Survivor” reality show will be topic number one on every media political shout-fest this fall.",-1,http://thehill.com/opinion/juan-williams/347270-juan-williams-mcconnell-and-trump-headed-for-showdown
21891,Williams,Juan,thehill,"Thanks, Obama!

That’s the public message President Trump needs to send immediately to his predecessor to thank him for low unemployment and record stock market performance during Trump’s first seven months in the White House.

Instead, Trump is busy boasting about a “Trump Bump.”

ADVERTISEMENT

Trump tweeted recently: “Highest stock market EVER, best economic numbers in years, unemployment lowest in 17 years, wages rising, border secure: No WH chaos.”

I will leave the amazing claim of no chaos in the Trump White House to others. Please direct inquiries to Anthony Scaramucci, who spent a few days as White House communications director.

But the first part of the tweet, suggesting Trump has jumpstarted a moribund economy, is Pinocchio-level astounding.

Going into what is shaping up to be a turbulent fall season — with his approval rating at historic lows near 38 percent and the Russia probe now in the hands of a grand jury — Trump is grasping for any positive news.

The good economy has become his most frequent boast to assure his base that he is delivering something for them.

But recall that candidate Trump dismissed official reports of strong economic numbers when they came under Obama by saying the Federal Reserve was creating a “false economy” and the stock market was rising due to an “artificial” bubble.

As recently as December, Trump said the unemployment rate was “total fiction.” During the campaign, Trump told voters “don’t believe those phony numbers when you hear 4.9 percent or 5 percent” and “the number is probably 28, 29, as high as 35. In fact, I even heard recently 42 percent.”

Did he really say unemployment had reached 42 percent? Yes, and Politifact rated the claim as a “pants on fire” outright lie.

Now that Trump is president, he is telling his voters that the numbers are real. These are the same economic numbers from the same source calculated in the same way. Is it any wonder Americans question the president’s honesty and some question his sanity?

Let’s review some hard facts:

The unemployment rate for June 2017 was 4.4 percent. In December 2016, the last full month of the Obama administration, it was 4.7 percent.

Contrast those numbers to the unemployment rate in February 2009, the first full month of the Obama administration: 8.3 percent. Now that is the triumph of a good economic policy. It is an indisputable reality that the unemployment rate decreased during President Obama’s time in office.

Thanks, Obama.

Honest politics requires context. The context for America’s current economic performance is that the national economy was in danger of going over the edge in 2009, into a second Great Depression.

Trump’s distortion of the stock market’s rise is a similar story of presenting numbers without context.

Sorry, President Trump, but the fact is that when President Obama took office the Dow Jones Industrial Average was around 8,000. When he left office, it was on the verge of 20,000. The NASDAQ more than tripled under Obama’s tenure.

Any subsequent increase in market averages is based on the tremendous rise that took place under Obama.

Thanks, Obama.

Obama also saved the American auto industry, overhauled the student loan industry, and provided health insurance to 20 million Americans who previously did not have it.

Recently, Trump boasted that 2.6 percent growth in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is “a number that nobody thought they’d see for a long period of time.”

But Obama had 13 quarters of higher GDP growth, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. In fact, the New York Times noted that “since the beginning of the recovery in 2010, growth has averaged 2.1 percent.”

Thanks, again.

Trump recently traveled to Wisconsin to associate himself with the Taiwanese company Foxconn’s decision to build a plant there and employ 3,000 people. But the state is giving the company a $3 billion package of incentives. And the same company promised to build a $30 million plant in Pennsylvania four years ago, but nothing has come of that pledge.

After winning the election, Trump traveled to Indianapolis to celebrate Carrier’s promise not to move jobs to Mexico after the state and local government gave the company tax breaks. But Carrier has since announced a plan to lay off 600 workers in August.

A majority of voters are not buying Trump’s economic spin.

A July poll from Quinnipiac University found that 52 percent of voters disapprove of Trump’s handling of the economy. He has a fading 41 percent approval rating for his handling of the economy.

A cynic might give Trump and his GOP Congress credit in the sense that their failure to do anything prevented the reversal of the economic gains made by the Obama administration.

That pattern may continue.

On Capitol Hill, Speaker Paul Ryan Paul Davis RyanOn The Money: Senate confirms Gensler to lead SEC | Senate GOP to face off over earmarks next week | Top Republican on House tax panel to retire Trump faces test of power with early endorsements Lobbying world MORE (R-Wis.) has made it clear that any tax cuts have to be revenue neutral — in other words, Trump will have to cut spending to prevent the deficit from exploding with lower tax rates for corporations and the rich.

As a result, the prospect for passing tax cuts grows dimmer by the day.

Despite seven months of the Trump administration, the Obama economy is still going strong. It is so strong that Trump wants to claim it as his own.

Thanks, Obama.

Trump won the state by almost 30 points last November. But the president is dividing his Alabama supporters with steady attacks on one of the state’s favorite sons: Sessions.

Trump is also at the center of two gubernatorial races — in Virginia and New Jersey. Trump lost both states in the presidential election. Democrats now delight in stirring up their base by putting Trump’s face on every Republican opponent.

The question in Alabama, however, is which candidate for the GOP nomination is the most pro-Trump.

Luther Strange, the Republican appointed to hold the seat until the December general election, is running as a GOP primary candidate who “strongly supported our president from Day 1.”

He is attacking one opponent, Rep. Mo Brooks Morris (Mo) Jackson BrooksHouse rejects GOP resolution to censure Waters The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Facebook - All US adults can get vaccine; decision Friday on J&J vax Republicans fret over divisive candidates MORE, for saying during the presidential campaign that Trump voters would come to “regret” backing the billionaire.

Normally Brooks, a Tea Party, right-wing firebrand who is a vocal member of the House Freedom Caucus, could attack Strange, the state’s former attorney general, as an establishment Republican. But with Trump attacking Sessions, a leader of the state’s GOP establishment, Brooks is torn between supporting Sessions or Trump.

A private poll made public last week found Strange leading the race with 33 percent of the vote; another pro-Trump candidate, former judge Roy Moore, with 26 percent; and Brooks in last place with 16 percent.

Brooks has offered to drop out of the race if Sessions wants to resign his post and run for his old seat again. The primary will be held August 15, with a possible run-off in September.

In the Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial races, the polarizing dynamic around Trump is different: Democrats are stigmatizing their GOP opponents as Trump acolytes.

Virginia’s Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam, the Democrats’ nominee, is running an advertisement calling Trump a “narcissistic maniac.”

“I stand by what I said,” Northam said at a debate held earlier this month. “I believe our president is a dangerous man. I think he lacks empathy. And he also has difficulty telling the truth, and it happens again and again.""

The Republican candidate, former RNC chairman Ed Gillespie, who is roughly tied with Northam at 44 percent support in the polls, countered that the Democrat’s attack would make it more difficult to work with Trump on behalf of Virginia.

“What are you going to do — call the White House, ‘Please put me through to the narcissistic maniac’?” Gillespie quipped.

Gillespie has already been torched by Trump politics. Despite a big money advantage, he came within 1.2 percentage points of losing the GOP primary to Corey Stewart, a diehard Trump supporter who accused Gillespie of not being loyal to the president.

Gillespie “didn’t show up at a single Trump rally. Not one,” Stewart railed against Gillespie in a primary debate. He also alleged that, after a tape of Trump speaking in crude terms about women was uncovered, “Ed was one of the first Republicans in the country to kick him when he was down, to condemn him.”

Now Gillespie needs to make sure Stewart’s Trump-loving voters turn out for him in November. But he also has to appeal to moderates and independents in a state Clinton won by five points.

Meanwhile, Gillespie has refused to say if he supports Trump firing special prosecutor Robert Mueller. Gillespie said he is more focused on local issues in Virginia.

Trump is also a major factor in New Jersey’s gubernatorial race. Clinton won New Jersey by 14 points.

The difficulties Republicans face in New Jersey are ratcheted up due to incumbent Gov. Chris Christie’s (R) rapid fall in the polls. Christie was also a strong, public voice for Trump.

Those factors are hurting Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno, the GOP’s nominee.

A July Monmouth University poll found Democrat Phil Murphy leading Guadagno, 53 percent to 26 percent, with 14 percent undecided.

Guadagno has tried to distance herself from Trump. After the infamous tape where he was heard bragging about being able to grab women by their genitals, Guadagno broke with Christie and declared she would not vote for Trump.

“No apology can excuse away Mr. Trump’s reprehensible comments degrading women,” Guadagno wrote on Twitter. “We’re raising my 3 boys to be better than that.”

Democrat Murphy has turned his campaign into part of the ‘Resist’ Trump movement. He promises that, with him as governor, New Jersey will be “a state where we draw a line against Donald Trump.”

Murphy, President Obama’s ambassador to Germany has suggested there are parallels between Trump’s rise and the rise of Adolf Hitler in 1920s Germany.

“I’m a modest student of German history,” Murphy told voters at a town hall earlier this year. “And I know what was being said about somebody else in the 1920’s. And you could unfortunately drop in names from today into those observations from the 1920’s….”

Elections in odd-numbered years are often a harbinger of the following years’ midterm elections.

When Republicans Christie and Bob McDonnell won the New Jersey and Virginia gubernatorial races in 2009, it foreshadowed the Tea Party wave election of 2010.

When Democrats Jon Corzine and Tim Kaine Timothy (Tim) Michael KaineSenators in the dark on parliamentarian's decision Progressives put Democrats on defense Senators reintroduce bill to block NATO withdrawal MORE won those races in 2005, it foreshadowed the Democrats’ takeover of Congress in 2006.

That would mean the best approach to the 2018 congressional races is to go bold against President Trump, who is currently struggling with record-low approval numbers and a failure to get a major bill through Congress in his first six months.

But last week, a Washington Post/ABC News poll found that 51 percent of registered voters said Trump is “not a factor” in how they will vote in the 2018 midterm elections.

Only 24 percent of registered voters said they planned to vote in opposition to Trump. And that is countered by the 20 percent who say they will go to the polls solely to support congressional Republicans backing Trump.

That split — a 4-point deficit for Trump — is smaller than the 10-point disadvantage for President Obama going into the 2014 midterms or the 14-point disadvantage for President Bush going into the 2006 midterms.

“A majority of Americans see the Democratic Party as ‘just standing against Trump’ rather than presenting a coherent alternative — a stance that may not be enough to get voters to the polls next year,” according to an ABC News report on the poll.

That is bad news for Democrats, who historically suffer a major fall-off in voter turnout during non-presidential, midterm elections — most notably among younger voters as well as black and Latino voters.

The good news for Democrats is that the party’s congressional leaders, Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer Chuck SchumerLawmakers react to guilty verdict in Chauvin murder trial: 'Our work is far from done' Overnight Health Care: Johnson & Johnson pause seen as 'responsible' in poll | Women turning out more than men for COVID-19 vaccines 'Real Housewives of the GOP' — Wannabe reality show narcissists commandeer the party MORE (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), are this week introducing a legislative agenda to give voters reasons to back Democrats.

The new plan presents Democrats as the party creating jobs; offering job training; keeping healthcare costs low while making college affordable; and pushing higher wages including a hike in the minimum wage. The plan is called: “A Better Deal — Better Skills, Better Jobs, Better Wages.”

This is the “strong, bold, sharp-edged and common sense economic agenda” Schumer promised in a television interview last month.

Sen. Sanders (I-Vt.), who is the most popular national politician with a 57 percent approval rating, has been calling for this kind of clear, Trump-free branding to convince voters that Democrats are “on the side of the working class of this country.”

But what about the thrill that comes from fighting Trump? What about the blood sport of responding to his bullying tweets and his name-calling; and giving attention to the ongoing probe into his campaign’s alleged ties to Russia in the 2016 race?

That fight is a “fool’s errand,” according to Steve Phillips, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress.

Writing in The New York Times, Phillips argued Democrats are never going to win over Trump voters. He sees only a waste of time in trying to win “support from conservative, white working-class voters susceptible to racially charged appeals.”

Phillips favors a focus on getting Democrats who voted for Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' Cuba readies for life without Castro Chelsea Clinton: Pics of Trump getting vaccinated would help him 'claim credit' MORE last year to come out for the midterms — with specific attention to black voters whose turnout rates dropped in 2016.

The opposing view calls for Democrats to reach out to Trump voters.

Democrats have to “move to the center and reject the siren calls of the left, whose policies and ideas have weakened the party,” according to Mark Penn, who served as chief strategist in Clinton’s 2008 run for the presidential nomination.

This debate about the right message and the right audience for congressional Democrats going into 2018 extends to uncertainty about the right candidates to run for president in 2020.

Who would be on the perfect ticket for Democrats to keep Trump from a second term in the White House?

Following the National Governors Association meeting this month, two Democratic governors — Montana’s Steve Bullock and Rhode Island’s Gina Raimondo — are getting a lot of attention in Washington.

They are not political firebrands like Sanders or Warren. They don’t go on liberal political talk shows.

But they have established themselves as solution-oriented politicians able to win with Democrats while attracting support from independents and Republicans.

Bullock, working with a Republican legislature in a state Trump won by 20 points, expanded Medicaid as part of the Affordable Care Act and was able to increase the state budget for higher education.

Raimondo had similar success in expanding the Democrats’ base. She raised the minimum wage, brought new jobs to the state and is pushing to give students tuition-free education at state colleges and universities.

But can back-to-basics politicians excite the liberal base of the party in the Trump era?

Even with a forward-looking political agenda on Capitol Hill, emerging stars among the governors and Trump’s never-ending troubles, the Democrats are still playing second fiddle to the daily Trump eruptions in the press.

But for the first time since the shock of last November, the Democrats’ search for the right message and right messenger is finally fired up and ready to go.

Who is annoying the president with evidence that the Russians spread fake news and hacked email accounts to turn voters against his opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' Cuba readies for life without Castro Chelsea Clinton: Pics of Trump getting vaccinated would help him 'claim credit' MORE?

The sources are intelligence agents of the United States — the men and women who are the president’s frontline for information on threats to the U.S. from terrorists and hostile nations.

Since the end of World War Two, presidents of both parties have given special consideration to the people who put their lives on the line to provide sensitive, often secret information to the president and Congress. Historically, presidents defend intelligence agents, even when they use excessive tactics to get facts.

Trump does not see it that way. In his first six months in office, he has displayed unprecedented presidential disdain for the intelligence community.

Just before his inaugural, he tweeted that U.S. intelligence agencies were engaged in tactics similar to those of “Nazi Germany.” He accused them of being behind leaks to reporters that led to news stories about Russia’s efforts to help his campaign.

Trump’s extreme attacks on intelligence officials are in line with his outbursts against the media. In both instances, he is intent on diminishing claims that his election victory is not legitimate because Russia, a hostile foreign power, wanted him in office to advance its own agenda — specifically ending economic sanctions.

But when it comes to publicly trashing the people working at the CIA, the FBI and the NSA, Trump is making history. No president has attacked the entire intelligence community to serve his own political interests.

Two weeks ago, the president reopened old wounds when he reminded reporters at a press conference in Poland that America’s best intelligence agencies failed when they said there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.

Why did he bring that up? Once again, his goal was to diminish the value of their finding that Russia wanted him to win the 2016 election.

“Well, I think it was Russia and I think it could have been other people and other countries,” the president said. “It could have been a lot of people interfered.” He has previously said China or a fat man on a basement bed could have had a hand in meddling in the election.

Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.), in a CNN interview after the president skewered the intelligence community at the Poland news conference, said flatly, “the president is not telling the truth when he says no one really knows if Russia engaged in the cyberattack last year. Russia did it. There is no rational person who looked at evidence and concluded otherwise.”

The president continued his attack on intelligence agencies’ findings last week even after the disclosure that his son, Donald Trump Jr., agreed to meet with a Russian lawyer — having being told in an email message that she had information damaging to Clinton that came from the Russian government.

Former NSA and CIA director Michael Hayden said Trump Jr.’s emails were “game-changing”

""The overall American intelligence community, with a high confidence in judgment, [says] the Russians interfered in the American election,"" Hayden said in a television interview.

A Suffolk University/USA Today poll taken in late June — before these emails were revealed — found that 73 percent of voters agree Russia’s meddling in our election was either a “very serious” or “somewhat serious” issue (55 and 18 percent, respectively).

That public perception is rooted in the January report from the office of the Director of National Intelligence — based on reporting done by the CIA, FBI and NSA — that concluded with “high confidence” that Putin “ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election…to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency.”

And despite Trump’s denials, the intelligence report added that Putin had a “clear preference for President-elect Trump.”

Last week, McClatchy’s Washington bureau reported Congressional committees as well as the FBI are looking at whether the Trump campaign “helped guide Russia’s sophisticated voter targeting and fake news attacks,” on the Clinton campaign.

Adam Schiff Adam Bennett SchiffGroups see new openings for digging up dirt on Trump Overnight Defense: Administration says 'low to moderate confidence' Russia behind Afghanistan troop bounties | 'Low to medium risk' of Russia invading Ukraine in next few weeks | Intelligence leaders face sharp questions during House worldwide threats he Hillicon Valley: Biden administration sanctions Russia for SolarWinds hack, election interference MORE (D-Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told reporters Peter Stone and Greg Gordon of McClatchy that he is probing how the Russians knew the best timing and best targets for placing damaging stories, many fake, about Clinton on social media for voters in key states.

Trump calls these probes “the single greatest witch hunt of a politician in U.S. history.”

The president’s distaste for the independence of the intelligence community’s work was evident in his May dismissal of James Comey as FBI director. Trump derided Comey as “crazy” and a “real nut job,” to top Russian government officials during a later meeting in the Oval Office.

Speaking at an empowerment panel at the annual festival staged by the black women’s magazine Essence, Waters also said that an earlier comment from Carson, in which he drew a parallel between the aspirations of black slaves and the hopes of people who voluntarily immigrated to America, was evidence that he “doesn’t know the difference between an immigrant and a slave.”

Yes, Waters was throwing around strong words to stir up mocking laughter at the expense of President Trump’s only black cabinet secretary.

But beyond the trash talk there is an important political debate for black America.

The heart of Waters’ anger at Carson goes to what he said about poverty in a May radio interview on SiriusXM with host Armstrong Williams.

Carson infuriated Waters when he said: “I think poverty to a large extent is also a state of mind.”

Given the high poverty rate among black Americans (24 percent), especially black children (near 40 percent), Waters reacted with alarm. Poverty is not just a mental state to her. She knows the horrid reality of poverty in her Los Angeles district.

Overall, more than 43 million Americans lived in poverty in 2015 — about 13.5 percent of the population, according to the Census Bureau. That number includes over 14 million children — about 20 percent of all American children. For context, the 2017 Federal Poverty Level (FPL) for a family of four was a combined income of just $24,600.

But Carson was not putting down the poor. He grew up in poverty in Detroit as the son of a single mother. He cares about poor people and speaks with evangelical passion about the power of personal responsibility — God, family values, education and hard work — to push young people out of poverty.

In a time of political polarization, Carson’s belief in personal responsibility puts him at odds with people who point at the capacity of “systemic poverty” to defeat even the smartest, most ambitious young person.

Those voices say that a combination of broken families, bad neighborhoods, bad schools and the persistence of racism can snare anyone and keep them on the margins of society, regardless of their personal character.

Rep. Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.) offered this comment on Twitter after Carson’s radio interview: “States of mind: Happy. Sad. New York. Not a state of mind — Systemic poverty.”

Another Twitter comment read: “Poverty is a state of mind, Ben Carson? Tell that to a kid who can’t afford lunch for school or won’t have anything to eat for dinner.”

A letter to the New York Times said Carson’s “state of mind” comment opened the door to policies that hurt the poor. His thinking allows congressional Republicans to ignore racism “and other institutionalized drivers of poverty,” the letter-writer said, while denying “health care, education and social services to millions of Americans.”

And sociologists told reporters that Carson’s approach denigrated people in poverty by suggesting that they lacked the initiative, good values and work ethic of people with money.

But the academics and political critics are missing a key point.

Liberal or conservative, we can all agree it is important to encourage anyone living in poverty to look for a way out, to find the path to a better life.

If the poor wait on the government to end their poverty, they will be waiting a long time.

I have known Carson for several years. My son, Raffi, is his press secretary. But my view, which is sympathetic to Carson’s description of poverty as a “state of mind,” is not a result of loyalty to him. It is rooted in a desire to see more people get out of poverty.

I grew up in Section 8 housing and have experienced being poor.

Social science data confirms that the best ways for people of all colors to avoid poverty is to stay in school as long as possible and graduate, take even a menial job to build a resumé and connections, don’t marry until you have a career on track and don’t have a child until you are married. People who follow that prescription have close to zero chance of living in poverty.

That is no recent finding. I wrote about it in my 2006 book, “ENOUGH: The Phony Leaders, Dead-End Movements, and Culture of Failure That Are Undermining Black America — and What We Can Do about It.”

Given the persistent high poverty rate in black America, I think major black voices should join Carson in yelling out that there are steps individuals can take — and advise their children to take — to win their personal fight against poverty.

Conservatives who favor small government are currently intent on limiting federal entitlement programs. Trump’s budget includes harsh cuts that would make poverty worse for many – including the $6.2 billion proposed cuts to HUD.

Those conservatives are deluding themselves if they think big cuts are going to help the poor.

But liberals are deluding themselves if they don’t see the good in Carson offering hope to people in need of inspiration and looking to make a way to success.

Republicans and Democrats need to support the inspiring message that fired up the growth of the black middle class a generation ago: We Shall Overcome.

21898,Williams,Juan,thehill,"Conservatives are right to skewer liberals as “snowflakes” who need to go back to their “safe spaces” when the left starts promoting codes that limit free speech.

That critique is largely aimed at college students who don’t want to listen to controversial speakers.

ADVERTISEMENT

But on this July 4, as the nation celebrates our founding principles, there is a bigger threat to free speech than overly sensitive liberals.

In our politically divided nation, it is too often being left to big corporations to decide the limits of acceptable political speech.

And those companies are concluding that defending free speech is not worth their time if it damages their brand and their stock price.

On this Independence Day, ask yourself what the authors of the Declaration of Independence — men heavily influenced by the works of Shakespeare and Roman philosophers — might have said about corporate sponsors like Delta and Bank of America pulling their support for the Public Theater’s production of Julius Caesar in New York City.

Those big companies ran away from free speech and artistic freedom when far-right talk radio and websites produced a swarm of social media outrage suggesting that the assassination of a Trump-like Caesar could promote violence against the real President Trump.

Top executives at those companies failed to notice that the play was written in 1599. They also ignored that a recent production of the play had the lead character played by a black actor who looked and acted a lot like President Obama. He, too, was assassinated. Yet no sponsors pulled their financial support from that show.

But in these politically polarized days, the billion-dollar brands are skittish about being trolled online by provocateurs on the right and left.

By the way, the takeaway from that play is a warning that stands the test of time about the danger of political violence and its unintended consequences.

The same dynamic — featuring big corporations instead of citizens deciding the limits of free speech — is now also at play in the fight over the value of opinion shows presented on our ideologically divided media outlets.

The right and the left now press big companies to pull advertising from media personalities with whom they disagree.

They are counting on timid executives to focus only on their profits without giving a thought to the basic American tenet of free speech.

I am not asking corporations to spend a dime on the racists, the women-haters, the gay-bashers, liars or people calling for violence. They deserve to be shunned.

But let’s stop and consider how corporate bosses — with the power of their advertising dollars — have taken charge of determining acceptable speech in America.

Last month, I took my family to the Washington D.C. Capital Pride Parade.

The parade was the biggest and best in years. It was a rainbow-flag-waving celebration of the progress made by the LGBT community in terms of marriage equality and broad social acceptance.

Several parade watchers pointed out to me that some of the corporations whose logos were now proudly placed on floats had not long ago fired those who were open about their homosexuality.

More than a few of these companies stood silent as states passed anti-gay laws. They thought standing up for equal rights might be bad business.

But as the culture shifted on gay rights, those same corporations hopped on the rainbow bandwagon.

I see the critics’ point.

But just as the Supreme Court changed the laws to protect gay marriage, I am glad to see corporations take a stand for individual rights.

The heart of the issue is sincerity. Are these firms sincere in promoting gay rights or do they have their fingers in the air, checking comments on social media and fearing for their stock price with no regard for the principle of protecting constitutional rights, even when they are unpopular?

Controversy about free speech on a politically sensitive subject is a storm I know all too well.

Seven years ago, I was fired by NPR for telling Bill O’Reilly, then of Fox News, that since the September 11 attacks I get nervous whenever I see people dressed in Muslim garb boarding an airplane.

By acknowledging my personal fears, I was pointing out the need to speak freely and have honest debate in a time of crisis. I was making the case for tolerance — and for avoiding the kind of fear-mongering that might lead to zoning restrictions against a particular religion’s house of worship.

My point was this: Giving voice to hidden fears allows for clear thinking and full-throated discussion. This, in turn, can prevent a free people from falling into the same kind of policy mistakes seen in the past — the setting up of internment camps for Japanese-Americans during the Second World War, for example.

But the argument was lost on the politically correct crowd who quickly labeled me an anti-Muslim bigot. They didn’t like the idea that I work at Fox News, engaging in debate with its conservative personalities, either.

Many people on the right and the left only want to hear news and opinion that confirms their pre-existing point of view.

And they are willing to demonize opposing views. Often — dangerously — they even try to silence them.

This July 4, liberals and conservatives — “We the People,” not “big business,” — need to find common ground in defense of honest debate and its life blood, free speech.

Free speech can lead to revolution. But we are a nation born of revolution. And the greatest gift of our founders remains the right to speak out.

A Monmouth University poll taken last month found that 32 percent of Americans said Trump is “actually making the swamp worse.” In fact, 35 percent said he has done nothing to change Washington’s swamp culture. Only 24 percent said he is making good on his promise to drain the swamp.

And now the Trump administration is stirring outrage among Republicans with a recent memo to federal agency employees instructing them not to answer questions from members of Congress unless the request comes from a committee chairman.

""Oversight brings transparency, and transparency brings accountability,” Grassley wrote. “And, the opposite is true. Shutting down oversight requests doesn’t drain the swamp, Mr. President. It floods the swamp.”

“The reality is, sadly, I don’t see much difference between the Trump administration and the Obama administration,” Chaffetz, who is leaving Congress at the end of the month, told reporter Sharyl Attkisson on her program “Full Measure.”

“In many ways, it’s almost worse because we’re getting nothing, and that’s terribly frustrating and, with all due respect, the attorney general has not changed at all. I find him to be worse than what I saw with [Obama-era AG] Loretta Lynch in terms of releasing documents and making things available.”

Wow. These charges are particularly damning since they come from two Republicans. Grassley and Chaffetz have credibility with conservatives for their endless investigations and hounding of the Obama administration.

Trump’s supporters respond to questions about his record on government ethics by pointing to his January 2017 executive order placing new restrictions on lobbyists working in his administration.

But even that defense is fraying. Last month brought news that the Trump White House had asked the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) for even more ethics waivers for Trump staffers to get around the lobbying rules. The Trump administration has requested more of these ethics waivers in its first six months than the Obama administration did in eight years.

“They are circumventing what they touted as their signature ethics achievement,” Robert Weissman, the head of the liberal watchdog group Public Citizen told the New York Times at the time. “It’s utterly at odds with candidate Trump’s ‘drain the swamp’ rhetoric and it suggests that the Trump executive order is not worth the paper it is written on.”

And the ethics quagmire – or swamp – is getting deeper.

Case in point: The Trump International Hotel in Washington. This week, Trump will hold the first fundraiser of his 2020 reelection campaign at his luxury DC hotel. This glitzy affair for “major donors” is a glaring reminder of the unprecedented conflicts-of-interests and ethical problems that have defined the Trump presidency.

Recall Trump is leasing this hotel from the General Services Administration (GSA), a federal agency which he oversees as President, effectively making him his own landlord.

His visit to his hotel serves as free publicity and boosts his bottom line since he refused to divest. And now he is using the hotel as a venue for a fundraising event held in partnership with the Republican National Committee.

Former President Obama's chief ethics attorney, Norman Eisen, told the Associated Press the fundraiser showed Trump is ""becoming more and more brazen in his efforts to monetize the presidency.""

Rep. John Sarbanes (D-Md.) calls the Trump hotel “the symbol of complete disregard for the lines of ethics, the boundaries of ethics, and the conflicts of interest.""

And don’t forget there has already been at least one major lobbying scandal in the Trump administration, when it was revealed that former national security advisor Michael Flynn failed to disclose his lucrative lobbying work on behalf of Turkey and other foreign governments on official government forms.

Wouldn’t it be ironic if Flynn implicates the Swamp-Drainer-In-Chief in the Russia scandal in exchange for leniency for his own lobbying transgressions?

Liberals have spent the last six months wondering aloud what it would take for congressional Republicans and conservative media types to turn on President Trump.

Perhaps his administration’s litany of indefensible ethics violations combined with their disrespect of congressional oversight powers will be the breaking point.",-1,http://thehill.com/opinion/juan-williams/339378-juan-williams-trump-refills-the-swamp

THURGOOD

MARSHALL



American Revolutionary

Right Time, Right Man?

RUMORS FLEW THAT NIGHT. Supreme Court Justice Tom Clark had resigned a few hours earlier. By that Monday evening, Solicitor General Thurgood Marshall and his wife, Cissy, heard that the president was set to name Clark's replacement the very next morning. At the Marshalls' small green town house on G Street in Southwest Washington, D.C., the phone was ringing. Friends, family, and even politicians were calling to see if Thurgood had heard anything about his chances for the job. But all the Marshalls could say was that they had heard rumors.

As Marshall dressed for Clark's retirement party on that muggy Washington night of June 12, 1967, he looked at his reflection in the mirror. Years ago some of his militant critics had called him ""half-white"" for his straight hair, pointed nose, and light tan skin. Now, at fifty-eight, his face had grown heavy, with sagging jowls and dark bags under his eyes. His once black hair, even his mustache, was now mostly a steely gray. And he looked worried. He did have on a good dark blue suit, the uniform of a Washington power player. But the conservative suit looked old and out of place in an era of Afros and dashikis. And even the best suit might not be strong enough armor for the high-stakes political fight he was preparing for tonight. At this moment the six-foot-two-inch Marshall, who weighed well over two hundred pounds, felt powerless. He was fearful that he was about to lose his only chance to become a Supreme Court justice.

Staring in the mirror as if it were a crystal ball, Marshall could see clearly only that he would have one last chance to convince the president he was the right man. That chance would come tonight at Justice Clark's retirement party.

In his two years as solicitor general there had been constant rumors floating around the capital about Marshall being positioned by the president to become the first black man on the high court. However, with one exception, no one at the White House had ever spoken to him about the job. That exception was President Lyndon Johnson. Whenever Johnson talked about the Supreme Court in front of him, the tall, intense Texan made a point of turning to Marshall, thrusting a finger in his face, and reminding him there was no promise that he would ever have a job on the high court.

But Johnson was privately talking about putting Marshall on the Supreme Court. For a southern politician, Johnson had a strong sense of racial justice. As a skinny twenty-year-old, he had taught school to poor Hispanic children in south Texas and seen firsthand the disadvantages they faced. Now Johnson's fabled political instincts had drawn him to the idea that he would be hailed by history as the president who put the first black on the Supreme Court. The president had set the wheels in motion by making Marshall the nation's first black solicitor general. And he had confided to his wife, Lady Bird, that he wanted to appoint Marshall to the Supreme Court. But the president had been having second thoughts about Marshall. Was he really a good lawyer? And what about talk that Marshall was lazy? Was it realistic to think he could win enough votes to get by white racists in the Senate and be confirmed?

As he finished getting ready for the party, Marshall replayed all the rumors he had heard about why the president was reluctant to appoint him to the high court. Thinking about it, Marshall got grumpy, then angry. His chance to be in the history books as the first black man on the Supreme Court was fading, and he felt abandoned. The word around the capital was that the nomination would be announced tomorrow. Marshall had heard nothing from the White House.

Looking in the mirror, Marshall began to buck himself up. He decided that he had run this course before--and won. He remembered when, as a Failing lawyer in Depression-era Baltimore, he had pressured the NAACP for a job. He had peppered Charles Houston, his former law school dean, who was then running the NAACP's legal office, with letters and phone calls detailing ideas for lawsuits to fight racial segregation. The NAACP had little money and could not afford to hire a junior lawyer. But Marshall's aggressiveness and his record of early successes in Maryland civil rights cases finally paid off. Houston offered him a small salary if he would move to New York. Marshall jumped at the chance.

Once in New York, Marshall won case after case, culminating in the landmark Brown v. Board of Education, desegregating America's public schools. Then a driven Marshall played his political cards with care. When the Democrat John Kennedy won the White House, the successful and persistent Marshall headed everyone's list of black lawyers deserving a top federal judgeship. However, Attorney General Robert Kennedy feared that southern segregationists would be angered by the nomination of any black man, especially the famous black lawyer who had been on the cover of Time magazine for having undressed them as bigots and defeated them in court.

But Marshall played tough. He refused the Kennedy administration's offer to be a judge on any lower court. He told the attorney general it was the appeals court job or nothing. Then Marshall increased the political pressure on Robert Kennedy's left by drumming up support in the black press and among civil rights leaders who had been crucial to John Kennedy's narrow election as president. Robert Kennedy weighed the price of angering the civil rights groups and decided to give Marshall the seat he wanted. The determined and willful Thurgood Marshall had won.

Marshall's forceful personality usually allowed him to get his way. He could charm a racist cop with stories and jokes, and he was also capable of intimidating black political rivals by being loud and defiant. But Marshall was full of nagging doubts about this Supreme Court job. He had a desperate need to be respected, to be seen as the equal of top white lawyers who had always looked down on black lawyers. The Supreme Court job would distinguish him for all history and make him the equal of any lawyer. Marshall's personal ambition went deeper than most because it was inextricably tied to his idea of what was best for a racially tense nation. All his life Marshall had been an integrationist. If black people could mix freely with white people, study and work together, he believed, there would be no racial problems in America. He had pushed that theory in courtrooms throughout the nation, won in the Supreme Court, and created the foundation for a modern civil rights movement that to this night still had the nation in turmoil. As a matter of principle, history, and personal ambition, Thurgood Marshall wanted to be the man to integrate the high court. This desire stirred a lifetime of passion and determination in him.

But campaigning for a seat on the Supreme Court might be self-defeating; President Johnson was the kind of man to kill a deal if his hand was being forced or someone was telling him what to do. When newspapers wrote stories in advance of his policy decisions and appointments, Johnson would change his mind just to prove the papers wrong.

Marshall had asked Louis (pronounced ""Louie"") Martin, the smooth, senior black political player at the Democratic National Committee and deputy chairman of the party, to speak to the president about the nomination. Martin had known Marshall since the 1940s, when Marshall was director of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and Martin ran several black midwestern newspapers. Martin, a tall honey-brown man who spoke slow, thoughtful words in a raspy voice, was entertained by Marshall's rapid, blunt comments and his gusto for an argument or a drink. Martin often told friends how after one bout of drinking in Harlem years before, he had driven Marshall around in the early morning hours to give him some air and sober him up before taking him home.

But when Martin sat and talked with the president about Marshall, Johnson fired back, ""That son of a bitch is not worth a damn; he is lazy."" Martin did not tell Marshall about that conversation. He didn't want to deflate Marshall's ego, and he didn't take Johnson's outbursts all that seriously. Martin figured it was just ""Lyndon being Lyndon."" He continued saying a good word here and there to the president on his friend's behalf and getting Marshall into meetings so the president saw him regularly.

But Martin could never give Marshall any guarantee, and Marshall realized that his friend's best efforts may not have been enough. Marshall saw other indications that Johnson was slowly moving away from giving him consideration as a nominee for the Court. The president had told Ramsey Clark, then the acting attorney general and the son of Justice Tom Clark, that Marshall's reputation as solicitor general worried him. With the keen eye of a man who had been watching the scoreboard, the president precisely noted that by the end of 1966 Marshall had lost five of fourteen cases he'd argued as solicitor general before the Supreme Court. That was not good enough. Johnson wanted a perfect record--no losses--so that even Marshall's most racist critics would have to say he was qualified.

Johnson's main worry was about the politics of putting Marshall on the Court in 1967. It was a time of a growing backlash against liberal politics. The college campuses were filled with antiwar and civil rights protests. Violent riots had shaken Baltimore, Chicago, and Los Angeles during the Black Power summer of 1966. Talking to Clark about the politics of nominating Marshall to the Court, the president had said Marshall was a man who would ""just be in the liberals' pocket 100 percent of the time."" A Court with Marshall, William Douglas, Hugo Black, Abe Fortas, and Earl Warren was a sure bet to be a liberal playground: ""Think they'd send a man to the penitentiary for raping a woman if you had a photograph of it?"" the president asked Clark. Johnson also worried that putting another liberal on the Court at that time would infuriate conservatives and might mean that his chance to be reelected in 1968 ""was long gone.""

Clark listened to Johnson's rant. But he did not agree. A fellow Texan and close confidant to the president, Clark was different from most of the men surrounding Johnson. He was a University of Chicago graduate who was considered by Johnson's political cronies to be an extreme liberal, even if he was from Texas. In his deep southern drawl the young Clark reminded Johnson that Marshall shared the president's core belief that the key to ending the 1960s racial strife was promoting integration. Marshall's record showed a willingness to crack down on younger, more militant blacks who could be seen on TV rioting and battling with cops. Given his record as a famed civil rights lawyer, Marshall would be a powerful man to oppose the black radicals.

The president listened to Clark but never said yes or no to putting Marshall on the Court. Clark found himself attempting to stop Johnson from ruling Marshall out. He tried to soothe the president by allaying his biggest fear--that Marshall could not be confirmed. But with southern segregationists in many key positions in the Senate, Johnson expected a fight over the first black justice. He said he could not afford to have a major nomination go down to defeat with the election so near.

Some of the president's doubts eventually got back to Marshall. In conversations with Louis Martin and other friends, he worried that the president was looking at other black lawyers--less well known and less controversial--who would be more likely to win easy Senate confirmation. Jet, the weekly black newsmagazine, reported that the president's list of potential black nominees to the Supreme Court included Marshall but also federal judges Wade McCree of Detroit and William Hastie of Philadelphia. They had first-rate credentials in the white legal establishment--and none of Marshall's baggage of a career in the civil rights movement. In fact, the president had asked Nicholas Katzenbach, Ramsey Clark's predecessor as attorney general, a Rhodes scholar and Yale Law School professor with impeccable establishment credentials, to identify other black candidates for the Court.

Johnson, standing toe-to-toe with the equally tall, balding Katzenbach, told him, ""Marshall's not the best--he's not the most outstanding black lawyer in the country."" Katzenbach grimaced as the imposing Johnson listed prominent, supposedly better-qualified black lawyers, such as William Coleman and Bill Hastie. Finally, Katzenbach, who had come to be friends with Marshall, faced up to Johnson's charge. He replied, ""Mr. President, if you appoint anybody, any black to that court but Thurgood Marshall, you are insulting every black in the country. Thurgood is the black lawyer as far as blacks are concerned--I mean there can't be any doubt about that.""

Katzenbach did agree with the president that Marshall was lazy some of the time. But he reassured Johnson that he would never regret putting Marshall on the Supreme Court. ""He may not be a Felix Frankfurter, he may not be a Hugo Black, but he will never disgrace you."" Katzenbach wanted Marshall on the Court as a symbol of racial harmony.

Inside the White House, Marshall had asked another good friend to urge the president to put him on the high court. Clifford Alexander, one of Johnson's White House lawyers, was the chief adviser on hiring blacks for the administration. Alexander had known Marshall for years. When Alexander won the presidency of the student council at Harvard University in 1954, he asked Marshall to address the students. At that moment Marshall was world famous for his victory desegregating U.S. public schools. When he agreed to come to Harvard, it was a coup for the student council president, and Alexander never forgot it.

In the Oval Office, dominated by the president's massive mahogany desk, the unassuming Alexander had walked the same path as Ramsey Clark and Nicholas Katzenbach. Sitting by the side of the desk, Alexander in a soft voice had pressed him to make history by nominating Marshall to replace the retiring Clark. Johnson, again, did not say yes or no. Later, Alexander could only tell Marshall that he had put in a good word for him and not to worry about all the rumors.

On June 12, 1967, his last day on the high court, Justice Tom Clark told reporters the president would appoint a replacement ""who will fill my shoes to overflowing, possibly break them open."" His comment sparked a new wave of rumors. Justice Clark's comments raised Marshall's hopes. But as his petite Hawaiian wife later told reporters, she had heard hints before, and ""you can't live on hints.""

At the retirement party Johnson was his usual dominating self, alternately bullying and ingratiating himself with both justices and the politicians in the crowd. When Marshall made his way through the faces surrounding Johnson, the president quickly greeted him with a wide smile. The two men loved to drink bourbon and tell stories full of lies. They were the same age and had strong feelings for each other. So it was no surprise when the president threw a long arm around Marshall and briefly pulled him aside. Johnson bluntly told him not to get his hopes up because he was not going to replace Justice Clark.

Marshall played it off with a laugh. Standing to his full height, he reminded Johnson that he didn't need a job and there had never been any promise he would get to the high court. Behind his bluster, however, Marshall felt a fierce determination to argue with Johnson right there. It was Marshall's style to apply pressure and fight. But this time he bit his tongue. It didn't make sense to think he could bully Lyndon Johnson in the middle of a party and win. He drove home, cutting across the Mall, with the U.S. Capitol's magnificent white dome glowing to one side and the towering Washington Monument on the other. The nation's grand symbols made him feel small, an outsider. He had missed his chance.

The next morning, Tuesday, June 13, Marshall was in his office at the Justice Department on Pennsylvania Avenue when his secretary got a call from the attorney general. It was just before 10:00 A.M., and Clark told her he was coming down to see Marshall and to keep everyone else out. When Clark got into Marshall's office, he asked him what he was doing later that morning. Marshall replied that he was going to the White House to speak with a group of students. Clark told him to go over fifteen minutes early and stop in the Oval Office. Marshall pressed Clark to tell him what was going on. Clark said he didn't know.' But given the spate of rumors over the last twenty-four hours and the disaster at the party, Marshall figured this trip was for Johnson to stroke him and tell him why he didn't get the job.

Meanwhile, the president phoned Louis Martin at the Democratic National Committee that morning and asked him to come to the Oval Office. Before Martin's arrival Johnson placed another call. He told Clifford Alexander to come over as well. Alexander was the first to arrive. He found Johnson sitting in a rocking chair in front of a circular marble coffee table in the middle of the Oval Office. The president was holding handwritten notes on large white index cards. Listed were the names of key members of the Senate Judiciary Committee; the Senate leaders, including Mike Mansfield and Everett Dirksen, the majority and minority leaders; Chief Justice Earl Warren; and a tally of Marshall's record in cases argued before the Supreme Court. Highlighted on one card was the fact that Marshall had been first in his class at Howard Law School. Alexander could barely contain his glee when he realized what was going on.

With Alexander standing by, the president, using the white phone built into the coffee table, called Vice President Hubert Humphrey, informing him of the decision. Then Johnson, alternately leaning forward and pushing back as he spoke, called the man who was sure to be the leader in any confirmation fight in the Senate, James Eastland of Mississippi, a hard-line segregationist. ""That conversation was mostly in monotone,"" Alexander recalled. ""President Johnson said to him, `I know you must agree that this is the best-qualified person.'""

Johnson then called several more senators. Alexander remembered the conversations all ended the same way: ""I am sure with this distinguished record that you will support his nomination."" No one, neither Republican nor Democrat, argued. There was hardly any reason for discussion. Johnson had made up his mind, and he spoke with presidential authority. He was not asking for anyone's support. ""God knows by the time he finished his monologue, the people at the other end of the phone had to think about what they had agreed to,"" said Alexander.

Louis Martin soon came in and stood with Alexander as the president called Earl Warren, who was in San Francisco. Warren gave his approval to the nomination and later sent a note thanking Johnson for early notice of the nomination.

With the calls finished, Johnson asked Alexander and Martin to wait outside while he spoke with Marshall alone. Marshall had been next door since 10:45, talking with Marvin Watson, Johnson's appointments secretary. Watson played dumb when Marshall asked him why the president wanted to see him. When he was finally called into the Oval Office at 11:05, Marshall saw Johnson, all by himself, bent over the news service ticker-tape machine.

While Marshall waited for the president to turn around he quickly glanced about the Oval Office. In the far corner was a bronze caricature of a frenetic President Johnson running while holding a phone in one hand. On the marble coffee table Marshall could see a bunch of index cards and papers, some of which had spilled onto the green rug under the president's rocking chair. Nervously, Marshall coughed to get the president's attention. Johnson spun around, as though surprised, and said, ""Oh, hi, Thurgood. Sit down, sit down."" Marshall moved toward the couch and sat next to Johnson's rocking chair. Johnson made small talk with the fidgety Marshall until he abruptly turned to him and said, ""You know something, Thurgood?... I'm going to put you on the Supreme Court."" Marshall was stunned. All he could say was ""Oh, yipe!""

Johnson laughed and had Martin and Alexander come back into the office. They sat on the couch across from Marshall, with the president occasionally leaning forward in the rocking chair. Johnson joked with Marshall that he appointed him to the Supreme Court because ""you are very much like me--brought up in poverty ... not a Harvard boy like Cliff."" Alexander later recalled thinking to himself that Marshall was not brought up in poverty, but that was the image he gave off. For nearly an hour a giddy Marshall joked around, never moving far from the president's rocking chair even as Johnson made phone calls to ecstatic civil rights leaders. Marshall shook his head and laughed at Johnson's trickery as he recalled for Martin and Alexander that just the night before, the president had told him he would not get the job. Johnson just smiled.

At noon Johnson led his new nominee out the French doors behind his desk and into the bright June sunshine. The minute the reporters in the Rose Garden saw Marshall, they knew what was coming. His nomination, while historic, somehow was expected because it had been rumored for so long.

""I have just talked to the Chief Justice and informed him that I shall send to the Senate this afternoon the nomination of Mr. Thurgood Marshall, Solicitor General, to the position of Associate Justice of the Supreme Court,"" Johnson said. ""He has argued nineteen cases in the Supreme Court since becoming Solicitor General. Prior to that time he had argued some thirty-two cases. Statisticians tell me that probably only one or two other living men have argued as many cases before the Court--and perhaps less than half a dozen in all the history of the Nation....

""I believe he has already earned his place in history, but I think it will be greatly enhanced by his service on the Court,"" continued Johnson. ""I believe he earned that appointment; he deserves the appointment. He is best qualified by training and by very valuable service to the country. I believe it is the right thing to do, the right time to do it, the right man and the right place.""

Surprisingly, there was no express mention of the fact that Marshall was black, just Johnson's singular focus on his legal record and an expression of doing the ""right thing,"" a quick jab at critics, particularly southern senators, who might oppose the idea of putting a black man on the nation's highest court. The president, with Marshall by his side, then began a twenty-minute news conference, most of which, incredibly, had nothing to do with the nomination. Reporters asked about Vietnam, the Middle East, and riots in the big cities. Finally, a reporter asked Johnson if he had been advised to name a more conservative nominee than Marshall.

President Johnson shook his head and said, ""No, I received very little pressure of any kind in this connection."" The American Bar Association found Marshall ""highly acceptable,"" Johnson added. Another reporter jumped in: ""I was just going to ask Justice Marshall, if we might, how he feels about this appointment?""

Johnson, turning to Marshall, responded: ""I hope the justice doesn't go into an extended news conference before his confirmation."" Marshall, who was almost as tall as the president, then stepped forward, bent over the microphone, smiled, and looking out through thick, black-framed eyeglasses said: ""You speak for me, Mr. President, we will wait until after the Senate acts."" The president and Marshall, arm in arm and smiling, then marched with long, loping strides back into the Oval Office, where Marshall asked the president for permission to tell his wife the good news before she heard it on the radio. Johnson, with a startled look, said he was surprised Marshall had not already told her. ""How could I, sir?"" Marshall asked. ""I've been with you all the time."" Marshall rang up his wife from a phone on the circular coffee table, and an eager Johnson grabbed for the receiver. ""Cissy, this is Lyndon Johnson.... I just put your husband on the Supreme Court."" The stunned wife replied, ""I sure am happy I'm sitting down.""

To Marshall's surprise, the next morning's newspapers did not greet the nomination with high praise. It was ""rich in symbolism,"" said The New York Times. But the paper did not give Marshall high marks as a legal thinker, saying he was not particularly distinguished either as a federal judge or as solicitor general.

Newsweek magazine said President Johnson did not have to mention at his press conference that Marshall would be the first black on the Court. In a week of race riots across the nation, for the president to choose a black man to sit on the high court looked to a lot of people like a deft political move by a master politician. And there was the chance that the nomination could win back liberal white voters, who were increasingly turning away from Johnson over the Vietnam War. With a potential primary challenge from Sen. Robert Kennedy next year, Johnson had tied up the black vote, the magazine concluded. Newsweek did laud Marshall as a black leader who ""in three decades ... has done as much to transform the life of his people as any Negro alive today, including Nobel Laureate Martin Luther King, Jr.""

One faint line of praise for Marshall's nomination came from conservatives who thought it might stop wild-eyed black people from rioting. An editorial in the Las Vegas Sun didn't have much good to say about Marshall but celebrated the fact that his nomination ""pretty much negate[s] the complaints of the Negro multitudes.... It is hoped the significance is not lost on the Martin Luther Kings and the Stokely Carmichaels and their rampaging followers.""

While cheering for the nomination was polite at best in most papers, the voices of criticism were full-blooded. The Chicago Sun-Times wrote that lawyers would be keeping an eye on Marshall ""because he has been subject to criticism for laziness by those who dealt with him as Solicitor General and Circuit Court Judge."" Joseph Kraft, the preeminent Washington columnist, wrote Marshall's only qualification was that he was ""a Negro, not just any Negro [but] not even the best qualified Negro.""

The administration quickly responded to the critics by emphasizing Marshall's strong belief in the law and racial integration. Johnson and his top aides transformed Marshall into a living symbol of racial progress and good American race relations. Two weeks after his nomination and before any Senate hearings began, the White House arranged for Marshall to be appointed to a special commission to study whether crime and violence were the cause of rioting in Harlem. The leaders of the liberal white establishment were embracing him as their answer to angry blacks who said whites never gave a black man a chance.

And yet a strong undercurrent of criticism of Marshall--he was unqualified, lazy, too liberal--continued. Marshall came under the most brutal attack from segregationists, who did not want an integrationist on the Court. President Johnson's political strategy to have Marshall quickly and easily confirmed was crumbling. And even Marshall's tough-mindedness, his amazing will to win, seemed to be overmatched.

Hearings for most Supreme Court nominees began within a week of the nomination. Byron White, President Kennedy's first candidate for the Court, had been nominated and confirmed within eight days. Abe Fortas, President Johnson's first, had to wait only fourteen days. Thurgood Marshall was different. It would be seventy-eight days before his name would come up for a vote of Senate confirmation.

In the two and a half months between the nomination and the vote on Marshall, his record as a lawyer, his writings, his drinking, the women he slept with, and his family came under the intense scrutiny of FBI and Senate investigations. Sen. Robert Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia, wrote to FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, asking if there was information about Marshall's ties to Communists. Another senator focused on uncovering evidence that Marshall hated whites; other senators loaded up on detailed legal questions, hoping to reveal gaps in Marshall's knowledge of the law that would disqualify him for the high court.

But the larger topics for Marshall's opponents were still left unanswered: Who was this man? How did a black man so despised by millions of segregationists rise past Jim Crow political power to become a federal judge, the first black solicitor general, and finally to stand at the door of the highest station of American law, the Supreme Court? Simply put, where did this Negro come from?",-1,http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/w/williams-marshall.html

OPINION: The Republican attempt to replace ObamaCare could bring political disaster.",-1,https://www.realclearpolitics.com/2017/06/20/gop_fumbles_on_healthcare_413491.html
21902,Williams,Juan,thehill,"How times have changed on ObamaCare.

A Kaiser Family Foundation poll late last month found that 49 percent of Americans have a favorable view of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), as ObamaCare is officially called, while 42 percent have an unfavorable view. That is the highest level of support the poll has found for the law since the summer of 2010.

And then there is the GOP failure to find a palatable substitute.

Kaiser found that just eight percent of the public think the Senate should pass the GOP House bill being advanced to replace ObamaCare, a bill the Senate is using as the basis for its healthcare reform plan.

Even President Trump on a visit to Capitol Hill last week reportedly told Republican senators that he doesn’t like the House GOP’s American Health Care Act (AHCA) because it is “mean.”

ADVERTISEMENT

Seeing Trump jump off the House plan is a very bad sign for Congressional Republicans as they get ready to talk health care with constituents over coming recesses around Independence Day and in August. Even when the president was celebrating the House bill, Republicans faced unruly Memorial Day town hall meetings, with outright protests against their health care proposal.

But Senate Republicans are betting they can do reconstructive surgery on the framework of the unpopular House plan — which the Congressional Budget Office concludes will take insurance away from 23 million people — by making the House bill less “mean.”

They are reported to be looking at increasing subsidies for the poor while providing more time to achieve the far-right goal of doing away with federal guarantees of Medicaid funds to pay medical bills for the poor. The GOP Senate majority also may include special grants to areas hard hit by opioid addiction.

None of this is being done in public hearings. The Congressional Budget Office has not been given a proposal to score. No committees have met.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellMcConnell vents over 'fake news' The Hill's 12:30 Report - Presented by Facebook - Tensions rise as U.S. waits for Derek Chauvin verdict Trump looking 'beyond seriously' at 2024 run MORE (R-Ky.) is keeping his caucus on board this night train ride by promising bright days ahead. The dawn will bring tax reform that will cut taxes for the rich – another promise the GOP wants to keep ahead of the 2018 midterms. But they can only get there once passage of a healthcare deal is in the rearview mirror.

So Senate Republicans steam ahead on this night train despite red lights warning of political derailment. Their proposals have not been vetted by their own caucus, the healthcare industry or their constituents.

The Wall Street Journal’s editorial page buys into the McConnell strategy. It contends the big players know what is in the Senate bill. Also, the paper views Democrats as insincere on the grounds that nothing will please liberal critics except renewal of ObamaCare.

Well, the proof will be in the bill.

Let’s see if the GOP can put a plan before the public that provides medical insurance to more people than ObamaCare and lowers premiums; that offers protections for people with pre-existing conditions; that pays bills for mental health, maternity and drug problems; that does away with yearly and lifetime caps on spending; and that protects young people from being prematurely pushed off of their parents’ plans.

To be clear, it isn’t all 52 Senate Republicans who are on board for these secret negotiations. A working group of 13 arch-conservative men led by McConnell got tickets to ride.

Noticeably not on board are female GOP senators, including the most senior Republican woman in the Senate, Susan Collins Susan Margaret CollinsCollins joins Democrats in bid to undo Trump methane emissions rollback Biden dispatches Cabinet members to sell infrastructure plan Senate confirms SEC chief Gensler to full five-year term MORE of Maine, who has a background as a state insurance regulator.

This lack of diversity is important because smoke signals coming from the GOP’s private talks appear to include changes to healthcare law that will disproportionately harm the poor, the elderly, women and people of color.

Polls show the public consistently rejecting the House plan. A Quinnipiac poll earlier this month found 62 percent of voters disapprove of the House bill while just 17 percent approve of it.

Quinnipiac also found that 30 percent of voters say Trump and Congress should not repeal any part of ObamaCare. And 47 percent said they should repeal only some parts of it.

Meanwhile, Democrats are rushing into the town square in advance of the 2018 elections pointing to rising support for ObamaCare. And they are damning the Republicans with charges of hypocrisy.

They point to then-House Republican Leader John Boehner John Andrew BoehnerCantor: 'Level of craziness' in Washington has increased 'on both sides' Cheney on Trump going to GOP retreat in Florida: 'I haven't invited him' Republicans race for distance from 'America First Caucus' MORE’s (Ohio) epic rant before the Democrats’ pushed through ObamaCare on a party-line vote in 2010.

Hell, no you can’t! Have you read the bill? …Hell, no you haven’t! ...Shame on this body!”

But the Republicans of 2017 roll along, even though they are open to the very same charges.

Even if the Senate bill gets 50 votes once the deal is public, it will still have to survive a conference committee with the House Freedom Caucus hardliners.

Is it any wonder the Senate Republicans want to keep their plan secret?

21903,Williams,Juan,thehill,"Last week James Comey testified that while he was FBI director, he felt pressured by President Trump to drop an investigation into one man.

Also last week, U.S. allies went to war to oust Islamic State terrorists from their command center in Raqqa, Syria, a sharp shift from the orders once given by the very same man.

The man at the center of both stories is Trump’s former national security advisor.

ADVERTISEMENT

Yes, Michael Flynn had an even worse week than Trump.

Comey told Congress the president pushed him to “let this go,” referring to the FBI investigation into Flynn, who has financial ties to Russia and Turkey. Flynn took money from both nations before the election without proper disclosure.

But despite Flynn’s central role in the growing scandal, last week’s media spotlight locked in on personalities: Comey versus Trump.

The headlines focused on Comey calling the president a liar and whether his testimony was strong enough to build a case for an obstruction of justice charge against Trump.

That is a strangely narrow view of the damage coming from the possible corruption in the White House.

The scandal being overlooked is that the president for some reason made America’s national security secondary to his allegiance to Flynn.

As he took office, Trump knew he was allowing a man to become his national security advisor who broke the law by failing to disclose that he took money from companies tied to foreign powers. In the case of Turkey, he took money to represent its interests in Washington.

Most alarming, in the days before Trump became president, the Obama administration advised Flynn that they planned to take the fight against the terrorists to Raqqa. Susan Rice, then the national security advisor to President Obama, spoke to Flynn because the fight was certain to continue under the Trump administration.

And what did Flynn tell Rice?

The Washington Post reported Flynn said bluntly: “Don’t approve it.” The attack was delayed from January until last week.

Why did Flynn and the incoming Trump team delay the offensive?

As Vera Bergengruen reported for McClatchy newspapers last month, Flynn’s stand-down order to Rice and the Pentagon was “consistent with the wishes of Turkey, which had long opposed the United States partnering with Kurdish forces — and which was his undeclared client.”

Turkey’s president, Recep Erdogan, was concerned that close ties between the U.S. and Kurdish forces trained to lead the fight might result in the U.S. eventually supporting independence for Kurdish majority areas of Turkey.

The Justice Department was alarmed about Flynn and Turkey in part because of an opinion article Flynn wrote in The Hill on Election Day. After the article appeared, officials at Justice were worried about “potential ties between Lt. Gen. Flynn and others who might be acting on behalf of the government of Turkey,” according to records released to The Daily Caller.

In addition, before becoming the national security advisor, Flynn also appears to have held conversations with the Russian ambassador about U.S. sanctions against Russia.

And Flynn also then lied about those conversations to Vice President Pence.

When the president was told that the Russians potentially could blackmail his national security adviser with that information, he did nothing for more than two weeks.

Well, he did something. He soon fired the acting attorney general who told the White House about the damning conflict of interest. It took a lot longer for him to fire Flynn — and that happened only after news reports that the Justice Department had told the White House about Flynn’s conflicts.

On Friday, Trump denied asking Comey for an end to the investigation into Flynn.

That leads to the question of why Comey would perjure himself before Congress.

Trump, on the other hand, has a clear distaste for the House and Senate investigations into his campaign’s ties to Russia.

And once again that centers on protecting Flynn.

In late April, Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the ranking Democrat on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, released documents showing that after Flynn was fired as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, he was explicitly informed it was illegal for him to accept money tied to any foreign government without “advance approval” by Pentagon officials.

But despite the warning, Flynn, by his own later admission, took money from firms tied to foreign governments, specifically Turkey and Russia. And Pentagon officials said they had “no records of …Flynn requesting permission from the Army for foreign employment.”

Cummings told reporters he wanted to know why Flynn took the risk of secretly accepting money tied to governments in Turkey and Russia when he knew he was breaking the law.

“Our next step,” in the Congressional inquiry, Cummings explained to the reporters, “is to get the documents we are seeking from the White House so we can complete our investigation.”

The White House immediately shut that down. They said documents related to Flynn’s security clearance would be kept from Congress because they include classified information.

Even before he testified, public opinion was on Comey’s side in his battle with the administration.

According to a new ABC News/Washington Post poll, 61 percent of Americans believe Trump fired Comey to protect himself. The same poll found that 56 percent believe Trump is trying to interfere in the Russia investigation.

It is clear that Trump’s team thinks they can weather the storm if this remains a clash between two political personalities — Trump and Comey.

But others in the Trump campaign — especially Flynn — are part of the rising swamp threatening the Trump White House.

21905,Williams,Juan,thehill,"Will Democrats win any of these special Congressional elections?

Republicans won the May special election for Montana’s congressional seat even after their candidate throttled and body-slammed a reporter. The upcoming special election in Georgia remains close even with a weak Republican candidate.

So, what will it take for Democrats to start winning?

ADVERTISEMENT

First, the Montana fisticuffs showed that Republicans can react volcanically to questions about President Trump’s failed effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as ObamaCare. Their candidate went ballistic when the reporter, Ben Jacobs of The Guardian, asked about the projected higher premiums and fewer people insured under Trump’s healthcare plan.

Second, last week’s poor jobs numbers and Trump’s lack of progress on tax reform offer more evidence that the GOP lacks a strong record for its candidates to run on.

And, third, the Democratic base is fired up. With Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris climate deal, the party is definitely unified in its fury at him.

But with the president retaining strong support among his GOP base, are these hopeful signs just mirages similar to the illusions that led Democrats to think Trump could never be elected president?

Is there any concrete reason to think that the nation’s politics have changed enough to give the Democrats the 24 seats they need to take control of the House and set themselves up to defeat Trump in 2020?

In Montana, the Democratic candidate lost by only six points while Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' Cuba readies for life without Castro Chelsea Clinton: Pics of Trump getting vaccinated would help him 'claim credit' MORE, the party’s 2016 presidential nominee, lost by 20. That margin narrowed even as the GOP outspent the Democrats. And most people voted long before the Republican, Greg Gianforte, resorted to violence.

Daily Kos Elections reports that, as of May 25, there had been 18 special elections for Congressional and state legislative seats. Democrats have done better than Clinton in 12, averaging a margin of 11 percentage points better than their 2016 presidential nominee.

That led Kyle Kondik, the managing editor of the Crystal Ball newsletter from the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics, to conclude: “Democrats can point to overall special election trends that suggest the opportunity for significant gains next year if they can be replicated on a nationalized scale.”

That forecast fit with Clinton’s prediction at a tech conference last week that it is “certainly realistic” for Democrats to win the House majority in the 2018 midterm elections.

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee announced last month that it was expanding the targets for GOP-held House seats in 2018 beyond the 23 districts currently represented by a Republican but won by Clinton. They are now aiming at an incredible 79 seats.

Before he withdrew from the climate deal, Trump’s approval rating was underwater by 14 points: Gallup reported last week that the president’s job performance was approved by 40 percent of the country, while 54 percent disapproved.

And don’t forget the FBI, special counsel and congressional probes into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia, which could totally derail any GOP policy agenda before the 2018 races.

A Politico/Morning Consult Poll last week found that 43 percent of voters want impeachment proceedings right now.

A Quinnipiac University poll last month found the president with the support of just 29 percent of self-described independents — a group with which he had scored plurality support last November.

But all that is noise inside a political bubble unless there is a winning message from Democrats that goes beyond another dose of fury at Trump and speaks directly to voters.

Last week brought news that a group of Democrats had formed the People’s House Project to elect left of center candidates. The new group’s goal is to give Democratic candidates in the Midwest and rural areas a new look, with a jobs-first focus and free from Republican attacks on the party as a coalition of elites, young people, and minorities.

“It will allow them to say, ‘I’m a different kind of Democrat,’ ” said Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), who supports the effort.

“The Democratic Party, especially the presidential campaign, lost its core economic message last year; Trump sort of outmaneuvered us among Democrats and independents,” said Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper last month. Pepper has spent the months since the election traveling around the Buckeye State for one-on-one “kitchen conversations” with Ohioans.

The Ohio chairman’s effort is one front in the battle to shape the Democrats’ future.

That includes the search for an energetic, charismatic leader able to withstand Trump’s attacks.

Former Vice President Biden announced last week that he is forming a political action committee to support candidates in the 2018 congressional races. It is also a possible platform for him to run in 2020.

And two senators, Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth WarrenLawmakers react to guilty verdict in Chauvin murder trial: 'Our work is far from done' World passes 3 million coronavirus deaths Poll: 56 percent say wealth tax is part of solution to inequality MORE of Massachusetts and Cory Booker of New Jersey, also look to be auditioning as the leading Democrat.

They offer different looks for the anti-Trump brigade.

Warren satisfies Democrats who want to go toe-to-toe with a president they view as illegitimate, corrupt, dangerous and even treasonous. They want Trump treated by Democrats the way President Obama was treated by Republicans for the last eight years — with contempt and unrelenting opposition.

Meanwhile, Booker wants to offer a contrast to the president by branding himself and Democrats as a force for unifying the nation across political lines.

“It’s gotta be about love. It’s gotta be about the connections we have to each other,” he told Vox recently.

The Democrats’ search for answers remains a work in progress.

21906,Williams,Juan,thehill,"Here is my question for Trump voters: What do you hear the president saying with his new budget?

My guess is that you don’t want to hear that giant sucking sound as he takes your money — dollars from hard working people — to cut taxes for the rich.

The Trump administration would say that characterization is fake news.

ADVERTISEMENT

They say their budget is written from the perspective of salt of the earth people who think taxes are too high.

During the 2016 campaign, Trump made statements that I considered outrageous, offensive and often factually wrong. But his supporters loved it. Even with falling support, the president still has 81 percent approval among Republican voters, according to the latest Fox News poll.

And Trump’s base delights in mocking journalists for not hearing what they hear in Trump’s words. They laugh at critics who fact-check his every mistake and exaggeration.

They laugh even harder at Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' Cuba readies for life without Castro Chelsea Clinton: Pics of Trump getting vaccinated would help him 'claim credit' MORE when she argues that Trump’s budget “shows an unimaginable level of cruelty and lack of imagination and disdain for the struggles of millions of Americans, including millions of children.”

So tell me, Trump voters, what thrilling message are you getting from a president whose budget reduces funding for programs that benefit you? I refer to cuts to programs to feed children; help student with school loans; and to help seniors and the disabled get to the doctor.

Last week, an analysis from The Atlantic magazine concluded that core Trump backers — older, white voters without a college education — will be hurt by this budget. Those are the blue-collar voters in Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Iowa who made the electoral college map turn red across the Midwest for Trump.

These same voters “represent a majority of those receiving benefits” from federal government programs such as food stamps and Social Security Disability payments, Ron Brownstein wrote in The Atlantic. And those programs are “targeted for large cutbacks” in the Trump budget.

Trump’s budget comes as the Congressional Budget Office announces that the House GOP plan to replace ObamaCare will leave 23 million more people without health insurance by 2026.

Even some Republicans don’t like what they hear.

Sen. John Cornyn John CornynOvernight Health Care: Johnson & Johnson pause seen as 'responsible' in poll | Women turning out more than men for COVID-19 vaccines Cornyn places hold on Biden Medicaid nominee Stacey Abrams: Parts of new Georgia voting law have racist intent MORE (R-Texas), the conservative Majority Whip, said the budget was “basically dead on arrival.”

The voters that elected Trump or “brought [him] to the dance are the populists out there in the Midwest and South who rely on these programs that he’s talking about reducing,” William Hoagland, a former budget aide to Senate Republicans who is now at the Bipartisan Policy Center, told the New York Times.

The only get up-and-holler I hear in the Trump argument is anti-immigrant, racist, hateful rage.

Trump is playing on white working class resentment against racially diverse young people, immigrants and minorities — people who are falsely and callously characterized as lazy, undeserving bums who lie to get a Social Security disability check, an unemployment check or to qualify for food stamps.

“We want to measure compassion, true compassion, by the number of people we help to get off those programs,” said Mick Mulvaney, the White House budget director, in arguing for people to stop talking about how many programs exist or how many people are being helped by those programs.

But what about deserving Trump voters who will lose benefits?

Mulvaney only expressed concern for people who complain they’ve paid high taxes but still see poor people.

There is no denying the near-record number of people getting disability payments. There is no denying that the record number of people who qualified for food stamps after the 2008 recession has stayed high nine years later, even as the unemployment rate has fallen below five percent.

And the Trump argument then logically rewards people with high paying jobs, investments and savings by cutting corporate taxes, income taxes and taxes on inheritance.

But wait a minute.

What happened to Trump’s campaign promise to look out for the little guy instead of the ‘too big to fail’ crowd on Wall Street?

The Trump budget cuts Medicaid by a whopping $610 billion over the next decade. According to the AARP, Medicaid is the primary means of support for 65 percent of people in nursing homes. The program pays for 45 percent of total nursing home bills.

Trump won voters aged 65 and older by 52 percent to Clinton’s 45 percent.

More specifically, he won white voters aged 65 and older by 58 percent to Clinton’s 39 percent.

According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, Wisconsin has 1.046 million people enrolled in either Medicaid or CHIP. Michigan has 2.34 million people enrolled in those programs. Pennsylvania has 2.927 million.

Trump won each of those states by less than one percentage point. His aggregate margin across all three was around 77,000 votes.

The Trump budget also hacks away at the farm insurance programs that rural farmers in the Midwest use to staying in business during bad crop years.

2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney, a multimillionaire, suffered during his campaign when a video surfaced of him complaining that 47 percent of Americans were too poor to pay taxes and therefore likely to vote against his tax cut plan.

It did not help matters that the tape was revealed months after the Romney family sought permits to install a car elevator in their new seaside California mansion.

As conservatives have been quick to point out for decades, the top one percent of wage earners pay about 50 percent of all federal income taxes.

The bottom sixty percent of wage earners pay barely two percent of federal income taxes.

This Trump budget comes from a songbook written for the top one percent. They have every reason to sing along. But how can 81 percent of Republicans approve of this?

Anyone sniffing around for a criminal act might want to note that Comey is reported to have made contemporaneous notes of that February meeting.

They might also focus upon a New York Times story that emerged on Friday, reporting that Trump had told Russian officials during an Oval Office meeting that “great pressure because of Russia” had been “taken off” with the ouster of Comey.

If it is proved that Trump asked the FBI to close a probe because he did not want Flynn’s ties to Russia exposed that is a classic case of a crime — obstruction of justice.

That was the charge at the heart of the case against Nixon over Watergate.

As the search for a crime continues, it is important to note that impeachment does not require a statutory felony.

All that is needed is for Congress to agree that the president’s actions fit their definition of “high crimes and misdemeanors.” Lying to government officials, cover-ups, and taking money from a foreign government without proper disclosure all look like a good fit for a subjective claim of “high crimes.”

John McCain John Sidney McCainBush says he doesn't criticize other presidents to avoid risking friendship with Michelle Obama 'Real Housewives of the GOP' — Wannabe reality show narcissists commandeer the party George W. Bush: 'It's a problem that Americans are so polarized' they can't imagine him being friends with Michelle Obama MORE of Arizona, told veteran newsman Bob Schieffer last week. ""Every couple of days, there's a new aspect of this really unhappy situation.""

As the author of a new book on the people who shaped American history in the latter half of the 20th century, the parallels between Nixon and Trump jump out at me. And historians are not the only people noticing.

A new survey from the Democratic-leaning firm Public Policy Polling (PPP) also released last week found for the first time that a plurality of voters, 48 percent, supports the impeachment of President Trump. This figure includes 12 percent of self-described Trump voters. The same poll also found widespread public support, 62 percent, for an independent special prosecutor.

Talk of a special prosecutor and prospects for impeachment invite comparisons to Watergate, the only scandal that forced an American president to resign.

Trump fired Comey as the FBI investigation was heating up. Nixon fired Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox as the Watergate probe got hot and closer to the president.

The politics of the Trump-Russia scandal look a lot like the politics of Watergate.

Remember that Nixon only resigned the presidency when he and his top aides realized that he had lost the support of most Congressional Republicans. The GOP feared a wipeout in the 1974 midterm elections so they made the political calculation that their only chance to save their seats in Congress was to distance themselves from the politically toxic Republican president.

With 18 months to go until the 2018 midterm elections, Congressional Republicans have begun to distance themselves from Trump. The pace of the retreat quickened last week with some of the most vulnerable House Republicans loudly demanding answers.

“It is time for an investigation of Russia’s intervention in the U.S. Election,” Rep. Steve Knight (R-Calif,.) said. “There is too much at stake at home and abroad to not take this step. There is so much conflicting information from many sources; Americans deserve the opportunity to learn the truth.”

It is no coincidence that last week’s news was accompanied by increased chatter in conservative circles about the possibility of Vice President Pence becoming the 46th president of the United States.

“President Trump needs an intervention,” wrote top conservative blogger Erik Erickson. “Without that, we need his resignation. Republicans… have no need for him with Mike Pence Michael (Mike) Richard PenceHispanic Caucus energized by first Biden meeting Simon & Schuster rejects employees' call to drop Pence book deal Jeffries roasts McCarthy over Waters: 'Clean up your own mess' MORE in the wings.”

President Ford pardoned Nixon for his Watergate crimes. How long before we start discussing whether President Pence will pardon his predecessor so the country can move on from its present national nightmare?

Trump’s die-hard backers will still be looking for the crime.

“If the election had been on October 27, I would be your president,” Clinton declared at a forum in New York City earlier this month.

Those words led Republicans to mock Clinton for refusing to accept responsibility for running a bad campaign that ended in defeat.

But Clinton then got backing — of a kind — from the man who beat her, President Trump.

The president fired FBI director James Comey last week, ostensibly for violating policy when, despite clearing Clinton of any crime, he still went on national television last summer to condemn her as a “careless” public official.

At that July 2016 press conference, Comey defamed Clinton to the point that Republicans criticized him for not recommending that she be charged with a crime.

Comey’s impact on the campaign grew larger when, just 11 days before the November election, he sent a letter to Congress announcing that the FBI was reopening the investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email address and server.

Nothing came of the last-minute investigation, just as no charges resulted from the first investigation. But with Trump campaign surrogates, including retired Gen. Michael Flynn, shouting “lock her up,” Republicans and a supplicant press made a big issue out of the controversy.

How times change.

Last week Trump agreed with a memo from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein which flatly stated that it is not possible to “defend the director’s handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clinton’s e-mails.”

That memo was released a week after Comey gave testimony to Congress in which he wrongly claimed “hundreds and thousands of emails,” had been forwarded by Clinton aide Huma Abedin to her husband’s non-secure computer.

In fact, most of the Clinton emails found on the non-government computer “occurred as a result of a backup of personal electronic devices,” according to the FBI. And only two “email chains” of classified information had been mistakenly sent to the private computer.

Trump found it convenient to use Comey’s errors to get rid of the leader of the agency investigating charges that his campaign had treasonous ties to Russia.

But whatever the reason, Trump stood with Clinton — at least for a while. In an interview broadcast Saturday with my Fox News Channel colleague Jeanine Pirro, Trump reverted to his earlier insistence that Comey gave Clinton ""a free pass like nobody's ever, ever gotten a free pass.""

Clinton, meanwhile, is refuting Republican claims that Russian interference did not swing votes to Trump.

“I was on the way to winning until the combination of Jim Comey’s letter on October 28 and Russian WikiLeaks raised doubts in the minds of people who were inclined to vote for me but got scared off — and the evidence for that intervening event is, I think, compelling and persuasive,” Clinton explained at the New York forum.

She specifically pointed to data coming from pollster Nate Silver. On his website FiveThirtyEight.com, Silver later noted that Comey’s letter “does not excuse” every bad decision made by the Clinton campaign.

But Silver concluded: “Hillary Clinton would probably be president if FBI Director James Comey had not sent a letter to Congress on Oct. 28.”

Silver’s breakdown shows that Comey’s letter hurt Clinton’s chances of victory in swing states key to winning the Electoral College — such as Wisconsin and Michigan. Clinton lost in each of those states by less than one percentage point.

And keep in mind while Comey was maligning Clinton, he never mentioned the FBI’s investigation into the Trump campaign.

But Republicans still refuse to accept the reality that Russia, a hostile foreign power, played a major role in electing Trump.

Comey’s sudden dismissal is now part of a fire that threatens to burn down the GOP’s House majority next year.

The firing came one day after Sally Yates, the former acting Attorney General, told the Senate she warned the White House Counsel about former National Security Adviser Flynn’s ties to Russia weeks before he was fired. Yates, too, was fired by Trump.

How quickly will Capitol Hill Republicans abandon their Republican president in order to save themselves before they are fired by voters?

The flight is beginning.

All this comes at a time when a full 58 percent of Americans disapprove of Trump’s job performance, according to a Quinnipiac University poll.

But it makes no sense to run slowly from an inferno. This conflagration is threatening to burn every Republican on the ballot in 2018.

“The President's firing of Director Comey is a smoke signal. And where there's smoke, there's fire. And this is a bonfire,” tweeted Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.).

How far will the fire have to spread before Republicans decide it is every GOP candidate for himself or herself — whatever the consequences for Trump?

Having failed to pass any major legislation in President Trump’s first 100 days, the GOP kicked off the president’s second 100 days by passing a massive $1 trillion spending bill chock-full of Democratic priorities, including funding for Planned Parenthood.

So, when Vice President Pence called into Limbaugh’s radio show last week, the king of conservative talk radio let him have it.

“If this is what happens, Mr. Vice President, why vote Republican? What is the point of voting Republican if the Democrats are going to continue to win practically 95 percent of their objectives, such as in this last budget deal?” Limbaugh asked.

Top of mind for Limbaugh and other leading conservatives is the GOP’s failure, so far, to live up to its promise to produce a better healthcare plan than the Affordable Care Act — or, as they always put it, “to repeal and replace ObamaCare.”

House Republicans held 60 symbolic votes to kill the healthcare plan. Candidate Trump promised to replace President Obama’s program with a plan that gives “everybody” better coverage at less cost and to do it “very quickly.”

So in a desperate effort to tell Limbaugh and his listeners they are keeping this promise, the GOP passed a healthcare bill last week that leaves more people without insurance.

About 24 million people will lose coverage over a decade by official estimates. The GOP plan will also drive up costs for seniors and give hospitals financial incentives to turn away Medicare patients.

Despite rushing through a bill that hurts so many people, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), the former head of the hard-right Freedom Caucus, admits the bill does not repeal ObamaCare.

“This is the best bill we can get out of the House,” he said in a CNN interview last week. “But frankly, we should be clear this is not repeal of ObamaCare. If it was repeal, you wouldn’t need the option for a waiver option for states to seek. So, we have to be clear with the voters about that, and continue to work on it.”

Work on it?

The Republicans have been working on it for the last seven years. They have engaged in all-out sabotage. Yet they have not come up with a better plan. The AARP, the March of Dimes and the American Medical Association all oppose their proposal.

The bill has no future. The Republican majority in the Senate is trying to come up with its own plan. And whatever comes out of the Republican majority in the Senate has no chance of surviving conference committee with the hardline members of the House Freedom Caucus.

Now, consider the politics of 2018.

Keep in mind the wave of House Democrats who lost seats after Obama passed his healthcare plan. Now, hear from Democratic House Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.), who says that House Republicans have this flawed plan “tattooed to their forehead.”

An ABC News/Washington Post poll from April found 61 percent of Americans — including 21 percent of self-described Republicans — want Congress to keep the law in place and try to improve it. Just 37 percent of Americans still say “repeal and replace.”

A March Quinnipiac poll on the GOP bill found just 17 percent of Americans in support of it; 56 percent were opposed and 26 percent were undecided.

True, these polls were conducted before some amendments. But the basics of the bill did not change. That’s why it was rushed through.

On that score, it is striking that older, white, and working-class voters who gave Trump his victory are being betrayed by Trump. Under the House bill, older people can be charged higher rates; states can allow plans with no coverage for prescription drugs; and they can waive protections for people with pre-existing conditions.

The political lesson for Republican voters is that Republican politicians have lost touch with them while competing to see who can cater to the most extreme voices on talk radio.

A Gallup poll taken in January 2017 found that 30 percent of Republicans self-identify as moderates and seven percent say they are liberal Republicans. That is a sizable minority of moderate voices in a Republican party in which 63 percent describe themselves as conservatives.

But those moderate voices are being marginalized, demonized and derided as RINOs — “Republicans in Name Only” — as they call for Republicans to stop playing politics and focus on fixing the flaws in the Affordable Care Act.

Moderate Republicans have been sacrificed for a bad bill.

For example, Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.) helped scuttle the flawed House GOP healthcare bill in March and voted against the new version last week.

Now she has announced her retirement at the end of this Congress, after 28 years in the House.

Ros-Lehtinen is the most senior Republican woman in the House, and she won reelection in a South Florida district that backed Democrat Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' Cuba readies for life without Castro Chelsea Clinton: Pics of Trump getting vaccinated would help him 'claim credit' MORE over Trump by 20 points in 2016. Her purple district is one of 23 Congressional districts represented by Republicans that supported Clinton over Trump.

Remember that as the House is currently composed, Democrats need to flip 24 seats to retake the majority.

Democrats see the health care debacle as a boon to their candidates — a thesis that may be confirmed if Democrat Jon Ossoff pulls off a surprise win in June’s Georgia special election to fill Republican Tom Price’s old House seat.

Playing games with healthcare makes it less likely each day that the GOP will keep their House majority in 2018.

The GOP has just handed the Democrats a huge political gift.

As a Democrat I feel your anger, senator.

But despite disgust with Trump’s Russia scandals and failure to keep campaign promises, the hard fact is that Democrats have yet to prove they can revive their political prospects in the next two years, or stop Trump from winning a second term.

In fact, a Washington Post/ABC News poll last week concluded that in a rematch right now against Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' Cuba readies for life without Castro Chelsea Clinton: Pics of Trump getting vaccinated would help him 'claim credit' MORE, Trump would win the popular vote 43 percent to 40 percent.

Democrats have to admit that Trump has consolidated his political power and established himself as the undisputed leader of the Republican Party.

Independent voters are moving away from Trump. But according to the most recent Gallup poll, 86 percent of self-described Republicans approve of the job he is doing.

In April, the Republican National Committee (RNC) announced a record fundraising haul of $41.5 million for the first quarter of 2017.

Meanwhile, the Democrats’ troubles begin with the fact that they have no clear leader.

Former President Obama is still a towering figure in the party, as is Hillary Clinton. But their presence threatens to starve a new generation of Democratic leaders of oxygen.

Warren is certainly vying for the mantle of leadership, crisscrossing the country to promote her new book.

But it will take more than a tour to bring the party’s left wing together with its establishment.

According to the most recent FEC filings, the DNC is way behind the RNC in terms of fundraising. It has just $10.8 million cash on hand and $2.8 million in debt.

In two special elections, in Kansas and Georgia, Democrats failed to translate Trump’s historic low approval ratings into wins for their candidates. Comedian Bill Maher quipped that the party’s new slogan should be “Democrats: Now losing by slimmer margins!”

Fifty-nine percent of Americans in the Washington Post/ ABC News poll said Trump does not have “the kind of personality and temperament… to serve effectively as president.” Fifty-eight percent said he is dishonest and untrustworthy. And 56 percent said he lacks the judgment to be an effective president.

So why did the poll find that Trump would still beat Clinton in an election rematch?

Well, 67 percent said the Democrats are “out of touch” with ordinary Americans. That’s more than the 62 percent who said the Republican Party is “out of touch” or the 58 percent who said the same about Trump.

Voters may not like Trump but Democrats have yet to come up with a positive alternative vision. All the Democrats have going for them is the anti-Trump enthusiasm of their grassroots, the so-called “resistance.”

“Taken together, all signs are looking up for the movement,” New York Times columnist Charles Blow argued in a recent column. “The Trump administration, from pillar to post, is an unmitigated disaster…Americans are not taking it lying down.”

The Women’s March in January, the pro-ObamaCare disruptions at GOP town halls and the recent nationwide tax day protests show there is populist energy that Democrats could be tapping to change their electoral fortunes.

Over the next seven months, Democrats have the opportunity to win House seats in special elections in Georgia, Montana and South Carolina. Polls show they stand a decent chance of winning back the governor’s mansion in New Jersey and holding the Virginia governorship.

But Democratic voter turnout in midterm years is traditionally low, giving the GOP a huge advantage in Congressional elections.

It is the job of the Democratic Party and its leaders to translate the raw, visceral anti-Trump energy that exists in the country into votes for their candidates.

But for all of Trump’s self-destructive ways, there is little evidence that Democrats have found the right counterpunch to knock him out.

On Day One, after listening to Trump’s inaugural address, former President George W. Bush reportedly said: “That was some weird s--t.”

The GOP establishment still holds that view after 100 days of President Trump.

And Democrats are also offering “We Told You So” looks to all who voted for Trump.

Trump’s most striking achievement in his first three months is being the least popular new president in modern history.

A majority of Americans – 52 percent — disapprove of his job performance as president, according to the most recent Gallup tracking poll, released Saturday.

Even Trump’s supporters have to admit these first three months have been defined by the administration’s failure to deliver on campaign promises.

For all of Trump’s talk about being a great dealmaker, the flashing lights on the political scoreboard read as follows:

No repeal of ObamaCare. No tax reform. No Muslim travel ban — in the sense that the attempt to enact one is bogged down in the courts — and no evidence to support the incredible claim that President Obama had Trump wiretapped.

There is also no wall on the southern border and no indication that Mexico will pay for it.

And in the last few weeks, the reversals on campaign promises have come thick and fast.

Now Trump approves of the Export-Import Bank. Now Trump is no longer a fan of the border adjustment tax. Now he believes in NATO. Now China will not be listed as a currency manipulator. Now Janet Yellen is a good chairwoman of the Federal Reserve.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellMcConnell vents over 'fake news' The Hill's 12:30 Report - Presented by Facebook - Tensions rise as U.S. waits for Derek Chauvin verdict Trump looking 'beyond seriously' at 2024 run MORE (R-Ky.) put all the flip-flops in delicate terms so as not to offend the Trump faithful:

“I think President Trump is learning the job and some of the things that were said during the campaign I think he now knows — that’s simply not the way things ought to be.”

Trump’s singular success was getting Neil Gorsuch confirmed to the Supreme Court.

But the credit for that win should properly go to the Heritage Foundation and the conservative legal minds at the Federalist Society. They compiled a list of their favorite conservative judges and handed it to Trump.

Now, let’s look ahead to Trump’s next 100 days.

The biggest threat to Trump is the split between him and Republicans in Congress.

He has proven to be a weight on Republican congressional candidates in two special elections in Kansas and Georgia.

FiveThirtyEight forecaster Harry Enten tweeted earlier this month that the House GOP caucus is in the worst position of any party holding the House majority since 1954, when voters were first asked their preference for which party rules the House.

That ballot question was simply, “If the election were held today, would you vote for the Republican or the Democratic candidate?” Enten’s average of the polls has the Republicans down by six points.

There is more than a year for the Republicans to dig out from there, but it is a big hole.

That gives Republicans every reason to start distancing themselves from the Trump White House. Democrats are already standing far away.

Yet Trump needs Congress’s help right now to avoid a government shutdown.

After a two-week Easter recess, Congress returns to work tomorrow with just four days left until funding for current government operations is set to expire on April 29.

The top two Senate Republicans, McConnell and Majority Whip John Cornyn John CornynOvernight Health Care: Johnson & Johnson pause seen as 'responsible' in poll | Women turning out more than men for COVID-19 vaccines Cornyn places hold on Biden Medicaid nominee Stacey Abrams: Parts of new Georgia voting law have racist intent MORE (Texas) are going out of their way to call for a bipartisan, stop-gap funding measure to stave off a shutdown.

“We’ll be talking to Senate Democrats,” McConnell said before Easter. “They will be relevant to the process. It will require 60 votes. I’m confident that Senate Democrats are not going to want to shut down the government.”

So now we have leading Republicans calling on President Trump to work with the Democrats.

But Democrats know that Trump’s plans for future budgets anger their base. So why would they help him?

The Trump blueprint for future budgets, released last month, outlined draconian cuts to funds that support popular education, social welfare and economic development programs. Meals on wheels for the elderly and afterschool programs for disadvantaged youths were two that invited public outcry.

Trump recently said he remains focused on health reform and is threatening to withhold subsidies to insurance companies to force Democrats to help him pass a bill to replace ObamaCare.

""Health care [reform] is going to happen at some point,” the president told my Fox colleague Maria Bartiromo. “Now, if it doesn't happen fast enough, I'll start the taxes. But the tax reform and the tax cuts are better if I can do health care first.""

If you are a Democrat who enjoyed the disastrous GOP civil war over their health care bill, then you are going to love the upcoming GOP slugfest over spending and taxes. If past is prologue then Trump will be frustrated, and fail to get his tax and spending plans passed by the splintered GOP Congress.

His biggest success will be in driving down the GOP’s poll numbers as the midterm elections get closer by the day.

A CBS poll shows Pelosi’s call for Congress to vote on any future military attack on Syria has the support of 69 percent of Americans, including a majority — 53 percent — of Republicans.

ADVERTISEMENT

But the House was in recess last week and there are no plans to bring it back this week.

Scheduling is not the issue.

The real problem is that Congressional Republicans run for the exit when they hear calls for a vote to authorize military action. They fear having to explain such a vote if the war effort goes badly.

At the moment, the Republican majority in Congress is happy to take no responsibility. They simply praise Trump for taking bold action and moving away from the cool, considered approach of President Obama.

That politically expedient response to the horror in Syria fits in perfectly with the two-faced behavior of Trump himself.

In 2013, he tweeted out his opposition to Obama taking military action in Syria. Now, confronted with the same problem — although this latest chemical attack by Syrian leader Bashar Assad is smaller than the one that brought Obama to the brink of military action — Trump is telling voters he had to act after he saw babies dying.

Babies were dying in 2013. So what did Trump’s missile strike accomplish beyond a symbolic, ineffectual use of force?

One key difference is that Trump has decided the U.S. is no longer focused on “getting Assad out,” in the words of Nikki Haley, Trump’s U.N. ambassador. That policy announcement might have led the Syrian leader to believe the U.S. would not respond when he resumed using chemical weapons.

The incoherence of the Trump policy for dealing with Assad’s brutality — more than 400,000 people have been killed in the Syrian civil war —allows Congress to escape its constitutional responsibility to vote for or against authorizing U.S. military action and declaring war.

Members of Congress are gun-shy because they know about the political backlash that followed congressional authorization for the Iraq War and the Vietnam War.

This political cowardice on the part of Congress is why the United States has not formally declared war against another country since the Second World War, 75 years ago.

It is also why the Congress hasn’t issued the less forceful substitute of an “authorization for the use of military force” (AUMF) by the president against another country since the second Iraq War, 14 years ago.

To his everlasting credit, Obama did send the Republican Congress an AUMF to fight ISIS back in 2013. Congress promptly ignored him, not even bothering to hold a vote.

They said they wanted a battle plan to prevent giving the president unlimited power.

Now, with Trump as commander-in-chief, the GOP majority in Congress is happy to look the other way while the missiles take flight.

Republican voters, meanwhile, are allowing Republican politicians to neglect their duty.

Four years ago, only 22 percent of Republicans, according to a Washington Post-ABC poll, supported Obama’s proposed airstrikes against Assad to punish him for using chemical weapons.

Now that there is a Republican in the White House, 86 percent of Republicans, according to a new Washington Post-ABC poll, support airstrikes to punish Assad for the same crime.

That is not the only big dose of hypocrisy.

A Post-ABC 2012 poll found that 67 percent of Republicans supported “U.S. military involvement in Syria” before Obama drew a “red line” against the use of chemical weapons.

It was only when Assad actually used the chemical weapons and Obama asked Congress to approve firing missiles into Syria that support from Republican voters sank to the 22 percent level.

In fact, 98 House Republicans put their signature on a 2013 letter to Obama to warn against airstrikes against Syria without first getting authorization from Congress.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellMcConnell vents over 'fake news' The Hill's 12:30 Report - Presented by Facebook - Tensions rise as U.S. waits for Derek Chauvin verdict Trump looking 'beyond seriously' at 2024 run MORE (R-Ky.), now a supporter of Trump’s airstrikes against Syria, denounced Obama.

“A vital national security risk is clearly not at play, there are just too many unanswered questions about our long-term strategy in Syria,” McConnell explained.

This crass display can only be described as partisan politics with no conscience — or outright hypocrisy.

There is one voice of responsibility emerging on Congress’ proper role in warfare. It comes from the Pentagon.

“I would take no issue with the Congress stepping forward with an AUMF. I think it'd be a statement of the American people's resolve,"" Secretary of Defense James Mattis told a Senate Committee last month. ""I thought the same thing for the last several years, I might add, and have not understood why the Congress hasn't come forward with this, at least to debate.""

Trump was elected on a promise to change the way Washington works and to respect the Constitution of the United States. What better way for him to demonstrate both — and prove he is different from all of his predecessors — than to demand Congress come back into session today and hold a vote to authorize further U.S. military action in Syria?

Advance Praise for We the People



“American democracy is continually being reborn, and Juan Williams brings alive the impact of some of the modern-day leaders of this renewal. By portraying people of different backgrounds and ideologies, he has created a series of narratives that are both inspiring and thought provoking.”

— Walter Isaacson



“In a Washington boiling with anger, some of it real and some of it synthetic, Juan Williams is a rarity. He combines strong beliefs with a cheerful ability to see how disparate people, including some with whom he disagrees, have enriched the American mosaic. From Robert Moses to Robert Ball, and from George Meany to Charlton Heston, this book will remind readers of some strong men and women who made the nation strong.”

–George F. Will



“The Founders of our nation, politically bold and intellectually adventurous, would be appalled at the idea that their revolutionary work would be used as a trump card against change, creative thinking, or social progress. The genius of Juan Williams’ We the People is that it shows how subsequent generations kept the promise of those who created our republic by building on their work rather than sitting back complacently, advancing the rights of excluded groups, and facing new problems squarely. Williams’ moving portraits of key figures in our national story show why the American gift for self-criticism and self-correction will always be one of our greatest assets.”

– E. J. Dionne Jr., author, Why the Right Went Wrong



“Juan Williams’ We the People is a fascinating intellectual romp through American history. All sorts of burning current event issues— the Gun Lobby, immigration, evangelical politics, sexual revolution— are brilliantly explored by Williams. Only a first rate mind could have written such a wide ranging and original survey. Highly recommended!”

–Douglas Brinkley, Professor of History at Rice University and author of Rightful Heritage: Franklin D. Roosevelt and the Land of America



“The Founders themselves would have approved of this ambitious and endlessly fascinating book. With his customary acumen, Juan Williams weaves together a rich montage of the people shaping a diverse and dynamic modern America. We the People is social history at its very finest, and belongs on the bookshelf of all history buffs. What a daring book! What a triumph!”

— Jay Winik, author of 1944 and April 1865



“Juan Williams has penned a rich, fascinating, and zesty tour among the men and women who have helped shape what we think of today when we think of America. The book is provocative, fun, and nonpartisan, all at the same time. Just what we need to explain how we got here, and where we might be headed.”

– Stephen L. Carter, William Nelson Cromwell Professor of Law at Yale University



“The battle over the Constitution and how the USA should be run rages on. For Americans who want an informed view of the great debate, there is no better book than We the People. I thank Juan Williams for writing it.”

21921,Williams,Juan,thehill,"At a campaign stop last year, Donald Trump saw one black man in a sea of white supporters. Without a drop of embarrassment he announced, “Oh, look at my African American over there. Look at him. Are you the greatest?”

Yes, it has got to be tough to be a black Republican in the Trump era.

It is all the harder after two terms of near-total black support for the first African American president — a Democrat whose right to be president was brought into question by a Trump-led, racially-charged ‘birther’ movement.

But there are black Republicans.

There is Dr. Ben Carson, Trump’s lone black cabinet member, as well as the actor The Rock, newsman Lester Holt, and basketball hero Charles Barkley. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and Sen. Tim Scott Timothy (Tim) Eugene ScottChauvin found guilty as nation exhales Lawmakers react to guilty verdict in Chauvin murder trial: 'Our work is far from done' Tim Scott: 'No question' Floyd jury reached 'the right verdict' MORE (R-S.C.) are bright lights of black conservatism in official Washington.

Recently, musician John Legend played a famous black Republican on television, starring as abolitionist Frederick Douglass.

Trump won eight percent of the black vote. That was better than GOP nominee Mitt Romney’s six percent in 2012. But an NBC exit poll last November found 68 percent of black voters to be “scared” of Trump’s brand of Republican politics.

Since then, Trump’s budget plans have aimed to cut funding for the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, potentially limiting monitoring of police abuse and voter disenfranchisement. He has also proposed cuts to programs in the Education Department, which are likely to undermine efforts to prepare minority students for college. And there are also cuts to funding for public housing programs.

In this moment of tense relations between President Trump Donald TrumpSt. Louis lawyer who pointed gun at Black Lives Matter protesters considering Senate run Chauvin found guilty as nation exhales US says Iran negotiations are 'positive' MORE and black America, it is important to separate Trump’s racial politics from the conservative principles that still attract black Americans.

Last week, one of history’s great black Republicans and conservatives, William T. Coleman Jr., passed away at age 96.

He was one of the seven percent of black people who are Republicans, the lowest percentage of any racial group in America. Far more black people are conservatives, though. A 2009 Pew poll reported that about 32 percent self-described as on the “conservative” end of the ideological spectrum.

One day, I walked into Coleman’s law office and he pointed at a bust on a bookshelf. He was surprised that I recognized the figure as the black Russian poet, Alexander Pushkin.

Pushkin was a hero to Coleman, as a black conservative, because Pushkin achieved success based on personal effort and education despite competing in an all-white world.

Coleman was an achiever.

As a leading legal mind, Coleman was a leading author of the briefs used by Thurgood Marshall, then lead counsel for the NAACP, in successfully arguing for the end of public school segregation in the 1954 Brown case.

Coleman later argued 19 times before the Supreme Court, including winning the case that the constitution protected interracial sex — a precursor to the court ruling in Loving v. Virginia that affirmed interracial marriage as a constitutional right.

Similarly, he won a Supreme Court case halting federal tax exemptions for segregated private schools.

All that success in arguing for racial integration — and his close alliance with leading liberals, including Marshall, during the civil rights movement — did not change Coleman’s allegiance to the GOP.

He became the second African American in a president’s cabinet, as transportation secretary for President Ford, a Republican.

Coleman’s brand of Republicanism celebrated personal responsibility, traditional family values and patriotism — he trained with the Tuskegee Airmen. He spoke up for black economic development free of racially-targeted government assistance.

He dismissed the black nationalist and black power movements as impractical, a waste of time in a predominantly white country.

His pragmatic view of race fit with Booker T. Washington’s call in the late 1800s for blacks to create alliances with whites even if it meant turning away from radical black activist demands for whites to admit racism and make reparations. Coleman, like Washington, kept his eyes on the long-run benefit of gradual racial reform.

But his pragmatism held a defiant edge. He refused to allow white racism to define him. In James Baldwin’s language, he was clear with whites that “I am not your negro.”

He held that view despite discrimination at top law firms that barred him despite having graduated first in class from Harvard Law School in 1946 and becoming the first black law clerk at the Supreme Court.

His black Republican identity led him to be a dealmaker between white Republicans and the civil rights movement. He pushed for Republicans to vote for the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights Act as a respected fellow conservative.

To this day, Republicans accused of racism are quick to point out that 80 percent of House Republicans and 82 percent of Senate Republicans backed the 1964 bill. Those are higher percentages than were seen in the Democratic Party, which then included a large contingent from the south intent on maintaining segregation.

The same held true for his influence at the Supreme Court.

When President Kennedy nominated Marshall to the Second Circuit Court Appeals in 1961, he ran into difficulty in the Senate. Southern Democrats were still smarting over the Brown decision and eyeing payback for Marshall’s role in the victory.

As I wrote in my biography of Justice Marshall, “Thurgood Marshall — American Revolutionary,” Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter was heard telling friends around Washington that while he liked Marshall personally, he was not qualified for the appeals court.

Coleman knew that if Frankfurter’s criticism went public it would give ammunition to segregationists out to defeat Marshall.

Coleman’s personal relationship with Frankfurter led the justice to end his criticism. Marshall was confirmed to the appeals court, which led to his later appointment as solicitor general and finally to the Supreme Court.

The Washington Post’s obituary of Coleman noted that President Clinton gave him the country’s highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and praised him as a man of “disciplined devotion to the things that make this country a great place.”

That is a Democrat speaking about a real black conservative.

It is no fantasy to say the drip-drip-drip of the Trump-Russia investigations is draining this presidency of political capital. The president’s historically high disapproval rating — 51 percent in the latest McClatchy poll — tells the same story.

That’s why astute Republicans are starting to look out for themselves.

The struggle for Republicans in Congress is two-fold.

First, they have to avoid being blamed for undermining the legitimacy of the Trump presidency. But, secondly, they are worried about the damage Trump will do to their party’s fortunes in the 2018 midterms.

The Democrats have a different political challenge.

They have to figure out how to respond to White House efforts to distract the public by denigrating the intelligence agencies and derailing the Congressional investigations.

Rep. Adam Schiff Adam Bennett SchiffGroups see new openings for digging up dirt on Trump Overnight Defense: Administration says 'low to moderate confidence' Russia behind Afghanistan troop bounties | 'Low to medium risk' of Russia invading Ukraine in next few weeks | Intelligence leaders face sharp questions during House worldwide threats he Hillicon Valley: Biden administration sanctions Russia for SolarWinds hack, election interference MORE (D-Calif.), the ranking member on the House Intelligence panel, has become a model on that score by avoiding political statements.

He limits himself to saying there is “more than circumstantial evidence” that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to influence the election.

As a result, Schiff looks virtuous compared to the committee’s chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.). The Republican has failed by playing along with Trump officials who are busy suggesting that the whole controversy has been ginned up by anti-Trump intelligence agents and left-over Obama administration officials.

In the Senate, the Democrats are also unified behind the political strategy of Minority Leader Charles Schumer Chuck SchumerLawmakers react to guilty verdict in Chauvin murder trial: 'Our work is far from done' Overnight Health Care: Johnson & Johnson pause seen as 'responsible' in poll | Women turning out more than men for COVID-19 vaccines 'Real Housewives of the GOP' — Wannabe reality show narcissists commandeer the party MORE (D-N.Y.). He is threatening to filibuster Trump’s nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.

""It is unseemly to be moving forward so fast on confirming a Supreme Court justice with a lifetime appointment while this big gray cloud of an FBI investigation hangs over the presidency,” Schumer said recently.

But the Trump White House continues to pursue a failing strategy of distraction.

In conspiratorial terms, these Trump insiders point to a shadowy clique of Washington hands — the so-called anti-Trump “Deep State” — trying to bring down the populist president.

Trump tried his hand at the change-the-subject game with his unsupported claim that President Obama was wiretapping him. That is now a claim that all but his most stalwart allies have abandoned.

Democrats also have to contend with the Trump White House effort to undermine the Congressional investigations. The Washington Post reported last week on White House efforts to stop former Attorney General Sally Yates from giving testimony.

The good news for Democrats is that the White House is not very good at distracting anyone from the Russia scandal.

White House aides got caught leaking documents to Nunes in an attempt to shift media attention to charges of potentially illegal surveillance of Trump campaign officials.

That backfired when the names of the White House aides ended up in The New York Times. One of the men, Ezra Cohen-Watnick, a 30-year-old at the National Security Council, had recently been targeted for dismissal by his boss H.R. McMaster, the national security adviser. Cohen-Watnick had to appeal to the president to save his job.

In this chaos, Democrats have the luxury of watching and expressing apolitical regret. After all, most of the Democratic base views still views Trump as a racist, a huckster, a sexual predator and an illegitimate president.

Democrats have also been emboldened by the health care debacle. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) literally took off her shoes and jumped for joy with protestors outside the Capitol after the vote was pulled.

It has been said that predictions make fools of us all. The campaign and the election that brought Trump to power certainly proved that, since the majority of the media — myself included — predicted he would not win.

But it is no liberal fantasy to say the odds of a Trump resignation or impeachment before 2020 are looking better by the day.

21924,Williams,Juan,thehill,"Right-wing media to President Obama: We are so very sorry.

That’s the message I got last week from the conservative Wall Street Journal editorial page.

The Journal abandoned efforts to make sense of President Trump’s outright fiction that Obama wiretapped him. Its editorial page — never a friend to Obama — wrote this last week about Trump:

“[He] clings to his assertion like a drunk to an empty gin bottle, rolling out his press spokesman to make more dubious claims.”

ADVERTISEMENT

Wow. The Journal was sharply critical of Obama but never said he had the credibility of a drunkard.

They are not yet saying “Thanks, Obama,” but their words do stir new appreciation for the good old days under the previous president.

Will right-wing talk radio follow the Journal’s example?

Imagine the reaction from far-right talk radio — the people who raised hell and their ratings by attacking Obama daily with accusations about fake scandals — if the 44thpresident had lied about his predecessor or if people in his circle had been taking money from Russia.

Imagine the outburst from Rush Limbaugh — the king of conservative talk radio — if the Justice Department told Obama that his National Security Advisor had lied about discussing sanctions with Russian government officials and Obama had waited three weeks to demand that person’s resignation.

And what would Hugh Hewitt say on radio if it was later revealed that the advisor took over $65,000 from companies linked to Vladimir Putin’s Russia, in addition to pocketing more than $500,000 from moonlighting as a lobbyist tied to the Turkish government?

What might my friend, conservative radio host Lars Larson, have said if Obama’s former campaign manager had taken $10 million from Russian oligarchs to — in his words — “greatly benefit” the interests of Putin’s Russia inside the U.S.?

Of course, the reality is Obama’s team never engaged in such damaging acts. It is Trump’s team that is under investigation for all of these charges of scandalous behavior.

Radio talk show hosts on the right have great ratings but they are not elected to defend the democratic basis of our government. That job belongs to Congress.

But House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), has become an apologist for Trump. Last week, he rushed over to the White House to say he had seen transcripts of apparently legal intercepts that may have swept up some Trump campaign officials.

Was this evidence that Obama wiretapped Trump as he was running for president? No. Even Nunes admits that. But by briefing the White House before sharing the information with his own committee, Nunes revealed himself as an advocate for the Trump White House.

Nunes, who served on the Trump transition team, compromised any claim to independence and threw away the credibility he needs.

Before Nunes’ rash action it was left to the top Democrat on the House Intelligence panel, Rep. Adam Schiff Adam Bennett SchiffGroups see new openings for digging up dirt on Trump Overnight Defense: Administration says 'low to moderate confidence' Russia behind Afghanistan troop bounties | 'Low to medium risk' of Russia invading Ukraine in next few weeks | Intelligence leaders face sharp questions during House worldwide threats he Hillicon Valley: Biden administration sanctions Russia for SolarWinds hack, election interference MORE (D-Calif.), to explain to the nation what the House panel had already found:

“Last summer, at the height of a bitterly contested and hugely consequential presidential campaign, [Russia]…intervened in an effort to weaken our democracy, and to influence the outcome for one candidate and against the other,” Schiff said.

Schiff made more news later in the week when he told Chuck Todd of NBC News, “there is more than circumstantial evidence” that there was collusion between the Russians and the Trump campaign.

Meanwhile, House Republicans continue injuring the party’s brand as they busily sweep dirt from the Russia scandal under the White House carpet.

But even the attempted congressional cover-up can’t fool the public — not even in concert with the silence from right-wing talk radio hosts. Look at the polling: Trump’s approval ratings are at historic lows for any president in the modern age at this point in his presidency.

A Quinnipiac poll last week found his approval rating had fallen to 37 percent while his disapproval rating had risen to 56 percent. According to the same poll, 60 percent of voters say he is “not honest,” 55 percent say he “does not have good leadership skills” and 57 percent say he “does not care about average Americans.”

What could be driving the president’s collapsing poll numbers?

The Quinnipiac results suggest an answer.

A whopping 70 percent of voters do not believe Trump’s claim that Obama wiretapped him last year. Just 19 percent believe — in the face of the evidence — that Obama did so.

In perhaps the most damning result in the Quinnipiac survey, 73 percent of voters say Trump’s administration makes “statements without evidence to support them ‘very often’ or ‘somewhat often.’”

Again, it was left to the Wall Street Journal editorial page to admit that the Trump White House is drowning in a vast credibility crisis.

“If President Trump announces that North Korea launched a missile that landed within 100 miles of Hawaii, would most Americans believe him?” The Journal wrote. “Would the rest of the world? We’re not sure, which speaks to the damage that Mr. Trump is doing to his Presidency with his seemingly endless stream of exaggerations, evidence-free accusations, implausible denials and other falsehoods.”

President Obama, please accept the right wing’s many apologies.

Conservative political observers are also connecting the troubled GOP healthcare proposal to the Republicans’ longstanding promise to act on tax reform.

Once again, the most important tweet last week in conservative politics did not come from President @realDonaldTrump. It came from Matt Drudge, the proprietor of the Drudge Report.

“Republicans lied about wanting tax cuts,” he tweeted. “Can we get our votes back?”

Drudge is looking ahead on the political horizon and seeing that ObamaCare replacement and tax reform can’t be separated. Without a healthcare plan that cuts federal spending, there is no chance for tax reform.

President Trump stunned a lot of people with his honesty when he recently blurted out that he’d discovered that healthcare is “an unbelievably complex subject.” He added that he remained determined on healthcare for one reason:

“And for budget purposes, as you know, we have to do healthcare before we do the tax cut,” he explained.

Speaker Paul Ryan Paul Davis RyanOn The Money: Senate confirms Gensler to lead SEC | Senate GOP to face off over earmarks next week | Top Republican on House tax panel to retire Trump faces test of power with early endorsements Lobbying world MORE (R-Wis.) acknowledged as much to my Fox colleague Maria Bartiromo last week, while begging for his House caucus to support the problem-filled GOP healthcare proposal.

“It makes tax reform a lot harder, it makes it more difficult…” without a new, low-cost healthcare plan, Ryan noted.

In fact, Ryan built the House healthcare plan on the bedrock promise that it contains “massive tax relief.”

But now with the GOP majority’s mash-up of an effort to replace ObamaCare, the tax reform plan looks like it is headed for the graveyard. The only hope for the GOP is to demand party loyalty to the ObamaCare replacement plan in the service of reviving the tax cuts. Ryan and Trump are twisting arms by telling GOP lawmakers that if they don’t pass tax reform, angry Republican voters will punish them in the 2018 midterms.

But high pressure tactics to produce tax cuts can’t hide the GOP’s health reform implosion. After seven years of campaigning against ObamaCare, including numerous repeal votes and acts of open sabotage, Congressional Republicans have failed to come up with a better plan. They don’t even have an inferior plan they can agree on.

Voters have noticed. A Fox News poll showed 54 percent disapproval of the Republican plan. About two-thirds of those who dislike the proposal say their complaint is about “too many changes to ObamaCare.”

To save political face, Ryan is reversing course. He is signaling an openness to changing the failed GOP plan to buy votes from members of his caucus who are walking away from the fiasco.

Even with that SOS call, the Speaker’s problem is that the Tea Party’s Freedom Caucus wants more cuts to ObamaCare programs for seniors and the poor. That kind of fix will not arrest the decline in public support.

Meanwhile, Republicans and their allies in the business community are having anxiety attacks at the prospect of tax reform disappearing. They are divided over tax reform proposals, too.

The biggest problem the Republicans face is the so-called “border adjustment tax.” Big manufacturers like Boeing support it, while big retailers like Walmart oppose it.

Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch Orrin Grant HatchPress: Forget bipartisanship — it's dead! Privatization of foster care has been a disaster for children Remembering Ted Kennedy highlights decline of the Senate MORE (R- Utah) is not upbeat about the border adjustment tax: “I don’t think it’s going to pass over here. There’s not a lot of enthusiasm for it. We’re already working on what we’d like to do.”

Trump’s chief economic advisor, Gary Cohn, raised the bar even higher when he told CNBC recently that any tax cut plan will be “deficit neutral over a 10-year period.”

To make matters worse, other fault lines in the tax debate are emerging amongst Republicans.

“The fight over a border-adjustment tax isn’t the only challenge for Republicans in their push for tax reform,” The Hill reported last week. “Notably, some business groups have criticized the proposal to do away with the deduction for businesses’ net interest expenses.”

As The Hill also notes, conservative interest groups are pressing House Republicans to oppose Trump’s campaign promise to eliminate the carried interest tax break.

It’s not like Trump and Republicans lack political cover to go bold on taxes. The problem is that the Congressional GOP is unable to reach consensus within its ranks on even its most basic principles.

It is worth remembering that back in 2014, then-House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp, a Michigan Republican, put forward a reasonable tax reform proposal. It was revenue neutral and lowered rates on 99 percent of Americans. His fellow Republicans ignored him. They were busy demonizing ObamaCare.

In their talking points, Congressional Republicans like to remind people that the nation has not seen comprehensive tax reform since 1986, when Republican President Ronald Reagan worked with a Democratic Speaker, Tip O’Neill.

Republicans are learning there is a reason why it hasn’t happened in over three decades. Perhaps they should have listened to Camp when they had the chance.

When it comes to a healthcare plan and tax reform, the GOP might as well echo the famous words of the comic-strip character Pogo: “We have met the enemy and he is us.”

If Congress can’t pass the current flawed Republican plan, Trump told leading conservative groups last week, he has a Plan B. It is to keep badmouthing the Affordable Care Act as a “disaster” and then blame Democrats when ObamaCare collapses.

He is going to need a Plan C because there is a big problem with Plan B.

If the Affordable Care Act ever fails, it will be because of Republicans.

It was Senate Republicans, led by Sen.

And Republicans in 19 states refused to expand Medicaid, keeping about 4 million eligible Americans away from health insurance offered by ObamaCare.

It was Trump who cancelled advertising aimed at bringing more people into the program. Congressional Republicans also made a point of scaring away sports teams and celebrities ready to join in public service campaigns to tell people about the benefits of getting health insurance under the Affordable Care Act (ACA).

Who can forget all the scary claims coming from Congressional Republicans and candidate Trump about skyrocketing premiums under ObamaCare? They sounded the alarm without saying that most people in ObamaCare had nothing to fear because of federal subsidies. They also did not mention that premiums would have been higher without ObamaCare.

Despite the Republican effort, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected enrollment in ObamaCare would jump from 10 million in 2017 to 13 million in the next ten years.

Actual enrollment for ObamaCare 2017, despite the non-stop GOP chorus predicting its death, came in at 9.2 million, about 500,000 less than in 2016. “Open enrollment was a success, and it would have been even higher without the Trump administration’s efforts to suppress enrollment,” Leslie Dach, director of the Protect Our Care Coalition, told CNBC in February.

Also in December, Standard and Poor’s investment ratings service said an increasing number of insurance companies participating in the ObamaCare program would make money this year.

And the CBO reported last week that ObamaCare would cost one-third less than originally projected. It is saving money.

Opinion polls also show rising public support for ObamaCare in the face of all the Republican libels.

Pew Research Center and Kaiser Family Foundation both report record high levels of support for ObamaCare, with Pew finding 54 percent of the public approving of the healthcare program while 43 percent remain in opposition.

A Monmouth University poll released last week also found that a majority of Americans — 51 percent — say they want Congress to keep the ACA and improve it.

“Any changes in ObamaCare will need to take into account that a clear majority want it either left alone or expanded,” Dr. Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion, said after releasing a late February poll showing 67 percent opposition to complete repeal.

These polls are evidence that Republicans are so intent on damaging ObamaCare that they are no longer listening to voters.

The House Republicans’ replacement plan, the American Health Care Act, has not been scored by the non-partisan CBO. But critics on the left and right have been fiercely critical. And key questions remain, such as exactly how much it will cost and how many people it will leave uninsured.

Amazingly, the Trump White House is trying to pre-emptively discredit the CBO before it issues its report. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said at a briefing last week “If you’re looking to the CBO for accuracy, you’re looking in the wrong place.”

But attacking the CBO is not going to be enough to fool anyone. Even among conservative hardliners, there is opposition to the House version of a new healthcare plan. Tea Party pressure groups like Heritage Action, and Koch brothers-funded groups like Americans for Prosperity and FreedomWorks came out swinging against the bill.

Perhaps the most important foe of the House bill is the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), which represents over 38 million senior citizens.

“This bill would weaken Medicare's fiscal sustainability, dramatically increase health care costs for Americans aged 50-64 and put at risk the health care of millions of children and adults with disabilities, and poor seniors who depend on the Medicaid program for long-term services and supports and other benefits,"" wrote AARP senior vice president Joyce A. Rogers.

Also standing in opposition to the GOP plan are the American Medical Association (AMA), the American Nurses Association (ANA), the American Hospital Association (AHA) and the American College of Physicians (ACP).

According to exit polls, voters over the age of 65 backed Trump over Clinton, 52 percent to 45 percent in the November election. The blowback from those voters over the GOP failure to produce a better healthcare plan could produce a nightmare for Republicans in the 2018 midterms.

President Trump, however, is pushing the bill and Congressional GOP leadership say they are confident that it will pass.

Perhaps they have been in the right-wing media bubble so long that they can no longer discern reality from their talking points when it comes to ObamaCare.

Spoiler Alert: This political thriller ends with the president’s top aides striking plea bargains with federal prosecutors to reduce prison sentences.

The U.S. has a rich recent history of special prosecutors. The odds are rising that one more is coming to look into alleged links between the Trump campaign and Russia.

The dwindling trust in the GOP majority in Congress to conduct such a probe is due to the fading credibility of the Senate Intelligence Committee. The problem is that the Republican chairman of that panel, Sen.

Last month, it was revealed that Burr was one of the Republicans asked by White House chief of staff Reince Priebus to speak with reporters to downplay damaging news stories about Trump campaign contacts with the Russians.

Charles Schumer Chuck SchumerLawmakers react to guilty verdict in Chauvin murder trial: 'Our work is far from done' Overnight Health Care: Johnson & Johnson pause seen as 'responsible' in poll | Women turning out more than men for COVID-19 vaccines 'Real Housewives of the GOP' — Wannabe reality show narcissists commandeer the party MORE (D-N.Y.), the top Democrat in the Senate, had been slow to bury Burr with a call for a special prosecutor, perhaps seeking to avoid charges that he was politicizing the probe.

But on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday, Schumer did make that call. A special prosecutor was necessary, he asserted, to probe ""whether the Trump campaign was complicit in working with the Russians to influence the election.""

On cue, last week Sessions had to recuse himself from the FBI’s probes into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia after the Washington Post revealed he met with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. twice last year. Those details seemed to contradict sworn testimony he gave during his Senate confirmation hearing.

Even former President George W. Bush told NBC’s “Today” last week, “we all need answers” on the current president’s ties to Russia.

If trust in the Senate probe is weak, then the credibility of any House investigation is even weaker.

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) served with Sessions on Trump’s presidential transition team. Nunes was also one of the lawmakers actively recruited by Priebus to counter stories about Trump’s ties to Russia.

Nunes gave a rambling press conference last week in which he said he did not want the committee’s investigation to turn into a “witch-hunt” and warned of “McCarthyism” where innocent Americans were “haul[ed] before Congress.”

Rep. Darrell Issa, the California Republican who was a bulldog when he chaired the House Oversight Committee during the Obama years, told Bill Maher that the situation warranted a special prosecutor. Later he changed his tune, saying he was willing to wait. But Issa’s backpedalling took place before Sessions recused himself.

And last week, we learned that the Trump White House Counsel’s office issued a memo to all White House staff instructing them to preserve all documents related to Russia.

If history is a guide, all that is left now is for public pressure to build on the GOP and the special prosecutor to be named.

Here’s a quick look at that history:

During the Iran-Contra affair, President Reagan tried to put the scandal behind him by agreeing to the appointment of a special prosecutor, Lawrence Walsh. Walsh indicted several of Reagan's top aides, including Defense Secretary Caspar ""Cap"" Weinberger.

During President Clinton's first term, shady controversies from his time as governor of Arkansas led to the appointment of the special prosecutor Kenneth Starr and set the stage for the Monica Lewinsky sex story that resulted in Clinton's impeachment.

President George W. Bush's Attorney General, John Ashcroft, recused himself from a White House probe. His deputy then appointed an independent special counsel to find out who leaked the name of a CIA agent. That special prosecutor, Patrick Fitzgerald, won the conviction of the Vice President's chief of staff, Lewis ‘Scooter’ Libby.

John McCain John Sidney McCainBush says he doesn't criticize other presidents to avoid risking friendship with Michelle Obama 'Real Housewives of the GOP' — Wannabe reality show narcissists commandeer the party George W.

""Have no doubt, what the Russians tried to do to our election could have destroyed democracy,"" McCain said.

Julius Caesar feared the “Ides of March” with good reason. As the middle of the month approaches, President Trump and his GOP supporters will be under fearsome pressure to go along with the naming of a special prosecutor.

21931,Williams,Juan,thehill,"Sixty-six percent of Americans are “worried” that President Trump will lead the country into a “major war” in his first term, according to an NBC News/Survey Monkey poll released last week.

The high level of anxiety over the president is also evident in his low approval numbers, just a month into his first term.

With the president set to address a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night, the voters are making it clear — both in polls and in town hall meetings — that they are nervous about Trump. They are trusting in Congress’ power to stop him from taking the country on a wild ride that might veer out of control.

ADVERTISEMENT

Since Republicans hold the majority in both the House and the Senate, the pressure falls heavily on the GOP to police the president.

Across the country, voters have poured into town halls with members of Congress to demand close oversight of Trump on three topics in particular.

They want the GOP to put a better health insurance plan in place before ending ObamaCare.

They want Congress to take a serious look at the scandal involving former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn.

And they are full of doubts about the Republican Senate’s ability to investigate apparent Russian interference in the presidential election, given that the alleged interference appears to have helped the Republican candidate.

At this point, most presidents are in a ‘honeymoon’ period with the public, often enjoying an approval rating of around 60 percent.

But last week, a CBS News poll had Trump at 39 percent approval and 51 percent disapproval; Gallup had similar results at 43 percent approval and 52 percent disapproval; and Quinnipiac had him at 38 percent approval and 55 percent disapproval.

These negative polls are dismissed by Trump. He reminds friendly rallies of the polls that failed to see him winning in November. But for members of Congress, the polls — like the town hall meetings — are a series of urgent, flashing red lights.

A Morning Consult/Politico poll last week found 53 percent of Americans saying they want Congress to “serve as a check on the president,” while only 31 percent favor Congress following his lead on legislation.

Even Republican voters want Congress to play a strong role in watching over what is happening at the White House. The same poll finds more than a third of Republicans, 37 percent, saying they want Congress to put a “check” on the president so as to keep the country from going off track. Republicans in Congress can’t ignore more than a third of their own voters.

The clear expectation for Congress to manage and monitor the Trump White House is making Republicans nervous because their jobs will be on the line in the 2018 midterms, long before the next presidential election.

As the president’s approval remains in the 40 percent range, according to one analysis by the FiveThirtyEight blog, there is “an increasingly strong relationship between how people feel about the president and how they vote for Congress.”

FiveThirtyEight’s very early and wildly inexact attempt at an estimate suggests that if the president remains this unpopular by the time of the 2018 House races, Republicans “would be forecast to lose roughly 40 seats.” That would easily give Democrats the House majority for the last two years of Trump’s first term.

The New York Times’ “Upshot” notes, however, that congressional districts have been drawn by Republicans to their advantage. The reality is that the party has a “better chance to ride out a president’s weak approval ratings than in the past.” Even so, the Times notes that most presidents see their approval rating fall after their first month. If Trump’s approval rating “falls into the mid-to-low 30s, the Republicans could be in serious trouble.”

In addition, the 2018 Senate midterms are favorably organized for Republicans. The GOP is defending only 8 incumbents in the election while Democrats will have 25 incumbents on the ballot. In the House, Democrats will have to win 24 seats to capture the majority.

The favorable terrain for Republicans has donations flowing into the party at a record pace since the November election. The Hill reported last week that the Republican National Committee collected $16.2 million in December ­— almost double what they raised in the same period four years ago, after President Obama won his second term.

The Democratic National Committee has not posted its fundraising totals. But the split in the party over the election of a new chairman and last year’s scandal involving hacked emails have made fundraising difficult. The party’s base is energized in opposition to Trump but so far that has primarily boosted fundraising for outside groups such as Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).

The ACLU reported raising $24 million in one weekend after it sued to stop Trump’s ban on immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries. Democrats are waiting to see if they can attract similar record donations.

The Republicans, meanwhile, are having trouble finding strong candidates to run against incumbent Senate Democrats, even in states carried by Trump. Republican House members with strong credentials, including Reps. Sean Duffy Sean DuffyLobbying world CNN's Ana Navarro to host Biden roundtable on making 'Trump a one-term president' Bottom line MORE (Wis.), Pat Meehan (Pa.) and Ryan Zinke (Mont.) have all decided against entering Senate races.

Trump will be center stage Tuesday night. But voters clearly have their eyes on the people they sent to Congress to see how closely they are watching the president.

21932,Williams,Juan,thehill,"At what point do Republicans in Congress start looking out for their political future and go after President Trump’s ties to Russia?

Even before the president’s national security advisor Michael Flynn was forced out, Gallup had President Trump with the worst ratings of his presidency so far — 55 percent disapproval to 40 percent approval.

At that point, the top Republican in the Senate, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellMcConnell vents over 'fake news' The Hill's 12:30 Report - Presented by Facebook - Tensions rise as U.S. waits for Derek Chauvin verdict Trump looking 'beyond seriously' at 2024 run MORE (Ky.), began talking like a man concerned about keeping his majority.

He complained to the conservative Weekly Standard that the president’s approval numbers would be “10 to 15 points higher if he allowed himself to stay on message.”

“What [Trump’s] saying makes everything harder,” McConnell said — and that was before Trump’s epic Thursday press conference in which the president claimed stories about Russian involvement in the election amounted to “fake news.”

Flynn was forced to resign, apparently for misleading Vice President Mike Pence Michael (Mike) Richard PenceHispanic Caucus energized by first Biden meeting Simon & Schuster rejects employees' call to drop Pence book deal Jeffries roasts McCarthy over Waters: 'Clean up your own mess' MORE about a phone call he held with the Russian ambassador during which U.S. sanctions were discussed. That was followed by a New York Times report of regular contact between Trump campaign officials and Russian intelligence agents in the year leading up to last November’s election.

McConnell’s tone took on a sharp edge as he began separating himself from Trump.

“You know, everybody looks at last year’s election,” he said on MSNBC, “and says it was a change election. Well, it was in the presidential race, but in the Senate races, it was not a change election.”

If a White House scandal begins to damage the GOP brand, the political dynamic will shift. The 2018 midterm elections defined by Trump scandals will threaten Republican control of the Senate — not the Trump White House.

If Republicans in Congress look to be covering up a national scandal, they open the door to a “change election” that pushes them out of power.

The Senate Intelligence Committee has already pledged to investigate the Russian controversy. But that is not enough for Sen. Claire McCaskill Claire Conner McCaskillRepublicans fret over divisive candidates Greitens Senate bid creates headache for GOP The Hill's Morning Report - Biden tasks Harris on border; news conference today MORE (D-Mo.), who argues that the GOP majority on that panel could lead to a cover-up.

“Republicans need to look in the mirror and do a gut check,” she told the New York Times. She wants an open, public investigation in the form of a select committee.

Top Senate Republicans are resisting a select committee so far.

But the counter-threat for Republicans is the prospect of a catastrophic 2018 election.

Sen. Charles Schumer Chuck SchumerLawmakers react to guilty verdict in Chauvin murder trial: 'Our work is far from done' Overnight Health Care: Johnson & Johnson pause seen as 'responsible' in poll | Women turning out more than men for COVID-19 vaccines 'Real Housewives of the GOP' — Wannabe reality show narcissists commandeer the party MORE (D-N.Y.), the Senate Minority Leader, is not ramping up the calls for a select committee. He only asked that McConnell and Sen. Richard Burr Richard Mauze BurrSenate confirms SEC chief Gensler to full five-year term A proposal to tackle congressional inside trading: Invest in the US Former Gov. Pat McCrory enters GOP Senate race in North Carolina MORE (R-N.C.), the head of the Intelligence Committee, promise to “making their findings as public as possible,” including open testimony from Trump campaign and transition officials.

Burr pledged there would be no political limits on the probe, promising his committee will “go anywhere the intelligence leads.”

Already, Senate Republicans are open to writing a law requiring Congress to sign off on any changes in the current sanctions against Russia imposed by the Obama administration.

It is a different story in the House, where fear of blowback from Trump supporters has the leadership playing defense for the president.

The House Intelligence Committee is chaired by Rep. Devin Nunes, a California Republican who served with Gen. Flynn on Trump’s presidential transition team at a time when some of the illicit communication between Trump’s team and Russia apparently was going on.

Does this mean that Nunes is investigating himself, along with his House colleagues who also served on the transition team?

In addition, House Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Jason Chaffetz Jason ChaffetzCongress's latest hacking investigation should model its most recent Fox News Audio expands stable of podcasts by adding five new shows The myth of the conservative bestseller MORE (R-Utah) said last week his committee would not be investigating the Flynn scandal.

""I think that situation has taken care of itself,” Chaffetz said. “I know that the Intel committee is looking into the hacking issue.”

Chaffetz had no problem asserting his committee’s broad jurisdiction over matters of national security when they were looking into Benghazi.

Chaffetz did call for an investigation by the Department of Justice on the Russian issue — but not into Flynn, only into who leaked the transcripts to reporters.

That is consistent with Trump’s complaint that the real story is media bias against him, as well as leaks from the intelligence agencies intended to do political damage.

Senate Republicans have fully accepted that there needs to be some form of investigation.

“I don’t think we need to go through setting up a special committee,” McConnell said. “But we are going to look at Russian involvement in the U.S. elections. It’s a significant issue.”

The contrast between how Speaker Paul Ryan Paul Davis RyanOn The Money: Senate confirms Gensler to lead SEC | Senate GOP to face off over earmarks next week | Top Republican on House tax panel to retire Trump faces test of power with early endorsements Lobbying world MORE’s (R-Wis.) House Republicans and McConnell’s Senate Republications handle Flynn is instructive.

Just as Ryan mishandled Trump’s candidacy during the campaign, he is mishandling Trump’s presidency. Ryan did chide Trump over the Muslim ban and his slander of Judge Gonzalo Curiel’s integrity on the basis of his ethnicity. But Ryan still backed him on the basis of party unity.

McConnell, on the other hand, kept his mouth shut and never took the bait when asked to respond to a Trump tweet or rude remark, instead focusing on preserving his Senate majority.

As last week showed, McConnell is a much shrewder political operator than his party colleagues in the House.

He is putting daylight between Trump and the fate of the Senate GOP majority.

21934,Williams,Juan,thehill,"The big news for the GOP majority on Capitol Hill last week came as a tweet — and it was not from President Trump.

Matt Drudge, the proprietor of The Drudge Report, the conservative website which played a leading role in the rise of the new president, raised eyebrows with this note:

ADVERTISEMENT

“Republican Party should be sued for fraud. No discussion of tax cuts now. Just lots of crazy. Back to basics, guys!”

Later he pointed to the inability of the Trump White House to immediately dismantle President Obama’s Affordable Care Act, asking “meanwhile, is Obamacare penalty tax still in place?”

Drudge’s scolding was amplified by another leading voice in the successful Republican takeover of Congress, my Fox News colleague Sean Hannity.

Hannity called the Republicans in Congress “spineless, gutless, timid politicians.” He lambasted them for failing to keep their promise to kill off ObamaCare. During campaign season, Republicans — and their sirens in the media — demonized ObamaCare to win the votes that enabled the GOP to maintain its majorities in the House and Senate. The strategy also helped Trump win control of the White House.

Hannity and Drudge are among the loudest — if not the most powerful — voices speaking to the hard right base. Their unforgiving attacks on Obama, Democrats and the old-school Republican establishment stirred the populist resentments that shaped today’s Congress.

So, the speed with which these conservative media titans have turned on their creations — the politicians they helped put in power at the Capitol and White House — is a sign of the deep divisions already splitting the ruling Republican majority in Washington.

The right-wing media-led assault that won elections with the promise to disrupt Washington politics is now confronting reality. As the governing party, the GOP is now accountable for what comes after the party disrupts and tears down existing programs.

But note that the fire is not evenly distributed.

While Drudge is not happy with what he considers the slow pace of attack coming from the Trump White House, both he and Hannity are aiming their strongest shots at Republicans on Capitol Hill.

Meanwhile, Democrats are smiling as they watch Republican members of Congress come increasingly under siege at town hall meetings. Voters are alarmed at the idea that their ObamaCare benefits might be stripped away by the GOP, and no comparable services offered in their place.

The public anger at the town halls and Trump’s high public disapproval rating — 53 percent of adults give him the thumbs-down, according to the most recent CNN/ORC survey — have led to the rising conservative media discontent.

Less than two months into what Speaker Paul Ryan Paul Davis RyanOn The Money: Senate confirms Gensler to lead SEC | Senate GOP to face off over earmarks next week | Top Republican on House tax panel to retire Trump faces test of power with early endorsements Lobbying world MORE (R-Wis.) called the “dawn of a new, unified Republican government,” the discontent on the right is revealing the shallow limits of negative ads and sloganeering at rowdy rallies.

Ambitious campaign rhetoric about cutting taxes, for example, is now entangled in the reality of negotiations over a “border adjustment tax” and the potential for a trade war, sparked by the tariffs on imports promised by Trump.

As for doing away with ObamaCare, the impassioned GOP promise to repeal now faces the reality that after almost seven years the party has no plan strong enough to attract enough votes to pass both the House and Senate.

Trump admitted last week that repeal of ObamaCare is now an issue to be dealt with down the road: by the end of the year at the earliest and possibly in 2018. All the president could promise is that “it’ll take till sometime into next year but we’re certainly going to be in the process.”

The president also noted that he has discovered the process is “very complicated.”

One source of that complication is division between the Trump White House and veteran Republican leaders, the so-called establishment.

Sen. Lamar Alexander Lamar AlexanderSenate GOP faces retirement brain drain The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by the National Shooting Sports Foundation - CDC news on gatherings a step toward normality Blunt's retirement deals blow to McConnell inner circle MORE (R-Tenn.), the chairman of the Senate’s Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which deals with healthcare, put the populist Republican call for Trump to repeal ObamaCare immediately in perspective this way:

“No one is talking about repealing anything until there is a concrete practical alternative to offer Americans in its place.”

Tax reform and ObamaCare are not the only issues dividing Republicans in power from the media voices that once championed them.

When Trump recently defended Russian President Vladimir Putin against charges that he is a “killer,” by arguing that “there are a lot of killers – you think our country’s so innocent?” – MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough, a former Republican congressman, responded angrily.

“President Trump’s claim that America is morally on par with Russia’s corrupt dystopian regime was so historically ignorant that even timid Republicans felt compelled to speak out this week,” Scarborough wrote in The Washington Post. “Perhaps that is because remaining silent in the face of such a morally disorienting claim would make them look like fools.”

Scarborough’s critique reflects the split between the Trump White House and several Republicans in Congress on maintaining sanctions against Russia.

Last week, Republican Sens. John McCain John Sidney McCainBush says he doesn't criticize other presidents to avoid risking friendship with Michelle Obama 'Real Housewives of the GOP' — Wannabe reality show narcissists commandeer the party George W.

Even Trump’s issuance of executive orders to create the image of keeping his campaign promises is being derided in some quarters as “small ball” and “mundane,” in the words of Gregory Korte in USA Today.

Attacking ObamaCare once rallied the GOP base. Now, failure to act on those campaign attacks has Drudge tweeting that Republicans “only know how to be opposition not lead! DANGER.”

Yes, danger for Republicans.

21935,Williams,Juan,thehill,"Here’s the dangerous state of play on the political chessboard as the battle over President Trump’s nominee for the Supreme Court intensifies.

Republicans hold the clear advantage.

Sen. Charles Schumer Chuck SchumerLawmakers react to guilty verdict in Chauvin murder trial: 'Our work is far from done' Overnight Health Care: Johnson & Johnson pause seen as 'responsible' in poll | Women turning out more than men for COVID-19 vaccines 'Real Housewives of the GOP' — Wannabe reality show narcissists commandeer the party MORE (D-N.Y.), the Senate’s minority leader with 48 votes, is facing a political trap.

If he moves to employ a filibuster against the nominee, federal Judge Neil Gorsuch, he opens the door to a devastating counter: The so-called “nuclear option,” whereby the GOP could change the rules and end the use of filibusters against Supreme Court nominees.

On the right side of the board, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellMcConnell vents over 'fake news' The Hill's 12:30 Report - Presented by Facebook - Tensions rise as U.S. waits for Derek Chauvin verdict Trump looking 'beyond seriously' at 2024 run MORE (R-Ky.), with 52 votes, sees the opening. But he also knows if he makes that move, it will have consequences far beyond this game.

It will give added energy to Democrats going into the 2018 midterm elections, possibly hurting Republican efforts to grow their Senate majority. And there is an even greater danger for McConnell. He could go down in history as the man who blew up the Senate, destroying an institution that first met in 1789.

Staring across the board at each other, Schumer and McConnell are looking for a way out.

Schumer is trying to persuade onlookers and McConnell that any nominee who can’t get 60 votes for confirmation is not a good candidate.

“There will be 60 votes for confirmation,” Schumer said on the Senate floor last week. “On a subject as important as a Supreme Court nomination, bipartisan support should be a prerequisite. It should be essential. That's what 60 votes does.”

Meanwhile, McConnell is content to wait and see what comes of Schumer’s move. But history and the populist rage on the right — typified by President Trump’s election — is making him sweat.

First, there is history: “Without [the filibuster rule], the majority in the Senate will do what majorities do – take full control,” historian Richard Arenberg recently wrote in The New York Times. “The Senate will become another House of Representatives.”

A broken Senate will facilitate the “tyranny of the majority,” that John Adams warned against in the early days of the republic.

Trump and his populist movement are not focused on Senate history. Trump wants his man on the high court now.

“If we end up with that gridlock, I’d say, ‘If you can, Mitch, go nuclear,’” Trump told reporters last week. He was clear that his focus is solely on winning confirmation when he added that it “would be an absolute shame if a man [Gorsuch] of this quality” gets “caught up in this web” of Senate politics.

But McConnell is a man of the Senate. He is a Republican – not a populist. The Senate is where his legacy will be made. He heard Trump’s disdain for the entire Washington political establishment in the president’s inaugural speech.

“What truly matters is not which party controls our government,” Trump said, dismissing the Republicans as well as the Democrats on Inauguration Day, “but whether our government is controlled by the people.”

Trump also knows that if McConnell lowers the threshold to 51 votes for a Gorsuch nomination, he will have a clear road ahead for future nominees who have an even more hard-right pedigree.

Looking ahead, the president sees three possible Supreme Court openings in view. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is 83; Justice Anthony Kennedy is 80; and Justice Stephen Breyer is 78. With the prospect of putting the gold “Trump” brand on the front of the Supreme Court for generations to come, the president is not concerned with damage to the Senate.

But there is concern over blowback from the populist left. That includes the possibility of creating what is being called a “Tea Party of the Left,” an energized Democratic opposition that will turn out in record numbers in the 2018 midterm elections and punish Republicans.

McConnell has a built-in advantage going into the midterms with Democrats having to defend 25 of 33 Senate seats up for election. In addition, Democratic-leaning groups typically do not turn out for midterms in the numbers seen at presidential-elections.

But that could change if liberal horror at Trump stays at its current level, or even grows. McConnell does not want to see his Senate majority become collateral damage to Trump’s presidency.

The anger building on the nation’s political left can be seen in the Senate.

Democrats still reeling from Trump’s election are now demanding political payback for the treatment of Garland. They are looking for the Democratic leadership in Congress to match their outrage and avenge Garland by putting up a fight — even if they don’t win.

Schumer, in his new role as leader of the Democrats in Congress, knows the base of his party wants to see their leaders fight hard against a president many view as corrupt, radical and illegitimate.

For now, there is a waiting game on the Senate chess board.

The real story of the Gorsuch nomination is the prospect that it could cause the Senate permanent damage.

""This is a disaster and setback for the country,"" Arturo Vargas, the executive director of the National Association of Latino Elected And Appointed Officials (NALEO) told the Associated Press last week. ""The next time a president convenes his Cabinet there will be no Latino perspective.""

This is not about being politically correct.

ADVERTISEMENT

The absence of Latinos at the White House comes as President Trump is already at odds with the nation’s largest minority group, and especially with people from Mexico.

Last week, he signed an executive order calling for the construction of a border wall with Mexico. That led the president of Mexico to cancel a trip to the White House.

Also last week, Trump ordered a crackdown on so-called “sanctuary cities” where local agencies do not question people about their immigration status and police do not report all criminals lacking immigration papers to federal immigration authorities.

Most of the undocumented immigrants in the “sanctuary cities” targeted by the president are Latinos.

At a meeting with congressional leaders and in a later ABC News interview, Trump falsely claimed that millions of illegal immigrants, the majority of whom are Latinos, voted in the election, thus causing him to lose the popular vote.

Trump’s anger at Latinos comes after a campaign where he stirred white resentment towards America’s southern neighbor with his call to “build the wall.” He often asked fans at rallies to name the country that was going to pay for it. The loud response? “Mexico.”

He also slandered federal judge Gonazlo Curiel — an American born in Indiana to Mexican parents — as a “Mexican” who could not be impartial in the Trump University fraud case because of his ethnic background.

That attack was so vulgar that even Speaker Paul Ryan Paul Davis RyanOn The Money: Senate confirms Gensler to lead SEC | Senate GOP to face off over earmarks next week | Top Republican on House tax panel to retire Trump faces test of power with early endorsements Lobbying world MORE (R-Wis.) labeled it the “textbook definition of a racist comment.”

In his first week in the White House, Trump poured fuel on his antagonistic relationship with Latinos.

Many Hispanic GOP stalwarts — including some who served Republican presidents — have distanced themselves from Trump over his anti-Mexican attitude.

President George W. Bush’s Commerce Secretary, Carlos Gutierrez, even endorsed Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' Cuba readies for life without Castro Chelsea Clinton: Pics of Trump getting vaccinated would help him 'claim credit' MORE. Gutierrez told NPR last year that Trump’s comments about Curiel “shattered the whole idea that we don't judge people on the basis of where they come from or where their parents came from” and said Trump was guilty of “bigotry” and “bullying.”

Linda Chavez, the highest-ranking woman in Ronald Reagan’s administration and a Bush Cabinet nominee, declared herself “anti-Trump” and called him a “disaster” and a “vile human being” because of his anti-immigrant comments.

Meanwhile, in the 115th Congress there is an all-time record high number of Hispanic senators and congressman — 38 in total — including the first Latina elected to the Senate, Catherine Cortez Masto, a Nevada Democrat.

However, none of these leaders hold positions in the upper echelons of the party’s leadership.

The only Latino in any congressional leadership post is Rep. Linda Sanchez (D-Calif.), who was recently named as the Vice Chairwoman of the House Democratic Caucus.

State and local representation for Latinos is not much better.

There are only three Hispanic governors in the United States, all of whom are Republican, while most Latinos are Democrats.

As I wrote in this column in August, there was vocal disappointment in the Latino political establishment that Hillary Clinton did not choose a Hispanic as her running mate. She tapped Sen.

And in the current race to lead the Democratic National Committee, there is no urgent rallying around Perez, the lone Latino in the race.

It is actually harder to explain the absence of Latinos among Democratic leaders than it is to explain the dearth in the Trump camp. According to exit polls, Democrat Hillary Clinton won 66 percent of the Latino vote last November.

At the moment, however, it is the absence of Latino voices in the White House that is painful and striking.

How long will President Donald Trump be able make that boast?

To his critics, Trump’s failure to divest himself from his global business empire, including deals with foreign governments, is already a scandal.

But the minute the head of the Office of Government Ethics started asking questions about Trump’s failure to separate his business deals from his presidency, something odd happened: Republicans in Congress began attacking the watchdogs.

It is hard not to go wide-eyed at the political hypocrisy on display. How can Republicans on Capitol Hill — who spent eight years trying to tar President Obama with charges of corruption — close their eyes to the potential conflicts of interest percolating around the new president?

Even more glaring is the preemptive effort to undermine future charges of corruption against Trump. Right-wing critics argue that Obama is not so scandal-free after all — a charge which, if true, would make it harder to compare Trump unfavorably to him. They cite three cases, each with a catchy shorthand title: “IRS Tea Party Targeting;” “Fast and Furious;” and “Benghazi.”

Those cases are full of bad judgment, even stupidity. But the allegation that they demonstrate actual corruption reveals more about Obama’s critics than anything else.

Let’s review:

First, the IRS case: Under Obama, the IRS supposedly targeted his critics in Tea Party-affiliated groups for investigation after they claimed tax-exempt status. Numerous investigations by Congress and the press showed none of the groups in question was denied tax-exempt status. And some liberal groups were subject to the same extra scrutiny.

Speaker of the House Paul Ryan Paul Davis RyanOn The Money: Senate confirms Gensler to lead SEC | Senate GOP to face off over earmarks next week | Top Republican on House tax panel to retire Trump faces test of power with early endorsements Lobbying world MORE (R-Wis.) provided the bottom line when he decided there was not enough evidence to hold a vote on an impeachment resolution against the IRS Commissioner.

Second, the case nicknamed “Fast and Furious”:

In a botched attempt to expose illegal gun sales to Mexican drug dealers, federal agents allowed guns to be sold to people illegally supplying arms to the cartels. Their intent was to track the guns and then arrest the gunrunners and the drug dealers.

But the gun-walking program was started by the Bush administration and ended by Obama’s Justice Department under Attorney General Eric Holder Eric Himpton HolderVoter suppression bills are the first move in a bigger battle Holder, Yates lead letter backing Biden pick for Civil Rights Division at DOJ Senate panel dukes it out over voting rights MORE. The case led to Holder becoming the first attorney general to be voted in contempt of Congress but no charges were ever brought against any administration official.

Third, the charge of scandal over how Obama’s team handled a terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya.

Obama and then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' Cuba readies for life without Castro Chelsea Clinton: Pics of Trump getting vaccinated would help him 'claim credit' MORE allegedly failed to help Americans during the attack. Four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens, were killed.

Once again, multiple Republican-led congressional committees spent years and millions of taxpayer dollars to investigate the events. And once again, they came up empty. No charges were ever filed against administration officials.

Where are the Republican bloodhounds these days?

They are aiming fire at the Director of the Office of Government Ethics, Walter Shaub, who tried to rouse the GOP majority in Congress to bark about Trump’s refusal to divest from his businesses. Trump, as president-elect, argued that he needed to do nothing more than put his sons in charge of running those businesses.

Trump’s plan, Shaub said earlier this month, “doesn’t meet the standards that the best of his nominees are meeting and that every president in the last four decades have met.”

""We can’t risk creating the perception that government leaders would use their official positions for profit,"" he concluded.

House Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Jason Chaffetz Jason ChaffetzCongress's latest hacking investigation should model its most recent Fox News Audio expands stable of podcasts by adding five new shows The myth of the conservative bestseller MORE (R-Utah), one of the Obama administration’s most persistent critics, immediately turned away from Trump’s failure to play by the rules of government ethics. He said Shaub was guilty of “blurring the line between public relations and official ethics guidance” by talking publicly about Trump’s finances.

In a Washington Post column last week, Richard Painter, the top ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush, and Norman Eisen, the chief ethics lawyer for President Obama, called on Congress to stop allowing Trump to hide his questionable ethics.

“For two weeks now, the majority leadership in the new Congress and the incoming Trump administration have been conducting a war on ethics,” they wrote. “This has ranged from the effort to cripple the Office of Congressional Ethics to the Senate’s rush to confirm President-elect Donald Trump’s nominees before their financial conflicts disclosures were complete to Trump’s own inadequate plan to address his ethical problems.”

The nominees being referenced include Trump’s nominee for Health and Human Services Secretary, Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.). He is facing tough questions from Senate Democrats over allegations that he used his position as a congressman to increase the value of pharmaceutical company stock he owned. Price denies the allegations.

Trump’s nominee for Education Secretary, Betsy DeVos, had not completed her review with the Office of Government Ethics before she testified in her confirmation hearings, prompting Democratic senators to ask for additional rounds of questioning when they had all the information.

A Pew poll taken last month found that among the general public, “65% say they are either very (45%) or somewhat (20%) concerned that Trump’s ties to groups conflict with his ability to serve the country’s best interests; 34% say they are not too (14%) or not at all (20%) concerned about this.”

It’s all on tape.

I was on television doing political commentary for Fox News Channel. The emotional power of that historic moment was extraordinary. A web of thoughts encompassing everything from the Civil War to Martin Luther King Jr.’s “dream” came rushing up at me like a wave as Obama was sworn in as America’s first black president.

For a nation just a century and a half removed from slavery — and still a majority white country — to recognize a black man’s intelligence and character by electing him as our nation’s leader still strikes me as an incredibly potent event.

ADVERTISEMENT

Last week, the emotions flowed again as President Obama, finishing his second term, made his farewell address. This time it was Obama who cried as he thanked his wife, Michelle, for her “grace” and “grit” as the first black First Lady.

What got to me emotionally last Tuesday night was when the president spoke about current race relations and the coming presidency of Donald Trump Donald TrumpSt. Louis lawyer who pointed gun at Black Lives Matter protesters considering Senate run Chauvin found guilty as nation exhales US says Iran negotiations are 'positive' MORE.

Obama said there was “talk of a post-racial America” at the time of his 2008 election but, eight years later, “race remains a potent and often divisive force in our society.”

Yet even with the rise of white nationalism in the 2016 election, Obama is steadfast in his belief that “race relations are better than they were 10 or 20 or 30 years ago, no matter what some folks say.”

To my ears, those words sounded like an updated version of the courageous civil rights-era anthem “We Shall Overcome, ” which was sung in optimism by activists even as they were beaten and jailed for demanding equal rights.

In the 2016 version, Obama is reviving the audacity of hope to pump up Americans who see the incoming Trump administration as a harbinger of a new, bleak era of racial division, anger at immigrants and the poor.

Obama challenged blacks, Latinos and Asians to make sure to include whites in their movement as they fight the political impulses encouraged by Trump’s insulting words about women, Mexicans, immigrants, blacks, and Muslims.

That means, he said, talking to “the middle-aged white guy who from the outside may seem like he’s got all the advantages, but has seen his world upended by economic and cultural and technological change. We have to pay attention and listen.”

When I saw Obama at the White House Christmas party, I asked him about the effect of television and radio broadcasts that divide Americans, liberal from conservative, urban from rural, affluent from poor, white from non-white: “It’s destroying the country,” he said.

In his farewell speech, the president lamented “the splintering of our media into a channel for every taste,” and quoted our first president, George Washington, as saying Americans needed to reject “the first dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the rest…”

According to a new Quinnipiac poll out last week, Trump will begin his presidency with a 51 percent disapproval rating and a 37 percent approval rating. President Obama will leave office with a 55 percent approval rating and 39 percent disapproval.

Among many people of all colors, but especially black and brown, it is hard to reconcile the president’s high approval rating and hopeful words with the cold hard fact that his successor will be Donald J. Trump.

They remember that Trump would never have become a national political figure had he had not stoked false, racist conspiracy theories about Obama’s legitimacy as president.

According to an Economist/YouGov survey taken last month, half of self-described Trump voters still believe Obama was born in Kenya. He was born in Hawaii.

The same Economist/YouGov survey found that 80 percent of Trump voters do not believe that Russia hacked Democratic Party emails to help Trump win.

Last week, in a contentious news conference, Trump finally acknowledged that the Russians are to blame. But his long denial has left his supporters dismissive of the facts of Russian foul play.

Similarly, Trump’s voice often seems to resonate with white nationalists and offer little hope of a search for common racial ground.

There is another ingredient in this combustible mix: Democrats are still smarting over the unprecedented, unyielding obstructionism of Obama by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellMcConnell vents over 'fake news' The Hill's 12:30 Report - Presented by Facebook - Tensions rise as U.S. waits for Derek Chauvin verdict Trump looking 'beyond seriously' at 2024 run MORE (R-Ky.). Many on the left want to block Trump’s agenda as revenge for the conservative blockade of the first black president.

This week is supposed to be about hope and optimism for the nation’s future, celebrated with inaugural balls and parades.

But Trump’s divisive political language on race and immigration makes me sad. Polls taken when Obama was inaugurated showed lots of optimism.

In his inaugural address, I’m praying to hear Trump speak to his trouble with the third of the nation made up of racial minorities and immigrants.

Trump can meet with black celebrities such as Steve Harvey all he likes. Given his past words, I’d be surprised to see tears of joy from any minorities as he is sworn in.

All the big talk about President-elect Trump and Congressional Republicans dismantling ObamaCare now looks to be political cover for the GOP to go after Medicare, Medicaid and even Social Security.

Sam Johnson Samuel (Sam) Robert JohnsonVan Taylor wins reelection to Texas seat held by GOP since 1968 House seeks ways to honor John Lewis Sam Johnson: Fighter for the greater good MORE (R-Texas) introduced a bill to cut Social Security benefits for most recipients. He also proposed steadily increasing the age, from 67 to 69, at which Americans get full Social Security benefits.

Johnson, chairman of the Social Security subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee, asserts that spending on Social Security has to be cut quickly to prevent the program from going bankrupt. This claim is strongly disputed by others.

But with a strong tide of Republican support for dismantling ObamaCare, the congressman sees a political opportunity to make the case for cutting all entitlement spending.

He will have support in the Trump administration for his plan to cut spending on healthcare.

Trump’s nominee for Secretary of Health and Human Services, Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), is a major critic of ObamaCare and a strong supporter of Speaker Paul Ryan Paul Davis RyanOn The Money: Senate confirms Gensler to lead SEC | Senate GOP to face off over earmarks next week | Top Republican on House tax panel to retire Trump faces test of power with early endorsements Lobbying world MORE’s (R-Wis.) plan to overhaul Medicare. If he is confirmed, he will be positioned to stop any defense of Medicare by advocates working within the agency that oversees the program.

After the GOP trounced the Democrats in November, Ryan was open about using the repeal of ObamaCare to go after other entitlement programs.

“When ObamaCare became ObamaCare,” Ryan said in a Fox News interview two days after the November election, “ObamaCare rewrote Medicare, rewrote Medicaid. So if you are going to repeal and replace ObamaCare, you have to address those issues as well.”

The Speaker said flatly that Medicare is going to have “price controls.” He asserted that “Medicaid is in fiscal straits,” and explained that changes to those programs are “part of our plan to replace ObamaCare.”

But who knew Republicans would be as bold as to make the plan their first order of business — before Trump has taken office and before any repeal of ObamaCare?

When he was chairman of the House Budget Committee, Ryan proposed limiting spending on Medicare by changing it from an entitlement program into a voucher program, ending federal guaranteed coverage of medical care for seniors. That led Democrats to run ads claiming that Republicans wanted to throw grandma off the cliff.

Before that, President Bush’s failed attempt at privatizing Social Security hurt Republicans.

But GOP fear of giving Democrats ammunition to attack them is now gone after their sweeping victory in November.

They are ready to test the nation’s political appetite for an overhaul of all entitlement spending.

Across the political divide, congressional Democrats see the GOP plan as extreme political overreach.

Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer Chuck SchumerLawmakers react to guilty verdict in Chauvin murder trial: 'Our work is far from done' Overnight Health Care: Johnson & Johnson pause seen as 'responsible' in poll | Women turning out more than men for COVID-19 vaccines 'Real Housewives of the GOP' — Wannabe reality show narcissists commandeer the party MORE (N.Y.) last week described the GOP effort to scale back the healthcare act, as well as Medicare and Medicaid, as a “full-scale assault on the three pillars” of America’s healthcare system. He called it a plan to “Make America Sick Again.”

That led the president-elect to tweet that Schumer is the Democrats’ “head clown,” adding that Democrats “know how bad ObamaCare is and what a mess they are in.”

But Sen. Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersNewsmax host: Jury decided to 'sacrifice' Chauvin to the mob Lawmakers react to guilty verdict in Chauvin murder trial: 'Our work is far from done' Senate confirms SEC chief Gensler to full five-year term MORE (I- Vt.) last week reminded Republicans that their incoming president might not be on board with everything they aim to do.

Sanders resurrected a Trump campaign tweet and blew it up for display on the Senate floor. During the GOP primaries, Trump tweeted that one of his rivals, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, was imitating him by ruling out cuts to the big entitlement programs.

Trump’s tweet read: “I was the first & only potential GOP candidate to state there will be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare & Medicaid. Huckabee copied me.”

Standing before that tweet, Sanders called on Trump to promise to “veto any legislation that cuts Medicare, that cuts Medicaid or that cuts Social Security.”

It’s not surprising that GOP budget cutters would target the big entitlement plans to fund their agenda of tax breaks for the wealthy; roughly half of the federal budget goes to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.

But these programs are popular.

A survey taken last month by Allstate/Atlantic Media Heartland Monitor found that a whopping 80 percent of voters say Washington should be “protecting Medicare and Social Security from any reductions to ensure those who paid a contribution receive their promised benefits.”

A mere 16 percent said they favored “reducing Medicare and Social Security benefits for upper-income seniors to help reduce the federal deficit.”

The seniors who depend upon these programs have the highest voter turnouts in midterm elections of any cohort.

As Sanders pointed out, the Democrats have an unlikely ally in this fight in the shape of Trump himself, who is on record vowing to protect the entitlement programs.

As Trump showed last week in a kerfuffle over an independent ethics body, he is willing to poke Congressional Republicans when they do something he doesn’t like.

Democrats rightly believe that if they can beat back GOP efforts to dissolve the social safety net, they will regain standing with some of the working class voters who deserted them for Trump.

The question of the moment is whether Democrats, busy fighting to hold on to ObamaCare, can simultaneously pressure Trump into helping them fight Republicans in order to save Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.

This is not a matter of opinion, it is statement of fact: knowable, hard, empirical truth.

ADVERTISEMENT

Yet about half of Trump voters don’t buy it.

And there are more jaw-dropping results in polls of GOP voters.

Among the 52 percent who give Trump the popular vote are 37 percent of college-educated Republicans, according to a Qualtrics poll released last week.

Sixty-seven percent of Trump voters in a Public Policy Polling survey released earlier this month also believe that unemployment increased during President Obama’s eight years in office.

In reality, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate when Obama took office in January 2009 was 7.8 percent. In November 2016, it had sunk to 4.6 percent.

By the way, 39 percent of Trump voters also believe the stock market went down under Obama. In fact, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was around 8,000 when Obama took office in January 2009. Late last week it closed at over 19,900 — on its way to possibly surpassing the 20,000 mark before the end of the year.

Let’s agree on one fact: Donald Trump upended the political world with his win.

But that incredible upset left an incredible hangover. The facts of political life are now subject to partisan interpretation.

Despite an unprecedented wealth of news gushing from hundreds of cable networks, radio stations, newspapers, Facebook feeds and websites, Americans increasingly live in separate realities when it comes to the facts of our common political lives.

I am not talking about the easy outrage over the outright lies told by gutter-dwelling fake news websites.

This is not about a liberal or conservative tilt to news presentations.

The core threat to democracy is not that news sites are lying or telling people what to think. The danger is that they are presenting a narrow slate of what to think about.

That means that Trump supporters hear more about charges of voter fraud than Clinton’s victory in the popular vote — and that leads them to think such fraud must be real, giving them an excuse to ignore the factual vote count.

Similarly, they hear less about President Obama’s success in pulling the U.S. out of a deep recession than they hear speculation about the number of people who stopped searching for jobs.

There is no way to overstate that this is a challenge to democracy — a system that is, after all, based on the consent of voters who are fully informed.

Scottie Nell Hughes, the conservative CNN commentator and staunch Trump supporter, recently told radio host Diane Rehm: “There's no such thing, unfortunately, anymore as facts.”

Hughes continued: “And so one thing that has been interesting this entire campaign season to watch, is that people that say facts are facts — they're not really facts…. Everybody has a way of interpreting them to be the truth, or not truth,” Hughes explained.

The distressing impact of a world free of facts is clearly on Obama’s mind in his final weeks in office. He recently tied the trouble American voters have agreeing on facts to the impact of Russian efforts to influence the presidential race.

“Our political dialogue is such that everybody’s under suspicion, everybody’s corrupt, everybody’s doing things for partisan reasons…,” Obama told reporters last week. He said “talk radio” style news is breaking apart the sense of common destiny among Americans and opening the door to external interference.

“If we want to really reduce foreign influence on our elections, then we better think about how to make sure that our political process, our political dialogue, is stronger than it’s been,” Obama concluded.

Americans, both conservative and liberal, seem to agree with the president that something is haywire when the news media fail to give everyone a common set of facts as the basis for vigorous, partisan debate.

Even before the election, a Gallup September poll found the share of Americans with a “great deal” or “fair amount” of faith in the mass media has hit rock bottom, at just 32 percent — a drop of 15 points since 2007.

The crisis is prompting change.

Facebook, now the nation’s top news source, recently announced steps to label and combat what it considers to be “fake news.” They will have a consortium of independent fact-checking journalists, including people from the Associated Press and FactCheck.org, review articles posted on their social media platform.

Facebook can check for fake stories and false information. But what happens when fact-challenged statements come from politicians and especially the President-elect?

And what happens when Trump is being fed fact-free conspiracy theories by his advisers?

Consider the possibility that Trump acts on “facts” as he hears them from his National Security Adviser, Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn (ret.). The former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency is infamous for disseminating so-called “Flynn Facts,” or dubious assertions.

Some “Flynn Facts” became public on Twitter, including a few with inaccuracies, some taken from fake news sites, and others containing what critics judged to be anti-Muslim sentiments.

A Fox News poll released last week found 25 percent of voters expect Trump to be an “above average” president. Only 11 percent say he’ll be one of the “greatest.” Thirty-one percent of voters say he’ll be “one of the worst.”

21943,Williams,Juan,thehill,"Is President-elect Trump’s nomination of Betsy DeVos to be Secretary of Education a Christmas present for America’s public schools or shiny wrapping paper on a lump of coal?

A teacher from Iowa recently wrote an open letter to DeVos in which he pointed out that she never attended public school, nor has she any experience as a teacher, nor has she studied school curriculum.

Patrick Kearney, the teacher whose letter was published in the Huffington Post, tellingly pointed out that, in DeVos’s home state of Michigan, “the charter schools you lobby for aren’t really achieving any better than their public counterparts.”

Stephen Henderson, a charter school supporter who is the editorial page editor of the Detroit Free Press, came to a similar conclusion about DeVos:

“For 20 years, the lobby her family bankrolls has propped up the billion-dollar charter school industry and insulated it from commonsense oversight, even as charter schools [in Michigan] repeatedly failed to deliver on their promises to parents and children.”

DeVos response to her critics came in a November tweet: “The status quo in [education] is not acceptable.”

At a December Michigan rally with Trump, she sharpened her point: “For me it’s simple: I trust parents.” By that she meant she does not trust teachers’ unions, who have a history of looking out for their dues-paying members first — not students.

I hear these political arguments. But my life experience with public schools speaks more loudly.

As black parents and Democrats, my wife and I paid taxes for public schools but did not risk sending our three children to troubled public schools in Washington during the ‘80s and ‘90s. We now have three grandchildren who are doing very well at one of the city’s charter schools. That’s why I am a supporter of charters.

On this point, I find myself aligned with Trump supporters who backed him because they thought he was going to be the “great disruptor,” the man to “shake things up.”

Trump Senior Adviser Kellyanne Conway tweeted last week, “School choice among the most exciting aspects of a @realDonaldTrump presidency, & among the most under-appreciated messages of his campaign.”

To me, no area of public policy is more in need of positive disruption than a public education system that is condemning too many children, especially black and Latino children, to live in poverty because they are not equipped with a good education.

Earlier this month, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) released its highly-regarded comparison of student performance in science, reading and math among 35 industrialized nations. The 2015 study ranked the United States 19th in science, 20th in reading and 31st in math.

This is not acceptable.

President Obama and his first Education Secretary Arne Duncan Arne Starkey DuncanProviding the transparency parents deserve Everyone's talking about a national tutoring corps; here's what we need to know to do it well More than 200 Obama officials sign letter supporting Biden's stimulus plan MORE deserve credit for raising the high school graduation rate to an all-time high of 83 percent in 2015. This was the fifth consecutive year where this important metric hit a record-breaking high.

However, as the OECD study shows, the value of a U.S. public high school diploma is in question because too many high schools are “diploma mills.” They award diplomas without giving students the skills they need.

The critical need in American education is for public schools, whether in their traditional form or as charters, to produce better outcomes for all children.

On that score, the most compelling criticism of DeVos is that the Michigan charter schools she helped to produce have underperformed compared to the nation’s other charters and even some public schools.

The root of the failure of many Michigan’s charter schools can be traced to a lack of oversight and accountability. DeVos opposed a Michigan law requiring oversight of charters. Gary Naeyaert, excutive director of a lobbying group started by DeVos, argues that failing public schools face no consequences and it is a double-standard to impose added burdens on charter schools.

But for someone who claims to be looking out for parents and students, why stand in the way of laws that allow parents to judge the quality of charters?

The head of the nation’s biggest teachers’ union, the American Federation of Teachers’ Randi Weingarten, labeled DeVos as simply an “anti-public education nominee.”

And Lily E. Garcia, the president of the National Education Association, said it is necessary to stand against DeVos to oppose “a corporate agenda to privatize, de-professionalize and impose cookie-cutter solutions to public education.”

At her confirmation hearings, the critical question for DeVos will be whether she is just a rigid right-wing ideologue or sufficiently flexible to learn from the mistakes she made in Michigan.

If she is serious about getting the best results for students, she will have helping hands from Republicans on Capitol Hill. Tennessee Sen. Lamar Alexander Lamar AlexanderSenate GOP faces retirement brain drain The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by the National Shooting Sports Foundation - CDC news on gatherings a step toward normality Blunt's retirement deals blow to McConnell inner circle MORE will remain chairman of the Senate Health Education Labor and Pensions Committee.

Virginia Foxx Virginia Ann FoxxHouse passes bill to prevent violence in health care workplaces House passes bill to combat gender pay gap Republicans argue school accountability waivers overstep Education secretary authority MORE will take over as Chairwoman of the House Education and Workforce Committee. Both Alexander and Foxx have long histories of support for school choice.

With Trump, DeVos, Alexander and Foxx soon to be in charge of setting federal education policy, this is the best chance for education reform in a generation.

It is up to all Americans who care about this issue, including Democrats on Capitol Hill and the teachers’ unions, to make sure the GOP does not turn this moment into a Christmas disappointment, another lump of coal for America’s students.

21944,Williams,Juan,thehill,"Live! All day and all night on your big screen comes the opening drama of the Trump presidency, with a cast of love-them-or-hate-them characters.

This reality television show will be set on Capitol Hill as President Trump’s cabinet nominees fight for survival against angry Democrats looking for revenge after getting wiped out on Election Day.

The opening scene has Trump demanding that Congress should ignore concerns over the heavy military presence among his top advisors. Trump will wave the flag and stir public support for a waiver to allow a recently retired general, James Mattis, to become his Secretary of Defense.

ADVERTISEMENT

Trump needs the waiver to void a World War II-era law intended to protect civilian control of the military.

Trump is likely to win that battle. But then the fight for survival gets nasty.

It begins with hearings for a housing secretary, Ben Carson, who has no experience in the housing industry. He also has no experience in government.

That will be followed by consideration of a nominee for labor secretary, Andy Puzder, who is opposed to raising the minimum wage and giving overtime pay to more workers. This comes at a time when rising income inequality has a majority of Americans supporting a hike in base pay.

Next the Secretary of the Treasury nominee, Steven Mnuchin, will find himself in a struggle against foes charging Trump with hypocrisy. Trump criticized Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' Cuba readies for life without Castro Chelsea Clinton: Pics of Trump getting vaccinated would help him 'claim credit' MORE for giving speeches to Goldman Sachs and cavorting with Hollywood elites; Mnuchin spent 17 years at that same Wall Street firm before becoming a Hollywood producer.

The fight for political survival continues with hearings for the nominee to head the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt. He is described as a “close ally of the fossil fuel industry,” by The New York Times. The paper reported that as attorney general of Oklahoma, the nominee sent a letter to the EPA on state stationery even though the letter was drafted by officials of big oil companies.

Somebody is definitely going to get hurt during the hearings on the nominee for Secretary of Health and Human Services, Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.). It will be a fight over the future of the Affordable Care Act — ObamaCare — as well as a threat to privatize Medicare and Social Security.

Back at the White House, Trump is trying to prevent critics in the Senate from finding a way to publicly review his pick to be national security advisor, retired Gen. Michael Flynn. Flynn’s record is explosive and full of conspiracy theories, one of which linked Hillary Clinton to “sex crimes [with] children.” He has also sent anti-Muslim tweets.

All of that is just an opening act. The deep pain will come over Trump’s pick to be Attorney General — Alabama Sen. Jefferson Beauregard ""Jeff"" Sessions III.

This is the same white southern senator who failed to be confirmed for a federal judgeship 30 years ago because of allegations of racism, including one instance where Sessions was heard to have said he liked the Ku Klux Klan until he heard they smoked marijuana.

Sessions did admit that he is “often loose with his tongue,” but meant “no harm,” when asked about his characterization of the NAACP as a “communist” organization.

Now he is nominated to be the nation’s top law enforcement official. And in 2016 — with ‘Black Lives Matter’ still a movement — the country is far more sensitive to charges of racial slurs and injustice than it was three decades ago.

Democrats will put Sessions on the spot, not just about his own past comments, but about whether he agrees with Trump’s incendiary rhetoric during the campaign regarding Mexicans, blacks, and Muslim immigrants, among others.

Republicans are insisting that Sessions deserves some deference as a fellow senator.

But Democrats recall that the Senate Armed Services Committee treated a former Republican senator, Chuck Hagel Charles (Chuck) Timothy HagelOvernight Defense: Navy medic killed after wounding 2 sailors in Maryland shooting | Dems push Biden for limits on military gear transferred to police | First day of talks on Iran deal 'constructive' 140 national security leaders call for 9/11-style panel to review Jan. 6 attack Trump Afghan pullout deal unachievable, says ex-Pentagon leader MORE, shabbily when President Obama nominated him to be Secretary of Defense in 2013.

Yes, you read that right.

A Democrat feels compelled to honor McConnell.

Let me explain.

For the past five years, this column has annually celebrated the Member of Congress who made the biggest impact during the preceding 12 months.

Usually the award goes to a legislator for positive action. Sen. Marco Rubio Marco Antonio RubioOn The Money: Senate GOP faces post-Trump spending brawl | Senate confirms SEC chief Gensler to full five-year term | Left-leaning group raises concerns about SALT cap repeal Senate GOP faces post-Trump spending brawl 15 Senate Republicans pledge to oppose lifting earmark ban MORE (R-Fla.) won for taking a political risk and gaining Senate passage of an immigration reform bill.

But in this topsy-turvy political year, which culminated in the election of Donald J. Trump as president, the old rules have gone out the window.

McConnell is this year’s winner for stopping Senate action.

Evidence of the success of McConnell’s obstructionism is his victory in holding the GOP majority in the Senate when the odds favored the Democrats taking over.

McConnell’s majority — likely 52 GOP senators after the Louisiana Senate race is decided this month — will be aided and abetted by a Republican president and a Republican House.

The Kentuckian won, again, by refusing to allow President Obama to fill a vacant seat on the Supreme Court. With Trump’s victory, the job will now go to a Republican nominee.

McConnell also won by keeping his mouth shut about Trump. Unlike Speaker Paul Ryan Paul Davis RyanOn The Money: Senate confirms Gensler to lead SEC | Senate GOP to face off over earmarks next week | Top Republican on House tax panel to retire Trump faces test of power with early endorsements Lobbying world MORE (R-Wis.), McConnell stayed silent on Trump’s vulgar comments and appeals to bigotry. Trump and his friends remain critical of Ryan, but they are now courting McConnell.

And McConnell won again last week when Trump named his wife, Elaine Chao, as his nominee to serve as Secretary of Transportation.

All these triumphs for McConnell are hard to believe given that Congress has a dismal 15.4 percent approval rating, according to the latest RealClearPolitics average of polls. That low rating is rooted in public frustration with a do-nothing Congress defined by McConnell’s strategy of obstruction.

But like it or not, there is no denying that McConnell comes out of this year’s political cycle as the big winner on Capitol Hill.

McConnell’s Republican predecessors as Senate Majority Leader — legendary figures such as Everett Dirksen, Howard Baker and Bob Dole — always played politics with great respect for the Constitutional responsibilities of the Senate, and respect for the best interests of the nation. There was a sense of shame about being too overly political.

McConnell demonstrated no such restraint or capacity for shame. And he got away with it.

The best recent example of his bare-knuckle style is his handling of the Supreme Court vacancy that occurred after Justice Antonin Scalia’s death in February. Within days, McConnell made the unprecedented announcement that he would not even hold hearings, much less a vote, to confirm any nominee coming from Obama, a twice-elected president with nearly a year remaining in office.

When Obama fulfilled his constitutional duty by selecting a nominee, Federal Judge Merrick Garland, McConnell refused to even meet with him. That level of disrespect was too much even for some of McConnell’s own troops. Sens. Kelly Ayotte Kelly Ann AyotteOvernight Defense: NATO expanding troops in Iraq Overnight Defense: New START extended for five years | Austin orders 'stand down' to tackle extremism | Panel recommends Biden delay Afghanistan withdrawal Study group recommends Biden delay Afghanistan withdrawal MORE (R-N.H.) and Mark Kirk Mark Steven KirkDuckworth announces reelection bid Brave new world: Why we need a Senate Human Rights Commission Senate majority battle snags Biden Cabinet hopefuls MORE (R-Ill.) did meet with Garland.

McConnell is a hardball political player but he does have a sense of humor. Last year, I ran into him as he was leaving a television interview and he teased me by saying: “You haven’t written anything trashing me lately.”

First elected in 1985, McConnell has served longer than any other Kentucky senator. A cynic might look at his record and say McConnell has been part of the D.C. swamp since it was a mere wetland.

When a reporter asked him last week if he would work with Trump to “drain the swamp,” McConnell dodged, saying he wanted to focus on “real concerns.”

In the ultimate twist, Democrats who, like me, decried McConnell’s tactics may end up following his example, seeking to block the most radical parts of Trump’s agenda and his most radical right-wing nominees.

And then there is the potential tension between Trump and McConnell. Remember Trump is at odds with most of the orthodox Republican positions that McConnell has spent his political life advocating.

McConnell, unlike Trump, backs free trade; he supports U.S. participation in NATO; he is opposed to paid maternity leave; he favors changing Medicare into a limited benefit; and he dodged support for paying for a wall on the Mexican border.

But for now McConnell is the man of the hour. He blocked the Obama agenda for eight years. He saved his Senate majority. And now it is up to him to slow down, speed up or even stop the Trump agenda.

Trump may soon find that he has finally met his match in Mr. McConnell.

21946,Williams,Juan,thehill,"This story ends with the demise of James Comey as FBI chief.

Let’s begin with the news that President-elect Trump has suggested he will not pursue criminal investigations by the FBI — and possible prosecution — of Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' Cuba readies for life without Castro Chelsea Clinton: Pics of Trump getting vaccinated would help him 'claim credit' MORE.

ADVERTISEMENT

The only reason that qualifies as news is because the FBI chief has reduced the bureau to a nakedly political player, leaving behind its goal of serving justice for all.

On the basis of Comey’s behavior, Trump thinks it is within his power to direct the Justice Department and the FBI chief, until recently a registered Republican, to prosecute his political rival, Clinton.

That twisted conclusion is not true as a matter of law. FBI investigations and federal prosecutions by the Justice Department are legally separate from the executive branch to prevent abuse of political power.

As a matter of history, however, the FBI has sometimes abused its power in order to target political outsiders. J. Edgar Hoover’s fascination with Martin Luther King Jr.’s sex life is one of the most infamous examples.

Right now the FBI’s proper role is so out of whack due to Comey’s actions that some Democrats, fearing more to come, are asking the Obama White House to preemptively pardon Clinton.

For the record, the FBI, State Department and several other federal agencies extensively probed Clinton’s use of a private email server while she was Secretary of State. None found any evidence of criminality.

None.

But in a “Through the Looking Glass” moment of politics in the age of Trump, the president-elect appears magnanimous merely by turning away from chants of “Lock her up!” at his campaign events. This kinder version of Trump is quoted by The New York Times as saying he does not “want to hurt the Clintons — I really don’t.”

So, Trump doesn’t want to hurt a political opponent who has committed no crime? How considerate.

The actions of the FBI clearly had an impact on the election’s outcome. Trump’s former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, told the Oxford Union that Comey’s actions sealed the election for Trump by pushing undecided voters toward him.

“With 11 days to go in this election cycle, something amazing happened,” Lewandowski said. “The FBI director, James Comey, came out on a Friday and said they may be reopening the investigation in to ‘Crooked’ Hillary Clinton’s emails. What that did was remind people there are two different rules in Washington — those of the elites, for the privileged, and those for everybody else.”

Lewandowski’s assessment fit precisely with the conclusion of the head of the Clinton campaign’s research division, Navin Nayak.

“Comey’s letter in the last 11 days of the election both helped depress our turnout and also drove away some of our critical support among college-educated white voters — particularly in the suburbs,” Nayak wrote in an email to senior campaign staff. “We also think Comey’s second letter, which was intended to absolve Sec. Clinton, actually helped to bolster Trump’s turnout.”

Mrs. Clinton agreed in painfully blunt terms on her final conference call with donors on Nov. 12: “Our analysis is that Comey’s letter raising doubts that were groundless, baseless, proven to be, stopped our momentum.”

Even Trump seemed to acknowledge the FBI had behaved improperly. He told the CBS program “60 Minutes,” there had been a “lotta leaking” by the bureau. Trump added he has not made up his mind about asking for Comey’s resignation when he becomes president.

One of those leaks apparently went to former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who said in an interview days before Comey’s controversial statement that “a surprise” was coming.

Recall the context, too.

All this took place after Comey held a press conference in July to announce that the FBI would not be recommending charges against Clinton. But Comey added a politically inappropriate commentary by saying that he was of the opinion that Clinton had been “extremely careless.”

That performance prompted his fellow Republicans, particularly members of Congress, to ask why the FBI did not recommend prosecution after the laundry list of questions raised by Comey.

In a lot of media coverage, the FBI probe came to be seen as an equivalent counterweight to Trump’s numerous vulgarities and ethically questionable controversies. Then, two weeks before Election Day, came Comey’s second wave of political interference. The rest, as they say, is history.

To my mind, the politicization of justice in America did not start with Comey’s interventions and it won’t stop with a new attorney general or a new FBI director.

Remember the FBI is under the purview of the Department of Justice. The attorney general is essentially the FBI director’s boss.

In my lifetime, both Democratic and Republican presidents have blurred the lines between politics and justice — seeming to forget that the DOJ is supposed to be an independent agency.

Four decades ago, Republican President Richard Nixon’s attorney general, John Mitchell, served 19 months in federal prison because of his involvement, and by extension the DOJ’s involvement, in the Watergate scandal.

And doing so is at the top of the Republican domestic agenda.

So, why does the GOP executioner suddenly look so hesitant?

ADVERTISEMENT

The reality is that Republicans on Capitol Hill and the Trump team see that their own heads could roll.

Republican voters, having been told that ObamaCare is a disaster, expect quick action. They wonder how hard is it to throw dirt on the grave and accept the cheers of a grateful nation.

The problem for the GOP executioner in Washington is that, once the deed is done, Trump will have to take responsibility for creating a better plan for American healthcare — especially for the more than 20 million people who will lose health insurance once ObamaCare is buried.

President-elect Trump put the potentially explosive political problem in simple terms earlier this year during the primaries: “We do need healthcare for all people. What are we going to do, let people die in the street?”

Later, as the party’s nominee, Trump was forced to get into line with GOP orthodoxy by just promising to kill off ObamaCare.

But Trump’s instincts were right when he pointed to the millions that will be left without insurance if the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is repealed.

And then there is the added cost to the healthcare system if ObamaCare dies.

The RAND Corp. estimates the death of ObamaCare will add $6 billion to the deficit in the first year it is gone. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget puts the price of losing ObamaCare at $550 billion in the next decade.

And the demand for ObamaCare remains lively despite the constant attacks from the GOP.

This month, more than 1 million people signed up for the healthcare program, exceeding the number that signed up last year during the same timespan. After Trump’s victory, people signed up at an even faster rate.

Already President-elect Trump, in an interview with The Wall Street Journal after the big win, has started hedging. He said he wants to keep alive some popular elements of ObamaCare.

But how can the new president cherry pick parts of the plan for reprieve if he kills its central funding mechanism, the individual mandate for all Americans to buy insurance? The individual mandate keeps the most popular parts of the law alive.

Meanwhile on Capitol Hill, Speaker Paul Ryan Paul Davis RyanOn The Money: Senate confirms Gensler to lead SEC | Senate GOP to face off over earmarks next week | Top Republican on House tax panel to retire Trump faces test of power with early endorsements Lobbying world MORE (R-Wis.) is busy trying to prevent explosive political fallout from killing ObamaCare by promising that its death will protect Medicare.

In a Fox News interview two days after the election, the Speaker tied the two programs together by arguing that “because of ObamaCare, Medicare is going broke.”

The political blowback against Ryan was hot. FactCheck.org soon wrote that Obamacare “actually improved Medicare’s financing, and [Medicare] isn’t going broke.”

The Speaker has long advocated ending Medicare as an entitlement for the elderly and replacing it with vouchers of limited value. That will keep a lid on Medicare costs. Elderly Americans, however, would lose the guarantee of government-paid healthcare for all their ills. Grandma sees the cliff approaching fast.

Ryan’s big stumble also increased demand for details of Republican plans to replace ObamaCare.

Despite six years and more than 50 votes to repeal ObamaCare, the only alternatives offered by the GOP don’t help the poor because they center on private healthcare accounts and tax deductions for healthcare costs.

There are no new ideas for how to deal with the financial strain attached to having insurance companies cover people with pre-existing conditions or allowing young people to stay on their parents’ plans.

A Washington Post editorial in July ridiculed the House GOP plan — titled “A Better Way to Fix Health Care,” — as “difficult to evaluate or take seriously,” because it lacked a funding plan and looked to “be hard on the poor, old and sick.”

“This many years on, the GOP has no excuses for blank spaces,” The Post concluded.

Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City and a senior adviser to the president-elect, said last week that the recent notifications about increases in health care premiums was a bigger factor in Trump’s victory than were FBI Director Jim Comey’s actions regarding Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' Cuba readies for life without Castro Chelsea Clinton: Pics of Trump getting vaccinated would help him 'claim credit' MORE’s e-mails.

“I think ObamaCare was the bigger hit, the fact that those premiums hit on… November 1,” Giuliani told ABC.

What are the people who voted against ObamaCare to think when they now hear insurance company executives say they don’t know of any credible Republican plan to deal with uninsured Americans?

What do they think when the GOP offers nothing to equal the ACA’s success in restraining the rising cost of health care, including the cost of healthcare provided by private employers?

“We started with a fresh piece of paper yesterday — we had no idea how to approach it,” Mark T. Bertolini, the CEO of Aetna, told Andrew Ross Sorkin of the New York Times the day after the election.

Referring to the millions who will lose their health insurance, Mr. Bertolini said, “You can’t put them out on the street without insurance.”

That sounds a lot like what Trump was saying earlier this year.

No wonder Republicans now fear that killing Obamacare may cost them their political lives.

With Obama leaving office, the Democrats are losing his anti-war focus and the personal popularity that allowed him to hold the Democrats together. The president enjoys a sky-high job approval rating among his fellow Democrats.

So, who replaces him as the working leader of Democrats in Washington? And what is the Democrats’ new guiding ideology?

The leading candidate to lead the party out of the darkness is Sen. Charles Schumer Chuck SchumerLawmakers react to guilty verdict in Chauvin murder trial: 'Our work is far from done' Overnight Health Care: Johnson & Johnson pause seen as 'responsible' in poll | Women turning out more than men for COVID-19 vaccines 'Real Housewives of the GOP' — Wannabe reality show narcissists commandeer the party MORE (D-N.Y.). He is widely expected to be the next Senate Minority Leader. But his strong ties to Wall Street are guaranteed to give the most liberal members of his party heartburn.

House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.), with 30 years in Congress, is expected to remain the top Democrat in the House. But the first woman to serve as Speaker of the House lost the majority in 2010 and failed to recapture it in any of the three elections since then.

Over at the Democratic National Committee (DNC), there is also a leadership vacuum.

Former chairwoman Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz (Fla.) was forced out after WikiLeaks published embarrassing emails showing DNC staffers trying to help Clinton defeat Sen. Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersNewsmax host: Jury decided to 'sacrifice' Chauvin to the mob Lawmakers react to guilty verdict in Chauvin murder trial: 'Our work is far from done' Senate confirms SEC chief Gensler to full five-year term MORE (I-Vt.) in the Democratic primaries.

Donna Brazile, the current DNC chairwoman, is under fire for emails, again released through WikiLeaks, that claim to show she shared presidential debate questions with the Clinton campaign while a paid contributor at CNN.

At the moment, Democrats are a people distressed at the reality that millions of Americans voted for Trump — and did so with full knowledge of his long list of insults, bullying, racist comments and failure to pay taxes. Exit polls showed voters selecting him despite their overwhelming conclusion that he lacks the judgment and experience to be president.

I sincerely hope the president-elect lives up to his promise to “bind the wounds of division.” Patriotism dictates that Democrats rally behind him and pray for his success as our nation’s leader. I am trying. It is also good to remember there are lots of Democrats out there. Clinton won the popular vote even as she lost the Electoral College.

If Trump really does try to improve the employment situation for working class people, Democrats should be ready to support him, a recent piece by D.D. Guttenplan in The Nation argued — even while they develop the power to pressure him on immigration and climate change.

Democrats need a revived party with a strong leader, as well as a clear message that allows them to stand as the loyal opposition to Trump Republicans.

One way to find the leader is to consider the best Democrat to run against Trump in 2020. International Business Times last week listed six names for the job: Sen.

“I want an uncompromising fighter who understands the values of our base, of our party, and of our nation,” Markos Moulitsas wrote at the Daily Kos last week in a blog post on who should be the next DNC Chair. “I want a champion who will rebuild the party in all 50 states. I want a hero that will support a whole new generation of new party leaders, candidates, activists and voters. And I want anger. But that may just be the day-after me speaking.”

In a Facebook post last Wednesday, liberal filmmaker Michael Moore urged activists to “take over the Democratic Party and return it to the people,” because “they have failed us miserably.”

“Any Democratic member of Congress who didn’t wake up this morning ready to fight, resist and obstruct in the way Republicans did against President Obama every day for eight full years must step out of the way and let those of us who know the score lead the way in stopping the meanness and the madness that’s about to begin,” Moore wrote.

The progressive populist wing of the Democratic Party, as currently led by Sanders and Warren, has a real opportunity in the coming months to execute a hostile takeover of the Democratic Party, just as Trump took over the Republicans last year.

The internal power struggles within the Democratic Party provide clues to how the party’s congressional leaders will deal with pressing issues like pending trade deals, where progressives like Sanders and Warren may find common cause with Trump in opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Then there is the Supreme Court, where an all-out fight will be required after Senate Republicans never even had a hearing to consider Obama’s nominee, Merrick Garland.

Other Trump GOP agenda items like the repeal of ObamaCare and sweeping tax cuts will require progressives to go to the barricades. They will need new ideas and strong leadership and it is not at all clear that their current roster is up to the challenge.

Bernie and Elizabeth, the party is yours for the taking. The opening is there for you to channel all of the pain and anger among Democrats. Will you seize it?

21950,Williams,Juan,thehill,"We jumped the shark on this campaign a long time ago.

First, there was the hostile takeover of the Republican Party by a candidate with no qualifications to be president, given to shaming women about their looks, insulting Mexicans, and even demeaning a former prisoner of war, himself a former GOP presidential nominee, for getting captured.

Then the American press played stupid.

ADVERTISEMENT

They equated one candidate’s reckless use of a private email server with the other candidate’s litany of disrepute — his reported failure to pay taxes; his insults of a Gold Star family; charges that he regularly groped women; as well as federal charges of racial bias against black people trying to rent apartments. Oh, and don’t forget charges of fraud at Trump University and the stories — never convincingly rebutted — of his corrupt use of money intended for charity.

Along this twisted road to elect a president, U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russia is trying to influence the election by attacking one candidate. And when — days before the election — the FBI director took a shot at the same candidate, the 2016 campaign totally went off the rails.

By that, I mean it went past all bounds of my prior experience with hardball political campaigns over the last 40 years.

The smart money is still on a Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' Cuba readies for life without Castro Chelsea Clinton: Pics of Trump getting vaccinated would help him 'claim credit' MORE victory. The bettors in Las Vegas and the polling/statistical analytics crowd have her as the favorite to seal the deal.

But her lead in the polls – both nationally and in the battleground states – has dwindled in the last week.

The nation is still shaking its collective head over FBI director James Comey’s letter to Congress stirring new suspicion about Clinton, without charges of misconduct or any evidence. The FBI’s credibility has been damaged. That damage has not been repaired by Comey's statement on Sunday, stating that the new emails had not changed his earlier conclusion that Clinton's deeds did not rise to the level of prosecutable offenses.

The actual election won’t end the craziness. This year’s campaign is just the latest chapter in years of polarized, dysfunctional national politics.

So as you refresh The Hill’s website for election updates Tuesday night, here is a viewer’s guide.

As we begin the contest, Clinton dominates the map. States that would be safe for any Democratic nominee give her just under 200 of the 270 electoral votes needed to win. Then there are four states very likely to add to her total — Virginia and the Midwestern trio of Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan.

If she can add Electoral College votes from Pennsylvania and New Hampshire — 20 from the former and four from the latter — she is on the brink of victory. Either Colorado or Nevada would carry her over the finish line.

Any sign that Donald Trump Donald TrumpSt. Louis lawyer who pointed gun at Black Lives Matter protesters considering Senate run Chauvin found guilty as nation exhales US says Iran negotiations are 'positive' MORE might grab one of those states threatens Clinton’s path to early victory.

Pay particular attention to Virginia. An early call that Clinton has won the state is a good sign for her in states with lots of college-educated whites and strong racial diversity — read that as auguring well for her chances in Colorado too.

Also keep an eye on Georgia, where the polls close at 7 p.m. The state has voted Republican in every presidential election for the last two decades. But Trump’s toxicity with racial minorities has given Democrats reason to believe they can do well. Trump holds the lead in polls. A close race here is bad news for him while a quick call for him will cheer his backers.

Staying in the south, there will be much attention paid to Florida and North Carolina.

Florida is critical with 29 electoral votes but it is never an early call because part of the state is on central time. The Tar Heel state, however, is likely to be an early bellwether. Polls close there at 7:30 p.m. As of Sunday, the RealClearPolitics polling average in the state showed a small advantage for Trump.

Texas is on my list for fun. The state has not voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since Jimmy Carter in 1976. But Trump’s racist rhetoric about Latinos has given Democrats new hope in the state with the second largest share of Hispanics in the nation: 39 percent. Polls show Trump leading but home-state Sen. Ted Cruz Rafael (Ted) Edward CruzOn The Money: Senate GOP faces post-Trump spending brawl | Senate confirms SEC chief Gensler to full five-year term | Left-leaning group raises concerns about SALT cap repeal Biden watching Derek Chauvin verdict from West Wing Cruz opposed to state lawmaker's bid to replace Wright in Congress MORE beat him in the state’s GOP primary by 17 points.

Stay up late to keep an eye on Utah. Trump can’t afford to lose a solid GOP state. But some recent polls show that independent candidate Evan McMullin, a former CIA officer and a Mormon, is competitive with Trump and Clinton. If McMullin wins, he will be the first third party candidate to claim electoral votes since George Wallace in 1968.

Arizona is worth watching too, because the Democrats see the state as their best hope for an election night shocker. Since September, Clinton has spent over $1 million on ads in the state, where 31 percent of the population is Hispanic. One indication that Clinton has a chance: she nabbed the endorsement of the state’s largest newspaper, the Arizona Republic, which has never endorsed a Democrat for president since it began publishing in 1890.

Get out the popcorn, start Tweeting and watch the returns come in. This is politics as soap opera or World Wrestling Federation — entertaining but at the end disheartening.

When all is said and done, 2016 remains the year that American politics jumped the shark.

21951,Williams,Juan,thehill,"Karl Rove and David Axelrod agree. The two political strategists — both with winning presidential campaigns on their resumés — say the odds are overwhelming that Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' Cuba readies for life without Castro Chelsea Clinton: Pics of Trump getting vaccinated would help him 'claim credit' MORE will be elected as the 45th president of the United States eight days from now.

Republicans on Capitol Hill seem to agree, too — or at least they did until the FBI’s Friday announcement about Clinton-related emails gave new hope to the GOP.

The closing argument from Republican congressional candidates has been that they will serve as a check on a President Clinton. Advertising run by The Congressional Leadership Fund, a GOP political action committee, is based around the theme of no “rubber stamps” for Clinton.

On the Democrats’ side, the political gears are also moving on the assumption that the first female president will take office in January.

The New York Times reports that a scramble is already underway among different factions in the party to get their people into the Clinton cabinet. There is special emphasis on whom Clinton will select for key financial posts, including Treasury Secretary.

“We need a secretary of the Treasury who is prepared to take on the greed and recklessness of Wall Street, not someone who comes from Wall Street,” Sen. Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersNewsmax host: Jury decided to 'sacrifice' Chauvin to the mob Lawmakers react to guilty verdict in Chauvin murder trial: 'Our work is far from done' Senate confirms SEC chief Gensler to full five-year term MORE (I-Vt.) told the Times in an email last week.

It all points to the fact that the real political hotspot right now is not the campaign trail but Capitol Hill. The question is whether Clinton can make deals with Congressional Republicans to get legislation passed into law and win approval for her judicial nominees.

The answer depends, in part, on whether Democrats claim a majority in the Senate. But even if they do, it will be a slim majority. And the odds are that the House will remain in Republican hands.

If past performance indicates the future of the Hillary Clinton White House, she will approach Republicans as a centrist and put pressure on Speaker Paul Ryan Paul Davis RyanOn The Money: Senate confirms Gensler to lead SEC | Senate GOP to face off over earmarks next week | Top Republican on House tax panel to retire Trump faces test of power with early endorsements Lobbying world MORE (R-Wis.) to break away from the right wing of his caucus.

But such a move would ignite counter-pressure from Sens. Sanders and Warren, reminding the new president how important the progressive left is to her political fate.

So, Clinton will be squeezed between left and right.

There is no escaping the fact that Clinton signed a 2016 Democratic Party platform that reads more like a Leftist manifesto, with its calls for a $15 minimum wage and abolition of the death penalty.

She will not be allowed to forget that she embraced free in-state public college tuition for families earning under $125,000 to win support from young, left-wing Democrats.

How can she agree to any trade deals with free trade Republicans after she agreed during the primaries to oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership to win support from unions?

It was smart politics. In an election cycle dominated by populist passions, she had to go left to reach out to the activist base of her party.

In the general election, with Donald Trump Donald TrumpSt. Louis lawyer who pointed gun at Black Lives Matter protesters considering Senate run Chauvin found guilty as nation exhales US says Iran negotiations are 'positive' MORE as her GOP opponent, she never felt the pressure to twist back to the middle of the road to win Republicans and independents. Trump’s ignorance of foreign policy, misogyny, racism, and vulgarity gave her all the help she needed.

Just last week, former secretary of State Colin Powell became the latest GOP stalwart, along with former President George H.W. Bush, to say he is voting for Clinton.

But as president she needs to pivot to work with the GOP. So, will the real Hillary Clinton please stand up?

The Clinton I know as a journalist is a political pragmatist; highly intelligent, consistent in her centrist views and the person who told me in an interview more than a decade ago: “You couldn’t get out of bed in the morning if you were listening to what everybody was saying or assessing.”

Clinton has never been a true liberal. During an Ohio primary event she was quoted as saying: “I get accused of being kind of moderate and [centrist]. I plead guilty.” It is easy to see why that statement gave progressives heartburn.

But she can’t run from her past. She began her political life as a conservative Republican. She grew up as a Goldwater Girl in Park Ridge, Ill., where everyone “thought Republican,” as one of Clinton’s former classmates told a biographer.

“I feel like my political beliefs are rooted in the conservatism that I was raised with,” Clinton said in a 1996 NPR interview.

On military interventionism, free trade, crime and welfare reform, Hillary has been a consummate conservative.

She favors “intensifying” airstrikes against terrorists in Iraq and Syria, a hawkish contrast to President Obama’s approach over the last five years. She voted for President Bush’s invasion of Iraq.

Her hawkishness carried over to her work as Secretary of State. Clinton advocated for the 2009 surge in Afghanistan. She also helped convince Obama to work with NATO to oust Libya’s Moammar Qaddafi.

If Russian President Vladimir Putin thinks he can run over this woman, he is in for a rough time. Think back to the troubles she has faced ranging from her husband’s scandals to attacks on her leadership of the State Department during the crisis in Benghazi.

She stood defiant through it all — including the legendary 11 straight hours of Congressional testimony on Benghazi.

That is why the smart money on Capitol Hill is betting Clinton will be a centrist dealmaker on the Hill.

How the far left and radical right react is the more explosive question.

21952,Williams,Juan,thehill,"My cell phone started ringing before dawn in Las Vegas last Wednesday.

At first, I thought frat boys had found my number and decided to prank me on the morning of the final debate between Donald Trump Donald TrumpSt. Louis lawyer who pointed gun at Black Lives Matter protesters considering Senate run Chauvin found guilty as nation exhales US says Iran negotiations are 'positive' MORE and Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' Cuba readies for life without Castro Chelsea Clinton: Pics of Trump getting vaccinated would help him 'claim credit' MORE. The flood of anonymous calls began politely, checking to see if it was really me. Then they sank into rude and threatening language.

By 4 a.m., I figured out that a new batch of hacked emails from Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta, had been released, including a note I wrote to Podesta with my cell number.

ADVERTISEMENT

By dawn, I had new appreciation for the phrase “your cell phone is blowing up.” It literally did not stop ringing with phone calls, buzzing with text messages, chiming with new email.

The barrage of crude suggestions about me — “ignorant, alcoholic and token black on Fox that needs to go,” — was interspersed with cheerleading: “Trump Will Win,” “TRUMP, TRUMP, TRUMP…” and “Juan, you are a piece of … just wait till TRUMP wins by landslide.”

But there was one serious line of criticism of my journalism in the anonymous text messages. The Trump supporters took my email to Podesta as proof that I am a “liberal stooge,” who is guilty of “continued deceit.”

“Now we know you are as corrupt as all the rest,” one Trump-backer wrote.

Another concluded: “You are a sell-out, Criminal Clinton-crony.” A more poetic version read: “How’s it feel being in Podesta’s pocket? Dark in there? If journalists have to kiss ass to get in, that’s ridiculous. In three weeks we will see that those polls were cooked.”

And one nasty note screamed: “Hey, you little bitch, I’m so glad we found out today you are paid for by Hillary and now I will never listen to you again.”

The note to Podesta that led people to this condemnation of how I practice journalism was pretty straightforward.

It came after we had a brief talk at an April 2015 political event in Washington. He was heading out of town to look at organizing efforts in a few states and would be back in ten days.

My note read: “Love to have a chance to speak with you when you get back from your travels.” I gave him the cell number and asked that we set a date. I wanted to talk to the chairman of a leading candidate’s political operation at the beginning of the campaign. That was all.

At that point I was similarly talking with the people running Jeb Bush’s effort on the Republican side and having lunch with Ed Rollins, who later became head of the Great America super-PAC, a pro-Trump group. I was also guilty of sitting down with other Washington journalists to talk with Ben Carson, Ted Cruz Rafael (Ted) Edward CruzOn The Money: Senate GOP faces post-Trump spending brawl | Senate confirms SEC chief Gensler to full five-year term | Left-leaning group raises concerns about SALT cap repeal Biden watching Derek Chauvin verdict from West Wing Cruz opposed to state lawmaker's bid to replace Wright in Congress MORE and Marco Rubio Marco Antonio RubioOn The Money: Senate GOP faces post-Trump spending brawl | Senate confirms SEC chief Gensler to full five-year term | Left-leaning group raises concerns about SALT cap repeal Senate GOP faces post-Trump spending brawl 15 Senate Republicans pledge to oppose lifting earmark ban MORE.

To me, this is the business of journalism: putting in the time to work the phones, develop ties to people — also known as ‘sources’ — at the heart of politics to better inform readers and viewers about the gears moving to drive daily headlines.

But to my Trump critics, the note to Podesta is evidence that this journalist has a hidden political agenda — pumping up Clinton’s candidacy.

In their minds, it fit with emails from reporters found in earlier WikiLeaks dumps sent to Podesta. For example, CNBC contributor John Harwood wrote to him in chummy language critics later described as “flattery.”

And it fit with the email sent by New York Times Magazine writer Mark Leibovich to Clinton Press Secretary Jennifer Palmieri — again released by WikiLeaks — asking for permission to print a quote from an off-the-record interview with Clinton.

There is no corruption here. Yes, Washington reporters looking for access do ingratiate themselves with politicians in order to get face time. This is an everyday reality to me after 40 years working in the news business for The Washington Post, National Public Radio and Fox News Channel. It does not add up to telling lies or covering up wrongdoing.

To the contrary, good sources opening up to reporters led to the Pentagon Papers story and Watergate in the 1970s.

But in present-day journalism, news outlets are defined less by getting stories of interest to mass audiences than by their success in tailoring news for conservative or liberal audiences. Now, there is less investigative journalism. And now the public’s view of a reporter talking to a source on the other side of the political divide is that he is a shill or working with enemies.

So a reporter trying to sit down with Podesta is suspected of becoming his James Boswell, the personal biographer and chief flatterer of the 18th century literary figure Samuel Johnson.

At last week’s debate, Clinton said U.S. intelligence agencies have identified Russian President Vladimir Putin as the force trying to undermine her campaign by feeding Podesta’s hacked emails to WikiLeaks. Putin also has a hostile, repressive history with independent journalism in his country. And Trump, Clinton said, has become a “puppet” for Putin.

Trump fired back at Clinton — “You’re the puppet” — and said Putin had “outsmarted” her when she was Secretary of State. Later in the debate, he also refused to agree to respect the outcome of the election.

At the debate, Clinton said Trump is “talking down our democracy.” She is right. Journalists — including me — now fall into Trump and Putin’s autocratic worldview as pawns of their foes.

Trump really is “talking down” the idea of a free press and honest journalism. I can tell you from personal experience.

In early September, the Washington Post and Survey Monkey had Clinton up 23 points among white women with a college degree. But as of mid-September, Trump was still leading among white women without a college degree.

Now, according to a PRRI/Atlantic poll conducted as the video of Trump’s hostile talk about grabbing women was released, non-college-educated white women are split, with Clinton and Trump each winning 40 percent of their votes.

Keep in mind that white women without a college education preferred GOP nominee Mitt Romney by 20 points over President Obama in 2012. Among all white women, Romney won by 14 percentage points but still lost among women of all races by 12 points — and lost the election.

Trump’s failure to defeat Clinton among white women with no college education, combined with her edge among college-educated white women — as well as her huge advantage among black, Latina and Asian women — has created an overall 33 point advantage for Clinton among all women, according to the PRRI/Atlantic poll.

That is unprecedented, so much so that the poll looks like an outlier.

But a FiveThirtyEight average of national polls done in October still gives Clinton a 15 point lead among women. And that edge among women is the heart of the growing Clinton lead over Trump both in national polls and in swing states.

The Tina Feys of America — white female voters in the suburbs of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh as well as the suburbs outside Cincinnati and Columbus, and Orlando and Tampa — are roaring.

A CBS Battleground poll taken last week found Clinton leading Trump by 8 points in Pennsylvania, 48 to 40. And here’s the real kicker: 53 percent of Pennsylvania women told pollsters that the tape caused them to view Trump in a worse light.

This trajectory is likely to get worse for Trump as Election Day approaches — not least because several women have now come forward accusing him of various kinds of sexual misconduct and assault. The GOP nominee has vehemently denied those allegations.

Women are the majority of voters. They cast 53 percent of the total votes in 2012. This year, it could be higher.

In previous elections, top political consultants, including Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, did brisk business advising candidates on the best way to reach white women of all economic classes, from “soccer moms,” to post-9/11 “security moms” and post-recession “mortgage moms.”

A year ago, before the primaries, Clinton appeared to have an advantage with women as the likely first female nominee of a major political party. But in the Democratic primaries, she had trouble attracting support from younger women, especially young white women.

And before the disclosure of the lewd tape of Trump bragging about making unwanted sexual advances to women, he was holding the overall advantage among white female voters.

In the stretch run of the presidential campaign, the Clinton camp is not going to stint in its efforts to drive women to the polls.

A devastating new round of television ads is being run by the Clinton campaign aimed at women.

""I fought for my country in Kosovo and Iraq, and I've been a Republican all my life. But I'm the father of three girls,” a male voter says in one of the ads. “I can't stand hearing Donald Trump call women pigs, dogs, and bimbos. And I sure don't want my daughters hearing it. I want my girls to grow up proud and strong in a nation where they're valued and respected.”

The Clinton campaign is getting a major assist from elected Republican officials.

Here’s Sen. Susan Collins Susan Margaret CollinsCollins joins Democrats in bid to undo Trump methane emissions rollback Biden dispatches Cabinet members to sell infrastructure plan Senate confirms SEC chief Gensler to full five-year term MORE (Maine), the most senior Republican woman in the Senate: “Donald Trump's lewd comments are the latest in a series of remarks he has made ranging from inappropriate to reprehensible that demonstrate why he is unsuitable for the presidency.”

Here’s Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (Fla.), the most senior Republican woman in the House. ""Trump doesn't represent our nation. I was not with Trump before and I'm not with him now. Trump must withdraw.”

As the most senior elected Republican, Speaker Paul Ryan Paul Davis RyanOn The Money: Senate confirms Gensler to lead SEC | Senate GOP to face off over earmarks next week | Top Republican on House tax panel to retire Trump faces test of power with early endorsements Lobbying world MORE (Wis.) announced that he could no longer defend his party’s presidential nominee and instead wanted to focus on preserving the GOP’s majority in Congress. Ryan knew his only hope of achieving that goal was to bring suburban women back into the fold. That meant he had to dump Trump.

Last week on this page, I wrote about how the Clinton campaign was making shrewd use of micro-targeting to depress Republican voter turnout among Florida’s Cuban American community.

As we enter the final three weeks of the campaign, every appeal — including every answer Clinton gives in Wednesday night’s debate — will be targeted to those women in the suburbs of Pennsylvania, Florida and Ohio.

As things currently stand, the odds are strong that female voters — particularly the Tina Feys of America — will be responsible for electing the first female president next month. That’s no joke.

That story fit with another Newsweek revelation about Trump’s decision to turn his back on the struggling American steel industry on two of his recent construction projects. He bought cut-rate steel and aluminum from government-backed mills in China instead.

And then there are questions about Trump’s reliance on Russian investors and Chinese banks. The troubling extent of his dependence on money from foreign, communist-backed enterprises is one of the most frequent explanations for why Trump won’t release his tax returns.

Oh, and the man who is running for president as a business titan who knows how to create wealth also lost nearly a billion dollars while the economy was booming in the 1990s, according to the New York Times — and may not have paid taxes for 18 years.

Trump’s troubling financial entanglements with China — a country he says is ripping off the U.S. economy — as well as ties to oligarchs in Vladimir Putin’s Russia and a desire to do business in Fidel Castro’s Cuba might all be revealed if he would release his tax returns.

But even without the tax returns, the Cuba story is the one with the potential to end Trump’s presidential bid.

He needs the Cuban-American vote to have any chance of winning the critical swing state of Florida.

Trump supporter and one-time presidential rival, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio Marco Antonio RubioOn The Money: Senate GOP faces post-Trump spending brawl | Senate confirms SEC chief Gensler to full five-year term | Left-leaning group raises concerns about SALT cap repeal Senate GOP faces post-Trump spending brawl 15 Senate Republicans pledge to oppose lifting earmark ban MORE sees the danger. He called the allegations that Trump explored business in Cuba during the embargo without pre-clearance from the U.S. government “very serious and troubling.”

It is worth noting that Rubio is himself the son of Cuban immigrants and is only about six points ahead of his Democratic opponent as he fights to keep his Senate seat. Like Trump, Rubio cannot afford to risk reduced voter turnout in Florida’s Cuban-American community.

Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' Cuba readies for life without Castro Chelsea Clinton: Pics of Trump getting vaccinated would help him 'claim credit' MORE’s campaign sees an enormous political opening. They have started running a radio ad in Florida targeting Trump’s apparent indifference to freedom-loving people engaged in decades of struggle against Castro.

“While our parents and grandparents were fighting the Castro regime both on and off the island, Donald Trump was looking to line his pocket, and even worse, those of the Castro brothers. This is a serious insult to our community,” the ad concludes.

That ad stays with me because the issue is personal for me.

When I was a boy, my mother fled Panama with me, my brother and sister to get away from a Castro-like populist dictator named Arnulfo Arias. He had shut the door on education and opportunity for all but his followers, punishing people of color, even threatening their citizenship. He ruled with an iron fist — subjugating, jailing and even torturing anyone whom his government suspected of disobedience to the state.

I can totally relate to the plight of the Cuban people and the Cuban refugee community. Their story is essentially my family’s story.

This empathy is why I was so disappointed when President Obama unilaterally lifted restrictions on Cuba last year, without a firm schedule for restoring human rights to the Cuban people.

The U.S. embargo on Cuba was put in place to isolate the Castro regime and force the restoration of those rights. Even today, Castro does not allow a free press and holds political prisoners.

While I don’t agree with Obama’s decision to weaken the embargo by easing travel and financial restrictions, I understand his thinking. The president argues that half a century of sanctions did not bring change to Cuba and it is time to try something new. This is not about money.

That is far different from Trump’s game. He was all about putting money in his pocket by covertly defying the embargo. Based on Newsweek’s reporting, Trump did not give a damn about ending the painful history of communist oppression in Cuba.

He was willing to undermine U.S. foreign policy — codified by law — and gave a form of aid and comfort to the murderous Castro regime for money.

It is easy to see how this would anger not just Cuban Americans but lots of other families — including my own — who came to America to escape Latin American despots.

“The issue has already started to percolate among the state’s large Cuban-American population and could have the potential to undo some of the progress that Mr. Trump — a pariah to many Hispanics — had been making there,” the New York Times reported last week.

The latest Census figures show there are over 1.4 million Cuban Americans currently living in the Sunshine State.

Donald Trump needs this historically reliable Republican constituency to turn out big and support him next month or he will surely lose the state and its 29 electoral votes to Clinton.

History may soon record that it was the press reports about Trump’s business dealings with Fidel Castro’s regime in Cuba — not his poor debate performances — that cost him the 2016 election.

If Republicans retain control on both sides of the Capitol and Clinton wins, it will just result in shameless obstruction of the first female president instead of the first black president.

The permanent, standing filibuster of legislation and nominations that McConnell implemented under Obama will continue and become the norm. Sixty votes not 51 will be required to pass anything through the Senate, just as it has been under Obama.

If you liked the dysfunction, gridlock and petulance of the 114th Congress, then you are going to love what’s in store for the 115th Congress.

Now, some surprising news for Team Trump: It will be much the same for them if he wins. Even with total GOP control of the Senate, the House and the White House, President Trump Donald TrumpSt. Louis lawyer who pointed gun at Black Lives Matter protesters considering Senate run Chauvin found guilty as nation exhales US says Iran negotiations are 'positive' MORE is likely to face pure obstruction from Capitol Hill.

The reason is simple: Trump has broken with years of conservative Republican orthodoxy on free trade, military interventionism, U.S. participation in NATO and, recently, paid maternity leave.

Trump’s positions on these and many other issues are anathema to everything McConnell has said he believed throughout his political career.

The same goes for Speaker Paul Ryan Paul Davis RyanOn The Money: Senate confirms Gensler to lead SEC | Senate GOP to face off over earmarks next week | Top Republican on House tax panel to retire Trump faces test of power with early endorsements Lobbying world MORE (R-Wis.), who has accused Trump of making “textbook” racist comments and who will have a GOP majority in the House capable of blocking Trump’s agenda.

For example, the U.S. Supreme Court has had a vacancy since Antonin Scalia died in February. Senate Republicans have refused to schedule a confirmation hearing much less a vote on Obama’s eminently qualified nominee, Judge Merrick Garland. His confirmation remains stalled.

There is every reason to expect more delay if not outright denial of the nominee, especially if Clinton eventually nominates a stronger liberal.

All calculations about the future of Congress shifted in recent days with polls showing it is increasingly likely that Republicans will hold their majority in the Senate.

The most recent New York Times “Upshot” forecast says the Republicans have a 58 percent chance of holding the Senate. Less than two months ago, the Times gave Democrats a 65 percent chance of winning control of the upper chamber.

In his latest “Crystal Ball” forecast, University of Virginia professor Larry Sabato predicts that, after Election Day, the Democrats will have at least 47 seats while at least 49 seats will be held by Republicans. Four seats — Indiana, Nevada, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania — are toss-ups according to Sabato, who predicts that GOP incumbents in Illinois and Wisconsin will lose their seats.

Press reports are full of rude whispers about how lackluster the crop of Democratic Senate candidates is this year.

“Democrats can still manage to win the four or five seats they need to claim the Senate majority, but the battle has shifted from purple states that Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaMinneapolis mayor on Floyd: 'Ultimately his life will have bettered our city' Lawmakers react to guilty verdict in Chauvin murder trial: 'Our work is far from done' Obamas praise Floyd jury, urge more action: 'We cannot rest' MORE twice carried — Ohio and Florida — to Indiana, Missouri and North Carolina, where Obama lost in 2012,” The Washington Post noted recently.

Even in the New Hampshire Senate race, Gov. Maggie Hassan, the Democratic candidate, is in a dead heat with incumbent Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte Kelly Ann AyotteOvernight Defense: NATO expanding troops in Iraq Overnight Defense: New START extended for five years | Austin orders 'stand down' to tackle extremism | Panel recommends Biden delay Afghanistan withdrawal Study group recommends Biden delay Afghanistan withdrawal MORE — despite the fact that Hassan is much more popular than Clinton in the Granite State.

At data forecasting website FiveThirtyEight, Harry Enten wrote last week that the Senate and presidential races are moving in near lockstep. “Polls continue to show a tight race in states such as New Hampshire, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, three of the four most important seats in determining who wins control,” Enten wrote. “Not coincidentally, the contest between Clinton and Donald Trump in those three states is also close.”

If the Democrats pull through to regain the Senate majority, it will be by a thin margin — possibly relying on a tie-breaking vote from a Vice President Tim Kaine Timothy (Tim) Michael KaineSenators in the dark on parliamentarian's decision Progressives put Democrats on defense Senators reintroduce bill to block NATO withdrawal MORE.

In that scenario, the power of the GOP filibuster returns, with Republicans pointing to polling showing their constituents want them to fight Democrats, not compromise.

Trump’s campaign has turned off major GOP donors but their money continues to flow into key Senate races with the goal of offsetting four more years of a Democrat in the White House.

If the polls keep going the way they are, McConnell’s GOP will have gotten away with it and paid no price at the ballot box.

To put it in old Republican economic terms, if you tax something you get less of it; if you subsidize something you get more of it.

At the moment, Senate Republicans look like they will pay no tax for their years-long blockade of the Obama agenda. And there is no indication they will pay a price for continuing the blockade under Clinton or Trump.

Even with record disapproval ratings, the GOP House and Senate majority are on track for more of the same nightmare.

Politicians, journalists, movie stars, ballplayers and the college crowd will focus on the actual debate only long enough to allow them to send out zingers and put-downs about Trump and Clinton.

President Obama was judged by the Twitter universe to have lost the first 2012 debate against Mitt Romney. Liberals such as Bill Maher and Alec Baldwin cut down their candidate, Obama, in real time because he seemed too cool, not going in to bloody the Republican.

Conservatives created a bandwagon effect by jumping on him from their side. Obama was toast.

The tweets turned against Romney in the second and third debate. Before he left the stage at both events, Romney was savaged by conservative talk show hosts and celebrities for never lambasting the president, especially failing to hammer him on Benghazi – a bloody flag for the conservative websites.

The lesson from 2012 is clear:

The 21st century debate crowd is focused on the small screen even as they are keeping an eye on the big screen television. And wherever they are looking, they want to see fight from the candidate they came to cheer and howling from supporters of the candidate they came to jeer.

That first Obama-Romney debate set a record with 10.3 million tweets. Tonight’s debate is expected to go way over that number with an audience drawn to see Trump’s antics and pride in being politically incorrect — and how the first woman on a presidential debate stage handles him.

The critical test for each candidate is to show fire early and give their base voters reason to start the online cheerleading. That defines the opponent as bloodied.

Trump can delight his followers by calling the Democrat “crooked Hillary.” Any mention of her controversial private e-mails will get a rise on the rightwing blogs.

But given his past behavior, Trump also needs to look presidential. He has to quiet questions about his thin-skin and quick temper. In an ideal world, he would wait to skewer Clinton until she attacks him.

The fireworks will start if she points at him and reminds the audience about his failure to open his tax returns, the scandal over his charity and his wild, often offensive remarks.

Trump got into trouble in the first GOP primary debate when my Fox News colleague Megyn Kelly recited the rude comments he had made about women. The trouble continued when another of my Fox News colleagues, Chris Wallace, knocked him back on his heels with hard questions about his firms’ many bankruptcies.

But conservative websites and Twitter loved the cruel nicknames he gave his Republican rivals, his macho bullying and his refusal to back down over errors of fact.

This time, the audience will be outside the conservative media bubble. It will be much bigger than the small-but-consistent percentage of Republicans that made him the winner against a field of 16 other candidates. When party stalwarts such as Ohio Governor John Kasich and former President George H.W. Bush say they won’t vote for Trump, it causes thoughtful Republicans to take pause.

Trump needs to pull back in those moderate Republicans — especially younger, educated females, often suburbanites. But what pleases them is likely to be at odds with the kind of brashness that excites his current base of older, working-class whites without a college degree. They love his talk of building a border wall, shutting down trade deals and keeping out Muslim immigrants.

Clinton faces challenges of her own.

She needs to excite a Democratic base of young and minority voters, especially Latinos, who tell pollsters she is experienced and knowledgeable but also see her as a status quo candidate who lacks honesty.

For Clinton, her primary audiences tonight are Hispanics and young people who would have preferred a firebrand like Sen. Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersNewsmax host: Jury decided to 'sacrifice' Chauvin to the mob Lawmakers react to guilty verdict in Chauvin murder trial: 'Our work is far from done' Senate confirms SEC chief Gensler to full five-year term MORE (I-Vt.) or Sen. Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth WarrenLawmakers react to guilty verdict in Chauvin murder trial: 'Our work is far from done' World passes 3 million coronavirus deaths Poll: 56 percent say wealth tax is part of solution to inequality MORE (D-Mass.) to have been the Democratic standard bearer.

Clinton needs to speak to Latinos because current polling shows Trump is getting about the same percentage of their vote as Romney did in 2012.

True, Romney lost to Obama that year. But Clinton’s hopes of burying Trump with record-breaking support among Hispanic voters seem to slipping away. She needs the kind of firewall from Hispanic voters, especially in Florida, Colorado, Nevada, and Arizona, that she got from black voters in the south during the Democratic primary.

And Clinton also has to put on a show for the young voter.

A George Washington University Battleground poll taken earlier this month showed Clinton struggling with millennials.

Just 22 percent of 18 to 34-year-olds told pollsters Clinton “says what she believes” and only 38 percent said she is “honest and trustworthy.”

Clinton made a direct appeal to those voters last week in a speech in Philadelphia.

“Too many young black men and women made to feel like their lives are disposable; too many immigrants living in fear of deportation; too many young LGBT Americans, bullied; too many young women and men assaulted,” she said.

Finally, Clinton wants Republican women to hear her roar. If she can reach middle-of-the road women uncomfortable with the risk posed by Trump’s appeals to white nationalism and his lack of experience in national politics, she wins.

Much has been written about how the 2016 election flipped the script on the old rules of campaigning, rhetoric, advertising and politics in general. Tonight will be a completely new debate experience, scored and distorted in real time by instantaneous reaction on social media.

Fire up your hashtag for the big debate.

The New York Times’ liberal editorial page similarly concluded “real damage had been done” because Clinton had written off a group of voters by saying they were “irredeemable.”

Sally Kohn, the left-leaning CNN commentator, wrote in The Washington Post that “what is, in fact, deplorable is not only that Clinton said this but that she apparently believes it.”

Kohn explained that while Trump is clearly “running a xenophobic campaign that’s pandering to white nationalism,” most of his supporters are filled with “resentment that is partly about identity but also about economic suffering.” Clinton, Kohn argued, “should be reaching out to these voters, not offending them.”

This line of thinking from influential white Democrats reminded me of a line in President Reagan’s 1989 farewell address: “Don’t be afraid to see what you see.”

And here is what I see:

Mike Pence Michael (Mike) Richard PenceHispanic Caucus energized by first Biden meeting Simon & Schuster rejects employees' call to drop Pence book deal Jeffries roasts McCarthy over Waters: 'Clean up your own mess' MORE, Trump’s vice presidential running mate, was asked a few days after Clinton’s speech if he would call former Ku Klux Klan leader and white supremacist David Duke a ""deplorable.""

""No, I'm not in the name-calling business,” Pence responded, refusing to condemn an indisputable racist and Trump supporter.

Instead, Pence complained: ""What Hillary Clinton did Friday night was shocking. I mean, the millions of people who support Donald Trump around this country are not a basket of anything.""

And then I saw Trump’s son, Donald Jr., post an image of his dad, Pence and Alex Jones.

Jones is best known for advancing the conspiracy theory that the U.S. government was behind the 9/11 terrorist attacks that killed almost 3,000 people. Jones has also suggested the government is putting chemical additives into juice boxes, intending to make children homosexual to control population growth. And Jones claims the massacre of school children at Sandy Hook Elementary in 2012 was staged as part of a government plot to enact gun control and that no children were actually killed there.

Trump has praised Jones for “his amazing reputation” and appeared as a guest on his show during the GOP primaries.

Earlier this month, Trump Jr. tweeted an article from Jones’ website which stated that Hillary Clinton was wearing an earpiece during a forum with Matt Lauer on NBC News. Clinton was not wearing an earpiece, of course.

At a Trump rally last week in Asheville, N.C., a 69-year-old woman protesting against the GOP nominee at one of the candidate’s rallies was punched in the face by a Trump supporter. She later called a North Carolina television station to ask if people found a Trump supporter punching her in the face ‘deplorable’?

So, I see a lot of deplorable behavior. But some political thought-leaders — including some Clinton supporters — prefer to excuse it as the actions of a few misguided people and not representative of most Trump supporters.

Can we determine if close to half of Trump supporters hold deplorable beliefs? Let’s go to the polls.

An April poll taken by Reuters found that a large percentage of self-described Trump supporters describe black people as more “lazy” than whites (40 percent), “less intelligent” than whites (32 percent), more “rude” than whites (44 percent), more “violent” than whites (48 percent) and more “criminal” than whites (46 percent).

Another Reuters poll taken in July found that 58 percent of Trump supporters have either a “very unfavorable” or “somewhat unfavorable” view of the entire religion of Islam.

These are racist views. If they do not count as “deplorable,” then the word “deplorable” no longer has any meaning. By the way, a Washington Post/ABC News poll has 60 percent of Americans agreeing that Trump is personally “biased against women and minorities.”

Another shocking poll from NBC News/Survey Monkey taken in August found that just 27 percent of Republicans agreed with the statement “Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaMinneapolis mayor on Floyd: 'Ultimately his life will have bettered our city' Lawmakers react to guilty verdict in Chauvin murder trial: 'Our work is far from done' Obamas praise Floyd jury, urge more action: 'We cannot rest' MORE was born in the U.S.”

Trump burst on to the national political stage five years ago as the “birther-in-chief,” perpetuating this overtly racist conspiracy theory about the first black President of the United States. Only last week did he finally — and briefly — acknowledge that Obama was born in the United States.

As she prepares for her first debate with Trump next week, Clinton needs to unapologetically remind voters — especially traditional Republicans who are uncomfortable with seeing their party overrun by extremists — of the racist, paranoid fringes that Trump has invited into the nation’s politics under the banner of the Republican Party.

Clinton laid the groundwork in a speech in Nevada last month when she declared that ""a fringe element has effectively taken over the Republican Party.""

She accused Trump of “disregard for the values that make our country.""

After being scolded for her ‘deplorables’ comment, Clinton backtracked. She explained that she was being “grossly generalistic…I regret saying ‘half’ – that was wrong.”

Clinton should not have apologized. Calling out the bullies and the bigots in a national presidential election is brave. Listen to her running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine Timothy (Tim) Michael KaineSenators in the dark on parliamentarian's decision Progressives put Democrats on defense Senators reintroduce bill to block NATO withdrawal MORE (D-Va.).

“She advanced the notion that if you’re chumming around with the head of the KKK … that’s deplorable,” Kaine said. “You’ve got to call that out. If you’re attacking immigrants, that’s deplorable. If you’re attacking LGBT Americans, that’s deplorable. If you’re attacking people because they’re Muslims, that’s deplorable.”

To quote President Reagan once again: “Don’t be afraid to see what you see.”

My bet is that if any of those three GOP primary candidates had won the nomination, they would by now have consolidated the Republican base by attracting educated, white voters — especially women — who have questions about Clinton. Many of those voters, however, cannot bring themselves to support the actual nominee of the Republican Party, Donald Trump Donald TrumpSt. Louis lawyer who pointed gun at Black Lives Matter protesters considering Senate run Chauvin found guilty as nation exhales US says Iran negotiations are 'positive' MORE.

The same dynamic affects independent voters, too. They might well be attracted to a Republican candidate — if the candidate in question was not known for refusing to release his taxes, mocking the disabled, demeaning women, hating immigrants, praising Vladimir Putin and lying about the Mexican president’s stand on a border wall.

Even so, at the moment Trump is drawing closer to Clinton. Having been behind by eight percentage points in early August he is now within about three percentage points, according to the Real Clear Politics average of polls.

Is there an “October Surprise” with the power to push one candidate to victory?

Yes — in the shape of President Obama.

A majority of Americans — 50.8 percent on average, according to the latest polls — approve of Obama’s job performance. In a new Washington Post/ABC News poll released Sunday, 58 percent of adults gave Obama the thumbs-up and only 40 percent disapproved of his performance. Such popularity for an incumbent commander-in-chief in the twilight of his presidency is truly remarkable in an era of polarization and widespread discontent with the political system.

Obama’s predecessor, George W. Bush, left office with a 22 percent approval rating in the last CBS/New York Times poll of his presidency. His poor ranking with voters led the last two Republicans who ran for the White House — John McCain John Sidney McCainBush says he doesn't criticize other presidents to avoid risking friendship with Michelle Obama 'Real Housewives of the GOP' — Wannabe reality show narcissists commandeer the party George W.

But in this race, the incumbent president holds a winning hand. He is the key to unlocking support from the nearly 20 percent of voters who are undecided — the independents, conservative Democrats and college-educated Republicans who will be pivotal to the outcome of the election.

According to a Gallup poll published on August 30, 55.4 percent of Americans say they rate their life “well enough to be considered ‘thriving.’” That number has risen during Obama’s years in the White House.

Last month’s unemployment rate was 4.9 percent — near de facto full employment, according to most economists. The Affordable Care Act, in the face of constant Republican antagonism, has provided health insurance coverage to more than 20 million Americans who were previously uninsured.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average continues to shatter records, closing at over 18,000 again last week. The NASDAQ has more than tripled since Obama became president. Last week also brought news that the U.S. Consumer Confidence Index had reached its highest level since September 2015.

An August poll from Gallup showed that 48 percent of Americans approved of the way Obama is handling the economy. The economy is the number one issue for voters.

Last week, Trump dismissed the good economic indicators by claiming that the Federal Reserve was creating a “false economy” and an “artificial stock market.” But there is a strong sense on both Wall Street and Main Street that the economy has come back to life and Americans are benefitting.

Meanwhile, Trump’s economic plan is getting dumped on by leading businessmen and policy experts.

“A Trump victory in particular could prolong and perhaps exacerbate policy uncertainty and deliver a shock (though perhaps short-lived) to financial markets,” said Willem Buiter, the Chief Economist for Citigroup, in a memo last month.

Put it all together and it becomes clear Obama can help Clinton capitalize on economic issues and stir Democrats to turn out.

“Most of [Obama’s] appearances will be timed to coincide with voter registration deadlines and the start of early voting,” according to a recent New York Times report.

The Times also wrote: “Neither the Clinton campaign nor the White House has announced any more appearances, in part because they want to be able to send Mr. Obama where they think they need him most. But his visits are likely to be concentrated in Florida, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Nevada and Iowa, campaign officials said. Mr. Obama will generally campaign without Mrs. Clinton.”

It was announced last week that First Lady Michelle Obama Michelle LeVaughn Robinson ObamaMinneapolis mayor on Floyd: 'Ultimately his life will have bettered our city' Obamas praise Floyd jury, urge more action: 'We cannot rest' Bush says he doesn't criticize other presidents to avoid risking friendship with Michelle Obama MORE would also be hitting the campaign trail for Clinton. The First Lady enjoys a 64 percent approval rating, according to the most recent Gallup survey.

Contrast the political dynamite available to the Clinton campaign — in the form of the Obamas — with the sorry roster of C-list surrogates the Trump campaign is leaning on.

With the exception of Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions Jefferson (Jeff) Beauregard SessionsGarland rescinds Trump-era memo curtailing consent decrees Biden picks vocal Trump critics to lead immigration agencies The Hill's Morning Report - Biden assails 'epidemic' of gun violence amid SC, Texas shootings MORE and a handful of obscure backbenchers in the House, the Trump campaign has hardly any Capitol Hill surrogates speaking on its behalf. Romney, McCain and Bush had a chorus of current lawmakers making the case for them during their campaigns.

The Hill identified five swing states last week where Obama could be the biggest help to Clinton: Iowa, Nevada, Florida, Pennsylvania and North Carolina.

The Obamas can also provide a boon to lackluster Democratic Senate candidates in these states who have fallen behind in the polls.

The president is doing more than being nice to a fellow Democrat. He needs Clinton to preserve his legacy and prevent Trump from taking a wrecking ball to his accomplishments. The Democrats in the House and the Senate need Obama to get his voters out to the polls one last time.

Delivering his one-time secretary of State a victory in November is likely to be one of Obama’s greatest political legacies.

When the House and Senate get back to work tomorrow, the GOP majorities on both sides of Capitol Hill will be up against a September 30 deadline to pass a spending bill to keep the federal government open. That means funding the military, keeping Social Security checks going out and assuring global investors that the world’s leading economic power is not about to grind to a halt.

ADVERTISEMENT

If Congress fails to act, there will be a government shutdown weeks before a presidential election. In fact, early voting will be underway in several states.

In terms of the presidential race and the fight over control of the Senate, history tells us a government shutdown is a loser for Republicans.

In 2013, a majority of voters — 53 percent according to a Washington Post poll — blamed Republicans for the shutdown while only 29 percent blamed President Obama and the Democrats. The same was true in a 1996 shutdown — the majority of voters blamed the GOP-led Congress, not President Clinton.

But hardline conservatives in the House Freedom Caucus don’t care about history. They are willing to hold the federal government and fellow Republicans running for election hostage until GOP congressional leaders, Obama and the Democrats agree to more spending cuts.

The Freedom Caucus threats are specifically aimed at Speaker Paul Ryan Paul Davis RyanOn The Money: Senate confirms Gensler to lead SEC | Senate GOP to face off over earmarks next week | Top Republican on House tax panel to retire Trump faces test of power with early endorsements Lobbying world MORE (R- Wis.).

At the moment, Freedom Caucus members are already upset with Ryan after the defeat of one of their most prominent members, Rep. Tim Huelskamp, in his Kansas primary last month. Caucus members are telling reporters Ryan did not do enough to help Huelskamp.

“How can you have a gang, and have one in your gang get stabbed, and do nothing?” one caucus member told the Huffington Post in an interview last week. “You got to stab somebody, or else what’s the point of having a gang?”

Also fueling anger inside the Freedom Caucus is the possibility that Ryan will not take up a resolution to impeach IRS Commissioner John Koskinen before the election.

Ryan is not saying if he will bring the Caucus-led measure to the floor for a vote. He has, however, expressed reservations about setting a precedent for impeaching a cabinet or sub-cabinet official, according to Bloomberg. The House hasn’t voted to impeach a Cabinet-level official in nearly 140 years. More than 100 law professors sent a letter to the Speaker last week urging him not to break the precedent.

Meanwhile, Ryan is frustrated by the Freedom Caucus’ refusal to make deals on any of his top priorities as Speaker. The House hasn’t passed an official Republican budget; it has taken no action on a replacement to the Affordable Care Act; and Ryan is stymied on the Transpacific Partnership (TPP) because the GOP presidential nominee is running as an opponent of free trade.

And now — with the November election staring him in the face — Ryan finds himself in a high-profile showdown with those far-right members over the spending bill.

Freedom Caucus members say their only concern is restraining any growth in government spending. They are not persuaded by the fact that the federal deficit as a percentage of GDP has shrunk by about 75 percent since President Obama’s first year in office. In addition, between 2010 and 2014 discretionary spending as a percentage of GDP declined 25 percent. Meanwhile, “sequestration” has imposed fixed limits on spending since hardliners demanded it in 2013.

The easiest answer for Congress is to pass a short-term continuing resolution. That will kick the can down the road past November and into a lame duck session of Congress.

But the Freedom Caucus wants a multi-year deal with more sequestration-type restrictions. Their goal is to prevent a future Democrat in the White House and Democratic-majority in the Senate — both now likely — from passing a deal with more spending. Ryan is caught in the middle.

The window for Congress to pass a funding bill is narrow, with the House only scheduled to be in session for four weeks before the election.

That deadline pressure is putting Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellMcConnell vents over 'fake news' The Hill's 12:30 Report - Presented by Facebook - Tensions rise as U.S. waits for Derek Chauvin verdict Trump looking 'beyond seriously' at 2024 run MORE (R-Ky.) on the defensive over the stalemate in the House. McConnell is trying to shield vulnerable Republican senators from being damaged by a government shutdown.

Earlier this year, it seemed a political certainty that the GOP would lose its Senate majority. But the latest New York Times forecast shows the Democrats with only a 56 percent chance of winning back control of the upper chamber.

McConnell doesn’t want to do anything to jeopardize his team’s recent gains in the polls.

21967,Williams,Juan,thehill,"Here is the latest chapter in bang-your-head-on-the-wall, stupid, frustrating Congressional politics.

When the House and Senate get back to work tomorrow, the GOP majorities on both sides of Capitol Hill will be up against a September 30 deadline to pass a spending bill to keep the federal government open. That means funding the military, keeping Social Security checks going out and assuring global investors that the world’s leading economic power is not about to grind to a halt.

If Congress fails to act, there will be a government shutdown weeks before a presidential election. In fact, early voting will be underway in several states.

In terms of the presidential race and the fight over control of the Senate, history tells us a government shutdown is a loser for Republicans.

In 2013, a majority of voters — 53 percent according to a Washington Post poll — blamed Republicans for the shutdown while only 29 percent blamed President Obama and the Democrats. The same was true in a 1996 shutdown — the majority of voters blamed the GOP-led Congress, not President Clinton.

But hardline conservatives in the House Freedom Caucus don’t care about history. They are willing to hold the federal government and fellow Republicans running for election hostage until GOP congressional leaders, Obama and the Democrats agree to more spending cuts.

The Freedom Caucus threats are specifically aimed at Speaker Paul Ryan Paul Davis RyanOn The Money: Senate confirms Gensler to lead SEC | Senate GOP to face off over earmarks next week | Top Republican on House tax panel to retire Trump faces test of power with early endorsements Lobbying world MORE (R- Wis.).

At the moment, Freedom Caucus members are already upset with Ryan after the defeat of one of their most prominent members, Rep. Tim Huelskamp, in his Kansas primary last month. Caucus members are telling reporters Ryan did not do enough to help Huelskamp.

“How can you have a gang, and have one in your gang get stabbed, and do nothing?” one caucus member told the Huffington Post in an interview last week. “You got to stab somebody, or else what’s the point of having a gang?”

Also fueling anger inside the Freedom Caucus is the possibility that Ryan will not take up a resolution to impeach IRS Commissioner John Koskinen before the election.

Ryan is not saying if he will bring the Caucus-led measure to the floor for a vote. He has, however, expressed reservations about setting a precedent for impeaching a cabinet or sub-cabinet official, according to Bloomberg. The House hasn’t voted to impeach a Cabinet-level official in nearly 140 years. More than 100 law professors sent a letter to the Speaker last week urging him not to break the precedent.

Meanwhile, Ryan is frustrated by the Freedom Caucus’ refusal to make deals on any of his top priorities as Speaker. The House hasn’t passed an official Republican budget; it has taken no action on a replacement to the Affordable Care Act; and Ryan is stymied on the Transpacific Partnership (TPP) because the GOP presidential nominee is running as an opponent of free trade.

And now — with the November election staring him in the face — Ryan finds himself in a high-profile showdown with those far-right members over the spending bill.

Last week, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' Cuba readies for life without Castro Chelsea Clinton: Pics of Trump getting vaccinated would help him 'claim credit' MORE said Trump is “taking hate groups mainstream,” and “helping a radical fringe take over one of America’s two major political parties.” Trump tried to reduce the accusations to a game of tit-for-tat by calling her a ""bigot.”

But Clinton’s words simply amplified what Speaker Paul Ryan Paul Davis RyanOn The Money: Senate confirms Gensler to lead SEC | Senate GOP to face off over earmarks next week | Top Republican on House tax panel to retire Trump faces test of power with early endorsements Lobbying world MORE (R-Wis.) said months ago, after Trump attacked an Indiana-born judge as being incapable of fairness because of his Mexican heritage. Ryan said Trump’s remarks amounted to a “textbook definition of a racist comment.”

The damage Trump is doing to the GOP is evident in polls showing more than 12 percent of registered Republicans intend to vote for Clinton. GOP-leaning independent voters are staying away from Trump, too. The latest Quinnipiac poll had Clinton with 51 percent support and the Republican nominee fading.

As a result, the GOP is now likely to lose control of the Senate and lose seats in the House in the fall election.

And yet Speaker Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellMcConnell vents over 'fake news' The Hill's 12:30 Report - Presented by Facebook - Tensions rise as U.S. waits for Derek Chauvin verdict Trump looking 'beyond seriously' at 2024 run MORE (R-Ky.) and Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus have decided they have to stand with Trump — even as he destroys their party.

Much of the damage is directly tied to Trump’s racial politics.

Long before Trump, the GOP already had few black and Latino elected officials. The party is in desperate need of more women as well as racial and ethnic diversity to keep up with the reality of the nation’s changing demographics.

A wider range of people backing conservative principles — from small government and low taxes, to free trade and policies supporting strong families — is not tokenism. It is a necessity if the party is to remain relevant to policy debates and have any chance of winning in the future.

And there are churchgoing, family loving black people, Latinos and immigrants who share those values but see the GOP as an exclusively white party.

The potential power of a racially diverse GOP was on display this year in the ongoing controversy over police use of excessive force against blacks. The debate was an exercise in polarization between Republican law-and-order voices backing the police and Democrats backing the controversial Black Lives Matter group when Sen. Tim Scott Timothy (Tim) Eugene ScottChauvin found guilty as nation exhales Lawmakers react to guilty verdict in Chauvin murder trial: 'Our work is far from done' Tim Scott: 'No question' Floyd jury reached 'the right verdict' MORE (R-S.C.) stood up.

Even in a business suit and wearing a lapel pin signifying that he is a member of the Senate, Scott recalled being treated like a criminal suspect by Capitol Police: “The officer looked at me, full of attitude… I was thinking to myself, either he thinks I’m committing a crime — impersonating a member of Congress — or what?”

As a black man, a conservative and a Republican senator, Scott said he has “felt the anger…that comes with feeling like you are being targeted for nothing more than being just yourself.”

And when the Ku Klux Klan’s former Grand Wizard endorsed Trump by saying it is “treason” against white heritage to fail to vote for Trump, Scott again spoke up:

“Any candidate who cannot immediately condemn a hate group like the KKK does not represent the Republican Party,” he said. “If Donald Trump can’t take a stand against the KKK, we cannot trust him to stand up for America against Putin, Iran or ISIS.”

Scott’s stand against Trump now can be seen as an early storm warning. As Labor Day approaches, the awful reality of what Trump has done to the GOP goes beyond polls showing Trump is on track to lose more than 90 percent of the black vote and around 80 percent of the Latino vote.

The real issue for the GOP is that the latest polls have him losing white women with college degrees. That is devastating to the Republican brand.

Trump’s recent speeches about black America to overwhelmingly white audiences — asking black people “what the hell do you have to lose?” by voting for him — is an effort to regain the support of white Republicans who do not want to vote for someone viewed as a bigot.

Trump established himself in national Republican politics five years ago by pushing the racist conspiracy theory that President Obama was not an American citizen. Trump’s shameful stoking of this effort to undermine the credibility of the first black president remains an issue.

A disturbing poll from NBC News/Survey Monkey taken earlier this month found that a shockingly low 25 percent of Republicans agreed with the statement “Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaMinneapolis mayor on Floyd: 'Ultimately his life will have bettered our city' Lawmakers react to guilty verdict in Chauvin murder trial: 'Our work is far from done' Obamas praise Floyd jury, urge more action: 'We cannot rest' MORE was born in the U.S.”

The GOP’s problem with black voters didn’t begin when Barack Obama became president and it won’t end when he leaves the White House.

Even as he swept 49 states in his 1984 reelection, Ronald Reagan only won 9 percent of the black vote. George W. Bush fared only slightly better in his 2004 re-election, netting 11 percent of the black vote but put blacks in his cabinet, notably Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice.

Ryan, to his credit, has tried to follow in the footsteps of his mentor, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp, who famously toured black communities promoting economic growth with “empowerment zones.”

Trump is squandering those decades of efforts on race by Republicans.

Ryan, McConnell and Priebus need to dump Trump and save their party.

Something big is going on, threatening coastlines, crops and wildlife. But Republicans and Democrats — in a polarized Congress and across the country — can’t agree on what’s causing the heat and destruction. They also can’t agree on what to do about it.

A Stanford study recently found, in the words of the Associated Press, that while “90 percent of Democrats and 80 percent of independents believe global warming will be a serious or very serious problem for the United States, barely half of Republicans feel that way.”

""It's more politically polarizing than abortion,"" Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, told the news agency last week. ""It's more politically polarizing than gay marriage.""

In the interview, Leiserowitz noted other surveys had indicated that “17 percent of Americans, the fastest-growing group, are alarmed by climate change and want action now.” A further 28 percent of Americans say they are concerned but believe the consequences will only be truly felt far in the future. Still, another 27 percent basically say they can’t decide. But 10 percent of Americans totally dismiss claims of climate change.

That political divide is on display in the presidential campaign.

“I'm not a big believer in man-made climate change,"" GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump Donald TrumpSt. Louis lawyer who pointed gun at Black Lives Matter protesters considering Senate run Chauvin found guilty as nation exhales US says Iran negotiations are 'positive' MORE told a Florida journalist this month when asked about its effects on coastal communities in the Sunshine State. ""There could be some impact, but I don't believe it's devastating impact.""

Previously, Trump had tweeted “Any and all weather events are used by the GLOBAL WARMING HOAXSTERS to justify higher taxes to save our planet! They don't believe it $$$$!”

In 2012, Trump famously tweeted “Let's continue to destroy the competitiveness of our factories & manufacturing so we can fight mythical global warming. China is so happy!”

Mike Pence Michael (Mike) Richard PenceHispanic Caucus energized by first Biden meeting Simon & Schuster rejects employees' call to drop Pence book deal Jeffries roasts McCarthy over Waters: 'Clean up your own mess' MORE, Trump’s vice presidential nominee, was one of the most vocal climate-change deniers in Congress during his tenure, saying flatly “global warming is a myth” on his campaign website.

Meanwhile, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' Cuba readies for life without Castro Chelsea Clinton: Pics of Trump getting vaccinated would help him 'claim credit' MORE is calling out Trump and Republicans for being blinded to scientific reality by politics.

“I believe in science,” Clinton said in her acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention last month. “I believe that climate change is real and that we can save our planet while creating millions of good-paying clean energy jobs.”

There is also good political reason for Clinton to fight Trump and Pence on the issue.

At a minimum, she gains points with environmentalists and the large number of young voters who, according to polls, strongly believe there is a climate change problem. And it is not just young people. A Gallup poll taken in March found that 64 percent of Americans say they are concerned a “great deal or a fair amount” about global warming — the highest number in eight years.

Trump, however, sees political gain in downplaying climate change. He promises to reopen coal mines and reopen smokestack industries in Midwest states such as Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Voters in those states could be turned off by a Clinton embrace of more regulations to combat climate change, fearing it will cost them money and jobs.

The latest RealClearPolitics polling average shows Clinton with a solid lead over Trump in two of those three states: 7 percent in Michigan, 9 percent in Pennsylvania. If her lead grows to double digits, she may feel liberated to take an even harder line on climate change.

President Obama, in his last months in office, is adding to the pressure on Trump and the GOP majority in Congress. Last week, he released new fuel efficiency standards on “heavy-duty” trucks and equipment in order to meet a goal agreed on with Canada and Mexico for half of all power in North America to be free of carbon dioxide by 2025.

The president devoted his entire weekly address to the issue two weeks ago.

“One of the most urgent challenges of our time is climate change,” Obama declared. “We know that 2015 surpassed 2014 as the warmest year on record — and 2016 is on pace to be even hotter.”

“There’s still much more to do,” he said, challenging Congress to build on the progress made in the Paris Agreement last year where the nations of the world proposed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions which cause climate change.

Even after Obama leaves the White House, the issue will remain at the front of the political agenda. Congress is going to have to deal with reauthorization of the National Flood Insurance Program next year.

As a political issue, climate change is definitely heating up. Expect one of the candidates to get burned on it in the debates; the polls show the candidate on the defensive will be Trump.

Every climate change-induced natural disaster, between now and the election, presents an opportunity for Clinton to portray Trump as whistling past the Louisiana flood waters.

""Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing, I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press,” Trump declared, without a hint of humor.

The GOP presidential nominee also announced that the Obama administration’s failure to work with Russia was rooted in Russian leader Vladimir Putin’s dislike of President Obama. Putin had even called the U.S. leader the “N-word,” Trump alleged.

Later, Trump tried to slip away from critics by saying he was being “sarcastic” about having a foreign nation intrude into American presidential politics. But his comments came within days of American investigators concluding with “high confidence” that Russia broke U.S. law and hacked the Democratic National Committee’s computers.

Since then, Trump has asserted his desire to work with Russia and said “if we could be friendly with Russia – wouldn’t that be a good thing?” He similarly refused to condemn Russia for invading and taking over Ukrainian land. And earlier, he dismissed the idea that the U.S. was required to defend its fellow NATO states that are living in fear of Russian aggression, if they are attacked.

Now Trump is about to start getting regular briefings from the nation’s top intelligence agencies, as is traditional for the major parties’ presidential nominees.

Given his uncritical embrace of Russia and blind affection for its demagogic leader, there is real danger in sharing national secrets with Trump.

The greatest danger is that Trump and so many of the men running his campaign have financial reasons to share information with Russia and Putin, even at a possible cost to the interests of the U.S.

Eight years ago, Donald Trump Jr. said flatly that “Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our [the Trump family] assets.”

Washington Post columnist George Will recently wrote that questions about “Trump’s financial entanglements with Putin and his associates [are] justified by Trump’s refusal to release his personal and business tax information.”

Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort “has long and deep reported ties to pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine,” according to Politfact. Manafort also once controlled investments for a wealthy Russian closely allied with Putin.

Retired Lt. General Michael Flynn, former Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, is one of Trump’s top advisers. He was famously photographed sitting almost next to Putin at the head table of a gala celebrating the state-funded Russia Today, or RT, TV network.

Flynn told RT in an interview published on its website last December that the United States and Russia should work together to defeat ISIS and bring about an end to the Syrian civil war.

Also advising Trump on Russia is businessman Carter Page, who reportedly has extensive financial dealings with Russians.

Page “traveled to Moscow last week and criticized the U.S. and other western powers for their ‘hypocritical focus on ideas such as democratization, inequality, corruption and regime change,’ in other countries,” Washington Free Beacon reporter Morgan Chalfant wrote in mid-July.

“So many people who I know and have worked with have been so adversely affected by the sanctions policy,” Page said in an interview with Bloomberg in March. He then offered hope for the end of U.S. sanctions on Russian “creating a better situation.”

With that attitude, Trump staffers changed one item in the GOP platform before their convention. As The Washington Post reported at the time: “The Trump campaign worked behind the scenes last week to make sure the new Republican platform won’t call for giving weapons to Ukraine to fight Russian and rebel forces, contradicting the view of almost all Republican foreign policy leaders in Washington.”

As Trump himself once said, falsely suggesting President Obama may have ISIS sympathies, “there’s something going on.”

And polls show the American public is catching on to Trump’s strange attachment to Putin and Russia.

A poll from YouGov published last week found that 54 percent of Americans, including 48 percent of self-described independents, say Trump urging Russia to hack Clinton's e-mails was “inappropriate.”

According to the same poll, 40 percent of Americans — and 38 percent of independents — think the GOP nominee is “too friendly towards Russia.”

Polls also show Clinton, the former secretary of State, widening her lead over Trump on the question of who would be better on foreign policy.

A CNN/ORC poll last week found that 59 percent of voters trust Clinton more to handle foreign policy. Just 36 percent favored Trump to take change of the nation’s foreign affairs.

Hillary Clinton drove home questions about Trump’s consuming affection for Putin in an interview on “Fox News Sunday” eight days ago.

“I think if you take his encouragement that the Russians hack into American email accounts, if you take his quite excessive praise for Putin, his absolute allegiance to a lot of Russian wish-list foreign policy positions…[it] leads us once again to conclude he is not temperamentally fit to be president and commander in chief,” Secretary Clinton said.

Days later, President Obama said Trump’s comments about the parents of a deceased American soldier who was Muslim made him believe ""the Republican nominee is unfit to serve as president.”

""He’s woefully unprepared,” Obama said. “There has to be a point at which you say, 'Enough,'”

For voters, that point is Trump’s suspicious ties to Russia.

But Latino elected officials were not exactly thrilled by last week’s Democratic convention, either.

With GOP nominee Donald Trump calling for deportation of all undocumented immigrants, seeking to build a wall on the border with Mexico and defaming Mexican immigrants as “rapists” and thieves, Democrats are expecting record turnout and support from Latinos.

But at the Philadelphia convention, the party’s Latino leaders spoke privately of wanting more attention from the Clinton campaign and the Obama White House.

A prime example of the Democrats’ strained relationship with Latinos is on view in the U.S. Senate race in California. Two Democrats — one Latina and one black — are facing off to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer Barbara Levy BoxerBottom line Trump administration halting imports of cotton, tomatoes from Uighur region of China Biden inaugural committee to refund former senator's donation due to foreign agent status MORE.

Under California law, the top two vote-getters during the primaries advance to the general election — even if they are both Democrats.

Rep. Loretta Sanchez trails California Attorney General Kamala Harris in the polls and in fundraising. Harris has more than twice as much money on hand as Sanchez, $2.9 million to $1.1 million. If Harris wins, she will be the second black woman ever elected to the U.S. Senate. Sanchez, however, would be the first Latina.

Sanchez is charging that Harris is the choice of “the party establishment, the insiders…they discouraged all of us from running.” Vice President Biden and California Gov. Jerry Brown have endorsed Harris. But Sanchez includes President Obama, who has also endorsed Harris, in that “establishment"" as well. Sanchez told Univision that Harris “is African American. He [Obama] is too.”

“I think they have…a friendship of many years. She is African American, as is he. They know each other through meetings,” said Sanchez.

Harris is the daughter of two first generation immigrants, an Indian-American mother and a Jamaican-American father.

Harris fired back that Sanchez “should apologize to the president of the United States.”

The White House was forced to get involved in the fray. Press Secretary Josh Earnest said the president didn’t know what Sanchez “intended to imply.”

“The president’s endorsement, though, I think spoke volumes about his deep appreciation for Attorney General Harris’ service and her skill,” Earnest declared.

But Sanchez got support from fellow Latino politicians.

“Congresswoman Sanchez has served her party and her state in an exemplary fashion for over 20 years,” said Rep. Filemon Vela (D-Texas) earlier this year, when it was clear California Democrats were lining up behind Harris.

“Not one single Democratic Latina has ever been in the United States Senate, and the California Democratic Party’s position is a disrespectful example of wayward institutional leadership which on the one hand ‘wants our vote’ but on the other hand wants to ‘spit us out,’” Vela fumed.

While the Democrats have made history with the first black president, and now the first female nominee of a major party, a Latino has yet to appear on the presidential ticket.

“There’s no question that the future of the Democratic Party of America lies with Hispanics,” said Gilberto Hinojosa, the chairman of the Texas Democratic Party, who was one of many prominent Latinos who lobbied the Clinton campaign hard to put Castro on the ticket.

It’s also why you saw Clinton supporters such as Rep. Tony Cárdenas (Calif.), the chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus’ fundraising PAC, go out of their way to praise Kaine as “a true friend and ally of the Latino community.” Much was made at the Democratic National Convention last week of the fact that Kaine speaks fluent Spanish.

“He has proven himself a leader through advocacy on immigration and common sense gun reform. It has been his life’s journey to create an equal playing field for Latino families,” added Cardenas.

Obama won 71 percent of Latino voters in 2012, according to exit polls.They are the largest minority group in the United States and their numbers are especially strong in electorally crucial states like Colorado, Florida, Nevada and Virginia. Hispanic turnout is crucial to the outcome of several races that will determine whether Democrats are able to gain a majority in the Senate.

The haggling among Democrats, however, is dwarfed by Latino antagonism to the Republican nominee.

A Pew poll in late June had Trump winning only 24 percent of registered Hispanic voters. Some Republicans celebrated that low percentage because it is about the same level of support given to the GOP’s last two nominees, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney in 2012 and Sen. John McCain John Sidney McCainBush says he doesn't criticize other presidents to avoid risking friendship with Michelle Obama 'Real Housewives of the GOP' — Wannabe reality show narcissists commandeer the party George W.

But a Wall Street Journal/NBC poll conducted in early July gave Trump only 14 percent support among registered Hispanic voters.

The Journal poll also found “heightened interest in the election among Hispanics” with 72 percent saying they are following the race closely as compared to 55 percent at the same point in the presidential race four years ago.

The current low-level static — the Democratic establishment on one side, and Latino voters and elected officials on the other — could yet blow up into a major story before November.

Job number one for every Democrat will be to drive home the idea that Trump, for all the mistakes by the lake in Cleveland, is a legitimate political sensation, a giant ready to bestride his critics and claim the White House.

The point is to jolt Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' Cuba readies for life without Castro Chelsea Clinton: Pics of Trump getting vaccinated would help him 'claim credit' MORE’s voters, funders and young activists out of any illusion — any comfortable condescension — that it will be an easy win in a presidential race against an opponent they regard with disdain: Trump.

With pre-convention polling showing Clinton with a lead between 2.7 and 3.5 percent, according to the Real Clear Politics average, the race remains very close to a statistical dead heat.

That’s why the Clinton campaign is aiming its convention message at young voters. The takeaway is that even if Clinton doesn’t make your heart skip a beat — like President Obama or Sen. Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersNewsmax host: Jury decided to 'sacrifice' Chauvin to the mob Lawmakers react to guilty verdict in Chauvin murder trial: 'Our work is far from done' Senate confirms SEC chief Gensler to full five-year term MORE (I-Vt.) — it is time to get serious about defeating Trump.

Even a comically bad convention does not help drive up turnout among potential Democratic voters with a complacent attitude.

A June 15-26 Pew poll found that the youngest voters, under the age of 30, gave Clinton 47 percent support, Libertarian Gary Johnson Gary Earl JohnsonNew Mexico lawmakers send recreational marijuana bills to governor Judge throws out murder convictions, releases men jailed for 24 years On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday MORE 22 percent and Trump 21 percent. These strong numbers come with a big caveat: young voters have the lowest rates of turnout of any age group.

Trump’s base, by comparison, is older, whiter, attends church more regularly and includes many of the most reliable voters. He set a record for turning out Republicans to vote for him in the primaries and caucuses.

In this year’s primaries, 14.8 percent of Republicans voted, according to a June Pew report, compared to 14.4 percent of Democrats. That amounts to about 800,000 more Republicans voting than Democrats. Consistent voter turnout among Republicans in midterm elections has helped the party’s fortunes greatly in those “off-year” contests.

It’s no secret that Democratic voters are unreliable. Political hands in D.C. joke that Republicans pray for rain every Election Day because bad weather is more likely to make Democrats stay home.

Another factor is the television ratings bonanza that has the networks addicted to Trump.

In May, it was estimated that media fascination with Trump’s outrageous statements had resulted in the equivalent of $2.8 billion in free media. Trump’s campaign does not have to raise much money because it does not have to pay for advertising, given all the free television exposure the nominee enjoys.

In the last two election cycles, GOP voter suppression tactics, including stringent voter ID laws, have been put in place to keep Democratic turnout low. Four years ago, the top Republican in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives even bragged to a state GOP convention that restrictive new voter ID laws were going to help 2012 nominee Mitt Romney carry the Keystone State in the presidential election.

Since then, a federal court struck down the Pennsylvania voter ID law as unconstitutional. Tom Corbett, the GOP governor at the time, didn’t even bother to appeal. Last week, a federal appeals court invalidated a 2011 stringent Texas voter identification law.

But according to the Brennan Center for Law and Justice, 16 states will still have “new voting restrictions in place for the first time in this presidential election.”

Those states’ voter suppression efforts are aimed at young and minority voters. They are tougher to defeat after the Supreme Court’s 2013 vote to weaken the Voting Rights Act’s Section 5 pre-clearance provision. Congress has not been able to restore the provision.

In Ohio, for instance, the Republican secretary of State had cut early voting days and cracked down on voters’ ability to get absentee and provisional ballots, making Election Day turnout all the more important.

Both actions have been thrown out by the courts. But the fight goes on.

That’s why the Democratic convention will amount to a multi-million dollar “Get out the Vote” effort. That is why there will be a mosaic of black, brown, female and LGBT speakers to provide young voters a powerful contrast to the near snow-white, largely male, slate at the GOP convention.

Clinton’s selection of Sen. Tim Kaine Timothy (Tim) Michael KaineSenators in the dark on parliamentarian's decision Progressives put Democrats on defense Senators reintroduce bill to block NATO withdrawal MORE (Va.) was largely about driving up turnout too. A white man who is a fluent Spanish speaker, Kaine — who is also a former governor — has consistently performed well across racial and class lines in all of his elections.

The same motivation lay behind the decision to give plum primetime speaking slots to Sanders and Massachusetts Sen.

That sets them up as MVP surrogates to get Democrats to the polls.

Among Democrats, Obama enjoys close to an 87 percent approval rating, according to Real Clear Politics. Among African Americans, it is even higher.

In December, I wrote a piece for the Wall Street Journal saying that for this reason, Obama would effectively be Clinton’s running mate. The Clinton camp now embraces that idea.

No matter how Democrats look at the election, the whole game comes down to one issue: turnout.

The GOP is already a white, southern-based party. Trump’s vision for the future is to have the party expand its territory among the white working class in the industrial Midwest — beginning at the convention in Ohio.

“It is absolutely the case that in 2012, there were a little over 2 million fewer white non-Hispanics that voted compared to 2008…They sat it out,” Jason Johnson, an aide to Sen. Ted Cruz Rafael (Ted) Edward CruzOn The Money: Senate GOP faces post-Trump spending brawl | Senate confirms SEC chief Gensler to full five-year term | Left-leaning group raises concerns about SALT cap repeal Biden watching Derek Chauvin verdict from West Wing Cruz opposed to state lawmaker's bid to replace Wright in Congress MORE (R-Texas), told the AP earlier this year.

During the primaries, Trump’s strategy for rallying that base was to relentlessly attack free trade and illegal immigrants. He called for building a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico and banning foreign Muslims from entering the country.

That political messaging succeeded with a third of Republican voters nationwide who had no problem with Trump’s politically incorrect talk about Mexican immigrants as “rapists” and people who bring drugs and crime into the country.

But as Trump’s campaign looks beyond this convention, the nominee needs stronger medicine to get white working-class men to the voting booth in unprecedented numbers.

The new tonic set to be unveiled at the convention includes a heavy negative focus on Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' Cuba readies for life without Castro Chelsea Clinton: Pics of Trump getting vaccinated would help him 'claim credit' MORE.

The convention will feature speakers questioning the former secretary of State’s competence by condemning her for failing to prevent the death of four Americans in the 2012 attack at the consulate in Benghazi. Clinton will also be pilloried as in sympathy with Black Lives Matters protestors.

Meanwhile there will be full-throated support for Trump as the police-supporting, law-and-order candidate. And there will be guilt-by-association with presentations focused on the complicated sexual history of Clinton’s husband, former President Bill Clinton William (Bill) Jefferson ClintonThe Hill's 12:30 Report - Presented by Facebook - Tensions rise as U.S. waits for Derek Chauvin verdict Obama, Clinton reflect on Mondale's legacy Polls suggest House Democrats will buck midterm curse and add to their ranks MORE.

Trump’s idea is to make anti-Clinton attacks the main agenda for right-wing talk radio, internet and cable television. His campaign needs the help because Trump has been slow to start running TV ads. He has no significant campaign operation in swing states.

The target audience for these messages will not be the classic undecided suburban female voters. It will be blue-collar, white men who have not voted in recent elections.

Trump’s approach “opened the door to assertions of white identity and resentment in a way not seen so broadly in American culture in over half a century, according to those who track patterns of racial tension and antagonism in American life,” the New York Times reported last week.

The Times wrote that Trump’s campaign has “electrified the world of white nationalists,” and reported that one social media tracking company found “almost 30 percent of the accounts Mr. Trump retweeted…followed one or more of 50 popular self-identified white nationalist accounts.”

Speaker Paul Ryan Paul Davis RyanOn The Money: Senate confirms Gensler to lead SEC | Senate GOP to face off over earmarks next week | Top Republican on House tax panel to retire Trump faces test of power with early endorsements Lobbying world MORE (R-Wis.) has called out Trump for engaging in racism by bashing an Indiana-born federal judge of Mexican heritage as being incapable of properly handing a lawsuit against Trump because the judge is “Mexican.”

But can this racial strategy work? Let’s go to the numbers.

Last week, a New York Times/CBS poll had Trump tied with Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee. Each had 40 percent support. Those figures indicated that Clinton had dropped about three percentage points in the aftermath of scathing criticism from the FBI director, James Comey, over her use of a private e-mail server while secretary of State.

Now, going into the conventions, the question is whether Trump can build on his 40 percent via white identity politics.

In the last ten presidential elections, the GOP nominee has only gotten over 60 percent of the white vote twice – Ronald Reagan in 1984 and George H.W. Bush in 1988. Trump needs to surpass that high mark, while not dropping below Sen. John McCain John Sidney McCainBush says he doesn't criticize other presidents to avoid risking friendship with Michelle Obama 'Real Housewives of the GOP' — Wannabe reality show narcissists commandeer the party George W. Bush: 'It's a problem that Americans are so polarized' they can't imagine him being friends with Michelle Obama MORE and Mitt Romney’s dismal levels of support among blacks and Latinos in 2008 and 2012 respectively.

The difficulty of executing this racially charged strategy has been debated among Republicans for some time now.

“Republicans … must find a way to appeal to more nonwhite voters. If the GOP nominee in 2016 wins the same share of the white vote that Mr. Romney did—59%—then he or she will need 30% of nonwhites to be elected,” wrote GOP pollster Whit Ayres in the Wall Street Journal last year. “That is far greater than the 17% of the nonwhite vote that Mr. Romney won in 2012, or the 19% John McCain won in 2008, or the 26% George W. Bush won in 2004.”

Ayres added: “Looked at another way, if the Republican nominee only manages to hold Mr. Romney’s 17% among nonwhites, then he or she will need 65% of whites to win. Only one Republican has reached that mark in the past half century: Ronald Reagan in his 49-state landslide sweep in 1984. Even George W. Bush’s comfortable re-election in 2004 with 58% of whites and 26% of nonwhites would be a losing hand in 2016.”

By giving Trump an official seal of approval this week in Cleveland, the GOP is signing on to this high risk, race-based strategy for the November election.

Win or lose, Trump is defining the party as interested only in the votes of whites.

Overall, Trump’s convention is going to look like a boys’ locker room compared to a Democratic convention focused upon the first female presidential nominee of a major party.

The heart of Trump’s problem is that top Republican women, especially women of color, are distancing themselves from him and his convention.

New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez, whom Trump has disparaged as “not doing the job,” and South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley have gone out of their way to publicly signal their distaste for Trump. Condoleezza Rice’s name was mentioned as a possible vice presidential pick. Rice made clear she was not interested in any such offer; she will not even attend the convention.

Even a political newcomer, Rep. Mia Love of Utah, plans to skip the convention. Love is the first black female Republican ever elected to Congress.

At the 2012 Republican National Convention, presidential candidate Mitt Romney made a big show of giving primetime speaking slots to Rice, Martinez and Haley. He hoped to give his campaign a much-needed summer boost as he trailed President Obama badly among women of color. Romney went on to lose 96 percent of black women and 76 percent of Hispanic women.

Four years later, Trump is in such a deep hole he can’t even match Romney’s ability to have women stand up for him at the convention.

The absence of prominent women speaking for the GOP nominee is incongruous with political reality. Women are now the majority of all voters in presidential elections. In 2012, women cast 53 percent of the total votes.

In the last presidential race, Obama lost to Romney among white women. But with a record turnout by black, Hispanic and Asian women, Obama won the election.

Now the rising number of minority women voters spells big trouble for Trump in swing states such as Florida, Nevada, Arizona and Virginia.

A Quinnipiac poll taken late last month found Trump registering exactly one percent support among African-American voters with Clinton garnering 91 percent.

Among Latina women, a Fox News Latino poll in May found Clinton leading Trump by 68 percent to 17 percent.

The Latino electorate is revved up for a strong turnout to take down Trump, given his hard line on illegal immigrants and his especially harsh comments about Mexico and Mexican immigrants — including recently pointing to a plane flying over a rally and suggesting Mexico might bomb the U.S.

Black women, meanwhile, have already provided the firewall for Clinton that allowed her to defeat her primary rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersNewsmax host: Jury decided to 'sacrifice' Chauvin to the mob Lawmakers react to guilty verdict in Chauvin murder trial: 'Our work is far from done' Senate confirms SEC chief Gensler to full five-year term MORE (I-Vt.).

The Rutgers University Center for American Women and Politics reported last year that because “Black women have topped all other race and gender groups in turnout in the past two presidential cycles, Democratic candidates and campaigns will rely on their votes to secure their base. Likewise, Republican candidates and campaigns may seek to chip away at the Democratic stronghold among Black women voters.”

But with Trump as their candidate, the GOP effort to “chip away” at Democrats’ dominance of the black female vote becomes impossible.

And then there is Trump’s history with white women.

He has already been featured in two political ads, one run by anti-Trump Republicans and the second sponsored by the top super-PAC supporting Clinton, Priorities USA. In the super-PAC ad, women of all colors lip sync as Trump makes negative comments about women, claiming that one woman has a “fat ass,” asking whether “you like girls who are 5”1’, they come up to you know where” and offering his judgment that a woman “who is very flat chested is very hard to be a ten.”

Trump’s problem with women voters is an exaggerated reflection of the Republican Party’s problem with women.

Of the 20 women currently serving in the U.S. Senate, only six are Republicans. Of the 84 women serving in the House, just 22 are Republicans. In the Senate, one of those six, New Hampshire’s Kelly Ayotte Kelly Ann AyotteOvernight Defense: NATO expanding troops in Iraq Overnight Defense: New START extended for five years | Austin orders 'stand down' to tackle extremism | Panel recommends Biden delay Afghanistan withdrawal Study group recommends Biden delay Afghanistan withdrawal MORE, is one of the most vulnerable incumbents running for reelection this year.

As The Hill reported last week, House Republicans are increasingly worried that their most endangered incumbents are disproportionately women and minorities.

The report pointed to Love and Texas Congressman Will Hurd, the only black Republicans in the House, as two of the most vulnerable in the country. Also targeted are Arizona’s Martha McSally, Virginia’s Barbara Comstock and New York’s Elise Stefanik.

In addition, the House GOP is losing two female incumbents to retirement this cycle, while another — North Carolina’s Renee Ellmers — will also be gone, having lost her primary.

By contrast, House Democrats are led by a woman, Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.), and will almost certainly grow and replenish the number of women in their ranks.

After the 2012 election, Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus told reporters: ""The RNC cannot and will not write off any demographic or community or region of this country.”

But that is what is going on in 2016. Trump’s strategy is based on increasing the white vote, and especially the white male vote.

Twenty-eight years ago, Texas Gov. Ann Richards delivered the keynote speech to the Democratic National Convention.

She quipped that women “can perform [in national politics] — after all, Ginger Rogers did everything that Fred Astaire did, she just did it backwards and in high heels.”

Next week in Cleveland, any woman supporting Trump is going to have to dance backwards, blindfolded and balancing a ton of political baggage on her head.

Trump, about to be crowned as the Republican presidential nominee, wants to end ObamaCare but he has promised never to change Medicare. Sixty-four percent of Republicans, according to a 2015 Kaiser Family Foundation poll, agree with Trump on the importance of keeping Medicare as it is. So do 78 percent of Democrats.

But Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan Paul Davis RyanOn The Money: Senate confirms Gensler to lead SEC | Senate GOP to face off over earmarks next week | Top Republican on House tax panel to retire Trump faces test of power with early endorsements Lobbying world MORE’s (Wis.) plan calls for upending Medicare.

Instead of a guaranteed government healthcare plan for seniors, the Ryan plan will create an option in which a set dollar amount is offered to seniors so they can buy health insurance from private companies.

So, with four months to go until the presidential election, the politics of healthcare have flipped.

Now we have Congressional Democrats mocking the House GOP’s plan: “The big zit on the face of his proposal is … raising the age… for Medicare. I mean, that’s a nonstarter,” said House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). “So if you didn’t need to know anything else about his proposal, know that.”

Instead of the GOP majority in Congress targeting the purported weaknesses in President Obama’s six year old Affordable Care Act, we have Republicans standing in a circular firing squad.

As Drew Altman, president of the Kaiser Foundation, pointed out in a recent Wall Street Journal piece, the split among Republicans over Medicare will provide Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' Cuba readies for life without Castro Chelsea Clinton: Pics of Trump getting vaccinated would help him 'claim credit' MORE with powerful ammunition in the upcoming presidential debates. She will be able to force Trump into a trap where he has to reject or “embrace part or all, of the GOP plan.”

In that debate, Trump will also have to take a position on the Speaker’s proposal to limit the tax breaks for companies that offer employees health insurance. Most Americans get their health coverage from their employer. Clinton will hammer Trump on whether he wants to distance himself from the House GOP’s healthcare alternative on that point.

And Clinton is sure to ask him what he thinks of the House GOP’s plan to offer tax credits to buy insurance for catastrophic medical emergencies so as to — in the words of The Wall Street Journal — “sweep away the health law’s requirement for insurers to offer coverage to all regardless of their medical history, one of the most popular provisions of the law.”

Last month Karl Rove, the former top political advisor to President George W. Bush, argued in a Wall Street Journal column that Clinton and Senate Democrats would be on the defensive over ObamaCare. He pointed to polls that show 89 percent of Republicans reject ObamaCare. Among all voters, the Real Clear Politics average shows 48.8 percent disapproval versus 39.2 percent approval for the healthcare plan.

“But to exploit this opportunity,” Rove wrote, “Republicans must campaign on credible, substantive alternatives to ObamaCare.”

How quickly that political dynamic has shifted.

Now the “substantive” alternative offered by Ryan, labeled “A Better Way to Fix Health Care,” holds the potential to boost support for the president’s current healthcare program. The House plan is weak and offers almost nothing in the way of specifics, no new ideas and no mention of how much it would cost.

The Washington Post editorial board dumped all over the GOP House proposal for failing to lay out its costs. The Ryan plan is “difficult to evaluate or take seriously,” the paper wrote. “This many years on, the GOP has no excuses for blank spaces.” The Post added the GOP alternative looked to “be hard on the poor, old and sick.”

“It isn’t legislation,” Pelosi noted in her comments on the GOP plan. “Maybe when they ever decide to write legislation, they’ll get a score on how much it’s going to cost, how many people will lose coverage, and we can make a judgment about it.”

Meanwhile, as the GOP House plan flounders, so many dire predictions from Republicans of catastrophic consequences from the Obama plan have not materialized.

There are no death panels.

The ACA didn’t steal $700 Billion from Medicare.

Illegal immigrants are not draining the program.

Most important of all, the ACA delivered on its central promise to provide healthcare to millions of previously uninsured Americans.

According to a May 25 analysis published by the Urban Institute Health Policy Center, the uninsured rate for adults between the ages of 18 and 64 has fallen by 43.8 percent since September of 2013. That means 15.5 million Americans who didn’t have health insurance before the law went into effect are now covered.

On her website, Hillary Clinton proudly declares she wants to “defend the Affordable Care Act and build on it to slow the growth of out-of-pocket costs.”

In an interesting wrinkle, Clinton is now feeling pressure to move further to the left on health care. Sen. Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersNewsmax host: Jury decided to 'sacrifice' Chauvin to the mob Lawmakers react to guilty verdict in Chauvin murder trial: 'Our work is far from done' Senate confirms SEC chief Gensler to full five-year term MORE (I-Vt.) campaigned on a platform of single-payer universal coverage. The Service Employees International Union (SEIU), the massive labor union that endorsed Clinton, adopted a resolution formally calling for “a publicly-financed single-payer system that will recognize healthcare as a human right.”

When it comes to health care, it sure looks like the Republican-controlled Congress is stuck fighting the last war against ObamaCare while the public, Democrats, and even Trump are moving on.

Here’s Rubio on Twitter in May: “I have only said like 10,000 times I will be a private citizen in January.”

Here’s Rubio on Twitter last week: “I am running for reelection because control of the Senate may very well come down to the race in Florida.”

The same day, Rubio told reporters he changed his mind out of concern that some of Trump’s statements about women and minorities are “unacceptable.” He said that if Trump wins the White House “we will need senators willing to encourage him in the right direction, and if necessary, stand up to him.”

And it is not just Florida where the smoke is rising from the GOP after Trump set fire to some pillars of the party’s traditional policy on his way to claiming the nomination. Witness, for example, his deep skepticism about free trade agreements and his opposition to cutting entitlement benefits to lower the national debt.

Already, polls show Republican incumbent senators in Florida, Illinois, Wisconsin, Ohio, and New Hampshire are likely to lose their reelection bids to Democrats.

Trump’s reluctance — some say refusal — to raise money for other Republicans is at the heart of the party’s problem. As The Wall Street Journal reported last week, the Trump campaign has been slow to get involved with the Republican National Committee’s fundraising efforts and “another drag on the operation is the businessman’s own hesitation to pick up the phone and call donors.”

And then there is the donors’ reaction to Trump. Democrat Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' Cuba readies for life without Castro Chelsea Clinton: Pics of Trump getting vaccinated would help him 'claim credit' MORE’s campaign announced last week that 50 top business leaders, some of them longtime Republicans, are backing her and sending money her way. In figures released last week, Clinton had $42 million in the bank compared to $1.3 for Trump’s campaign.

In addition, major companies such as Apple, JPMorgan and Ford are declining to help sponsor the Republican convention, in order to put distance between themselves and Trump. And there is also the prospect of a rebellion of GOP convention delegates to prevent Trump from officially becoming the party’s presidential nominee.

This divide between the GOP nominee, the donors and the party’s congressional delegation comes with just over four months to go before Election Day.

Trump, meanwhile, remains critical of top Republicans in Congress for not standing behind him as he criticized an American judge for having Mexican heritage and proposed a ban on Muslim immigration. “Our leaders have to get a lot tougher and be quiet…Republicans, either stick together or let me just do it by myself,” Trump said at a recent rally.

GOP congressional leaders see no option but to distance themselves from Trump in their effort to save endangered senators

That job gets tougher every day as Trump slides in the polls, dragging down-ticket Republicans with him.

For instance, the Real Clear Politics average now shows GOP Sen. Ron Johnson Ronald (Ron) Harold Johnson15 Senate Republicans pledge to oppose lifting earmark ban 'Real Housewives of the GOP' — Wannabe reality show narcissists commandeer the party Republicans fret over divisive candidates MORE of Wisconsin losing by 7 points to liberal Democrat Russ Feingold, himself a former senator.

Even if Trump disappeared, however, there are still deep divisions within the party.

New York Times columnist Tom Friedman suggested in a recent column that the party’s problems were so intractable that it might as well disband and reconstitute itself as a “New Republican Party.”

“If a party could declare moral bankruptcy, today’s Republican Party would be in Chapter 11,” Tom Friedman wrote. “I know so many thoughtful conservatives who know it matters. One of them has got to start… a center-right party liberated from all the Trump birthers, the Sarah Palins, the Grover Norquists, the Sean Hannitys, the Rush Limbaughs, the gun lobby, the oil lobby and every other narrow-interest group, a party that redefines a principled conservatism.”

As Friedman suggests, the real problem here is that the GOP has sold off so many pieces of itself to niche constituencies, it is no longer a coherent party.

Last week’s failure by Senate Republicans to pass any limits on gun sales in the aftermath of the massacre in Orlando is a prime example.

According to a CNN/ORC poll last week, 90% of self-described Republicans favor preventing people on the terror “no fly” list from buying a gun. Yet the measure failed because of lack of support from GOP Senators.

Historians may soon write that Trump was less the cause of the GOP’s dysfunction than the man who finally pointed it out.

The strategy for picking a running mate this year is wildly different from anything seen before.

ADVERTISEMENT

The textbook on picking a VP calls for a heavy focus on adding swing-state support for the top of the ticket. The book also advises finding a running mate seen by voters as plausibly able to take over as president.

Well, throw out the textbook.

No one believes that any running mate is going to tip this year’s electoral map. And no strong, silent type fits the bill at a moment when voters want to shake up the system.

When Sen. Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth WarrenLawmakers react to guilty verdict in Chauvin murder trial: 'Our work is far from done' World passes 3 million coronavirus deaths Poll: 56 percent say wealth tax is part of solution to inequality MORE (D-Mass.) paid a visit to Clinton just days after she claimed the nomination, speculation kicked into overdrive.

Jeff Sessions Jefferson (Jeff) Beauregard SessionsGarland rescinds Trump-era memo curtailing consent decrees Biden picks vocal Trump critics to lead immigration agencies The Hill's Morning Report - Biden assails 'epidemic' of gun violence amid SC, Texas shootings MORE (R-Ala.) were overheard in a TV green room telling each other that the other one is the best choice to run with Trump.

The dynamics that frame the selection of a VP this year were evident in a Washington Post/ABC poll released last week. It found that nearly 70 percent of Americans have an unfavorable of view of Trump, a 10-point increase since he entered the race last summer. According to the same poll, Clinton also reached a new personal high in her unfavorable rating at 55 percent.

Clinton’s trouble is dwarfed by Trump’s trouble. He is viewed negatively by 94 percent of blacks, 89 percent of Latinos and 77 percent of women.

Picking a dazzling candidate as his running mate is one move that has the potential to change the way the world sees him.

The last attempt to dazzle and distract with a vice-presidential pick was in 2008. GOP nominee Sen. John McCain John Sidney McCainBush says he doesn't criticize other presidents to avoid risking friendship with Michelle Obama 'Real Housewives of the GOP' — Wannabe reality show narcissists commandeer the party George W. Bush: 'It's a problem that Americans are so polarized' they can't imagine him being friends with Michelle Obama MORE (Ariz.) got off to a good start with his surprise pick of little-known Alaska Governor Sarah Palin. She is beautiful, high energy and, that year, she had the potential to attract women disappointed that the Democrats had selected a black man over a woman as their nominee.

But the sparkle wore off quickly when Palin began to look uninformed and inept. Questions were raised about McCain’s judgment. Palin’s family life also became a staple of the gossip columns.

Palin’s selection looked especially bad in contrast with Democrat Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaMinneapolis mayor on Floyd: 'Ultimately his life will have bettered our city' Lawmakers react to guilty verdict in Chauvin murder trial: 'Our work is far from done' Obamas praise Floyd jury, urge more action: 'We cannot rest' MORE’s pick of Sen. Joe Biden Joe BidenBiden overruled Blinken, top officials on initial refugee cap decision: report Suicide bombing hits Afghan security forces Jim Jordan, Val Demings get in shouting match about police during hearing MORE (Del.). Biden was experienced and known to be a good guy, while his selection took the edge off the risk of putting a first-term senator in the Oval Office.

This time, Trump and Clinton need running mates combining the qualities of Palin and Biden.

The Trump campaign went nuts last month when Ben Carson said that Trump’s shortlist included Palin. Sens. Marco Rubio Marco Antonio RubioOn The Money: Senate GOP faces post-Trump spending brawl | Senate confirms SEC chief Gensler to full five-year term | Left-leaning group raises concerns about SALT cap repeal Senate GOP faces post-Trump spending brawl 15 Senate Republicans pledge to oppose lifting earmark ban MORE (Fla) and Ted Cruz Rafael (Ted) Edward CruzOn The Money: Senate GOP faces post-Trump spending brawl | Senate confirms SEC chief Gensler to full five-year term | Left-leaning group raises concerns about SALT cap repeal Biden watching Derek Chauvin verdict from West Wing Cruz opposed to state lawmaker's bid to replace Wright in Congress MORE (Texas), and two governors, Chris Christie of New Jersey and John Kasich of Ohio, were purportedly also on the list.

Palin’s downside is obvious; a desperate-looking Christie won’t do either. And Trump can’t afford to extend an offer to Rubio, Cruz or Kasich because he can’t risk being turned down.

That problem is getting worse by the minute as Trump lags farther and farther behind Clinton in the polls. Any dazzling vice-presidential pick has to think about his or her own political future. What will happen to them if Trump suffers a Barry Goldwater-style blowout loss in November?

Gingrich remains a serious contender to be Trump’s number two. He is a well-known personality and an ace with a TV soundbite who is also accustomed to dealing with controversy over his personal life.

But Gingrich sharply criticized Trump for his attacks on New Mexico Governor Susana Martinez and Federal Judge Gonzalo Curiel.

Trump then did an impromptu poll on possible running mates. He asked the audience at a rally in Tampa to pick from Gingrich, Sessions or former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. Rice got the biggest applause from the crowd.

Rice is a dazzler but the odds that she is willing to sign on are low to non-existent.

Meanwhile, on the Democratic side, Clinton needs a star to bring young, energetic supporters of her primary rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersNewsmax host: Jury decided to 'sacrifice' Chauvin to the mob Lawmakers react to guilty verdict in Chauvin murder trial: 'Our work is far from done' Senate confirms SEC chief Gensler to full five-year term MORE, back into the fold.

That means Clinton can’t bring on a centrist pick. Moderate Democrats with close ties to corporate America like Sens. Joe Manchin Joe ManchinBiden dispatches Cabinet members to sell infrastructure plan On The Money: Treasury creates hub to fight climate change | Manchin throws support behind union-backed PRO Act | Consumer bureau rolls out rule to bolster CDC eviction ban Miners union to back Biden on green energy if it retains jobs MORE of West Virginia or Mark Warner Mark Robert WarnerLawmakers react to guilty verdict in Chauvin murder trial: 'Our work is far from done' Manchin throws support behind union-backed PRO Act New US sanctions further chill Biden-Putin relations MORE of Virginia, or former Sen.

Warren, however, has powerful detractors. Critics say she lacks foreign policy experience and note that she has never run a city, state, cabinet agency or business.

“I think she will not pick somebody that she feels in her heart isn’t ready to be President or Commander-in-Chief,” former Pennsylvania Governor and DNC Chairman Ed Rendell recently told a Philadelphia radio station. “I think Elizabeth Warren is a wonderful, bright, passionate person, but with no experience in foreign affairs and not in any way, shape or form ready to be commander-in-chief.”

Clinton could find dazzle by naming the first Latino vice-presidential candidate. But no one doubts she will win Latino voters energized by Trump's insults regardless. If she still wants that option, then Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro is the leading candidate. Labor Secretary Tom Perez and California Congressman Xavier Becerra Xavier BecerraOvernight Health Care: All adults in US now eligible for COVID-19 vaccine | White House launches media blitz to promote vaccines Top House Republicans ask Harris for meeting on border White House launches media effort to promote coronavirus vaccines MORE have come on strong in the last few weeks.

When all the talk ends, Trump has few options. His best bet to dazzle is Gingrich. Clinton has a wider range, led by Kaine, Castro and Warren.

21982,Williams,Juan,thehill,"When he explained his support for Donald Trump’s presidential bid earlier this month, Speaker Paul Ryan Paul Davis RyanOn The Money: Senate confirms Gensler to lead SEC | Senate GOP to face off over earmarks next week | Top Republican on House tax panel to retire Trump faces test of power with early endorsements Lobbying world MORE (R-Wis.) was clear about the political strategy behind his move.

He wanted a Republican president to support the House Republican agenda.

ADVERTISEMENT

As he wrote in his hometown paper “on the issues that make up [the House GOP] agenda,” he and Trump “have more common ground than disagreement.”

That sounds fair to me. So what is in this House GOP agenda?

When Ryan became Speaker, he said one of his first goals was to pass a Republican alternative to ObamaCare. It has been six years since the law was enacted. But even with Ryan as Speaker, the House GOP has yet to come up with a better idea.

Next, the new Speaker said he wanted to give voice to members by returning power to committee chairmen. He pledged to get the GOP to lay out its priorities by passing a budget.

But after seven months, Ryan is on track to be the first Speaker in modern times to fail to pass an official budget for his party through the lower chamber.

Even if Trump were president today, the House would not have a budget proposal to send him.

And Ryan still hasn’t gotten the House to pass important measures like a long-term reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).

There is a failed GOP House agenda here that extends far and wide.

Part of the Ryan agenda was to have all twelve appropriations bills passed through “regular order,” with each committee gaining more say over budget priorities by controlling the debate over amendments and getting them passed on time.

Again, it has not happened.

The problem here is not Democrats in Congress or the Democrat in the White House.

The problem is the deep dysfunction in the Republican ranks.

Since becoming Speaker, Ryan has tried to control the same Tea Party activist forces that drove his predecessor, then Speaker John Boehner John Andrew BoehnerCantor: 'Level of craziness' in Washington has increased 'on both sides' Cheney on Trump going to GOP retreat in Florida: 'I haven't invited him' Republicans race for distance from 'America First Caucus' MORE (R-Ohio), into an early retirement; defeated Boehner John Andrew BoehnerCantor: 'Level of craziness' in Washington has increased 'on both sides' Cheney on Trump going to GOP retreat in Florida: 'I haven't invited him' Republicans race for distance from 'America First Caucus' MORE’s preferred successor then-Rep. Eric Cantor Eric Ivan CantorCantor: 'Level of craziness' in Washington has increased 'on both sides' White House says bills are bipartisan even if GOP doesn't vote for them Trump the X-factor in Virginia governor race MORE in his own Virginia Congressional primary; derailed Rep. Kevin McCarthy’s (R-Calif.) bid to become Speaker; and fueled Trump’s victory in the GOP primary.

The Speaker was embarrassed last month when hardline members of his own caucus sneaked poison pill amendments discriminating against LGBT contractors into legislation. A major House energy bill was defeated when Democrats joined with moderate Republicans to strip the language from the bill.

Despite these failures, Ryan is still trying to add on to the House Republican agenda. Last week, the Speaker and GOP House members rolled out the latest version of their unfulfilled plan. This one is called “Better Way” and they started with a plan for fighting poverty.

But Ryan’s rollout was overshadowed by Trump’s personal attack on a federal judge presiding over the Trump University case. Trump says the judge has an unfair bias against him because the judge is of Mexican heritage and Trump wants to build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico.

Ryan condemned Trump’s attacks on the judge, who was born in Indiana, as the “textbook definition of a racist comment.”

But with a laser focus on the future of the House GOP agenda, Ryan said he remained a Trump supporter.

This led to a tsunami of criticism. The New York Daily News front page had a picture of Ryan purportedly pointing at Trump saying “I’m With Racist!”

Bill Kristol, the editor of The Weekly Standard, tweeted: “Official position of the leadership of the Republican Party: Trump is an inexcusable bigot, and Trump must be our next president.”

Is Kristol failing to appreciate Ryan’s strategic desire to gain a powerful partner in the next president?

Conservative columnist George Will spoke directly to that issue.

He wrote that Ryan faced a simple moral choice that amounted to assuming that passing “whatever semblance of the House agenda that reaches President Trump Donald TrumpSt. Louis lawyer who pointed gun at Black Lives Matter protesters considering Senate run Chauvin found guilty as nation exhales US says Iran negotiations are 'positive' MORE’s desk is more important than keeping this impetuous, vicious, ignorant and anti-constitutional man from being at that desk.”

Wall Street Journal columnist Bret Stephens also piled on:

He condemned Trump’s attack on Federal Judge Gonzalo Curiel as “the most shameful word uttered by a major presidential candidate since Dixiecrat Strom Thurmond thundered in 1948 against the ‘Nigra race.’ ”

Stephens concluded that Ryan and other “Republican leaders who think they can co-opt or tame Mr. Trump will instead find themselves stained by him.”

So, to recap, Ryan capitulated and endorsed Trump because he thought it would help salvage the House GOP agenda. Instead, he has added fuel to the fires burning down the Republican Party.

After the 2012 election, the Republican National Committee warned against embracing the kind of race-baiting anti-immigrant policies Trump is now espousing. In its famous “autopsy,” the RNC pointed to a need to reach out to Latino and young voters.

With Ryan’s capitulation, the GOP establishment has now officially gone 180 degrees in the opposite direction. It has embraced the extremism, racism and incoherence that pervades talk radio and conservative blogs.

And Speaker Ryan, the party’s top elected official — the man with the stature to defy Trump and halt the GOP’s decline into political ineffectiveness — has decided to focus on an agenda that already looks like a lost cause.

21983,Williams,Juan,thehill,"Leave it to Fox News’s Chris Wallace to hit the pause button on a major line of political spin coming out of the Trump campaign these days.

When Trump’s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, repeated to Wallace Trump’s claim that the candidate is “doing very well with women” and also “winning with Hispanics,” the “Fox News Sunday” host called for a reality check.

“Corey, wait, he’s not winning with women, he’s not winning with Hispanics, his numbers are hugely underwater with both,” Wallace shot back.

ADVERTISEMENT

The numbers are on Wallace’s side.

Here we go:

A Quinnipiac University poll out last week found that 54 percent of female voters support Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPelosi on power in DC: 'You have to seize it' Cuba readies for life without Castro Chelsea Clinton: Pics of Trump getting vaccinated would help him 'claim credit' MORE while only 30 percent back Trump.

These findings track with those of a Fox News poll from mid-May which found Clinton with 46 percent support among women and Trump lagging with 33 percent support. A CBS/New York Times poll released the same week found Clinton beating Trump, 53 percent to 36 percent.

A Fox News Latino poll from last month found that Latinos overwhelmingly support Clinton over Trump, 62 percent to 23 percent. Far from “winning with Hispanics,” that’s a 39-point deficit for Trump.

“Much was made during the 2012 election about Mitt Romney's dismal performance among Latino voters,” Fox News Latino noted in its release of the survey. Later the pollsters added that Trump's 23 percent support ""paired with the 74 percent unfavorable rating has the real estate mogul facing a monumental task if he wants to win over Latinos.""

An April ABC News/Washington Post poll showed just how deep a hole Trump is in with these two key demographics. The real estate mogul has a 75 and 81 percent disapproval rating among women and Hispanics, respectively, according to that survey.

These are consistent findings from a variety of pollsters. Yet Trump and his surrogates repeatedly insist there is a great bandwagon of support for him picking up speed across the nation.

It’s all an illusion being created to make Trump seem more popular than he actually is.

Some TV networks buy into the fantasy to the point of inviting people to debate how many Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersNewsmax host: Jury decided to 'sacrifice' Chauvin to the mob Lawmakers react to guilty verdict in Chauvin murder trial: 'Our work is far from done' Senate confirms SEC chief Gensler to full five-year term MORE supporters are likely to vote for Trump in November.

That is amazing when Wall Street Journal/NBC News polls over January, February, March and April of this year found just 6 percent of people backing Sanders “felt positively about Mr. Trump, while 90 percent felt negatively.”

And that’s not even the biggest political illusion being used by Trump. The real whopper is his claim to have the support of most GOP voters, while he has only won a plurality.

According to the Census bureau, there were approximately 153 million registered voters in the United States as of the 2012 elections.

Just over 11.5 million have voted for Donald Trump Donald TrumpSt. Louis lawyer who pointed gun at Black Lives Matter protesters considering Senate run Chauvin found guilty as nation exhales US says Iran negotiations are 'positive' MORE so far in the GOP presidential primary. If we are going strictly by popular vote, a majority of the voters who cast ballots in the Republican primaries so far have voted for someone other than Trump.

This means Trump has won the support of roughly 8 percent of registered voters. Those voters are overwhelmingly older and whiter that the general electorate.

As the Pew Research Center noted in a February report, “The U.S. electorate this year will be the country’s most racially and ethnically diverse ever.”

“Nearly one-in-three eligible voters on Election Day (31%) will be Hispanic, black, Asian or another racial or ethnic minority, up from 29% in 2012. Much of this change is due to strong growth among eligible Hispanic voters, in particular U.S.-born youth.” Pew concluded.

Given his problem with Hispanics, how does Trump’s recent attack on New Mexico’s Republican Gov. Susana Martinez, who is Latina, make sense? How is it supposed to help him win over Latinos, especially women?

At a rally in Albuquerque, Trump defamed Martinez as a lazy leader for the state, saying “we have got to get your governor to get going.”

What was Trump’s evidence for this outrageous broadside? According to him, the number of New Mexicans on food stamps had increased since 2000. Trump neglected to mention that Martinez only became governor in 2011.

Even Trump backer and potential vice presidential candidate Newt Gingrich called this a political error.

“You particularly don’t want to see a candidate who needs to both get stronger with Latinos, and stronger with women, attack a Latina woman Republican governor,” Gingrich said.

Trump’s women problem isn’t confined to women of color. White women are also expressing their distaste for his politics.

“The potential for the 2016 election to widen America's racial voting chasm even further is nothing new,” Washington Post polling manager Scott Clement recently wrote. “But Washington Post-ABC News polls have also identified a related dynamic: White Americans are splintering along education and gender lines at rates not seen in at least three decades.

“The gender split is similarly historic, with Trump’s support 22 points higher among white male registered voters than white female registered voters (69 vs. 47 percent), double the largest gap between these groups in previous presidential elections (11 points in 2000),” Clement reported.

The polling numbers on the limits of Trump’s appeal are consistent. But many of the Republicans feeling the need to get in line behind Trump have bought into the myth that he has widespread support — including from women and Hispanics.

If Trump’s claims about his own political appeal were summed up in a song title, it would be a choice between Carly Simon’s “Just Not True” and “You’re So Vain.”

Everywhere I go people want to talk presidential politics. And that is how I’ve heard time and again why Donald Trump Donald TrumpSt. Louis lawyer who pointed gun at Black Lives Matter protesters considering Senate run Chauvin found guilty as nation exhales US says Iran negotiations are 'positive' MORE’s biggest fans love him:

He is the Great Disruptor!

ADVERTISEMENT

He disrupts Washington politics, a Congress they loathe and the Republican leaders by whom they feel betrayed. He is not afraid to call out President Obama and the self-important talking heads on cable news.

Interwoven at the core of their discontent: political correctness; the role of big money in controlling politicians; gridlock-inducing dogma; and corrupt, special interest groups looking out only for themselves.

It’s hard to argue with them on these points. I agree with Trump supporters on the need for disruption of all of those things. But I’m left with a question: Why do they believe Trump will be a reliable agent of disruption?

Yes, he points out the hypocrites and liars. And, yes, he has crushed the GOP leaders who have contributed to the right-left divide that has paralyzed Washington and earned Congress a dismal 13 percent approval rating.

But what is Trump’s plan once he kicks out the bums?

He has no clear political principles to anchor him or to give his fans any reason to believe he can repair the damage.

Instead, he hurtles wildly from one position to another. Just last week, he said his infamous pledge to temporarily ban all non-citizen Muslims from entering the country was “only a suggestion.”

This equivocation must have come as a surprise to his diehard supporters. It will be one of many disappointments if he is elected.

Similarly, Trump brags about not being in debt to big political donors who control politicians. Voters say they like the fact that Trump does not need millions of dollars of dark PAC money.

But two weeks ago, he began raising money with the Republican National Committee from those selfsame big donors. And he expects to use those funds for his general election campaign as well as to pay off the money he loaned himself during the GOP primary.

And don’t forget Trump promises to appoint more Supreme Court Justices like the late Antonin Scalia. Scalia was a great conservative jurist but he took the lead in opening the floodgates for unlimited corporate political donations with the 2010 Citizens United ruling.

The same puzzling inconsistency applies to Trump’s put-downs. It is wonderfully entertaining to watch him defy the rules of civil discourse by insulting and belittling Republicans as well as Democrats and disrupt everything considered politically correct.

But he also bullies women, just last week going after New Mexico Gov. Susanna Martinez, a Hispanic Republican. And he has a history of insulting prisoners of war, immigrants and the disabled.

Where are the insults for a man threatening world peace — Russian President Vladimir Putin? Where are his put-downs for hedge fund managers who profit from sending jobs overseas? Where is his rage at self-serving bankers?

So, yes, he is defying the rules of political correctness but he is doing so by often making xenophobic and racist comments.

In the days before he died this month, former Utah Republican Sen. Bob Bennett felt the need to apologize to every Muslim he met for the hateful words of his party’s standard-bearer. Trump’s strident anti-PC rhetoric risks inspiring a backlash and a rush of people into the PC camp because the messenger is so noxious.

According to Trump, the trash-talk will stop if he actually becomes president.

'You're going to be so bored, you're going to say this is the most boring human being I've ever interviewed,' Trump told Chris Wallace on “Fox News Sunday” last month. “'I think if I act very presidential I'll be dull, but that will be fine.”

“Trump is not a serious man, which is part of his appeal in a country that has grown increasingly unserious,” wrote Peggy Noonan in the Wall Street Journal last summer. “He’s a showman in a country that likes to watch shows — a country that believes all politics is showbiz now, and all politicians are entertainers of varying degrees of competence. At least Mr. Trump is honest about it. He capitalizes on the fact that no one in America trusts politicians anymore.”

Once the show of a disruption is over, the regularly scheduled programming will resume.

“It’s as improbable as it is entertaining,” my friend and Fox News colleague Bret Baier observed last month in a special called “Donald Trump: The Disruptor.”

“He’s changed the face of American politics and somehow connected with the public in a way that few politicians ever had,” Baier said. “A businessman who was all but able to take over a party with its establishment in open war against him. While he is popular with his base, polls show him consistently to be the candidate with the highest negatives.”

Oh, yes, the negatives.

One fundamental thing separates Trump’s fans and critics: Whether they have taken the time to apply even the slightest scrutiny to what he says and does.

Even after last week’s surprising polls, Clinton still led in the RealClearPolitics nationwide average by 3 points as of last Friday. But that makes the race a toss-up — her big lead is gone.

The strength of Trump’s rise in national polls is also evident in swing states. A Quinnipiac poll, released two weeks ago, showed him leading Clinton by four percentage points in the swing state of Ohio. Meanwhile, Clinton’s lead in two other critical states is razor-thin. In both Florida and Pennsylvania, the poll gives her a one-point lead — 43 to 42.

These national and swing state polls are pure joy to Trump’s supporters. But there is reason to be cautious. The polls are hiding some hard truths about what it will take for Trump to win the White House. The electoral college battlefield is forbidding for him.

A Trump-Clinton matchup will dramatically expand the electoral playing field beyond Ohio, Florida and Pennsylvania — in Clinton’s favor. The most recent polls show a statistical dead-heat between Trump and Clinton in red states, like Arizona and even Georgia, which have reliably voted for the GOP nominee in recent presidential elections.

In 2012, GOP nominee Mitt Romney won 206 electoral votes to President Obama’s 332 electoral votes. This was an improvement over 2008 when the Republican candidate, John McCain John Sidney McCainBush says he doesn't criticize other presidents to avoid risking friendship with Michelle Obama 'Real Housewives of the GOP' — Wannabe reality show narcissists commandeer the party George W. Bush: 'It's a problem that Americans are so polarized' they can't imagine him being friends with Michelle Obama MORE, won only 173 electoral votes and Obama won a whopping 365.

To win the 270 votes needed to claim victory in the electoral college, Trump will have to keep every single state won by Romney — including Arizona and Georgia — and find 64 more electoral votes somewhere.

The question is where? If Trump holds all the Romney states and carries Virginia, Pennsylvania and Florida, he still loses.

“Every preliminary electoral-map forecast this spring paints a bleak picture for Donald Trump in his effort to win the presidency against Hillary Clinton,” Dan Balz recently wrote in the Washington Post.

Balz pointed to separate forecasts from three veteran political handicappers who make the same prediction: Trump is going to get crushed by Clinton in an electoral college landslide.

Larry Sabato, Charlie Cook and Stu Rothenberg all predict a big Clinton victory. For example, Sabato projects Clinton to win 347 electoral votes to Trump’s 191.

“Trump has proved to be largely impervious to attack in the primaries, but he’s now facing a much different electorate,” Balz concluded in depicting voters beyond the GOP base as younger, more racially diverse, more educated and more balanced in terms of gender. “If he isn’t ready for what is coming at him, the opening phase of the general election could prove decisive.”

In Arizona, where 30 percent of the voters will be Hispanic, McCain is telling supporters that his own reelection “may be the race of [his] life.” Over 2 million Hispanics live in the Grand Canyon State.

McCain privately told supporters recently: “If you listen or watch Hispanic media in the state and in the country, you will see that it is all anti-Trump. The Hispanic community is roused and angry in a way that I've never seen in 30 years.”

Trump galvanized support during the overwhelmingly white GOP primary by smearing Mexican immigrants as “rapists,” calling for construction of a border wall and promising to stop remittances to Mexico.

Last month, a poll of registered Latino voters from America’s Voice and Latino Decisions nationwide found that 87 percent had an unfavorable opinion of Trump – 79 percent of those were “very unfavorable.” Non-white voters, especially Hispanics, could make the difference statewide.

McCain is perhaps the most surprising example of an incumbent Republican senator whose own reelection is jeopardized by having Trump at the top of the ticket. But he is not the only one.

It is almost impossible to imagine any electoral college scenario where Trump is elected without carrying at least one of those states. It is also hard to imagine moderate and independent voters splitting their ticket — voting against Trump for president but reelecting senators who back him.

Now, here’s an ironic twist. After the bitter 2000 presidential election and the famous Florida recount which made George W. Bush president, newly elected Sen. Hillary Clinton (D-N.Y.) called for doing away with the electoral college entirely.

“We are a very different country than we were 200 years ago,” she said back then. “I believe strongly that in a democracy, we should respect the will of the people and to me that means it’s time to do away with the electoral college and move to the popular election of our president.”

One can only assume that today’s Clinton is glad that Congress did not follow her advice then.

21986,Williams,Juan,theactivetimes,"Dirty beaches have become nationwide scourges. From storms to sewage overflows and overall water pollution, some beaches have a hard time maintaining their cleanliness and reputation.

Americans are fortunate to have a country full of swimmable beaches. The best ones call for water sports, sun bathing, and bonding with family and friends. The last thing anyone wants to worry about is exposure to contaminated water.[slideshow:83038]

The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) pressures the federal government to protect all U.S. waters under the Clean Water Act. The organization also fights for policies and practices that ensure a safe and sufficient water supply through efficiency, pollution controls, better management, and infrastructure improvements (NRDC).

However, safe and sufficient water is not accessible everywhere. Water pollution has become a health hazard in the U.S. and waterborne bacterial illnesses have become a constant danger.

There are many factors that contribute to water pollution. Animals, humans, illegal dumping off the coast, people leaving their garbage on the beach, and cigarettes littering the sand are just a few.

CBS News explains, “as many as 3.5 million Americans are sickened from contact with raw sewage overflows each year, according to the EPA.” That being said, the risk is higher for young children because they tend to spend more time in the ocean dunking their heads underwater.

The dirtiest beaches in the country have water samples that have exceeded the national standards. Some of them are actually repeat offenders.

No one wants to leave the beach feeling sick, so think twice before visiting these dirty beaches.

And what can Clinton and the Democratic Party give Sanders to get him to campaign aggressively for her in the fall, harnessing the voting power of the passionate, mostly young, white left-wing voters who favor him?

ADVERTISEMENT

Obviously, Sanders expects a prime-time speaking slot at the Democratic National Convention. Neither the Clinton camp nor the party’s leadership will have a problem with that demand.

But what if he wants to be the vice presidential candidate on a Clinton-led ticket?

That is a reach.

Sanders’ “socialist” label is a liability in a general election. The Vermonter will hurt Clinton’s effort to win support from political moderates, especially older voters. Sanders would also be a bridge too far for Republicans disenchanted by their party’s wild primary season and the prospect of either Donald Trump Donald TrumpSt. Louis lawyer who pointed gun at Black Lives Matter protesters considering Senate run Chauvin found guilty as nation exhales US says Iran negotiations are 'positive' MORE or Sen. Ted Cruz Rafael (Ted) Edward CruzOn The Money: Senate GOP faces post-Trump spending brawl | Senate confirms SEC chief Gensler to full five-year term | Left-leaning group raises concerns about SALT cap repeal Biden watching Derek Chauvin verdict from West Wing Cruz opposed to state lawmaker's bid to replace Wright in Congress MORE (R-Texas) as the GOP’s presidential candidate.

Adding Sanders to the ticket would also create an opening for Republican ad-makers. They would gleefully target his past congressional votes opposing tax cuts, the Patriot Act and new military defenses against a possible Iranian missile attack.

But if Sanders is not to be made the prospective veep, Democrats will have to find something else to give him. After all, he has exceeded all expectations during the primary season. The depth of his support was underlined by his three strong victories on Saturday in Alaska, Hawaii and Washington. And Democrats live in fear of a him mounting a third-party run along the lines of the populist campaign run by Ralph Nader in 2000 that arguably gave the White House to George W. Bush.

The heart of this troublesome political puzzle for Democrats is how to get Sanders’s passionate supporters to line up behind Clinton. In early March, a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found a third of the people voting for Sanders saying they “cannot see themselves voting for Hillary Clinton in November.”

The Nation magazine, a leading voice of the left, reported recently that “nearly 60,000 people have signed the ‘Bernie or Bust’ pledge,” vowing to remain loyal to him even if Clinton wins the nomination.

The Clinton campaign’s chief strategist, Joel Benenson, speaking in a recent Washington Post interview, charged Sanders with becoming “increasingly negative.” Sanders frequently points out to his crowds that several polls show him doing better than Clinton against Republican candidates in the general election.

President Obama is now getting involved in this escalating debate. According to The New York Times, the president privately told Texas Democrats that Sanders’s continuing campaign against Clinton stalls party organizers, donors and activists from getting started on beating the GOP in the fall campaign.

The president and leading Democrats in Congress are all but calling for Sanders to get out of the race now. The Democrats’ unstated anxiety is that Clinton, while a clear winner among primary voters, does not set the campaign trail on fire. Sanders and Trump, the leading candidate for the GOP nomination, are arsonists by comparison. The Vermonter continues to ignite the party’s base with his calls for a “political revolution.”

Even after he lost in Arizona last week — while winning smaller contests in Utah and Idaho — and saw Clinton increase her lead in the contest for delegates, Sanders continued to condemn a “corrupt campaign finance system which is undermining American democracy.” Clinton’s campaign is taking money from political action committees while Sanders is not.

Sanders is also casting an unfavorable light on Clinton by celebrating “the kind of energy and excitement” of his crowds and claiming that it is because “we are telling the truth.” He did not mention Clinton but the comparison is obvious, if implicit.

Sanders’s number one issue is income inequality. He continues to accuse Clinton of being too close to Wall Street, further arguing that this makes it implausible that she will rein in wealthy bankers and hedge fund managers.

It is easy to see how his followers might be convinced she is the no-change, establishment candidate and become permanently turned off to Clinton.

Sanders’s lack of formal connection to the Democratic Party is another part of the political problem. At an Ohio town hall meeting earlier this month, he admitted to having considered running for president as an independent but decided to run as a Democrat because “in terms of media coverage — you have to run within the Democratic Party.”

Last year, former New York Congressman Anthony Weiner (D), whose wife Huma Abedin is a top Clinton aide, publicly expressed the reservations Democratic insiders still have about Sanders, even as they ask him to get in line behind Clinton.

“What exactly does he think he’s doing in a Democratic presidential primary?” Weiner wrote in Business Insider last July. “Why is he asking for the nomination of a party he always avoided joining…Now he wants to not only be a member of the party but its standard bearer?”

The answer for Weiner is the answer for the Democrats. To bring Sanders inside the camp they will have to do more than make him a TV star at the convention. They will also have to put Clinton, union organizers and money behind his issues, creating a permanent movement based inside the party for a living wage, for lower-cost college education and a sharper critique of Wall Street.

The party is going to have to buy into Sanders if they want him to buy into them.

21990,Williams,Juan,theatlantic,"Clarence learned other lessons from his grandfather after a visit up North to see some relatives, who were now shelved in housing projects and living on welfare. ""He'd say, 'Damn welfare, that relief!—Man ain't got no business on relief as long as he can work.'""

Southern society, both black and white, had another view of Clarence and his grandfather. Black Savannah society, Clarence Thomas recalls bitterly, knew him as ABC—America's Blackest Child (""and you have to remember that for someone to call you black in the sixties, that meant serious business""). He was ridiculed not only for his extremely dark complexion but also for his hair -- they called it ""nigger naps""—and thick lips. Thomas's grandfather endured worse. ""I remember this lady came up to the house—Miss Morgan,"" Thomas told me one day. ""Her husband was noted for being fairly mean. She drove up in one of those great big Buick Electras. Granddaddy was out in the field. You see a car driving up and you always wonder who it is, because we had a dirt road leading up to the house—you see all the dust and everything. She said, 'Myers, boy.' And you could see him seethe. He looked around and saw his little kids there. You could see him seethe. People say what kind of manhood does it take to yell back and get mad. But what must it have taken for him not only to take the insult but the stares from his kids seeing him being called a boy. The most significant things [in civil rights] were things that I saw day-to-day, not the protests downtown or in Washington.""

Integration touched Thomas's life for the first time in tenth grade. His grandfather decided that he wanted Clarence, a good student, to attend an all-white Catholic boarding school, St. John Vianney Minor Seminary. Thomas was admitted without incident. He got excellent grades and was a star quarterback on the school's football team. His grandfather bragged that his grandson would become a priest. To Anderson, Clarence became a racial symbol. On vacations his grandfather would take him to the local NAACP meetings and have him read his grades aloud: ""He thought I was living proof that black people were as good as white people.""

In his own mind, however, Thomas was in a state of crisis. He had never been around many whites. Now he was living with them. He saw how many more possessions they had, how the other boys commanded respect as seminarians in a town where he was at best ignored. (Thomas remembers a quote from Richard Wright's Blank Metropolis: ""But the American negro, child of the culture that crushes him, wants to be free in a way that white men are free. For him to wish otherwise would be unnatural, unthinkable."") Most devastating of all were the racist jokes and slights that Thomas's fellow seminarians made at his expense. Myers Anderson had held the church up as a moral and ethical model. But, Thomas told me, ""After lights out someone would yell, 'Smile, Clarence, so we can see you.' The statement wasn't the bad part, it was no one saying 'Shut up.' "" On Thursday afternoons, when students went to town with their friends, Thomas was left alone. Movie theaters were still segregated; to eat at a restaurant with classmates would have caused a stir.

Thomas remembers a ""self-hate"" stage, where ""you hate yourself for being part of a group that's gotten the hell kicked out of them."" He tried to fit in. He avoided every form of stereotypical behavior attributed to blacks. He took pains to speak perfectly—not in slang, not loudly. He stressed academic achievement. But acceptance did not come. When he left the seminary, he held a conviction he has carried since: there is nothing a black man can do to be accepted by whites. Consequently, despite his anger at segregation, he does not automatically grant that integration is good for black people. Thomas wants to know in every instance what integration means for blacks. If it means losing the alternative of going to their own schools, running their own businesses, then he doesn't like it. He has too many scars from episodes in which, in the name of integration, he was the only black. Today he says, ""The whole push to assimilate simply does not make sense to me.""",-1,http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1987/02/a-question-of-fairness/306370/

So how can it be that the billionaire real estate mogul does not have a single endorsement from a Republican Senator or Congressman — even among the most hard-line conservatives?

This remains a startling fact, even as establishment party leaders have made it clear that they prefer Trump to a notoriously unpopular current member of the Senate, Ted Cruz Rafael (Ted) Edward CruzOn The Money: Senate GOP faces post-Trump spending brawl | Senate confirms SEC chief Gensler to full five-year term | Left-leaning group raises concerns about SALT cap repeal Biden watching Derek Chauvin verdict from West Wing Cruz opposed to state lawmaker's bid to replace Wright in Congress MORE (R- Texas).

Amazingly, the most pointed criticism of Trump in the run-up to the caucuses has come from Tea Party members of Congress, who advertise themselves as Trump-like on the issues, from their push for a wall at the southern border to their opposition to President Obama’s trade deals and nuclear accord with Iran.

“I love a lot of the things that Donald Trump is saying,” said Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert, a Tea Party firebrand who — along with 17 other House Republicans — has put his name behind Cruz.

“But then you worry since [Trump] is a deal-maker and he knows how to win, is he doing what he needs to do to win now, and then going to turn around and go back to the principles he stood on for nearly all of his life in the general election?” said Gohmert, speaking on Newsmax TV's ""The Steve Malzberg Show."" “And then evangelicals have nowhere else to go at that point.”

Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), another Cruz-supporting hardliner, has suggested that anyone endorsing Trump is guilty of ‘pay for play’ politics, embracing Trump for money, fame or out of fear of retribution.

“One of them is money…” King told Politico, regarding the possible motivations of those backing the business mogul. “It might be fame, it might be the mystique of the Trump machine, it might be people are afraid of retribution and it might be people that are looking for opportunities down the line. And it might be any combination of those things and others that I haven’t said.”

Several conservative talk radio hosts are also sounding the anti-Trump sirens. Glenn Beck endorsed Cruz last week, blasting Trump as a “dangerous man” and a “bully.” Beck and several other leading conservatives took to the pages of the conservative National Review magazine recently to urge GOP primary voters to reject Trump.

The closest Trump has come to an endorsement from any voice with ties to Congress is in the form of people running from Cruz.

Former Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.), the GOP’s 1996 presidential nominee, told the New York Times he’d back Trump if Cruz were the only other choice. “Nobody likes him,” Dole said of Cruz. Dole praised Trump, saying he could ""probably work with Congress, because…he's got the right personality and he's kind of a deal-maker.""

Former Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) has compared Trump’s appeal to that of Andrew Jackson because the “elites disliked” the early 19th century president who, like Trump, “represented farmer-frontier-worker rebellion against the eastern establishment.” Gingrich predicted to The Washington Post that Trump could become a “big asset” to the party and has the capacity to “shatter traditional” ways of doing business in Congress.

Similarly, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) has said he has “come around a little bit” on Trump. And why is that? Well, Hatch prefers Trump to Cruz.

Pennsylvania Rep. Charlie Dent, a leading moderate Republican who co-chairs the Tuesday Group moderates in the House, signaled last week he is also warming to Trump because he is not Cruz.

“Ted Cruz is a rigid ideologue,” Dent told the New York Times. “Donald Trump is ideologically scattered and malleable. In my view, a more rigid ideology would have a much harder time assembling a winning general election coalition than the less doctrinaire candidate.”

The real reason for all the anxiety among Republicans about Trump and Cruz is the fear that either man could drag down the party in Congress.

With Trump or Cruz at the top of the GOP slate in November, the Democrats like their chances of taking back the House and Senate.

Ahead of the Iowa caucuses, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) released a memo outlining how they will target 13 vulnerable incumbent Republican congressmen by linking them to Trump’s extreme policies.

“Regardless of the ultimate Republican nominee, Trump and Cruz have hijacked the Republican narrative and driven the conversation to a place that is bad news for House Republicans in a presidential year,” a DCCC spokeswoman recently told reporters.

The Democrats need to win 30 House seats to retake the majority. This seems unlikely given the landscape of gerrymandered districts, which favors Republicans. But with a polarizing figure like Trump or Cruz as the GOP’s presidential nominee, it could happen. Democrats won 31 House seats a decade ago and made Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) the Speaker of the House.

Democrats have a much better chance of taking back the Senate. They need only to flip five seats currently held by Republicans. Of the 24 seats the GOP will be defending, seven of them are in states that President Obama carried in 2008 and 2012 — Illinois, Florida, Iowa, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

The incumbent Republican senators in those states would have an uphill battle to re-election even without having to explain their relationship to Trump or Cruz.

By the GOP convention, the question will not be about endorsements. It will be about how many Congressional Republicans openly reject Trump or Cruz, if either man is the nominee.

As often as three times a week, Bob Alexander parks his car at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, makes the trek through the main terminal, and gets in line to pass through security.

Shoes and belt intact again, he heads to the gate. And he waits.

Alexander is under no obligation to run the dreaded airport security gauntlet again and again. He volunteers to do it. His mission is to ensure every Honor Flight veteran coming down the gangway feels welcomed to the nation’s capital.

The Honor Flight Network is a nonprofit organization that brings veterans from all over the country to Washington, D.C., to visit their war memorials. Co-founder Jeff Miller says since the first flight went wheels up in 2005, the network has brought nearly 170,000 veterans to D.C. to see the World War II Memorial, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, the Korean War Memorial, Iwo Jima and sometimes the Changing of the Guard ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery.

“There is absolutely no way we could do this at the level we’ve done it without volunteers,” Miller said as he looked around at the dozens of neon yellow “Ground Crew” T-shirts blanketing the area.

Related: The War on Veterans Memorials

An unpaid quintet plays patriotic songs for as long as it takes dozens of vets to deplane. Volunteers not only rev up a rousing greeting for each incoming flight, but many then pair up with a veteran to escort throughout the day.

Some volunteers are designated photographers. Others work as tour guides. Still others work as administrators, voluntarily organizing the volunteers.

Swacha says the work is worth it. She had three great uncles who were in the service but who never got to see their memorial.

Jody Swacha works her spreadsheets every day to be sure each bus has a knowledgeable guide.

“Some days I have four or five different hubs that have requested tour guides, so I could have 20 to 30 guides out on one particular day,” Swacha commented as she hawked a group meandering through the WWII Memorial’s concrete arches toward the fountain. “They have to be veteran friendly. They have to be looking out for wheelchairs, instructing them not to take pictures while they’re walking backwards so we don’t end up with a veteran landing in the pool here.”

As dozens of octogenarian — or even nonagenarian — gentlemen (and some women) storm the nation’s capital, it’s clear it’s a big undertaking. Many veterans use canes or walkers or even wheelchairs. There is the occasional oxygen tank.

Swacha says the work is worth it. She had three great uncles (Cecil, Bill and Don) who were in the service but who never got to see their memorial.

“It’s just amazing being around all these guys who’ve been there, done that. I’ve been with guys who’ve cleaned out concentration camps, who were this close to putting up the flag at Iwo Jima. I’ve met first-wave landers at Normandy. It’s absolutely incredible,” she said.

Alan Lewis recently welcomed a group of veterans who met in a Florida airport at 2 a.m. to make their flight to D.C. They boarded buses at 8 a.m., hit all the memorials and had lunch — in a pouring rainstorm.

“With the weather and the traffic, it was an interesting day,” Lewis recalled. But he said it’s important work, because “these veterans in large measure didn’t get the ticker tape parade down Broadway or Main Street after their service.”

Alexander thinks nothing of his weekly airport runs. His father served in WWII. He tears up when he talks about him.

“He was on what is known as the Second Schweinfurt Raid where 600 planes were in the raid. Sixty were shot down. He never said anything special about it,” Alexander said of his father.

Bruce Hill volunteers because his dad and uncles were all fighter pilots in WWII. But the stop at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial is especially important to him. He ran reconnaissance patrols in Laos. His brother was a dust-off pilot, carrying the wounded off the battlefield.

“I was fortunate enough to see my brother several times in Vietnam … I got home and a month later he was killed,” Hill said.

At the distinctive memorial wall, Bruce gently touches Robert Hill’s name etched in black granite.

“It never dawned on me that he would be killed,” Bruce Hill said.

Miller expects that Vietnam veterans will likely soon be filling Honor Flights as WWII veterans become too disabled or die off. The younger vets who are ill are invited on flights now. As veterans age and wars continue, he said he sees Honor Flight as an ageless way to honor those who served in all wars.

“There’s always a conflict. As long as there’s a man, there’ll be a fight somewhere,” Miller said.

And he believes there will always be volunteers to keep the program going.

“They do it because they love it. They have a real passion for it.”",-1,http://www.lifezette.com/polizette/guiding-the-greatest-generation/
21993,Williams,Juan,livescience,"Four more people were diagnosed with dengue fever on Hawaii's Big Island today (Nov. 5), raising the number of locally transmitted cases to 19 people, according to the Hawaii State Department of Health.

Health officials say these ""locally transmitted"" cases are concerning because, although dengue has popped up sporadically in Hawaii before, in most previous cases, the disease was imported, meaning travelers brought it to the islands from elsewhere. In the new cases, people are contracting dengue from the bites of local mosquitoes.

""Although dengue is not endemic to Hawaii, we do have the mosquito species capable of transmitting the disease,"" Dr. Sarah Park, the state epidemiologist for Hawaii, said in a statement last week. It's likely an infected traveler was bit by a mosquito and infected the local mosquito population, which led to this cluster of cases, Park said. ""We want the public to be aware of this mosquito-borne disease and the steps they can take to prevent infection,"" she added.

The outbreak likely started in mid-September, and has infected people on all sides of the Big Island, meaning there are multiple hotspots, Park said. It's unclear who brought the illness to Hawaii, but a pending genetic analysis of the virus will tell researchers where in the world the virus originated, Park said. [Tiny & Nasty: Images of Things That Make Us Sick]

Dengue (pronounced DEN-gee) symptoms usually begin a week after a person is bitten by a mosquito carrying the virus, and can include fever, joint or muscle pains, headache or pain behind the eyes, and rash, according to the Hawaii State Department of Health.

To prevent the virus' spread, health officials advised people to use mosquito nets and wear insect repellant and long-sleeved, light-colored clothing (mosquitoes are drawn to dark colors). People can also get rid of standing water where mosquitoes lay eggs, and avoid going outside in the early morning and dusk, when Aedes mosquitoes are most active.

There is no vaccine or specific treatment for dengue fever, but people with the virus can receive supportive care, including taking acetaminophen, drinking fluids and resting. Infected people should avoid taking aspirin and ibuprofen because these painkillers can worsen the bleeding problems that can sometimes happen in people with dengue, the department said.

This is Hawaii's third outbreak of locally transmitted dengue in the past 14 years. The largest of these struck in 2001, when 122 people contracted dengue, mostly on the island of Maui, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2011, a small outbreak sickened five people on Oahu, the state's most populated island.

Hawaii has a handful of dengue cases every year, but these cases are typically diagnosed in travelers who got the virus elsewhere, not from local Hawaii mosquitoes. This year, 13 infected travelers have been diagnosed with dengue, but these cases are separate from the current outbreak, Park said.

Will dengue become endemic in Hawaii?

Dengue fever is endemic, or permanently established in the human population, in a number of tropical places around the world, including Puerto Rico and popular tourism spots in Latin America and Southeast Asia, according to the CDC.

However, the virus is unlikely to become endemic in Hawaii, said Jonathan Day, a professor of medical entomology at the University of Florida.

Dengue is different from other mosquito-transmitted viruses that have become endemic in recent years in parts of the U.S., he said. For instance, West Nile virus is carried by birds, and mosquitoes can spread the disease from birds to people because they bite both. But dengue doesn't have such an animal ""reservoir,"" except for monkeys in Africa and Southeast Asia, the CDC said. Therefore, the virus is unlikely to persist in the mosquito population for long, once the human outbreak ends.

Other dengue outbreaks in the United States have typically lasted a year or two. In an outbreak in Brownsville, Texas, 25 people became ill with dengue in 2005, and in Key West, Florida, 90 people got dengue from 2009 to 2011, according to the CDC. [7 Devastating Infectious Diseases]

These outbreaks usually end with the help of public education campaigns and mosquito control measures. People in these areas also typically have air conditioning in their homes, which removes the humidity mosquitoes need in order to live, Day said.

But in places like Puerto Rico, dengue is likely there to stay, he said.

""There's a constant dengue problem in Puerto Rico,"" Day said. ""You go to downtown San Juan in Puerto Rico, and the houses are all open — they have bars on the windows, but no screens, the front doors are open [and there's] no air conditioning. Every house has a population of Aedes aegypti [mosquito] that live right inside the house.""

For Hawaii, however, dry weather is in the near-term forecast, which should help abate mosquito transmission of the virus, Park said. Nonetheless, it's unclear how long the outbreak will last.

""I think the only question about Hawaii right now is, are we looking at the beginning of a large transmission event, where there might be 50 or 100 cases, or are we looking at something that has been going on during September and October, and is essentially over?"" Day said. ""At this point, I don't think we know the answer to that.""

21995,Williams,Juan,thehill,"This week marks the 271st birthday of the politician who first approved of “gerrymandering.” As governor of Massachusetts, Elbridge Gerry (also the nation’s fifth vice president) agreed to the idea of drawing congressional districts in odd shapes to ensure that the political party in power won the majority of the state’s seats in the House.

His enduring legacy is the partisan split in Congress that dismisses compromise and disdains bipartisan solutions to the nation’s biggest problems, from tax reform to a federal budget.

ADVERTISEMENT

But last month the Supreme Court took a first step toward burying the corruption of gerrymandering. In a 5-4 decision, the justices approved of voters deciding by referendum to create independent, non-partisan commissions to draw a state’s congressional map. Last week, the Florida Supreme Court followed up by ruling that parts of a current redistricting plan violate the state constitution by being crassly political.

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s majority opinion said voters have the right to go around politically skewed state legislatures and “address the problem of partisan gerrymandering — the drawing of legislative district lines to subordinate adherents of one political party and entrench a rival party in power.”

“Entrench” is the right word. One popular joke around Washington is that redistricting by state legislatures allows members of Congress to pick their voters instead of voters picking their members of Congress.

When it comes to 2016 House races, more than 400 of the 435 seats in the House are rated as “safe” for incumbent Republicans and Democrats because of gerrymandering. That leaves only about 7 percent of the seats in Congress open to a meaningful contest.

Gerrymandering has distorted congressional politics by eliminating the need for either party to appeal to the political middle. Instead, the members of Congress live in fear of a challenge from the far right (in the case of Republicans) or the far left (in the case of Democrats), ignoring the majority of voters who live in the middle and want a Congress that gets problems solved.

Gerrymandering along racial and political lines is a large part of the reason why there is no longer even one white Southern Democrat in the House. It is the mother of the ‘Tea Party Caucus’ that undermines the Speaker, John Boehner John Andrew BoehnerCantor: 'Level of craziness' in Washington has increased 'on both sides' Cheney on Trump going to GOP retreat in Florida: 'I haven't invited him' Republicans race for distance from 'America First Caucus' MORE (R-Ohio), by denigrating him as insufficiently conservative when he tries to make budget deals with Democrats.

Gerrymandering is the reason President Obama tells supporters the best thing they can do to help him is to move to a red state and help break the GOP hold on Congress. As a result of the distortion caused by gerrymandering in the 2012 cycle, Republicans kept control of Congress while losing the overall, national congressional vote to Democrats by 49 to 48 percent.

In the 2014 cycle, an off-year election, Republicans had the edge in voter enthusiasm as well as control of more state legislatures. As a result of the power of gerrymandering, the GOP won 57 percent of all House seats even though they had just 52 percent of the votes.

Even in election years, when majority control of the House changes from one party to the other, the reelection rate tied to gerrymandered districts is staggeringly high. In 2006, when Democrats won the House, 94 percent of incumbents were reelected. In 2010, when Republicans rode a Tea Party wave back to the majority, it was still high times for incumbents with 85 percent of them retaining their seat. This is the politics of back-room congressional mapping.

This current era of unprecedented polarization and dysfunction borne of gerrymandering has current congressional approval ratings down to 15.8 percent while disapproval is at 74.6 percent, according to the RealClearPolitics polling average. Obviously, Republicans as well as Democrats disapprove of what is going on in this broken Congress.

Sen. John McCain John Sidney McCainBush says he doesn't criticize other presidents to avoid risking friendship with Michelle Obama 'Real Housewives of the GOP' — Wannabe reality show narcissists commandeer the party George W. Bush: 'It's a problem that Americans are so polarized' they can't imagine him being friends with Michelle Obama MORE (R-Ariz.) has often said that the only people approving of Congress these days are “paid staffers and blood relatives.”

The adoption of independent state commissions to draw congressional maps is by far the most important step available to voters longing for a Congress that works. Seven states already have non-partisan commissions in place: Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, New Jersey and Washington State. With the Supreme Court’s recent ruling, the door is open to more.

Republicans currently hold 246 seats in the House and Democrats hold 188. Even with a higher turnout likely for Democrats, as compared to 2014 midterms, and the Electoral College map favoring the Democrats in the presidential race, it is doubtful that Democrats can win the 30 seats they need to take control of the House. Gerrymandering is the reason.

It is not as sexy as the court’s recent rulings on gay marriage and ObamaCare. But this high court ruling also has historic potential. It opens the door for voters in more states to get referendums on the ballot calling for non-partisan panels to set the lines for congressional districts — and so revive a functional Congress.

21997,Williams,Juan,thehill,"It is worse than that. President Obama can jab back in any political fight.

The real issue here is the way Boehner is recklessly sowing division along party lines on Israel. He is also — intentionally or not — heightening the silent but simmering racial tensions that increasingly divide Americans on the subject.

The racial division is the most troubling of all to me, as a black American.

ADVERTISEMENT

Boehner’s visit is his latest embrace of Israeli Prime Minster Benjamin Netanyahu, a man who used strong racial language to rally his conservative supporters and win another term in office earlier this month.

“The right-wing government is in danger,” the prime minister wrote to supporters on the day of the election. “Arab voters are coming out in droves to the polls. Left-wing organizations are busing them out.”

Obama’s spokesman condemned the use of such noxious rhetoric as a “cynical” tactic. But there has been no comment from Boehner or other top Republicans.

There is a terrible history of race-based political appeals in the United States. As a civil rights historian, I know the sharp edges of racial politics as revealed in coded campaign language, gerrymandering, voter suppression and even today’s strong black-white split when it comes to views of how police deal with poor black communities.

But both major American political parties reject having their candidates directly and openly play on racial tensions for short-term political gain.

It is dangerous politics, at odds with maintaining a socially and economically stable nation of many different races, as well as a rising number of immigrants. It is also not in keeping with America’s democratic values, specifically the Declaration of Independence’s promise that “All men are created equal.”

To overlook Netanyahu’s racial politics is to send a troubling message to Americans at a time when blacks and Hispanics are overwhelmingly Democrats and the Republican Party is almost all white.

Boehner is acting as if Netanyahu’s racial tactics and his government’s insensitivity to its Arab minority do not matter inside American politics. They do.

Last year, polls showed black and Hispanic Americans, along with younger voters, had become less likely to support Israel than older, white Americans. The Pew Research Center found that 36 percent of black Americans and 35 percent of Hispanic Americans then believed Israel had gone “too far” in its strong military response to Hamas. Only 22 percent of white Americans agreed.

Pew reported that “as many blacks blame Israel (27 percent) as Hamas (25 percent) for the fighting; and Hispanics are somewhat more likely to say Israel is to blame (35 percent) than Hamas (20 percent.)”

This disagreement among American racial groups is reflected in the split between Republicans and Democrats over Israel.

Republican voters are more likely to support Israel in its fight to control the West Bank and Gaza than they are to support the Palestinian opposition. “Nearly three quarters of Republicans (73 percent) said they sympathize more with Israel than the Palestinians, compared with 45 percent of independents and 44 percent of Democrats,” Pew reported.

These divisions are likely even deeper now, after Netanyahu’s racial political appeal.

He has already pushed back against long-standing United States policy, which calls for a “two-state solution” with a safe, sovereign Israel as the neighbor of an independent Palestinian nation. (Netanyahu, after the election, appeared to moderate his position to some degree, but his lack of enthusiasm for the two-state solution remains plain.)

Boehner seems oblivious to the deteriorating levels of support for Israel among America’s liberals and young people, especially black and Hispanic young people.

With blinders on, he is doubling down on Republicans using Israel to rally their base. Boehner’s trip comes after he invited Netanyahu to address Congress without informing the White House in advance, and after President Obama made clear his distaste for the Israeli leader’s campaign tactics.

Abe Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League, described Netanyahu’s address to Congress, which was intended to undermine Obama’s efforts to reach a nuclear deal with Iran, as a “tragedy of unintended consequences.”

In the broadest sense, the consequences of the current political atmosphere include rising anti-Israel sentiments on U.S. college campuses.

“On college campuses, pro-Palestinian groups like Students for Justice in Palestine have long framed the Israeli occupation as the civil rights issue of our time,” a recent New York Times magazine article noted. Jeffrey Salkin, a New Jersey rabbi, wrote in a syndicated column last year that “Israel Apartheid Week is a regular feature of [American] campus life.”

The decline in support for Israel extends to Capitol Hill where, the Times reported, “a recent focus group of congressional staffers — tomorrow’s policy makers — revealed ebbing support for Israel.”

It is time to hit the stop button on the cynical political spin at play when Boehner appears indifferent to Netanyahu’s racial appeals.

21998,Williams,Juan,thehill,"Sen.’s (R-Ky.) strategy for defeating Democrats in the final two years of the Obama administration is clear: divide and conquer.

Last week, the Senate majority leader got 10 Democrats to vote with the GOP for a motion to continue debate on construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, which would carry Canadian oil through the United States to the Gulf of Mexico for shipment overseas.

President Obama intends to veto the bill. And most Republicans admit they don’t have the 67 votes necessary to override a presidential veto. Reaching that goal would require not just Republican unanimity on the issue (which McConnell has), but also the support of 13 Democrats (which he doesn’t).

ADVERTISEMENT

McConnell knows he won’t win on the pipeline. That is not the point. McConnell is a terrific, canny political player. As Senate minority leader for the first six years of the Obama presidency, he set the Republicans’ successful strategy of obstruction. He unified the Republicans on Capitol Hill in opposition to anything with the president’s name on it.

Now he is testing Sen. Harry Reid’s (D-Nev.) ability as minority leader to hold Senate Democrats together in opposition to a Republican agenda favoring the pipeline, halting immigration reform, lowering corporate taxes, and seeking to destroy ObamaCare.

If significant numbers of Senate Democrats are willing to join with Republicans to force presidential vetoes, McConnell wins. He gains the power to paint himself as the good guy working across political lines. And he will smear the remaining Democrats as members of an out-of-the-mainstream party in the grips of leftist ideologues — Obama, Reid, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and possibly Hillary Clinton.

McConnell has identified three Democrats as prime targets for defection: Sens. Joe Manchin (W.Va.), Heidi Heitkamp (N.D.) and Joe Donnelly (Ind.). Those red-state senators were among the 10 Democrats voting with him on the pipeline bill last week.

Keystone was first up because it is central to McConnell’s goal of changing the GOP’s image from the party of Wall Street and Southern white, social conservatives to the party able to produce economic prosperity for the beleaguered American worker.

The challenge for Republicans is that 2012 exit polls showed Democrats, led by President Obama, won big over the Republicans (81 to 18 percent) on the question of which candidate cares about “people like me.”

McConnell takes every chance he gets to describe the pipeline as a jobs bill. He plans to follow it up with a vote “restoring the 40-hour workweek,” to ObamaCare. He says that will produce more jobs by freeing employers from providing health insurance under ObamaCare. His broader goal is to sell the GOP as the party of the working class.

“If there’s one party for the working person right now, it’s the Republican Party,” newly elected Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy (R) said recently on “Fox News Sunday,” artfully expressing McConnell’s new narrative. “The Republican Party is pushing the use of natural resources to create American jobs. It is the Democratic Party that is trying to kill those jobs. … In the coal industry, they clearly have a war on coal. In the oil and gas industry, Barack Obama continues to impede our jobs with regulations.”

Regular attacks on all new Environmental Protection Agency regulations will be central to the agenda of McConnell and congressional Republicans.

According to The Washington Post, environmental groups, fearing the McConnell agenda, made contributions to Democratic candidates in 2014 totaling $85 million to try to save the Senate from a GOP majority. They lost. But the environmentalists remain a key constituency for Democrats.

McConnell sees an opportunity to make the Democrats seem like effete elitists, thwarting people in need of jobs by prioritizing environmental concerns. Since the 1980s and Ronald Reagan’s political rise, the Democrats have struggled to win white working-class voters. The “Reagan Democrats” abandoned unions and the Democrats until a Southern Democrat, Bill Clinton, won them back. Then George W. Bush reclaimed them for the GOP. President Obama has never done well with working-class whites, especially men.

The 2016 election is shaping up as a contest defined by a working class that is discontent with low wages and rising income inequality. Even with the economy doing well, sinking gas prices and unemployment lower than it was before the start of the recession, there is populist anger over income inequality.

That is why McConnell made the XL pipeline vote his first order of business for the new Republican majority in the Senate. When McConnell tries to pass tax reform intended to lower tax rates on big business he will similarly and cynically present it to working-class voters as an effort to create jobs.

Reid recently described the Republican passion for the pipeline bill as “one of the biggest farces,” in his time in Washington. Top White House officials predict there will be little political damage from a presidential veto because the pipeline is not a priority for voters. But if enough Senate Democrats continue to work with Republicans, McConnell plans on a narrative ahead of the ’16 election featuring Obama and loyal Democrats as the real “obstructionists” and the reason Washington is not working. The only relevant question for the next two years is whether Democrats will maintain the unity to beat McConnell’s game.

21999,Williams,Juan,thehill,"People with broken arms, patients recently recovered from emergency surgery — President Obama needs to put Americans benefitting from ObamaCare next to the First Lady when he makes his Jan. 20 State of the Union address.

It is time for him to go on the offensive on the Affordable Care Act. The insurance exchanges are attracting strong enrollment. And the politics of ObamaCare is shifting gears, with Republicans controlling majorities on both sides of Capitol Hill. Now, there is a new set of questions at play.

Will the new GOP majority in Congress offer any viable alternative to a healthcare reform measure that gives insurance benefits to millions of Americans who previously were uninsured?

ADVERTISEMENT

How will candidates for the GOP 2016 presidential nomination deal with Republican primary voters who remain reflexively opposed to anything short of outright repeal of ObamaCare?

Republican candidates have to keep in mind they will need voters in the general election — Democrats and independents — who want to keep a system that now gives them more and better health insurance. If you want to get a sense of the new politics of ObamaCare, try imagining running for president on a platform opposed to Social Security.

The bullets flying at Speaker John Boehner John Andrew BoehnerCantor: 'Level of craziness' in Washington has increased 'on both sides' Cheney on Trump going to GOP retreat in Florida: 'I haven't invited him' Republicans race for distance from 'America First Caucus' MORE (R-Ohio) last week from conservative firebrands trying to deny him another term as the GOP leader in the chamber targeted one big complaint: He spearheaded the omnibus spending bill that funds the government for the coming year. So that means he funded ObamaCare.

The spending bill also funded the president’s executive action on immigration reforms, but only through February. It is primarily the funding of ObamaCare that allowed rightwing talk radio and conservative firebrands such as Reps. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) and Steve King (R-Iowa) to rally votes against Boehner. And they got the most votes in opposition to any Speaker since the Civil War.

The same anger at ObamaCare can be seen among the new Republican majority in the Senate. In a CNN interview last week, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellMcConnell vents over 'fake news' The Hill's 12:30 Report - Presented by Facebook - Tensions rise as U.S. waits for Derek Chauvin verdict Trump looking 'beyond seriously' at 2024 run MORE (R-Ky.) said: “We’re certainly going to be voting on that. Either repeal or take out pieces of it, whether destroying the 40-hour work week, the medical device tax, the individual mandate — all of these are highly unpopular with the American people.”

The Senate Majority Leader promised to put bills killing all those central elements of ObamaCare “on his desk” — the president’s desk — as a show of the GOP’s continued disdain for ObamaCare. The fact that Obama is certain to veto the bills makes little difference from the GOP’s perspective.

During the last Congress, the GOP-controlled House voted more than 50 times to repeal or defund the whole, or some part, of the Affordable Care Act.

In the midterm campaigns, Republicans stirred their voters, especially in Senate races in “red” states, by lambasting ObamaCare. They waved the law like a bloody flag, offering it as the central evidence of Obama defying the will of the American people, who tell pollsters they disapprove of the legislation and its mandate for everyone to have health insurance.

It has been great political theater. But, from now on, running against healthcare reform becomes a very dangerous game.

A November Gallup poll found that 70 percent of the people who have ObamaCare are happy with the program. Even more impressive, the number of uninsured Americans has dropped by more than 25 percent in the last year. That works out to between 8 and 11 million people with coverage who had no health insurance before ObamaCare.

As The New York Times reported in October: “At its most basic level, the Affordable Care Act was intended to reduce the number of Americans without health insurance. Measured against that goal, it has made considerable progress.”

And that’s not all. As of last month, more than 3.4 million people had signed up for an insurance plan through Healthcare.gov. Of those people, the Department of Health and Human Services notes, 87 percent selected a plan offering financial assistance. That means low-to-middle income working people are coming to the plan and finding that it fits their individual and family needs.

“The evidence is now on Obama’s side,” Steve Friess, a technology writer, asserted in a Time magazine essay last month. “You think [evidence of success] is some liberal, nanny-state fever dream? It is not…conjecture; it is a statistical certainty based on all the data used by insurance carriers to set rates.”

Polls continue to show overall opposition to ObamaCare: The Real Clear Politics average is 39.2 percent in support and 51.5 in opposition. Polls also show majority support for keeping the law. Last year a Kaiser poll found 60 percent — including people who say they oppose the law — favor keeping the law as it is or improving it.

The challenge for the new GOP majority is making ObamaCare their own. But do they know it?

22000,Williams,Juan,military,"The Navy is surging forward with plans to build a new, more lethal Littoral Combat Ship variant engineered with a host of new technologies, weapons and systems to begin procurement by 2019, service leaders announced Thursday.

The new Small Surface Combatant, or SSC, emerged as a result of recommendations to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel from a unit tasked with analyzing possibilities for a new LCS variant called the Small Surface Combatant Task Force.

""After rigorous review and analysis, today I accepted the Navy's recommendation to build a new Small Surface Combatant ship based on upgraded variants of the LCS. The new SSC will offer improvements in ship survivability and lethality, delivering enhanced naval combat performance at an affordable price,"" Hagel said in a written statement.

This past January, Hagel instructed the Navy that there would be no new contracts awarded for LCS production beyond 32 ships, instructing the Navy to consider a host of alternative proposals for the remaining 20 ships slated to complete the 52-ship program.

Hagel cited many criticisms of the LCS platform such as concerns that it lacked the lethality and survivability that it needed to complete its desired range of mission sets. As a result, he inspired the creation of the Small Surface Combatant Task Force which focused on identifying a new LCS design featuring vastly improved survivability.

The task force explored more than 192 different design concepts and consulted with fleet commanders, industry, surface warfare officers, engineers and program managers, among others.

""They did a remarkable job. It was very deliberate. It was very detailed and it was very analytical and informed,"" said Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Jonathan Greenert.

Instead of focusing of interchangeable sets of integrated technologies called mission packages like those used for the existing LCS, the new modified ship will simultaneously be configured for surface warfare and anti-submarine warfare, Greenert said.

""The Navy needs a Small Surface Combatant and this ship meets that need. The secretary directed us to bring forward with our 2017 budget proposal an acquisition plan to forward fit these capabilities into a 2019 timeframe,"" Greenert said.

Mine counter-measures mission packages will be handled by the regular LCS ships already in production.

""It will feature an improved air defense radar, air defense decoys, a new, more effective electronic warfare system, an over-the-horizon anti-ship missile, multi-function towed array sonar, torpedo defenses and additional armor protection,"" Hagel said.

The new ship will feature specially configured space armor designed to better protect the ship and its crew. In addition, the ship will have improved decoy systems to divert incoming enemy missions and an upgrade to a missile-interceptor ship defense system called SeaRAM.

The new ship will also be configured with what's called improved signature management, meaning technologies which make the vessel less detectable to enemy radar and less susceptible to enemy mines.

Alongside the new modifications, the ship will also incorporate many of the weapons systems and technologies currently on the LCS such as 30mm guns, a ship-launched Hellfire missile, 11m rigid inflatable boats and a 57mm gun.

Greenert also added that the Navy was directed to come up with a proposal to explore whether any of the additional survivability technologies could be retrofitted onto existing LCS ships or engineered into those entering production.

The new modifications will add about $65 to $70 million to the price of the ship, an increase which amounts to less than 20-percent of the overall cost of the ship, Navy officials said.

22001,Williams,Juan,military,"A Veterans Affairs official on Thursday said the agency is making changes to its homeless veterans national call center, a 60-person department that the VA's Office of the Inspector General recently concluded had failed to respond to more than 40,000 calls for assistance.

Lisa Pape, executive director for homeless programs with the Veterans Health Administration told the House Veterans Affairs Committee that she regretted ""that any veteran calling for referrals did not get the service they requested.""

The IG report said it counted 40,500 ""missed opportunities where the call center either did not refer the homeless veterans' calls to medical facilities or it closed referrals without ensuring homeless veterans had received needed services from VA medical facilities.""

In about 21,000 cases the veteran ended up getting an answering machine, and more than half of those who left messages could not be contacted because the messages were inaudible, according to the report.

Pape told lawmakers that employees may have been away from their phones for training, leave or documenting earlier work.

Pape was unable to say whether anyone would be fired over the lost calls and incomplete referrals, saying the matter is under review.

""Management is looking at how to address issues in performance and I will be addressing that,"" she said. ""I don't know if all the employees are still there. I don't know if employees were fired.""

She said if there is wrongdoing found on the part of the call center manager, action will be taken but she could not say whether that would mean being fired.

Even before the IG released its report, the department had already taken action by rescheduling the hours of employees, to ensure that all phones are staffed during peak times. Currently, she said, 90 percent of calls are being answered.

Veterans who get voice mail, she said, will be told where they are in the queue and given the option of waiting or leaving a message.

Some 20 to 25 percent of veterans will continue to remain on the streets after 2015 regardless of what government housing, health and assistance programs are made available, expert witnesses told Congress on Thursday.

Criticism of the VA's call center comes as the VA enters the final stretch in its five-year plan to end homelessness among veterans.

Since VA Secretary Eric Shinseki announced the plan in 2009, VA officials have tracked annually the number of homeless veterans across the country. During a one-night count in January 2010, the VA found 76,329 vets living in emergency shelters, transitional housing or out on the streets.

Currently that number is 49,933, a 33 percent drop from the 2010 figure and about 6,000 fewer veterans than were counted last year.

The VA has developed numerous programs aimed at tackling veteran homelessness, including jobs programs with which it works with the Labor Department and housing programs run by the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

In recent years, it has also increasingly provided millions of dollars in grants to community-based organizations to assist veterans with housing and employment assistance.

But experts working on the problem in communities told lawmakers Thursday that the problem will not really end, but can be made manageable.

Phil Landis, president and chief executive officer of Veterans Village of San Diego, California, said most veterans ""will be able to deal with their demons and move forward"" if they get the proper residential treatment, healthcare and assistance.

""But a good 25 percent of this population will require our care for the rest of their lives,"" he said.

John F. Downing, chief executive officer of Soldier On in Massachusetts, said his own experience and observation indicates 20 percent of veterans who find themselves homeless will remain that way over time.

These are veterans, he said, ""who cannot learn to manage or who are just comfortable in that lifestyle. We would like to change that, but I don't think we can.""

Pape, in her remarks to the lawmakers, said the VA knows that ending veteran homelessness is a continuing effort.

""We recognize that ending homelessness is not an end point but a waypoint,"" she said. ""We can never become complacent about our achievements,"" she said.

Check the broad market

You can't distinguish overpriced from a steal of a deal if you don't know the range of rates available at your destination airport. So start your quest with some preliminary research on big travel websites that aggregate rates from multiple car rental companies, such as Expedia, Kayak, Orbitz, and Travelocity. For a midsize car, we found prices as low as $258 (Alamo and Enterprise) up to $478 (Avis), including all taxes and fees.

We didn't find better rates when checking rental company websites.

Don't jump at your airline's fly-and-drive deal

Shortly after we bought our airline tickets, our carrier (Southwest) sent a 30 percent discount offer for Budget, it's partner rent-a-car company. That would have reduced the price to about $250, but we knew we could do better.

Consumer Reports' indefatigable haggler Tod Marks (aka Tightwad Tod) recommends shopping for a car rental on Hotwire and Priceline. We chose Hotwire.

Like Priceline, Hotwire doesn't disclose the brand name of the car rental company until you make and pay for your reservation. If you're iffy on reserving a rental car that way, do some research.

Hotwire's offer listed several brands, but it also said this deal was from a rental company located inside the terminal rather than at an off-airport location. We checked the Burbank airport's website to find out which car rental companies are in the terminal and crosschecked that list with Hotwire's list of contenders. That left us sufficiently satisfied that the deal would be from a major national brand.",-1,http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2014/12/how-to-save-big-on-car-rental.htm
22003,Williams,Juan,defensetech,"The Air Force deployed four global positioning satellites into space this past year - the most it has put up in a single year in more than three decades.

But the constellation that helps more than 3 billion worldwide users - military and civilian - get from Point A to Point B also enables the Air Force to carry out another critical mission — watching for nuclear explosions.

Within each satellite is a secondary payload called the Nuclear Detonation Detection System, Air Force 2nd Lt. Christopher Phillips of the 2nd Special Operations Squadron, Schriever Air Force Base, Colorado, said in a statement released on Dec. 7.

“NDS performs an important mission,” he said. “It helps verify the Limited Test Ban Treaty of 1963. It makes sense. The whole reason the GPS constellation has these nuclear detonation sensors is because it provides global coverage. We can see every part of the planet.”

The most recent launch occurred on Oct. 29 when the GPS IIF-8 satellite was carried into space aboard an American Atlas V 401 rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida.

Nearly two years ago, the head of Air Force Space Command said the Pentagon was considering dropping the nuclear sensor payload from the GPS satellites as part of a cost-savings measure. The military would instead pay to have the sensors placed aboard commercial satellites, Reuters reported in January 2012, quoting then Air Force Space Command Commander Gen. William Shelton.

The Air Force said on Sunday there are 38 satellites in the GPS system.

GPS service requires more than 24 operational satellites in order to maintain worldwide coverage around the clock, according to the Air Force. Additional satellites increase GPS performance but are not considered part of the core constellation.",-1,http://defensetech.org/2014/12/08/air-force-breaks-30-year-record-for-gps-satellite-launches/
22004,Williams,Juan,deadline,"Paul Rosalie, we’re sorry to report, was not eaten alive by an anaconda tonight on Discovery’s special, Eaten Alive. He got hugged and kissed instead. When the snake hugging proved too much for one of his lower arms — Rosalie had insisted on taking off the lower-arm section of his special crush-proof suit for mobility sake — he bailed.

Twitter was not amused:

Last month, Discovery and Paul Rosolie had asked the media to swallow a whopper — Rosolie would attempt to be eaten alive by an anaconda, for all the anacondas out there who have no voice. Some bit.

In Eaten Alive, Rosolie said, he would attempt to be swallowed by a 25-to-27-foot anaconda “that slipped through his hands and nearly dragged him to the bottom of the floating forest” that happened “on his one and only previous expedition to this secluded part of the Amazonian jungle.” But one hour and 40 minutes into the two-hour special, Rosolie was seen failing entirely to capture that anaconda, and they instead had to use some understudy welterweight anaconda they had lying around because, Rosolie explained, he was still intent upon getting crushed and swallowed by an anaconda, for the sake of the snakes.

While failing to produce much drama, the special did cough up some great anaconda-theme ads, including a Man Up Moment repeat of a moment during the special in which Rosolie dives into the water in pursuit of a snake — brought to you by Every Kiss Begins with Kay Jewelers — as well as an ad mocking the show while plugging an online contact lens store. That company nicked the show again in its own tweet after the telecast was over:

In its news release, Discovery Channel described Rosolie “as snake researcher and conservationist… who has dedicated his career to studying the Giant Green Anaconda.”

In an interview with adventure travel web site Curious Animal, published May 16, 2014, Rosolie described thusly his research and conservation work on the world’s largest anaconda:

“I have a six-foot arm span and I jumped on a snake where I couldn’t wrap my arms around the snake. That’s a giant snake…She kept moving with me on her back, so I was riding an anaconda and she didn’t even seem to mind.”

Rosolie said he was in “extreme danger” when he hitched a ride on the back of the snake — for research purposes, we now know– adding, “I don’t know why I jumped on it, except I was so excited and amazed to see an animal like that. I think I just needed that experience of getting to touch it.”

Last month, while Discovery Channel said Rosolie would “attempt something no one has ever dared: to be EATEN ALIVE,” Rosolie himself floated his “I did it for the Rain Forest and all its living creatures” defense:

“I’ve seen first-hand how the Amazon Rainforest is being destroyed. It is so rampant that we may be the last generation with the opportunity to save it. People need to wake up to what is going on. What better way is there to shock people than to put my life on the line with the largest snake on the planet, the Green Anaconda?” he asked rhetorically, since he’d previously been compelled to reveal the stunt already had been shot, and the snake had survived his publicity stunt, in response to the growing din of critics. Discovery Channel tried to drown that din, by announcing that the anaconda that attempted to dine on Rosolie was alive and well. Discovery added that the Lumpy Ninja get-up Rosolie wore during his attempt to force himself, meal-wise, on the snake who was just minding her own business in the floating forest, was “built to ensure the snake’s safety just as much as it was to protect Rosolie’s life.” This, in response to nearly 38,000 signatures on a Change.org petition to persuade Discovery Communications to dump this special it describes as made-for-TV animal abuse. PETA weighed in too.",-1,http://deadline.com/2014/12/eaten-alive-paul-rosolie-anaconda-snake-swallow-discovery-channel-1201314467/
22005,Williams,Juan,thehill,"America’s racial tensions, hot after the painful non-indictments in Ferguson and New York, bubbled up on Capitol Hill last week. The occasion was a House Judiciary hearing on President Obama’s executive authority to limit deportations of illegal immigrants.

ADVERTISEMENT

Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) asked an advocate for the policy why “the response to this has been so different under this president” when several other presidents have made similar use of their prosecutorial discretion to shift enforcement of immigration law.

“He is the first African-American president,” said Marielena Hincapie, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center. Matter of fact, she added: “Historically every single president — Republican and Democrat since Eisenhower — has used their prosecutorial discretion.”

Rep. Trey Gowdy Trey GowdyPompeo rebukes Biden's new foreign policy The Hunter Biden problem won't go away Sunday shows preview: Joe Biden wins the 2020 election MORE (R- S.C.) took offense. “I would just caution you to be careful when you try to [impugn] motives to people,” he told Hincapie. Gowdy argued that when the current president was a senator he “had a different perspective on executive overreach than President Obama and nobody runs to race as an explanation for that.”

Gowdy’s desire to take racism off the political table requires heavy lifting six years into the Obama presidency. Conservatives, including Gowdy, try to make the case that their unrelenting criticism, their pursuit of “scandals” that turn out to be non-existent and their systematic obstruction of Obama’s policies, all amount to just politics. It has nothing to do with race, they say, except in the minds of liberals who want to play the race card.

But Cohen’s question to Hincapie came from a deep well of liberal suspicion. At base, many progressives believe that conservatives resent a black man’s presence in the White House and resent, too, the rise of minority voting power that allowed him to win the presidency twice.

They point to comments made by Republicans such as Rep. Mo Brooks Morris (Mo) Jackson BrooksHouse rejects GOP resolution to censure Waters The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Facebook - All US adults can get vaccine; decision Friday on J&J vax Republicans fret over divisive candidates MORE (R-Ala.) who earlier this year said a “war on whites” is part of a “strategy that Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaMinneapolis mayor on Floyd: 'Ultimately his life will have bettered our city' Lawmakers react to guilty verdict in Chauvin murder trial: 'Our work is far from done' Obamas praise Floyd jury, urge more action: 'We cannot rest' MORE implemented … he divides us all on race, on sex, greed, envy, class warfare, all those kinds of things.”

My Fox News colleague Sean Hannity argued to me last week that President Obama’s decisions to speak up about racial incidents from Ferguson to the Trayvon Martin case to the 2009 dispute between police and a black professor in Cambridge, Mass., have enflamed white racial anger.

Ben Carson, a black Republican who could run for president, said last week: “I actually believe that [race relations] were better before this president was elected. … Things have gotten worse because of his unusual emphasis on race.”

This debate extends into the politics of 2016. Analysis of the Democrats’ big loss in the 2014 midterms prominently features the argument that Democrats cannot continue to lose ground with white voters and expect to do well in future elections.

Sixty percent of white voters in the midterms gave their support to the GOP. In 2012, Obama lost 59 percent of white votes.

After Obama’s 2012 win, the leading conservative talk show host, Rush Limbaugh, said: “I went to bed last night thinking we’re outnumbered.” He portrayed Mitt Romney, the GOP nominee, as campaigning with a “vision of traditional America,” versus Obama’s appeal to voters “who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims…who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it.”

More recently, Limbaugh implied the first black president was allowing people with Ebola into the country because of the legacy of slavery.

Rep. Charles Rangel (D-N.Y.) said after the midterms that Republicans have become an overwhelmingly white party and “believe that slavery isn’t over and that they won the Civil War.”

That prompted South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott Timothy (Tim) Eugene ScottChauvin found guilty as nation exhales Lawmakers react to guilty verdict in Chauvin murder trial: 'Our work is far from done' Tim Scott: 'No question' Floyd jury reached 'the right verdict' MORE, a black Republican, to say Rangel was being “ridiculous.” Scott insisted that Democrats should avoid appeals to “the lowest common denominator of fear and race-bating.”

But Scott’s approach is just another version of Gowdy’s call for turning a blind eye to racial issues and the presence of a black president.

It also requires lips to be zipped about the GOP’s advocacy of new voter identification programs that disproportionately keep blacks and Latinos from voting. It turns a blind eye, too, to gerrymandered congressional districts, constructed by Republican state legislatures, to push minorities out of GOP districts.

Sen. Rand Paul Randal (Rand) Howard PaulOn The Money: Senate GOP faces post-Trump spending brawl | Senate confirms SEC chief Gensler to full five-year term | Left-leaning group raises concerns about SALT cap repeal Senate GOP faces post-Trump spending brawl 15 Senate Republicans pledge to oppose lifting earmark ban MORE (R-Ky.) is causing discomfort in his party by owning up to the GOP’s use of racial wedge issues and voter suppression. He cites this history as the reason so many minorities have a problem with the GOP brand. Colin Powell, one of the most prominent black Republicans, admits there is a “dark vein of intolerance in some parts of the party.”

Chris Rock said Obama has “figured out, and maybe a little late, that there’s some people he’s never going to get.”

Rock was alluding to white conservatives and the growing racial divide now coloring America’s national politics. The GOP is now the home of white resentment over demographic, political and economic shifts in the country.

That is not President Obama’s fault.

22006,Williams,Juan,military,"A total of 495 men and women from across America have earned an opportunity to become Air Force leaders following their selection for an officer's commission, officials announced Nov. 24. Air Force Recruiting Service officials considered 495 applications as part of the Officer Training School non-rated selection board 14OT04. With the board's selection rate of 32.53 percent, 161 applicants were selected to serve as officers. Of the 161 selected, 100 enlisted members earned the chance to attend OTS and trade their stripes for gold bars as second lieutenants. As part of the selection process, board members review both objective and subjective factors. Objectively, the board considers each applicant's academic discipline, grade point average and Air Force Officer Qualifying Test scores. Subjectively, board members evaluate work experience, accomplishments, adaptability, character, leadership ability, potential for future growth and other recommendations. For active-duty enlisted members, performance reports and commanders' recommendations are also evaluated. Three Air Force colonels review every application. The selection process is similar to an Air Force officer promotion board. No single factor leads to an individual's selection or non-selection, according to OTS selection officials. Candidates selected can expect to attend basic officer training at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama, in 2015. For more information concerning OTS and the application process, active-duty members should visit the basic officer training website on the Air Force Portal; civilians should contact the nearest Air Force recruiter.

22007,Williams,Juan,military,"Women serving in the U.S. Marine Corps and the Navy are at a higher risk of being sexually assaulted, according to a new Pentagon report.

Indeed, female Marines are at the highest risk -- almost three times as likely as their Air Force counterparts to be victims of sex crimes, according to the study, which was released Thursday and included results from the largest-ever survey of sexual assault and harassment in the military.

The presidentially mandated report estimated that 7.9 percent of female Marines and 6.5 percent of female sailors were victims of sexual assault in fiscal 2014, while 4.7 percent of female soldiers and 2.9 percent of female airmen were similarly abused.

""A significantly higher proportion of women in the Marines and Navy are estimated to have experienced sexual assault in the past year than women in other services,"" it states.

Navy Rear Adm. Richard Snyder acknowledged ""the differences in the prevalence rates between the services,"" but pointed to other survey data that show sex assaults in the service decreasing over the past two years even as more victims come forward to report such crimes.

""We're in no way declaring a victory or declaring success in our battle to prevent sexual assault,"" he said during a conference call with reporters. ""We're declaring progress.""

Overall, almost 5 percent of women and 1 percent of men in the U.S. military -- roughly 20,000 troops among an active-duty force of 1.3 million -- were estimated to be victims of ""unwanted sexual contact,"" a broad definition that includes such offenses as groping or rape, according to the document.

The figures are based on a survey conducted from Aug. 7 to Sept. 24 by Rand Corp., a nonprofit research group based in Santa Monica, California, of more than 145,000 active-duty service members, with a response rate of more than 30 percent.

""The estimated rate of sexual assault varied dramatically by gender: fewer than 1 in 100 men but approximately 1 in 20 women,"" it states.

And while there were smaller differences by branch of service, both the Marine Corps and the Navy also had the highest incidence rates by type of sexual offense.

For example, the Marine Corps had the highest level of so-called penetrative sexual assault, or rape, with an estimated 4.3 percent of women and 0.63 percent of men experiencing such crimes, according to the report.

Meanwhile, the Navy had the highest level of so-called non-penetrative sexual assault, which includes groping or touching genital areas, with an estimated 3.6 percent of women and 1 percent of men experiencing such crimes, according to the study.

""There is ... evidence of significantly higher estimated percentage of female Marines who experienced a penetrative sexual assault and male sailors who experienced a non-penetrative sexual assault, relative to members of the same genders in other services,"" it states.

Snyder said another military survey shows the rate of unwanted sexual contact among women in the service decreased from 7.2 percent in fiscal 2012 to 5.1 percent in fiscal 2014, and among men from 2.7 percent to 1.1 percent over the same period. What's more, he said, the reporting of such crimes increased from one in 17 victims in 2012 to one in five victims in 2014.

""We're going to work to continually and aggressively go after the incidents of sex assault and increase the willingness to report,"" he said. ""We'll work with the other services and organizations to [identify] best practices and look at ours as well as to make sure we're doing the best we can in prevention and response.""

The study came a day after news outlets reported that the sea service was investigating a 24-year-old male enlisted sailor who secretly videotaped some of the first female submariners while they were showering aboard the ballistic missile submarine USS Wyoming.

The release of the document coinciding with the latest in a string of high-profile involving sexual assault or harassment in the services is likely to add fuel to the debate over how to reform the military legal system to better prevent and prosecute such offenses.

The military's top brass has fiercely resisted calls from lawmakers, led by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, a Democrat from New York, to give uniformed prosecutors rather than commanders the authority to decide which cases should go to court-martial.

The estimate that almost two-thirds of victims who reported the crime to their chain of command were retaliated against ""should be a screaming red flag,"" she said in a statement in response to the report’s findings. ""Last December the President said he would give the military and previous reforms a year to work and it is clear they have failed in their mission.""

22008,Williams,Juan,military,"A Navy admiral said the allegations of a male sailor secretly videotaping female sailors aboard a ballistic missile submarine could erode the trust and confidence essential to the entire Navy.

""If that activity of one of our sailors is founded, it really erodes the trust and confidence which is essential to the whole Navy and the submarine force,"" Rear Adm. Richard Snyder, director of the 21st century sailor office, told reporters Thursday.

Snyder was addressing an ongoing Naval Criminal Investigative Service investigation of allegations that a 24-year old male sailor secretly videotaped female sailors while they were undressing and showering on the submarine – and then distributed the video.

Snyder said the fact that these allegations are coming to light at the same time the Navy was releasing its annual report on sexual assault prevention does not change the circumstances.

""I am aware of the allegations of the criminal activity regarding one of our submarines in Kings Bay. I think it leads again to the point that any alleged criminal activity regardless of the timing or the relationship to any other report is really contrary to our core values,"" he added.

The videos, reportedly recorded over a one year period, are believed to show at least three female officers while showering or undressing, according to a source who has spoken to one of the alleged victims, according to Navy Times, which first reported this story.

A Navy spokeswoman has said further service comments were unavailable, citing an ongoing investigation.

""If the allegations prove to be factual, the Navy will ensure the individuals involved are held accountable for their actions,"" said Lt. Leslie Hubbell, a spokeswoman for Submarine Group Ten, in a written statement.

Navy women began submarine training about four years ago and the service has been preparing to further integrate them on Virginia-class attack submarines. In addition, the Navy has been preparing to integrate enlisted women into submarine ranks as well.

The USS Wyoming, in service since 1996, is an Ohio-class ballistic missile submarine home ported at Kings Bay, Georgia. An Ohio-class submarine has about 140 enlisted sailors and approximately 15 officers. The Wyoming was one of the first submarines to bring women on board in 2011, adding female supply officers to the crew.

22009,Williams,Juan,military,"The Pentagon released a survey Thursday showing an eight percent increase in reported sexual assaults in the ranks while claiming overall progress in the military's efforts to curb abuses.

Despite the increase in reported assaults, the survey showed a decrease by about 27% in the number of service members who said they were victims of unwanted sexual contacts – from 26,000 in 2012 to about 19,000 las year.

However, the report also included a troubling statistic showing that 62 percent of female service members who claimed they experienced unwanted sexual contact also said that they were targets of workplace retaliation from peers.

The report overseen by DoD's Sexual Assault Prevention And Response Office (SAPRO) showed ""measurable progress,"" outgoing Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said, but ""we ultimately want a military with no more victims. We're not there yet but we'll get there.""

""We believe that our efforts to prevent sexual assault are beginning to have an impact,"" Hagel said. ""There's much more to be done,"" particularly in the area of ""removing the stigma"" from male service members who report incidents of sexual harassment and assault against them.

Of the approximately 19,000 incidents of unwanted sexual contact, 10,500 came from men, the report showed.

Hagel said he was also concerned that ""there may be an increased use of social media for sexual harassment.""

The response to the report was mixed in Congress, where Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York, is pressing a bill that would take the prosecution of sexual assault cases out of the chain of command and put in the hands of independent military lawyers.

Gillibrand charged that the data in the report showed that military leaders ""have failed in their mission"" to curb sexual assaults.

""It should be a screaming red flag to everyone when 62 percent of those who say they reported a crime were retaliated against,"" Gillibrand said in a statement.

""And let me be clear, an estimate of 20,000 cases of sexual assault and unwanted sexual contact a year in our military, or 55 cases a day, is appalling,"" Gillibrand said.

Others in Congress were generally more positive. In a statement before the report's official release, Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said that ""reporting of assaults being up and incidents of assault being down are exactly the combination we're looking for.""

Reps. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, and Niki Tsongas, D-Massachusetts, who co-chair the Military Sexual Assault Prevention Caucus, said in a joint statement: ""While these numbers continue to be concerning, the rise in reporting is a possible signal that legislative and military changes from recent years are having an encouraging impact.""

""But none of these findings obviate the simple fact that these heinous crimes continue to occur at an alarming rate, and that a majority of those who choose to report face retaliation,"" Turner and Tsongas said.

The number of cases of sexual assault or unwanted sexual contact in the military fell to an estimated 19,000 in 2014 from the estimated 26,000 two years ago, according to the survey.

At the same time, sexual assaults actually reported to military authorities rose eight percent to 5,983 during the 2014 fiscal year that ended on Sept. 30, compared to 5,518 the previous year, the report said.

""White the results and initiatives described in this report demonstrates signs of progress in the fight against sexual assault in our military, I recognize there is more work to do,"" Hagel said in a cover letter to the report, which was requested by President Obama.

The Pentagon said that the 118-page report cost $9.2 million, including $7.7 million in expenses and $1.5 million for DoD labor.

The report compiled by DoD's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (SAPRO) included a military workplace study analysis by the Rand Corp.

""The trend data suggest that fewer active-duty service women are experiencing unwanted sexual contacts and sexual harassment than was the case two yeares ago, but significant improvements over 2010 levels have not yet occurred,"" the Rand study said.

The data experiences of women with retaliation after filing a report of sexual assault or harassment with a military authority were unchanged from 2012 to 2014, Rand said.

About 62 percent of women who filed a report said they experienced ""professional retaliation, social retaliation, adverse administrative actions or punishment for violations associated with the sexual assault,"" the Rand study said.

In what was possibly his last significant act as Pentagon chief, Hagel said he was implementing several new initiatives to combat sexual assault.

He said that the Pentagon will move to adapt sexual assault prevention measures to localities to take into account community risk factors, adopt new training for supervisors and take corrective action immediately on all reports of retaliation.

22010,Williams,Juan,motorauthority,"A new James Bond movie is coming next year, and with it a brand new Aston Martin developed exclusively for the world’s most famous spy, the Aston Martin DB10. We’re not talking a regular production model but a special, limited run of 10 cars that will be used for filming of the new Bond flick, which will be called the Spectre.

MUST WATCH: Compilation Of Supercars Starting Is A Great Use Of The Internet

The new DB10 was revealed today at special event held at Pinewood Studios in the U.K. where much of the filming will take place. Daniel Craig returns to play the title role and will star alongside fellow actors Andrew Scott, Lea Seydoux, Ralph Fiennes, Monica Bellucci and Dave Bautista. Sam Mendes will serve as director for the new movie, which is due for release late next year and set to be the 24th member of the ever-growing franchise.

As for the DB10, it continues a partnership between Aston Martin and the James Bond franchise that spans 50 years. It started with the appearance of a DB5 in 1964's Goldfinger and since seen various other Astons appear on the silver screen including an original DBS, an original Vanquish and more recently the latest DBS. Though it's yet to be confirmed, there are rumors Bond may also drive a Fiat 500 in Spectre.

Though likely based on Aston Martin’s existing platform found in the latest Vantage, DB9 and Vanquish models, the DB10 is completely bespoke and features a design penned by Aston Martin’s chief designer Marek Reichman. Reichman worked closely with director Mendes to pen the car, the first of which was made by hand at Aston Martin’s Gaydon headquarters.

ALSO SEE: 27-Year-Old That Crashed McLaren P1 Had Car For Less Than 24 Hours

It’s clear the design of the DB10 is unlike any other Aston Martin; this is because it’s believed to also be a preview of the DB9 replacement due in the coming years. The lines are much sharper than on any current Aston, the headlights are grille also feature new designs, and the sides and rear portion borrow elements from this year’s DB-100 concept designed for the Gran Turismo video game series.

“In the same year that we celebrate our 50-year relationship with 007, it seems doubly fitting that today we unveiled this wonderful new sports car created especially for James Bond,” Aston Martin’s new CEO Andy Palmer said at the reveal. “To be partnering once again with EON Productions is great news for this company and for everyone around the world that loves to see Bond at the wheel of an Aston Martin.”

22012,Williams,Juan,military,"Some of the Navy's first female submariners were secretly videotaped while undressing and showering on board the USS Wyoming, a ballistic missile submarine, service officials confirmed Wednesday.

Navy officials are investigating a 24-year old male sailor who is accused of making and distributing the videos, according to a Nov. 14 incident report circulated among the service's senior leaders, according to Navy Times, which first reported the story.

The male sailor has only been identified as a second class petty officer, according to Navy Times.

The USS Wyoming, in service since 1996, is an Ohio-class ballistic missile submarine home ported at Kings Bay, Georgia. An Ohio-class submarine has about 140 enlisted sailors and approximately 15 officers. The Wyoming was one of the first submarines to bring women on board in 2011, adding female supply officers to the crew.

The videos, recorded over a one year period, are believed to show at least three female officers while showering or undressing, according to a source who has spoken to one of the alleged victims, Navy Times reported.

The Naval Criminal Investigative Service, or NCIS, is investigating the incidents in question, according to the incident report, Navy officials said.

""The Navy is aware of an allegation of alleged criminal activity onboard USS Wyoming home ported at Kings Bay. The Navy and NCIS are investigating the matter, and unfortunately further details are not available at this time due to the ongoing investigation. If the allegations prove to be factual, the Navy will ensure individuals involved are held accountable for their actions,"" said Lt. Leslie Hubbell, a spokeswoman for Submarine Group Ten, in a written statement.

The report of the investigation comes to light a day before the Pentagon has planned to release the annual sexual assault report.

Navy women began submarine training about four years ago and the service has been preparing to further integrate them on Virginia-class attack submarines. In addition, the Navy has been preparing to integrate enlisted women into submarine ranks as well.

One Navy official who did not wish to be identified expressed profound disappointment at the news.

""Incidents like this show we are not where we want to be. This is the stuff we need to flush out to make sure it doesn't happen again,"" the Navy official told Military.com.

A Navy submarine officer, who asked for his name not be published, said he was afraid something like this might occur.

""It sucks. It was bound to happen,"" he told Military.com.

22013,Williams,Juan,defensetech,"Congress has frozen the construction of several new Littoral Combat Ships until the Navy provides the House and Senate defense committees with specific analytical reports on the program, according to a newly released Congressional budget agreement.

The agreement on the National Defense Act for Fiscal Year 2015, which Congress will vote on before Christmas, emerged from conference session between House and Senate committees responsible for passing the defense budget.

Regarding the LCS, the agreement prevents the Navy from spending money toward the construction of LCS-25 or LCS-26 until certain reports are submitted by the Navy Secretary Ray Mabus.

The Congressional road block is the most recent in a string of controversies and disagreements on the LCS’s future. Many have criticized the platform on the ground that it is not lethal or survivable enough to address the current global threat environment and is poorly suited to perform its intended missions.

Proponents of the LCS have long maintained that the ship’s 40-knot speed and mission packages provide it with the requisite tools to perform its intended range of primarily littoral missions.

The Congressional agreement prevents the Navy from spending money next year on the LCS’s mission modules until the Secretary of the Navy submits a report regarding the acquisition and testing of the program. The Navy must submit goals, cost and schedule information for each increment of the LCS mission modules related to Milestone B, an acquisition developmental benchmark prior to formal procurement.

Also, the Congressional restrictions require that the director of Operational Test and Evaluation to certify the “total number for each module type that is required to perform all necessary operational testing.”

The LCS mission modules are groups of integrated technologies engineered to perform certain maritime combat functions such as surface warfare, mine-countermeasures and anti-submarine warfare. Testing and development of these mission packages has been underway for quite some time – and a combat-ready version of the surface warfare package recently left for deployment aboard the USS Fort Worth, or LCS 3.

Designed to swap on and off Freedom and Independence LCS variants, the Congressional language halts additional spending upon new mission packages until the requested reports are submitted.

The surface warfare package includes MH-60 helicopters, two 30mm guns and 11-meter RIBs, or rigid hull inflatable boats, for fast-attack, rescue or maneuver operations. Future SUW increments will also include the Fire Scout UAS for additional intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance technology. In fact, the Fire Scout UAS recently deployed aboard the USS Fort Worth.

The Navy has also been testing its Mine Countermeasures and Anti-Submarine mission packages. For instance, the LCS recently searched for submarines and sailed through a dummy mine-field off the coast of San Diego, California, to assess whether the vessel’s anti-submarine and mine-countermeasure technologies could find enemy submarines and successfully detect and destroy underwater mines, service officials said.

The anti-mine developmental and operational tests this past summer took place on board the USS Independence, or LCS 2. The tests involved many aspects of the LCS’ Mine-Countermeasures mission package, a collection of integrated mine-detecting technologies engineered to swap on and off the platform.

“The real purpose of the test was to stress the operational tempo. This is the first time we’ve really done end to end missions on the ship,” said Capt. Casey Moton, LCS mission modules program manager.

Using a suite of counter-mine technologies, the ship travelled twice through the mock-mine field, successfully detecting the mines in each instance. The test was the first time all three elements of the MCM package were integrated on-board the ship, Moton explained.

The elements consist of a Remote Mine-hunting System below the surface and an Airborne Laser Mine Detection System, or ALMDS, above the water to locate the mines alongside an Airborne Mine Neutralization System, or AMNS, designed to destroy the mines once they are found, he added.

The RMS is comprised of an AQS-20 underwater sonar mine detection system which launches from an autonomous semi-submersible called the Remote Multi-Mission Vehicle, or RMMV. The RMMV, which has both line-of-sight and over-the-horizon capability, is launched from the back of the LCS, Navy officials said.

As many as two RMMVs can operate from the LCS at one time. The RMS works in tandem with the ALMDS, an airborne laser designed to scan the surface and shallow water for mines. Data from both the RMS and ALMDS are assessed at a command center on-board the ship, he said.

The ASW mission package, slated to be operational by 2016, is earlier in its development than the other two LCS mission packages, the Surface Warfare and Mine-Countermeasures mission packages.

The technologies for the ASW package include use of an active sonar called Variable Depth Sonar deployed off the back of the ship and a passive detection system called a Multi-Function Towed Array, or MFTA.",-1,http://defensetech.org/2014/12/03/congress-places-potential-freeze-on-lcs-construction/

22015,Williams,Juan,defensetech,"China has plans to grow its navy to 351 ships by 2020 as the Chinese continue to develop their military’s ability to strike global targets, according to a new report.

The 2014 U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission recommended to Congress the U.S. Navy respond by building more ships and increase its presence in the Pacific region – a strategy they U.S. military has already started.

The commission asked Congress to increase its Pacific fleet up to 67 ships and rebalance homeports such that 60-percent of the force is based in the region by 2020.

The commissions’ recommendations, which are based on Congressional testimony, expert assessments and open-source information on China’s military and U.S.-Chinese relations, are consistent with Pentagon’s stated plans for the region.

The Navy’s intended Pacific rebalance is designed to station 60-percent of the fleet in the area, rotate more ships and sailors through Pacific ports and move Marine Corps units through Darwin, Australia. Part of the Navy’s Pacific rebalance strategy includes plans to rotate up to four Littoral Combat Ships through Singapore, among other things.

Defense analysts have questioned where the U.S. Navy has the resources and funding to expand its presence in the Pacific adequately enough to meet the emerging Chinese threat. Critics point to the sweeping sequestration cuts as an example of the budgetary challenges that U.S. Navy officials face.

Opponents to this strategy point out that the U.S. has 11 aircraft carriers, the Chinese have one. And that one carrier still lacks an aircraft wing capable of operating off a carrier deck.

The commission cites a platforms and weapons systems the Chinese are developing, which change the strategic calculus regarding how U.S. carriers and surface ships might need to operate in the region. The report mentions the Chinese DF-21D, a precision-guided, land-launched anti-ship ballistic missile designed to reach surface targets at ranges greater than 900 nautical miles.

“China is pursuing a missile-centric strategy with the purpose of holding U.S. aircraft carriers at high risk if they operate in China’s near seas and thereby hinder their access to those waters in the event of a crisis. Given China’s growing navy and the U.S. Navy’s planned decline in the size of its fleet, the balance of power and presence in the region is shifting in China’s favor,” the commission states.

While the commission says the exact amount of Chinese military spending is difficult to identify, China’s projected defense spending for 2014 is cited at $131 billion, approximately 12.2 percent greater than 2013. This figure is about the sixth of what the U.S. spends annually.

The Chinese defense budget has increased by double digits since 1989, the commission states resulting in annual defense spending doubling since 2008, according to the report.

Rep. Randy Forbes, R-Virginia, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee Seapower and Projection Forces subcommittee, cited the increase in submarine and surface navy patrols tripling since 2007 as an area of concern.

“What they are doing with patrols is just the tip of the iceberg. It is not just the number of the ships, but within five to eight years they will have about 82 submarines in the Asia Pacific area and we will have about 32 to 34,” he said.

“If you look at where we are today, they outnumber us about 60 to 32 in subs. If you look at their surface ships they can get us further out with their anti-ship missiles than we can hit them,” Forbes said.

The Chinese have used cyber espionage of the U.S. military to boost their weapons development programs, the report said. In particular, the review cited a 2012 Defense Science Board report which explains how Chinese cyber spying resulted in their learning details on a number of U.S. systems such as the Littoral Combat Ship, F-35, FA/18, Black Hawk helicopter, Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense, Patriot and Global Hawk.

Chinese Naval Power

While Chinese naval technology may still be substantially behind current U.S. platforms, the equation could change dramatically over the next several decades because the Chinese are reportedly working on a handful of high-tech next-generation ships, weapons and naval platforms.

These include the LUYANG III, a new class of Chinese destroyer slated to enter the fleet this year. The ship is being engineered with vertically-launched, long-range anti-ship cruise missiles, the commission said. The new destroyer will carry an extended-range variant of the HHQ-9 surface-to-air missile, among other weapons, the report says.

Furthermore, the Chinese may already be beginning construction on several of their own indigenous aircraft carriers. China currently has one carrier, the Ukranian-built Liaoning. It is not expected to have an operational carrier air wing until at least 2016, according to the report.

The Chinese are currently testing and developing a new, carrier-based fighter aircraft called the J-15.

Regarding amphibious assault ships, the Chinese are planning to add several more YUZHAO LPDs, amphibs which can carry 800 troops, four helicopters and up to 20 armored vehicles, the report said.

The Chinese are also working on development of a new Type 055 cruiser equipped with land-attack missiles, lasers and rail-gun weapons, according to the review.

“They are becoming a blue-water Navy,” said Larry Wortzel, a commissioner tasked with helping to oversee the compilation and publication of the annual review.

China’s surface fleet is also bolstered by production of at least 60 smaller, fast-moving HOBEI-glass guided missile patrol boats and ongoing deliveries of JIANGDAO light frigates armed with naval guns, torpedoes and anti-ship cruise missiles.

The commission also says Chinese modernization plans call for a sharp increase in attack submarines, nuclear-armed submarines or SSBNs. Chinese SSBNs are now able to patrol with nuclear-armed JL-2 missiles able to strike targets more than 4,500 nautical miles.

The Chinese are currently working on a new, modernized SSBN platform as well as a long-range missile, the JL-3, the commission says.

The commission also specifically addresses areas of Chinese-Russian military developmental cooperation, saying the two countries are working on a joint deal to build new attack submarines.

“China is pursuing joint-design and production of four to six Russian advanced diesel-electric attack submarines containing Russia’s latest submarine sonar, propulsion, and quieting technology. The deal would improve the PLA Navy’s capabilities and assist China’s development of quiet submarines, thus complicating future U.S. efforts to track and counter PLA submarines,” the commission writes.

In addition, China is reportedly pursuing a new class of nuclear submarines, called the Type 095 SSGN, which could bring the country its first-ever submarine-launched, land-attack cruise missile.",-1,http://defensetech.org/2014/12/03/report-chinese-navys-fleet-will-outnumber-u-s-by-2020/
22016,Williams,Juan,military,"Service members next year will be paying more for prescriptions bought off base, getting less of a housing subsidy and a picking up a smaller pay raise under an agreement reached between Senate and House lawmakers.

The deal between the Senate and House armed services committees on the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act is bound to draw criticism from military associations and veterans' service groups, which lobby Congress on behalf of service members' pay and benefits.

The bill that will go before the full Senate and House includes higher co-pays for prescriptions filled at off-base pharmacies, a curb on basic allowances for housing – BAH – by 1 percent next year, and rolling back the statutory 1.8 percent troop pay raise to 1 percent, first reported by Military Times.

Though the Pentagon got what it wanted in terms of the smaller pay raise, the cuts it wanted to BAH spending and the increases it wanted for prescription drug co-pays were more than what lawmakers agreed to. The Defense Department originally asked for a 5 percent reduction to BAH over three years and a $30 increase in drug fees over a decade.

The pay and benefit cuts are included in the overall $521 billion budget package. In addition, the NDAA includes $64 billion for the overseas contingency fund – the budget for U.S. combat operations.

Military and veterans groups have insisted that the budget should not include pay and benefit cuts to service members.

""The losers in this compromise are once again the troops and their families,"" Veterans of Foreign Wars spokesman Joe Davis said on Tuesday. ""Congress should wait until after the ongoing Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission puts all of its cards on the table in their February report. ""

Norb Ryan, president of Military Officers Association of America, told Military.com last month that service members are being unfairly targeted in the Pentagon's drive to cut spending.

""They think we have to fund readiness by taking the money away from the people who are being asked to do more and more,"" he said.

Officials with Keep Your Promise, a group that lobbies for military pay and benefit protections, agreed.

""Congress forgot, in their haste to pass a bill, that they promised not to balance the budget on the backs of our military,"" said Lori Volkman, a spokesman for the group. ""We're asking why we have to continue to sacrifice, when some military families are already living in poverty. Military families should be the last to experience cuts.""

In August, the American Legion passed a resolution at their national convention opposing any increases in Tricare costs, which would include the roughly $3 increase for prescriptions agreed to between the House and Senate panels.

The increase would go into effect in January for all prescriptions except mail-order generic drugs, the paper reported.

National Commander Michael D. Helm also criticized plans to roll back the expected 1.8 percent pay increase to 1 percent.

""With a war in Afghanistan, boots back on the ground in Iraq, and ISIS on the loose in the Middle East, is a 1-percent salary raise really the best we can do for the men and women we expect to meet those challenges?"" he said in September.

The House panel's version of the 2015 defense budget includes no reductions in benefits but is silent on scaling back the pay increase – suggesting lawmakers' sympathy with the Pentagon's argument that personnel costs are consuming ever higher portions of the defense budget.

The House version gives President Barack Obama the authority to set the 2015 raise at 1 percent, which he has vowed to do.

Defense Department officials have been pushing for the cuts, saying they are needed to reign in personnel spending. Personnel costs are currently budgeted at $177 billion for 2015, or more than a third of the Pentagon's non-war budget of $496 billion.

Personnel costs are nearly half the department's non-war budget when civilian personnel are factored in, the Pentagon says.

In early November, the Congressional Budget Office reported that the Pentagon's base budget climbed from $384 billion in 2000 to $502 billion in fiscal 2014, in inflation-adjusted terms. The CBO also pegged ""the largest rate of growth"" to personnel costs, which increased by 46 percent over the 14 year period.

22019,Williams,Juan,defensetech,"Navy researchers have developed new simulation and training programs to help all Defense Department pilots avoid two potentially fatal spatial misperceptions during nighttime landings and in flight.

Spatial disorientation is the leading aeromedical cause of Class A mishaps not only throughout DoD aviation, but in commercial flying as well, Navy officials said in a report published this month in Naval Medical and Research Development News.

Henry P. Williams, a researcher with the Naval Medical Research Unit-Dayton, at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, who reported on the programs, said they have been forwarded to the Naval Survival Training Institute in Pensacola, Florida.

The phenomena include Black Hole Illusion, or BHI – when a pilot on a nighttime runway approach in a poorly lit area perceives he is higher than he should be and descends to a lower approach.

“If unlit high terrain or obstacles are near the approach path the results can be fatal,” Henry P. Williams, a researcher with the Naval Medical Research Unit-Dayton, at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, reported.

The unit tested a team of 38 pilots in day- and nighttime simulation landings, finding that they all flew near perfect approaching in the daylight. But 92 percent made “significantly low BHI approaches” in the nighttime simulation, the report said. On average, they were 148 feet too low when 1.5 nautical miles from the runaway, it said.

But after viewing a training video on BHI the pilots were, on average, just three feet too low at the same distance from the runway.

Another spatial disorientation problem tackled in the same study was Control Reversal Error, or CRE, which occurs when pilots lose visuals on a lead aircraft while making turns – as will happen flying into clouds, Williams reported.

When that happens pilots swap over to instrument control to recover from the turn, but in nearly a quarter of the cases pilots turned in the wrong direction and steepened the angle of bank, researchers found.

“This error can be extremely dangerous in actual instrument flight, leading to incapacitating [spatial disorientation] and a fatal departure from controlled flight,” Williams said.",-1,http://defensetech.org/2014/12/01/24172/
22020,Williams,Juan,military,"An F-16 pilot was killed late Sunday when the Air Force jet crashed shortly after takeoff from a Middle East airbase on an airstrike mission against ISIS, Pentagon officials said Monday.

The death of the pilot, whose name was withheld until his family could be notified, was the first involving a fixed-wing aircraft since the air campaign against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria began on Aug. 8, said Col. Steve Warren, a Pentagon spokesman.

The crash occurred at about 11 p.m. EST Sunday as the pilot attempted to return to the airbase, which the Pentagon declined to identify because of the ""political sensitivities"" of the host nation.

However, numerous published reports and official statements have made it well known that the U.S. is using airbases at al-Udeid in Qatar, which also serves as a headquarters for U.S. Central Command in the region, and at al-Dhafra in the United Arab Emirates in support of Operation Inherent Resolve.

Warren said that the aircraft experienced ""maintenance problems"" shortly after takeoff on a combat mission against ISIS and was attempting to return to base when it crashed. The pilot did not eject and it was not immediately known if the pilot attempted to eject, Warren said.

First responders were still at the scene and the cause of the incident was under investigation, Warren said.

The death of the pilot was not the first related to Operation Inherent Resolve. In October, a Marine corporal was killed in an accident involving at an MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft operating off a ship involved in Operation Inherent Resolve.

A Marine lance corporal was also killed in a non-combat incident in Baghdad in late October.

22021,Williams,Juan,thehill,"The 2014 winner of my annual award for “Member of Congress of the Year” goes to the politician who had such a good year she now defines her party’s future — Sen. Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth WarrenLawmakers react to guilty verdict in Chauvin murder trial: 'Our work is far from done' World passes 3 million coronavirus deaths Poll: 56 percent say wealth tax is part of solution to inequality MORE (D-Mass.).

Warren faced some serious competition. Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) had a very good year, easily winning what once looked like a tough reelection race. He is now set to become Senate majority leader. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) had a good year, too, arguably rising to be the GOP’s top contender for the party’s presidential nomination. But Warren is a different, bigger story.

The Massachusetts senator could become the Barack Obama of 2016, able to grab the Democrats’ presidential nomination from the favorite, Hillary Clinton, by coming at her from the left. The defining issue for Democrats in 2008 was Iraq. In 2016 it will be the economy. Warren is much more in step with the party on this issue than is Clinton.

Warren’s economic populism also defines the party’s present. After losses in the midterms, the Democrats have concluded that it is time for them to go on offense, utilizing Warren’s issues — raising the minimum wage, cutting better deals on student loans and supporting equal pay for women.

The new political direction set by Warren led Senate Democrats to add the first-term senator to their leadership team. They created a position just for her: “Strategic Policy Adviser to the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee.”

That means Warren will be at the table shaping the identity of Democrats in the Senate, as they become a loud, defiant minority beginning in January.

But Warren looms largest over the 2016 race.

Democratic strategists are openly worried that with President Obama leaving the stage, the base of their party — women, unions, young people and racial minorities — will lose interest in politics and splinter. That could allow a unified GOP to retake the White House. Warren’s focus on economic inequality is proving to be the glue holding the Democrats together.

Warren’s surprising power is evident in her ability to force Clinton, the former senator from Wall Street’s home state and a well-paid speaker for top brokerages, to go on the attack against income inequality.

“I love watching Elizabeth give it to those who deserve to get it,” she said at a late October rally in Boston. Clinton was referring to Warren’s calls for increased regulation of big banks and Wall Street brokers who have “tried to trick and trap and cheat our families.” Clinton also echoed Warren’s rhetoric when she said at the same rally: “Don’t let anybody tell you that, you know, it’s corporations and businesses that create jobs.”

Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) struck a Warren-like note last week, when he said the Democrats lost the midterms because they spent too much time on the healthcare law when they should have been working on improving the economy for the middle class.

The resonance of Warren’s economic populist agenda was evident in a recent NBC-Wall Street Journal poll. It found 56 percent of Americans agree with the statement: “The economic and political systems in the country are stacked against people like me.” Twelve years ago, only 34 percent of Americans agreed with that statement.

In the current Real Clear Politics average of polls asking Democrats to select their top choice as the party’s 2016 presidential nominee, Warren is running second. And she trails Clinton by a huge margin, 51 percentage points.

But a poll taken this month by the progressive group Democracy for America found Warren to be the most popular choice for party activists asked whom they wanted to see run. Warren drew 42 percent support, overshadowing Sen. Bernie Sanders’s (I-Vt.) 24 percent and Clinton’s 23 percent.

Warren also gave the political speech of the year. At the liberal Netroots Convention, she defined the values and specific issues that electrify and unite Democrats and that draw swing voters.

“These are American values,” she said, “and these are the values we are willing to fight for. … Wall Street needs stronger rules and tougher enforcement. … We believe in science and that means that we have a responsibility to protect the earth. … We believe no one should work full time and still live in poverty. That means raising the minimum wage. And we will fight for it …

“We believe that students are entitled to get an education without being crushed by debt. And we are willing to fight for it,” Warren continued as the cheering grew and grew. “We believe that, after a lifetime of work, people are entitled to retire with dignity, and that means protecting Social Security, Medicare and pensions. … We believe – only I can’t believe I have to say this in 2014 – we believe in equal pay for equal work, and we are willing to fight for it.”

Warren also backed immigration reform.

People whom this column has previously chosen as the Member of Congress of the Year have wrought big changes: Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Rep. Luis Gutiérrez (D-Ill.) on immigration, and Sen. Jeff Merkley (D- Ore .) on Senate rules.

Warren fits the mold as a game changer.

22022,Williams,Juan,military,"Female soldiers hoping to attend the first-ever, co-ed class of U.S. Army Ranger School have a much better chance of completing the grueling, two-month course if they prepare for what faces them in the first week, according to Ranger School officials.

Ranger School is a punishing ordeal designed to push combat leaders, both officers and sergeants, to their mental and physical limits. About half of all candidates fail to earn the coveted, gold and black Ranger tab.

In January, Army Secretary John McHugh and Chief of Staff Gen. Raymond Odierno are expected to make a decision whether to allow females to attend the historically male-only, infantry course.

If approved, the Ranger Course Assessment will be open to all women in the grades E-4 through O-4 whose end term of service, or ETS, is no earlier than Oct. 1, 2016.

The effort is a result of former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta’s January 2013 directive that all services open combat-arms roles to women that so far have been reserved for men. The services have until 2016 to make this happen.

Like male candidates, female Ranger School students will have to spend long hours training to prepare for weeks they will spend weighted down with infantry weapons and equipment on patrols through the thick forests of Fort Benning, Georgia, and the dense swamps of Camp Rudder, Florida.

They’ll also be expected to climb and rappel in the steep mountain terrain of Camp Merrill near Dahlonega, Georgia.

Ranger School candidates have to endure these challenges on two meals a day while getting three to four hours of sleep a night for eight weeks.

“It is a tough and demanding course,” said Col. David Fivecoat, commander of the Airborne and Ranger Training Brigade at Benning. “The graduation rate for 2013 was a 45-percent grad rate.”

“In the summer the guys are wet all the time; in the winter they’re cold all the time,” he said. “The toughest part is having that mental strength, mental toughness to persevere in this over a period of 62 days.”

RAP Week

But the challenge that “overwhelmingly” eliminates most Ranger School candidates occurs on the first day of the week-long Ranger Assessment Phase, Fivecoat said.

“We lose the bulk of our students the first week when they show up to Ranger School,” he said. “The number one obstacle that causes Ranger students to fail is the Ranger Physical Fitness Assessment on the first day.”

Students must perform 49 push-ups in two minutes and 59 sit-ups in two minutes. They have to run five miles in 40 minutes and do six chin-ups.

Many soldiers can do 49 push-ups, but they have to perform them to standard, Fivecoat said.

“We had a class in November that had 406 students show up, and we dropped 91 students for various physical fitness events that day,” he said.

In both the Army and the Marine Corps, the big question has focused on physical standards -- will the services have to lower the physical standards required for infantry and other combat-arms training for women to be successful in these jobs?

Like the Marine Corps infantry training courses, Ranger School standards “are going to stay the same,” Fivecoat said. “We have definitive standards that we apply to every Ranger student; if they can meet them, they will be successful.”

If students pass the fitness assessment, their next challenge on the first day will be the combat water survival assessment.

The CWSA “consists of a log walk and rope drop where they have to scale a ladder 30 feet above the pond, walk across a beam, up some stairs, down some stairs and they end up at a rope,” Fivecoat said. “They have to shimmy out onto the rope and do a pull-up, and they have to ask permission to drop into the pond. They drop into the pond and they move to the side.

“Then they are given the swim test portion where they enter the lake, shed their [fighting load carrier] and rifle without panic and swim 15 meters … without panic to demonstrate their ability to swim to safety should they get into a position where they are in over their head in the swamps of Florida or anywhere else during training.”

The second morning begins with a 10-kilometer, land navigation course. Students have to find four out of five points in five hours – 2.5 hours in the dark and 2.5 hours during daylight.

Students who fail course can retest on the following day. Following the land-nav course, students spend the rest of the afternoon crawling through the mud and negotiating other challenges on the Malvesti obstacle course.

The last hurdle of RAP is a 12-mile road march students must complete in less than three hours, carrying a rifle, fighting load carrier vest and a rucksack weighing approximately 43 pounds.

The week-long Ranger Assessment Phase accounts for about 40 percent of the students who fail to make it through the course. Another 15 percent of students fail to complete the course because of injuries and poor performance.

“After that you are at day five, so you’ve got 57 more days to go,” Fivecoat said.

Shouldering Heavy Loads

Students spend about half of Ranger School living in the field. In addition to food, water and individual gear, candidates have to carry all the items found in a normal infantry platoon including M240 machine guns, litters, radios and extra batteries.

“The lightest guy carries about 80 pounds … that’s a student with an M4 carbine,” Fivecoat said. The load goes up when students take turns carrying heavier items such as the M240, which weighs 27.6 pounds. One hundred-round belts of blank, 7.62mm ammunition weigh five pounds each.

Students will set into patrol bases, receive missions, plan them and move seven to 10 kilometers a night to attack their objectives. The amount of time it takes to cover this distance through the woods depends on the students’ navigation skills, Fivecoat said.

“The most essential guy in Ranger School at night is the compass guy that can get you to where you are going without a lot of excess movement,” he said. “The really good platoons spend a lot less time carrying the stuff because they figure out who their good compass guys is.”

Through this time, limited rations can take a toll on students.

“The Rangers are losing weight,” Fivecoat said. “The average Ranger loses about 10 to 15 percent of his body weight from the beginning of the course to the end.” But it’s not all about physical endurance. Students have to pass a certain number of graded patrols in each phase. They also have to pass a review from their Ranger peers, Fivecoat said.

Female Interest

The Army would not be the first service to open one its most prestigious combat schools to women. The Marine Corps in 2012 allowed women to attend the enlisted and officer infantry training courses.

In November 2013, three female Marines made history when they became the first women to graduate from the Marine Corps Infantry Training Battalion Course. Since then approximately 100 females have graduated from the course, according to a Marine officer familiar with the effort.

Despite the milestone, no female Marine officers have made it through the Infantry Officer Course. IOC is a demanding 13-week school that historically averages a 25-percent attrition rate for male Marines.

The Marine Corps recently launched a year-long experiment at Camp Lejeune, N.C., to evaluate how women perform in physically-demanding jobs such as the infantry.

The goal of the experiment is to try to determine what type of physiological profile women need to have to succeed under the current, training standards associated with direct-combat related jobs, the Marine officer said.

To help prepare students, Ranger School offers training resources on the web such as the “30-60-90 day PT plan,” Fivecoat said.

Army units also run pre-Ranger training courses for to improve their soldiers’ chances of earning the Ranger tab.

Service officials have hinted that the number of women actually interested in applying for direct-combat related assignments will be relatively small.

Fivecoat, however, said he has seen no shortage of women willing to go through Ranger School.

“There is lots of interest out there,” he said.

22023,Williams,Juan,military,"Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel's unexpected resignation on Monday drew words of consternation and praises from veterans groups and even from lawmakers who two years ago took the shots at him during his confirmation hearing.

Hagel resigned amid reports of his ""frustration"" with the administration on the strategy for Iraq and Syria, though some media reports quoting unnamed White House sources said President Obama had lost confidence in Hagel's execution of the campaign against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria.

""We were caught as flatfooted as everyone else,"" said Rick Weidman, executive director for policy and government affairs at Vietnam Veterans of America, a group born out of the war Hagel fought as a sergeant 46 years ago. ""Chuck Hagel is an extraordinarily decent man and he has rendered extraordinary service.""

One of his troop- and veteran-oriented moves will be made shortly, before he leaves, Weidman said.

""Before he leaves he's going to be signing an order ... opening up the bases to veterans' service organizations and military service organizations,"" Weidman said. This will permit group members to meet with hospitalized troops and with those close to separating in order to assist them with whatever needs they have.

Poll: What do you think of Secretary Hagel's resignation?

Retired Vice Adm. Norb Ryan, president of Military Officers Association of America, praised Hagel for unwavering commitment and compassion for service members, their families and veterans.

""I have the highest regard for Secretary Hagel,"" Ryan said. ""The secretary really gets it. He knows the challenges faced by our troops and their families and truly understands their concerns.""

Ryan said Hagel met regularly with the veterans groups – as much as six times in the last 20 months.

Weidman said that kind of contact was unprecedented, with past secretaries limiting such contact to an annual photo op at the Pentagon around Memorial Day.

""Then we'd get blown off. It was very different under Hagel ... Was he perfect? No. But it's hard to judge from where we sit.""

Some veterans groups offered a lowkey response to Hagel's departure.

Veterans of Foreign Wars National Commander John Stroud said the group ""salute[s] his service, his sacrifice, and his personal commitment to keeping America safe, as well as the close, unprecedented working relationship he built between the Pentagon and the VFW. His leadership and his presence will be missed.""

Verna Jones, executive director of The American Legion in Washington, DC, said Hagel had always been a true friend to the group.

""We appreciate his tremendous leadership at the Pentagon during a time of tough transition,"" Jones said in a statement. ""The Legion wishes Secretary Hagel Godspeed in his next endeavor, and we look forward to working with his successor to ensuring a strong national defense.""

Some the strongest words of praise for Hagel came from Sens. John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, lawmakers who hit him hard during his confirmation in early 2013.

McCain pressed Hagel repeatedly to accept that the ""surge"" of U.S. forces in Iraq in 2007 – which Hagel had criticized – was a good move and successful. McCain demanded a yes or no answer. Hagel refused to provide the simple answer but also was not able to give McCain an answer he would accept.

Graham suggested that Hagel was anti-Israel, and that ""the Jewish lobby"" in American intimidated Congess and made them do ""dumb things.""

Hagel refused to name a single senator who was intimidated by the Isreali lobby, and said he could not think of anything ""dumb"" Congress had done in order to accommodate the lobby. He also apologized for using the phrase ""Jewish lobby"" instead of ""Israel lobby.""

Hagel's performance was widely seen as weak and defensive throughout.

But with his resignation to the White House both McCain and Graham praised Hagel for his patriotism and dedication to service members and said problems with the Defense Department rest with Obama, not the secretary.

The lawmakers also said out that on the matter of ISIS Hagel's position regarding the U.S. role in the region more lined up with their own than with the President's.

""I know that Chuck was frustrated with aspects of the administration's national security policy and decision-making process,"" McCain said, noting that former Defense Secetaries Leon Panetta and Robert Gates both criticized the Obama White House's micromanagement of combat operations.

Graham said responsibility for the loss of large swathes of Iraq and Syria to ISIS forces does not rest with Hagel.

""Whether it was leaving a residual force behind in Iraq or assisting the Free Syrian Army at a time when it would have been most beneficial, our failing strategies in Iraq and Syria are President Obama's fault,"" Graham said.

Whatever Hagel's actions on personnel. or his views on how to deal with ISIS, he did little or nothing to fix chronic budgetary problems at the Pentagon, according to longtime Defense watchers Franklin ""Chuck"" Spinney, a retired analyst with DoD program analysis and evaluation, and Winslow Wheeler, a longtime Senate staffer who now directs the Straus Military Reform Project for the Project on Government Oversight.

""It's not at all surprising and it's not disappointing"" that Hagel is out, Wheeler said. ""He didn't do anyting. We knew he wouldn't do anything from the get-go, given his performance at his confirmation hearing.""

Wheeler, who wrote at the time that Hagel's question and answer session with the Senate Armed Services Committee was disappointing, said he ""was an empty shell [then] and nothing he has done since then shows him to be any more than that now.""

""He refused to stand up to bullying [at his confirmation hearing],"" Wheeler said. ""He showed a complete lack of spine. I don't know if it was a question of intellect, also, but he was a cipher as secretary of defense.""

Spinney said Hagel did nothing to reign in Pentagon spending, last year presenting a Strategic Choices and Management Review and a Quadrennial Defense Review using projections that had no basis in reality.

""He never came up with a plan to cut the budget,"" Spinney said. ""My guess is he couldn't come up with a way to do it.""

At a time when the Pentagon is supposed to be looking at mandated sequester cuts, Hagel is working with a military claiming to need nuclear modernization, a new bomber, missile and submarine, new Army vehicles, replacements for the Aegis cruisers and more.

""Hagel didn't do a thing,"" Spinney said.

22025,Williams,Juan,defensetech,"Over the next decade, the Pentagon plans to launch satellites that offer a revolutionary leap in surveillance technology by persistently staring at targets from space for long periods of time, an official said.

Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence Michael Vickers gave the estimate at a defense conference this week in Washington, D.C.

The Defense Department is at a “pivotal moment for intelligence” due to the rapid technological and geopolitical change underway throughout the world, he said. Adapting to the environment requires both short- and long-term investments, he said.

“In each of these areas, we’re trying to make some fundamental leaps,” Vickers said. “So, for example, in the global coverage area, for the first time, we’re trying to create really persistent surveillance from space, rather than having episodic surveillance, actually be able to stare at areas for real long periods of time and improve the resiliency and the integration of our architecture.

“Those will be really, really big things when they’re realized,” he added. “It will be a leap in overhead reconnaissance commensurate to anything we’ve done in the last 50 years or so, but they’ll take a decade-plus to realize.”

Vickers didn’t specify any programs.

The Air Force’s current Space Base Infrared System, known as SBIRS, and legacy Defense Support Program, or DSP, satellites support the Overhead Persistent Infrared Technology mission in such areas as missile warning, missile defense, technical intelligence and battlespace awareness, according to a Government Accountability Office report from January.

The service’s Commercially Hosted Infrared Payload, or CHIRP, demonstration sensor employed a wide field-of-view staring technology — which provided insight into the applicability for the mission area, the document states.

During the past decade of U.S.-led wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Pentagon was forced to turn to the private sector and rent bandwidth on commercial satellites because its own networks couldn’t meet the constant demand from commanders for video and other data captured by drones flying over the battlefield.",-1,http://defensetech.org/2014/11/21/pentagon-satellites-to-persistently-stare-at-targets-in-10-years/
22026,Williams,Juan,defensetech,"The Navy is beginning to work on a a next-generation carrier-launched fighter jet to replace the existing F/A-18 Super Hornet and Growler aircraft by 2030 and supplement the F-35C the Pentagon is still developing, service officials said.

The Navy effort, called the F/A-XX study, includes early work on the desired technological capabilities for the new aircraft. The idea is to have a new aircraft ready and producible by the time existing F/A-18s reach their end-of-service dates. Navy officials emphasize that the early work is in the very early stages and purely a conceptual effort to explore alternatives.

The Navy is analyzing industry proposals on the F/A-XX it started collecting two years ago. Navy officials are trying to pick out what they like and study potential ideas.

This effort is going on as the Navy considers various upgrades of the existing inventory of F/A-18s in order to extend its service life well into and beyond the 2030s. Nevertheless, unless more aircraft such as Growlers are purchased for future production, Boeing’s domestic production of the F/A-18 will come to an end in the next several years.

Meanwhile, these early F/A-XX efforts are going on while the service vigorously pursues ongoing developmental testing of its F-35C, slated to be ready by 2018.

Navy officials did say the platform would be a sixth-generation fighter but emphasized that service experts were reluctant to talk about the new aircraft because so much has yet to be determined and the project was still in the very early stages.

Meanwhile, exactly how long the F/A-18 will fly remains somewhat of an open question. At a certain point the aircraft will eventually need to be replaced, however the Navy is still interested in acquiring more Growler electronic jamming aircraft and continues to upgrade the F/A-18 platform.

There are near term efforts such as the ongoing initiative to outfit 170 F/A-18E/F Block II fighter jets with a next-generation infrared sensor designed to locate air-to-air target in a high-threat electronic attack environment.

Infrared search and track, or IRST, system, is a long range sensor that searches for and detect infrared emissions, Navy officials said. Slated to be operational by 2017, the system can simultaneously track multiple targets and provide a highly effective air-to-air targeting capability.

While the Navy is making progress with existing modifications to the platform, the service is also looking into slightly longer-term anti-surface-warfare upgrades to the aircraft such as improving the active electronically scanned array radar and forward looking infrared radar technologies such as IRST, Navy officials said.

Alongside upgrades to the platform that are already underway such as targeting improvements and experimentation with conformal fuel tanks and an external weapons pod, the Navy is investing research dollars into upgrading the plane’s sensors, radar and computer systems, Capt. Frank Morley, program manager for the F/A-18 and EA-18G Growler aircraft told Military.com in an interview last summer.

One analyst said if Navy F/A-XX developers seek to engineer a sixth-generation aircraft, they will likely explore a range of next-generation technologies such as maximum sensor connectivity, super cruise ability and an aircraft with electronically configured “smart skins.”

Maximum connectivity would mean massively increased communications and sensor technology such as having an ability to achieve real-time connectivity with satellites, other aircraft and anything that could provide relevant battlefield information, said Richard Aboulafia, vice-president of analysis at the Teal Group, a Va.-based consultancy.

Hypersonic Scramjets

The new aircraft might also seek to develop the ability to fire hypersonic weapons, however such a development would hinge upon successful progress with yet-to-be-proven technologies such as scramjets, Aboulafia added.

Super cruise technology would enable the new fighter jet to cruise at supersonic speeds without needing afterburner, he explained.

Smart aircraft skins would involve dispersing certain technologies or sensors across the fuselage and further integrating them into the aircraft itself, Aboulafia said.

‘Smart skins with distributed electronics means that instead of having systems mounted on the aircraft, you would have apertures integrated on the skin of the aircraft,” he said.

This could reduce drag, increase speed and maneuverability while increasing the technological ability of the sensors.

Finally, Aboulafia said the Navy may be interested in developing a super-capable air-dominance or air-to-air fighter capability as a new, next-generation aircraft to replace the F-14 Tomcat – an aircraft known for its air-to-air fighter capability.

Navy officials said the F/A-18 is the current replacement for the F-14 Tomcat.

Also, about 20 years ago the Navy was interested in acquiring a Navy variant of the F-22 through what was called the Naval Advanced Tactical Fighter program, Aboulafia explained. This effort never came to fruition, leaving the Navy without a fifth-generation air-dominance platform, Aboulafia said.

While the Navy’s F-35C is engineered for strike missions, next-generation sensor fusion, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance and air-to-air combat, experts maintain it does not have the fifth-generation air-to-air dominance and speed of the F-22. Nevertheless, Navy officials emphasize that the now-in-development F-35C is the service’s fifth-generation platform.",-1,http://defensetech.org/2014/11/20/navy-plans-for-fighter-to-replace-the-fa-18-hornet-in-2030s/
22027,Williams,Juan,military,"The Defense Department is poised to announce the shuttering of Fort Campbell, Kentucky's, 159th Combat Aviation Brigade, according to Congress.

The long anticipated closing means Fort Campbell will lose about 2,400 soldiers.

""We are deeply disappointed by the Obama administration's decision to remove the 159th CAB from Fort Campbell,"" Kentucky Sens. Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul, and Rep. Ed Whitfield said in a joint statement. ""It is bad news for our nation's security and for the local Fort Campbell community.""

Fort Campbell leadership confirmed the news.

""The inactivation of this unit is derived from the Army's aviation restructure initiative,"" post leaders said in a statement. ""Locally, this means Fort Campbell will lose slightly more than 2,400 soldiers, as well as aviation assets which include aircraft and equipment. The personnel loss figure becomes more dramatic when family members are included. Dependent figures at this time are roughly 3,800.""

The news does not come as any surprise to members of the 159th.

""We knew it was possibly coming, I kept hoping it wouldn't, though,"" Stephanie Sparks, an Army wife who said her husband was in the unit, wrote on a Fort Campbell-based Facebook page. ""We have just been here six months.""

The decision also means the end of Fort Campbell's 101st Airborne Division's distinction as the only Army Division with two combat aviation brigades. The 101st Combat Aviation Brigade is also housed on Fort Campbell.

The decision to shut down the 159th is likely the direct result of a plan to retire the Kiowa helicopter. Army leaders had planned to replace the Armed Aerial Scout program, but have since canceled the program because of the Army's shrinking budget.

The cuts are part of a larger restructuring plan, forced in part by budget cuts and sequestration. The Army is expected to shed about 69,000 soldiers by the end of the drawdown.

McConnell, Paul and Whitfield renewed their concerns that those troop cuts would cause future problems.

""We believe that cuts need to be made in places other than deployable troops as a means to make smart cuts to government spending,"" the lawmakers said. ""We also must not allow our number of troops to fall to the dangerously low levels being sought by the Obama Administration, especially at a time of increasing instability in the world.""

22028,Williams,Juan,military,"It may take several years for the Navy's new plan for shorter and more predictable deployments to take effect as the service adjusts to new conflicts in Iraq and Syria, service officials said.

The Navy is making substantial progress with the new plan to provide sailors with more predictable deployment schedules as a way to improve training and maintenance and attract and retain potential recruits, senior service leaders said Wednesday at the 2014 Defense One Summit in Washington D.C.

The Navy's support for the ongoing ground war in Afghanistan, coupled with the training and air war campaign over Iraq and Syria against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria has led to lengthy deployments and consistent schedule changes.

""During the last five years, the most difficult issue has been the predictability of deployments. Not only their length but when they end. The lack of predictability affects sailors' planning, families and their time off,"" said Vice Adm. Bill Moran, head of Navy personnel.

Adding predictability is part of a larger effort to help the Navy recruit high quality sailors. The service has even discussed allowing sailors to vary their time at sea or at home, even allowing them to temporarily leave the Navy to start a family or pursue a private sector experience before again returning to service, Moran said.

Slated to formally begin in 2015 with the scheduled deployment of the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower carrier strike group from Norfolk, Va., the new plan aims to add predictability to deployment dates and shorten the current eight and nine month deployments to seven months, service officials said.

""We are already starting with the Eisenhower strike group right now. Our deployments and our work-up cycle will be much more predictable,"" Moran added.

The effort, referred to as the Optimized Fleet Response Plan, is now underway with Fleet Forces in Norfolk, Virginia, and Pacific Fleet – the organizations which handle force generation and the preparation and deployment of naval forces.

Since first announcing the Optimized Fleet Response Plan in January of this year, the Navy has been progressing with efforts to implement its measures over the next several years.

""Fleet Forces and Pacific Fleet have increased home time by still doing the training that needs to be done but getting rid of duplicative training,"" said Cmdr. Chris Servello, Navy spokesman for personnel.

The effort, which will take several years to implement, is centered around streamlining maintenance and training cycles so that sailors have more time at home and ships hit their modernization schedules.

""This plan involves the thoughtful melding of people, platforms and schedules -- while keeping the long term health of all three in mind,"" Servello said.

Navy officials recognize that lengthy and unpredictable deployments can make it more difficult to retain the brightest and most talented people, Moran said.

""What we hear from sailors all over is when sailors are out operating and doing what they joined the Navy to do, they feel a sense of autonomy, mastery and purpose. Where we find problems is when they don't know when they are going to come home or a six month deployment turns into a nine month deployment without reason or notice,"" Servello added. ""What we've seen is one of the main reasons we lose good people is due to a lack of predictability.""

Part of the plan involves efforts to get sailors integrated with their ships earlier in the training cycle and work-up in order to optimize time and make sure the ship and its sailors are ready for deployment, Servello explained.

While emphasizing that the Navy's op-tempo is likely to remain high in coming years, Moran said the service is also looking at widening career paths for young sailors as a way to help recruitment and increase retention.

Moran said the youngest generation of new sailors, referred to as ""millennials,"" think differently about careers and service compared with older generations.

""We need to make sure we attract and retain the best people. We're also dealing with a generation of folks who view the world differently than when I came to the Navy,"" Moran said. ""What we've learned in talking to this generation is that they want to see more experience inside and outside service organizations including corporate America.""

22029,Williams,Juan,military,"The U.S. Army's top officer said he expects between 70 and 80 women to apply to become the first-ever female students at Ranger School.

Army Chief of Staff Gen. Raymond Odierno cited the figures on Wednesday during an interview at Atlantic Media's Defense One conference in Washington, D.C.

When asked how many women will apply to the historically all-male combat training course, Odierno said, ""We're still waiting to see. By December-January, we'll know the number of women who have asked to actually participate in Ranger School. I expect it will be somewhere around 70 or 80.""

Like the other military services, the Army must open all combat jobs to women by 2016 or seek a waiver and explain why any must remain closed. The Pentagon last year lifted its ban on women serving in such roles, but gave the services time to integrate female troops into male-only front-line positions.

The Army recently picked 31 women -- 11 officers and 20 noncommissioned officers -- to undergo training to become observers and advisers for the course, most of which takes place at Fort Benning, Georgia. The punishing two-month ordeal is designed to train future infantry leaders. More than three dozen women had applied for the positions.

The so-called observer-advisers underwent a week of modified training last week to give them a sense of what the program is like so they can work alongside male instructors and help observe the female students selected for the first-ever co-ed class, known as the Ranger Course Assessment, tentatively scheduled for this spring.

""Their performance and professionalism over the course of the week was extraordinary,"" Maj. Gen. Scott Miller, commanding general of the Maneuver Center of Excellence, said of the women, according to a release posted on Fort Benning's Facebook page. ""This group did very well for what was a very physically challenging week for any soldier.""

Women make up about 15 percent of the U.S. military's 1.3 million active-duty service members, according to Pentagon statistics. As of August, there were almost 71,000 female soldiers in the Army's active component, which is the largest of any branch and totals some 510,000 soldiers.

While the vast majority of jobs in the Army are open to women of various ranks – enlisted, officer and warrant officer – less than 10 percent of infantry, special operations and security forces positions in the service are open to female enlisted personnel, and less than half of tactical operations positions are open to female officers, according to a 2012 report to Congress.

Service officials hinted that the number of women actually interested in applying for combat assignments will be relatively small.

NATO countries that have opened infantry jobs and similar positions to women report that only about 1 percent of potential female recruits apply for the jobs, Col. Linda Sheimo, who works for the Army's human resources policy directorate, has said. What's more, if the U.S. military fully integrates women into all jobs, the services' various recruiting offices will vie to recruit that small subset of the population, she said.

""Unfortunately, all of us will be competing for those same women,"" Sheimo said.

Army Secretary John McHugh and Army Chief of Staff Gen. Raymond Odierno, among others, are expected to make a decision sometime after Jan. 1 on whether to approve the plan to allow female soldiers to enroll in Ranger School.

On Wednesday, Odierno said the service plans to finish by spring or summer assessments to determine the feasibility of opening engineering, artillery, armor and infantry jobs to women.

""It's going very well,"" he said. ""We still have some final assessments to do. For me, it's about talent management. We need to take the best, no matter who you are, if you're qualified. We're not going to lower the standards. If you can meet the standard, we should give them the capability to service.""

The application deadline for female students interested in applying to Ranger School has passed; units have until Dec. 1 to provide names of the volunteers to the Army's Infantry School. Women selected for the highly competitive slots will be identified in January, Sheimo said.

The Ranger Course Assessment was open to all women in the grades E-4 through O-4 who had the support of their chain of command and whose end term of service, or ETS, was no earlier than Oct. 1, 2016, according to All-Army Activities, or Alaract, notices about the proposal.

Similar to the current process, earning a Ranger tab will not automatically move a soldier into the 75th Ranger Regiment, the Army's special operations unit.

(Story was updated to clarify that upcoming deadline is for units to forward applicants for consideration.)

22031,Williams,Juan,military,"ABOARD THE USS NIMITZ IN THE PACIFIC OCEAN -- With smoke rising from the deck of the carrier and moderate winds churning up the seas, the Navy's F-35C took off from the aircraft carrier Nimitz as part of a historic series of test flights marking a major milestone in the service's first carrier-launched stealth fighter.

Following the first landing of the F-35C on Nov. 3, test pilots have conducted more than 100 approaches, landings and takeoffs on the Nimitz's flight deck. Last week's successful landing offered both history and relief for a Joint Strike Fighter program that Pentagon leaders say will revolutionize airpower, but has also been plagued by countless delays and budget overruns.

The Navy's variant of the fifth-generation fighter is arguably the most complex because it must execute catapult shots and landings from the flight deck. And it's also the one facing the most questions as many defense analysts have questioned the Navy's commitment to the Joint Strike Fighter program.

The ongoing maneuvers on the Nimitz are part of a 14-day developmental test period designed to gather data and assess the F-35C's ability to achieve the proper ""glide slope,"" handle catapult takeoffs, and land on the flight deck under a variety of wind conditions.

""If you look across the inventory at where we have stealth technology, it is all ground based. Now we have sea-based stealth technology. That provides us capabilities that we currently do not have,"" said Rear Adm. Dee Mewbourne, commander of Carrier Strike Group 11.

Navy leaders, pilots and engineers said the initial testing has gone well. Ultimately, the Navy and Marine Corps plan to acquire 680 F-35Cs and F-35Bs -- the Marine Corps' short-take-off-and-landing variant of the aircraft.

""Our job is to identify the issues and report on them. All the issues that we have been finding are very minor,"" said Navy Cmdr. Tony Wilson, an F-35C test pilot. ""The main focus of the test has been catapult shots and landings. We did do shore-based testing to make sure we were ready to come out here. However, the big difference is you can't simulate rolling off the edge of an aircraft carrier when you are shore based.""

Success Amidst Budget Problems

Successful test flights on the F-35C program could be seen as a welcome development for a program that experienced budget cutbacks earlier this year. The Navy's five-year budget plans outlined in the service's 2015 budget request cut the planned buy of F-35C aircraft almost in half, from 69 to 36.

Although service officials at the time said the numbers would be made up in future years, some observers questioned if the reduction indicated hesitations about the program overall.

A second round of developmental testing is slated for next summer to study the aircraft's ability to operate on a carrier while carrying weapons internally, Wilson said. A third period of testing with external weapons on board is also slated, all designed to bring the aircraft to operational status by 2018, Navy officials said.

""In this main round of testing, we're looking at the basic aircraft. We're looking at the approach and handling qualities. We're looking at high headwinds, low headwinds, crosswinds and a bunch of different wind variations as well,"" said Chris Karapostoles, an F-35C test pilot.

Being engineered for a carrier, the F-35C's 51-foot wingspan is larger than the Air Force's F-35A and Marine Corps' F-35B. An empty F-35C weighs 34,800 pounds, carries up to 19,000 pounds of fuel and 18,000 pounds of weapons. It is configured to fire two AIM-120C air-to-air missiles and two 2,000-pound guided bombs, or Joint Direct Attack Munitions. It can reach speeds up to Mach 1.6 and travel more than 1,200 nautical miles.

Landing a Stealth Fighter at Sea

As part of the testing, pilots practice maintaining their glide slope by watching a yellow light on the flight deck called the Fresnel Lens. It includes a vertical row of yellow lights between two horizontal rows of green lights. Using a series of lights and mirrors, a pilot's approach is reflected by the position of the yellow light in relation to the green lights above and below, displaying whether the aircraft is on the right ""center line"" or ""glide slope,"" Karapostoles said.

""If he [the pilot] is on glide slope, he will see a centered amber ball in between the horizontal green lights. If he goes high on glide slope, he will see the ball rise above the green lights. If he goes below glide slope, he will see the ball fall below the green lights,"" he explained.

The F-35C is also engineered with a technology referred to as Delta Flight Path, a system that uses software to help the flight control computer automatically correct course and adjust the aircraft's flight path as needed.

""Instead of manually controlling thrust and pitch attitude, our flight control engineers have cut out the middle work so the flight path is controlled directly. It gives us spare capacity to monitor the other systems on the jet. We are landing the jet almost exactly where we want almost every time,"" said Cmdr. Christian Sewell, a F-35C test pilot.

Pilots try to land the F-35C in between the second and third of four cables arranged on the landing deck, Sewell explained.

In order to properly align for an approach to the flight deck about three-quarters of a mile away, pilots make a sharp, descending 180-degree turn to slow the aircraft and begin descending from about 600 feet, Wilson said.

""Once we arrive on center line and on glide slope, that is where the precision comes in because your runway is essentially moving sideways on you,"" he explained.

The testing is also assessing how the F-35C catapults off the deck. The steam catapult on board the Nimitz is thrusting the aircraft off the deck at a range of speeds in order to test the slowest and fastest potential takeoff speeds, said Lt. Eric Ryziu, catapult arresting gear officer.

Aircraft are able to reach speeds up to 160 knots in about 2.5 seconds as a result of being thrust forward by the steam catapult, which stretches about 300 feet. The steam catapult generates 520 PSI (pounds per square inch) of pressure pushing pistons forward. The pistons push cylinders connected to a shuttle attached to a launch bar, which pulls the aircraft forward, Ryziu explained.

22032,Williams,Juan,defensetech,"SAN DIEGO — The U.S. Navy’s Littoral Combat Ship will deploy with an unmanned aircraft system on board for the first time when the USS Fort Worth leaves here next week on deployment to the Pacific region, service officials said.

The Fort Worth, or LCS 3, will soon deploy with what’s called a surface warfare mission-equipment package – a collection of integrated on-board technologies including 11-meter rigid inflatable boats, 30mm machine guns, MH-60R helicopters and the MQ-8B Fire Scout, a helicopter-like vertical take-off-and-landing drone.

“This first time we’re bringing Fire Scout into the equation and matching it up with a manned helicopter squadron. The same pilots that fly an MH-60 helicopter can fly a mission, land on deck, come inside the ship and launch the Fire Scout and do another mission. It brings us a lot more flexibility,” said Capt. Ken Bridgewater, commanding officer of the USS Fort Worth.

With a range up to 100 miles, the Fire Scout UAS uses electro-optical/infrared sensors send a live video stream back to a command center on-board the ship, Bridgewater said.

“The Fire Scout has a lot longer endurance so you can keep it up in the air a lot longer than we can keep a traditional manned MH-60. It gives us more loitering time on station to help build that maritime picture,” he added.

The surface warfare package will make full use of the USS Fort Worth’s flight deck, a landing area on the back of the ship which is larger than the deck space on current destroyers and cruisers.

The USS Fort Worth will first travel to Singapore as a first stop on a deployment throughout various parts of the Pacific. While on deployment, the Fort Worth will participate in an annual multi-national training exercise called Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training, or CARAT.

“The ship itself is going to operate out of Singapore as a logistics hub for an extended period of time. We will do three crew swaps, however, so that the crews don’t get over taxed as they are doing operations,” he said. “We are going to be operating extensively through the South China Sea region, Southeast Asia, Northeast Asia, southern Asia for an extended period of time. We’re going to be an actively engaged and employed vessel in the 7th Fleet area of responsibility.”

The first LCS to deploy, the USS Freedom, traveled to Singapore and the Pacific last year. Many of the problems experienced on this first deployment have been addressed through “fixes” made to the USS Fort Worth and subsequent LCS models.

For example, the Fort Worth is engineered with improved diesel generators, a new air compressor and is now built with special metal coating in certain areas to reduce the risk of salt-water corrosion, said Capt. Randy Garner, commodore of the squadron, USS Fort Worth.

Each of these “fixes” were put in place following problems experienced on the deployment of the USS Freedom.

“We’ve taken advantage of Freedom’s deployment and Freedom’s operations. We’ve incorporated lessons learned from that hull into this hull. There are over 400 improvements that have been made for Fort Worth just like the USS Milwaukee, LCS 5, has receive improvements from this design,” Garner added.

The LCS ships are constructed in two separate variants called Freedom variants and Independence variants. The Freedom variants are built with a flat-bottomed, semi-planing monohull and the Independence variants are engineered with a trimaran hull designed for low hydrodynamic drag. Both variants are engineered for high-speed littoral operations involving mine countermeasures, anti-submarine warfare and surface warfare.

Apart from what’s added to the ship with the surface warfare mission equipment package, the USS Fort Worth is equipped with a Rolling Airframe Missile for ship defense, 50-cal. Machines guns, torpedoes and a 57mm gun weapons system.

The 387-foot long LCS is designed to reach speeds up to 40 knots and perform a wide range of missions. The ship is built with four main propulsion engines, two diesel and two gas turbine engines.

“We have two outboard shafts that are maneuverable. They are steerable water jets. We also have two in-board shafts to give us additional speed,” Bridgewater said.

With a crew of 54 sailors, the LCS is designed to be small, fast and maneuverable; the ship uses its 15-foot shallow draft to access strategically important areas such as allied ports and waterways which larger Navy vessels such as cruisers and destroyers are too large to enter, Navy officials said.

The LCS has been certified as an official part of a carrier strike group.

“Carriers are not going to go into a lot of areas where there is a shallow draft, but they might want somebody else to,” Garner added.

Bridgewater also added that the smaller size of the LCS, compared with larger cruisers and destroyers, makes it more compatible for exercises with ships from various allied nations.",-1,http://defensetech.org/2014/11/13/fort-worth-first-lcs-to-deploy-with-uas/

22034,Williams,Juan,defensetech,"The Pentagon’s main research arm wants to find out what a flying “aircraft carrier” carrying a fleet of small aerial drones might look like and how much it would cost the military.

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency announced Sunday it would open a competition for proposals to build a large aircraft — similar to a C-130 — that could carry and distribute aerial drones across a large area. DARPA officials said they wanted to see proposals for a system that could both launch the drones, but also recover them mid-flight.

Flying conventional airstrikes with large manned aircraft is both expensive and risky for the human pilot, DARPA officials explained. Therefore, the Pentagon wants to consider a “blended approach” that would lengthen the range of small drones by carrying them to combat aboard a manned aircraft.

“We want to find ways to make smaller aircraft more effective, and one promising idea is enabling existing large aircraft, with minimal modification, to become ‘aircraft carriers in the sky’,” said Dan Patt, DARPA program manager.

DARPA wants the proposals to allow for a flight demonstration of the aircraft and the drones within four years. Officials expect to use the proposals to build an official DARPA program for the system.

Leaders emphasized in the announcement that DARPA wants the drones to be small and cheap. Military commanders want cost effective options to execute airstrikes and this program should provide it.",-1,http://defensetech.org/2014/11/12/pentagon-wants-to-build-aircraft-carriers-in-the-sky/
22035,Williams,Juan,defensetech,"Air Force doctors at Joint Base Langley-Eustis in Virginia have a germ-killing robot ready to help keep rooms clean should any returning service member show symptoms of Ebola.

The 366th Medical Group at Langley is responsible for housing and monitoring troops returning from Ebola aid missions to West Africa during a mandatory 21-day quarantine period.

The 5’2”-inch robot, named Saul, is essentially a germ terminator whose pulses of high-intensity, high-energy ultraviolet rays can destroy viruses lurking in areas where hazmat-suited humans using traditional cleansers cannot reach, according to the Air Force.

“Saul will provide an extra measure of safety for both our patients and our intensive care unit staff,” Col. Marlene Kerchenski, chief nurse of the 633rd Medical Group at Langley said. Saul’s role is to do a final mop-up in contaminated environments.

There are about 1,800 American troops in Liberia and Senegal for the Ebola mission, as well as about 100 contractors and close to 60 Defense Department civilians, according to the Pentagon. The quarantine is mandatory only for service members.

Langley-Eustis is one of five U.S. bases chosen by Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey to look after troops returning from West Africa during a 21-day isolation period. The other bases are Fort Hood and Fort Bliss, Texas; Fort Bragg, North Carolina; and Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington. The quarantine is mandatory for service members, though not for Defense Department civilians.

The robot is made by Xenex of San Antonio, which has sold more than 200 of their “germ zappers” to hospitals, according to the company.

The ultraviolet ray pulses emitted by Saul are 25,000 times brighter than florescent lights, Geri Genant, Xenex’s health care services manager. The rays split open bacterial cell walls and kill pathogens.

“Xenex has tested its full spectrum disinfection system on 22 microorganisms, studying nearly 2,000 samples in several independent labs all over the world,” said Genant.

The machine has already shown it can kill a single strand of ribonucleic acid, a virus similar to Ebola, two meters out in any direction, within five minutes, at an efficiency rate of 99.9 percent, Genant said.

Kerchenski said Saul will be used throughout the hospital on a rotating basis.

“Our surgical services groups have already been trained on this, so we will use them as well as our service representative for a train the trainer type program,” she said.",-1,http://defensetech.org/2014/11/11/air-force-ready-to-fight-ebola-with-virus-killing-robot/
22036,Williams,Juan,thehill,"A trouncing! A tsunami! A shellacking!

That’s the conventional wisdom about last week’s midterm elections. But it’s wrong.

ADVERTISEMENT

Yes, the GOP picked up 12 seats in the House and gained at least 7 seats in the Senate. But calling that a shellacking requires closing your eyes to some really big numbers.

First, the average pick-up for the opposition party in midterm elections that take place in the sixth year of a presidency is 29 seats in the House and 6 seats in the Senate. The GOP had an undisputed victory and was able to claim the Senate majority in emphatic fashion. But a tsunami? It did not come close to that.

Second, 60 percent of voters told exit polls they were either “dissatisfied” with Republican leaders in Congress (37 percent) or “angry” with them (23 percent).

Yet the lesson drawn by Republicans on Capitol Hill is that last week’s vote was a repudiation of President Obama.

Admittedly, the president’s approval rating is on the low side, at 44 percent among last week’s voters. But nearly half of the voters, 46 percent, said President Obama “was not a factor” in their vote.

The real message from the elections is that the public is turned off by the current state of our politics. Two-thirds of eligible voters did not go to the polls. Among those who did, exit surveys show a populist, angry vote against status quo politics. That vote is spearheaded by older, white men in “red,” mostly southern, states won by Republican Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential race.

Even with an electorate that skewed Republican, those same exit polls showed that 78 percent of voters said it is “only some of the time or never” that they can “trust the government in Washington to do what is right.” And, remember, 60 percent of these voters said they don’t like the Republican congressional leadership.

Even some conservative commentators, such as Charles Krauthammer and Frank Luntz, have warned Republicans that (to paraphrase Krauthammer) the GOP did not win the election so much as Democrats lost it; and (to paraphrase Luntz) that this was more an anti-status quo election than a pro-Republican one.

How can a Washington political class that is so distrusted by the American people get back on track?

At a White House press conference after the election, the president said the looming challenge is now “actually getting some good done.” But he did not display any new ideas for dealing with the GOP.

Critics in the media like to say Obama needs to do more outreach to Republicans: Have a drink with the likely new Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellMcConnell vents over 'fake news' The Hill's 12:30 Report - Presented by Facebook - Tensions rise as U.S. waits for Derek Chauvin verdict Trump looking 'beyond seriously' at 2024 run MORE (Ky.); play golf with the Speaker, John Boehner John Andrew BoehnerCantor: 'Level of craziness' in Washington has increased 'on both sides' Cheney on Trump going to GOP retreat in Florida: 'I haven't invited him' Republicans race for distance from 'America First Caucus' MORE (Ohio).

The Republican leadership, however, has its hands tied by the far-right of the GOP and the talk-radio crowd. Making any deal with a president demonized by the GOP base is politically perilous for them.

President Obama is hamstrung in his attempts to make deals with Republicans by a harsh, hyper-partisan political atmosphere that would defeat even a master of the Senate such as President Johnson or a charmer like President Clinton.

The Republicans have had no agenda for the last six years except hating Obama. Even now they do not have a program for government. McConnell and Boehner John Andrew BoehnerCantor: 'Level of craziness' in Washington has increased 'on both sides' Cheney on Trump going to GOP retreat in Florida: 'I haven't invited him' Republicans race for distance from 'America First Caucus' MORE are saying they will formulate their policy plans over the next few weeks through op-ed articles and meetings with the president and fellow Republicans.

“The American people have spoken,” McConnell said in a news conference after the election. “They’ve given us divided government. The question for both the president, and for the Speaker and myself and our members is: ‘What are you going to do with it?’”

Keep in mind that the newly-elected Republicans have ousted moderates from their own party and from within Democratic ranks. For example, in the last Congress there were Democrats willing to vote for changes to parts of the Affordable Care Act. Republicans who want total repeal of the law have replaced those Democrats.

There are some grounds for hope:

First, Congress passes more bills when both Houses are under the control of one party and the opposing party has control of the White House.

Second, more Republicans and Democrats tell pollsters they want compromise so that bills get passed.

But there is also this compelling reality:

“Republicans were not elected to govern [the country]…” said Rush Limbaugh, the king of conservative talk radio. “The Republican Party was not elected to compromise. The Republican Party was not elected to sit down and work together with Democrats. The Republican Party was not elected to slow down the speed [at] which the country is headed for the cliff and go over it slowly.”

You might not guess from Limbaugh’s bellicose tone that the GOP in the Senate still lacks the 60 votes to halt a filibuster and is miles from the 67 votes needed to override a Presidential veto.

Yet, despite that, Sen. Ted Cruz Rafael (Ted) Edward CruzOn The Money: Senate GOP faces post-Trump spending brawl | Senate confirms SEC chief Gensler to full five-year term | Left-leaning group raises concerns about SALT cap repeal Biden watching Derek Chauvin verdict from West Wing Cruz opposed to state lawmaker's bid to replace Wright in Congress MORE (R-Texas), a likely candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, is himself talking like a conservative radio host in demanding that the new GOP committee chairmen begin hearings on “the abuse of power, the executive abuse, the regulatory abuse, the lawlessness that sadly has pervaded this [Obama] administration.”

You don’t need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows. But my weather forecast for Capitol Hill predicts more partisanship and a steady blizzard of 2016 politics starting now.

22037,Williams,Juan,defensetech,"The Pentagon’s top research arm and Raytheon will test a new system designed to massively speed up air-ground coordination and reduce targeting time for close air support from as long as an hour — down to as little as six minutes.

A program called Persistent Close Air Support, or PCAS, connects pilots in real time with the ground-based Joint Terminal Attack Controllers, or JTACS, there to help establish and confirm target information.

“The way we are able to decrease the timeline from 30 to 60 minutes to six minutes or less is by having digital communications tablet-to-tablet between the pilot and the JTAC, having autonomous decision aides and sharing situational awareness,” said Dave Bossert, senior engineering fellow, Raytheon.

The PCAS program, which began four years ago and is now involved in what’s called phase three, plans a close air support weapons drop demonstration next February from an A-10 Warthog at the Barry M. Goldwater Air Force Range, Ariz. Phase three of PCAS involves a $25.5 million DARPA deal with Raytheon.

The DARPA effort, which in total includes a roughly $45 million developmental deal with Raytheon, is moving forward under the watchful eye of interested Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps observers, Bossert said. The system could be ready for operational use by May of next year.

The first flight test of the PCAS system took place on an A-10 in October of this year and a test-flight to verify the on-board sensors is slated for December, Bossert explained.

Right now, most close-air-support is done using only voice radio to identify and confirm target information or coordinates, a process which can at times be lengthy in order to ensure the pilot and JTAC have correctly confirmed a given target location.

With PCAS, pilots and JTACs have digital messaging capability and are essentially networked through software programmable radio, technology which can wirelessly transmit IP packets of voice, video and data in real-time. Through the use of android-based digital tablets on the ground and in the cockpit of the aircraft, pilots and JTACs can view and exchange relevant targeting information using icons, digital maps and display screens.

Using what’s called smart launcher electronics, the PCAS system integrates software programmable radio with a processor and a digital tablet in the cockpit of the aircraft. The smart launcher electronics includes a computer to host the PCAS software, radios, an ethernet switch and a GPS/inertial navigation systems unit, Bossert explained.

The digital tablet, used by both the pilots and the JTACs, leverages digital navigation technology and mapping information gleaned from a Navy and Air Force program called Electronic Fight Bag. Electronic Flight Bag is an effort to replace paper maps in the cockpit with a tablet-based digital map database, Bossert said.

With PCAS, the standard so-called “nine-line” targeting information form no longer needs to be relayed only by voice but can be viewed simultaneously in real time by pilots and JTACs using a digital tablet, Bossert explained.

“The nine-line is a standardized methodology to pass target information. It is a format and a form that has nine pieces of information on it used to describe the target and its location. Right now they read it off. We’ve implemented the form digitally. Through this IP-based network, we want it to be like the pilot and the JTAC are sitting side by side,” Bossert said.

As a result of being networked through IP-based radio, PCAS allows a JTAC to view a pilot’s airborne targeting pod control picture and, similarly, permits a pilot to view target-grid coordinates and other displays from a JTAC’s tablet on the ground.

In addition, the PCAS technology uses what’s called autonomous decision aides, allowing things like weapons employment planning on the JTAC tablet. While a ground commander and pilot will be the humans in the loop finalizing targets, the PCAS system will use algorithms to recommend which weapons might be best-suited to attack a given target.

“Not only do we have digital representation of the target but digital representation of the surrounding friendlies so you will be able to cycle through the different weapons effects and say ‘that is the weapon that I want.’ Then, the system will make a recommendation. The pilot and the JTAC can choose whatever weapon they want,” Bossert added. “We aren’t changing anything in terms of how the weapon is initialized and how the weapon is passed to the target.”

The targeting information can be networked to other air and ground platforms in the vicinity as well, he said.

“Anybody that is on the network that has an IP-based radio can get this information as well,” he said.

The A-10 is merely a demonstration platform for the technology, meaning the PCAS apparatus could easily migrate to other fixed-wing platforms able to provide close air support.

“You have increased situational awareness, so this has the potential to reduce collateral damage, decrease the likelihood of friendly fire incidents and save lives on the battlefield,” Bossert added.",-1,http://defensetech.org/2014/11/10/darpa-tests-new-close-air-support-technology/
22038,Williams,Juan,thehill,"Call me Forrest Gump — the fictional character who lived through so many changes in history — but after more than 30 years of covering national politics, it once again feels to me that basic strategy for winning elections is being tossed in the air by this year’s midterms.

In the 70s and 80s, the key to victory was winning swing voters via better advertising and campaigning.

In the 90s and 00s, as politics became more partisan, the winning strategy changed, becoming a matter of maximizing turnout among your party’s political base.

Now political thinkers are asking: What if voter turnout doesn’t matter?

ADVERTISEMENT

That is the theory of Harry Enten, a blogger for the FiveThirtyEight.com website. He wrote earlier this year that “the reason Republicans won more votes in 2010 – and likely will in 2014 – is that voters wanted Republicans in office, not that minorities and young people didn’t turn out to vote.”

Other academic studies have similarly questioned the conventional wisdom about the power of voter turnout. They point out that young people being pushed to the polls have weak party affiliation. The newcomers often just want to shake up the political status quo by voting against anyone in power, especially the incumbent president and his party.

Last week a Harvard Institute of Politics poll of millennial voters reported that a majority, 51 percent, of this year’s likely young voters said they would prefer a Republican-majority Congress. In 2010, 55 percent of millennial voters preferred to have Democrats lead Congress. Even with young people backing Democrats, the GOP won big in the 2010 midterms.

If the Harvard poll is right, it really upsets the Democrats’ apple-cart. The Democrats need those votes from young people to have any chance.

Here is another game changer in this year’s election. For the first time voters are telling pollsters they are willing to vote against their own member of Congress to show their overall disgust with Washington politics.

Obviously, that is bad news for incumbents of both parties. But has American politics really changed so radically? History is clear. The people who lose in midterms belong to the president’s party. Only three times since 1842 has the party holding the White House gained seats in a midterm election.

Another shocking change in today’s politics is the failure of so many polls. There are more polls than ever. But even great polling organizations are getting it wrong. That is what happened to Gallup’s prediction of a GOP victory in the 2012 presidential race.

Current polling points to a GOP advantage in this year’s midterms. But last week the New York Times blog, The Upshot, reported that this year’s polls have likely undercounted Democratic votes because their voter samples are based on 2010 Census numbers. That means the current polls are “typically weighted to reflect the slightly whiter America of a few years ago, rather than the America of today,” according to the Times.

If that is true, then critical Senate races where polls show Republicans holding a lead of less than 5 percentage points — states such as Arkansas and Colorado, for example — may actually have Democrats in the lead.

Also consider another crazy development: In Georgia this year, Democrats have registered a surprising 250,000 new voters. That kind of increase is previously unheard-of in a midterm election.

Here is yet another change for people who follow politics:

Polls are showing vastly different results when all “registered voters” are sampled versus the result from “likely voters.” In this year’s contests those “likely voters” are older, white, more affluent and Republican. A recent Washington Post/ABC News poll found 77 percent of Republicans say they will definitely vote this year compared to 63 percent of Democrats who say they are “certain” to vote. As a result, polls of likely voters skew in favor of Republican candidates.

But who is a likely voter these days?

Black voters turned out in record numbers in 2012, their turnout rate in percentage terms surpassing that of white voters for the first time. That means there are black voters available to Democrats in this cycle if the party is able to get them to the polls. The same is true with Latino voters.

The question is whether continued high minority-voter support for President Obama transcends the pattern of declining minority turnout in midterm elections. Early voting indicates an increase in black turnout.

Another surprising change in politics in my lifetime is the persistence of a gender gap. National Journal reported earlier this month the gender gap in senatorial and gubernatorial races is at 20 percent this year, higher than the 13-point average since ’04, and reaching “historic proportions across 2014’s battleground states.”

Given the GOP advantage in the large number of red states in play in this year’s Senate races, the real surprise of this midterm season is the apparent absence of a GOP wave. That could be tied to one final, confusing factor — the absence of a defining issue in this year’s races.

That is why this election is going to be remembered by all of us Forrest Gump types following politics according to Gump’s maxim that life is a box of chocolates – you never know what you’ll get.

22040,Williams,Juan,thehill,"Republicans have more women running for Congress this year than ever before. They have five female Senate nominees, one less than the record high set during the 2012 campaign. They also have 50 female House candidates, two more than in 2012.

This high-water mark for Republicans is important because single, white women, along with minority voters, are the last line of defense for Democrats hoping to keep the GOP from a wave election.

Historically speaking, minority voters are less inclined to go to the polls in midterm elections than in presidential contests. That being so, Democrats are focusing on pumping up turnout among college-educated, young, single women, who are considered more likely to vote.

“I haven’t seen gender gaps like this in any race until this year and we’re seeing them all over the place,” Nicole McCleskey, a Republican who polls for Public Opinion Strategies, recently told National Journal. She pointed to particularly high levels of male support for Republicans as part of the reason for this year’s yawning gender gap.

The gender gap has averaged about 13 points in senatorial and gubernatorial races since 2004. But this year the same races are averaging a gap of 20 points, ballooning to what National Journal called “historic proportions across 2014’s battleground states.”

By way of comparison, exit polls from the 2012 presidential election, showed President Obama winning the support of 55 percent of female voters over Republican Mitt Romoney, but only 45 percent of their male counterparts. Helpfully for the president, women made up 53 percent of all voters on that occasion.

The focus on women is glaring in the Colorado Senate race between two men, Sen. Mark Udall Mark Emery UdallKennedy apologizes for calling Haaland a 'whack job' OVERNIGHT ENERGY: Haaland courts moderates during tense confirmation hearing | GOP's Westerman looks to take on Democrats on climate change | White House urges passage of House public lands package Udalls: Haaland criticism motivated 'by something other than her record' MORE, the Democrat and his Republican challenger, Rep.

The Republican is basically tied with Udall in polls. He has a failed to pull away more convincingly because he cannot transcend his opposition to abortion rights, including past support for “personhood” bill that outlaws abortion by equating a fertilized egg with a living child.

But the gender gap will also be pivotal in Senate races in Georgia, Arkansas, Michigan, Louisiana, Alaska. That, in term, means it will also be at the core of whether the GOP is able to take the Senate majority.

One intriguing twist in this cycle is that Democrats have shifted from talking about a “War on Women.”

Instead, they rely on references to GOP opposition to equal pay laws, to renewing the Violence Against Women Act, to increasing the minimum wage, and to opposition to the Affordable Care Act, including its increased access to contraception and preventive care including mammograms and care for pregnant women.

It is hard for even the best female Republican candidates to counter the fact that Republicans in Congress have repeatedly voted to repeal the health care law. It is hard for anyone to ignore that Republican-majority state legislatures are forcing the small number of red-state abortion clinics to shut down by passing restrictive anti-abortion laws.

Stan Greenberg, the Democratic pollster, recently found that “Democratic campaigns are succeeding in making the candidates’ positions on women’s issues become the second biggest reason voters are planning to vote for Democrats — after the economy.” The headline on the press release for the poll’s results, written by its sponsors: “Unmarried Women Support Democratic Candidates by 22 points in 12 Battleground States.”

The poll led Rush Limbaugh, the king of conservative talk radio, to joke, “if single women vote Democrat, then Republicans would be wise to start a dating service.”

Short of having the male-dominated GOP marry single female Democrats, the party’s best hope was to recruit strong women candidates for 2014.

It did just that. This year’s class of Republican candidates includes Joni Ernst Joni Kay Ernst15 Senate Republicans pledge to oppose lifting earmark ban Child care advocates seek to lock down billion in new federal funding GOP senator: Raising corporate taxes is a 'non-starter' MORE in Iowa; Shelley Moore Capito Shelley Wellons Moore CapitoGOP eyes new strategy to derail Biden infrastructure plan On The Money: Moderates' 0B infrastructure bill is a tough sell with Democrats | Justice Dept. sues Trump ally Roger Stone for unpaid taxes OVERNIGHT ENERGY: Trump official delayed releasing information on cancer-linked chemical in Illinois: watchdog | Advocacy groups say tech giants need to 'step it up' on sustainability | GOP senator: Raising corporate taxes is a 'non-starter' MORE in West Virginia; Monica Wehby in Oregon; and Terri Lynn Land in Michigan. It is a start for the white-male-dominated GOP, even if this group is still outnumbered by female Democrats running for Senate.

In addition to recruiting more women and getting more of them through the primaries, the party has also avoided ending up with politically inept female candidates such as 2010’s Christine O’Donnell (“I am not a witch”) and Sharron Angle (“I’m tired of some people calling me wacky.”).

There is even more good news for the GOP’s effort to cut into the Democrats’ advantage with women. Older, white married women are polling more strongly behind Republican candidates.

As a result some generic polls in this year’s campaign are making news by showing likely women voters with an overall preference for Republicans, not Democrats, to control Congress.

In Republican advertising, the wives, daughters and mothers of male candidates are being prominently featured this cycle.

And Republican female candidates are directly confronting the issue in advertising by speaking to women.

In Michigan, the Republican senate candidate, Terri Lynn Land, has a television ad in which she looks into the camera and asks female voters if they believe she is “waging a war on women.” Then she says of her Democrat opponent: “As a woman, I might know a little bit more about women than Gary Peters.”

It is a good ad. Land is a good candidate. But is it enough to overcome a GOP brand defined by decades of hostility on pay, abortion and national healthcare — top issues for young, women voters? We shall see.

22041,Williams,Juan,thehill,"Is there anyway Democrats can win the 17 seats they need to capture the House majority this November?

In one word: Yes.

Democrats picked up 8 seats two years ago despite widespread predictions of losses. They lost 12 seats in 2012 by less than five percentage points and another 18 seats by less than 10 percentage points.

Also keep in mind that every poll shows the public agrees with Democrats on the big issues – gay marriage, pay equity for women, immigration, gun control and budget cuts.

Meanwhile, the GOP brand remains unpopular. The biggest advantage for House Democrats is that they are running against Republicans. That party’s good name suffered from last fall’s government shutdown, a strategy of obstruction that has paralyzed the Congress, and the recent vote in support of a budget that privatizes Medicare.

Another plus for Democrats is that the GOP’s misguided message to voters for the fall elections – “Obamacare is a Failure.” That claim is out of date with the success of 7 million people enrolling and 3 million more gaining insurance through Medicaid expansion. The kill healthcare reform message, with endless GOP votes in the House for repeal, also irritates swing voters. Polling shows Independents want to fix Obamacare, not kill it.

But even with all those advantages the odds remain against Democrats getting enough wins to make Nancy Pelosi the Speaker of the House. Top political analysts, from Charlie Cook to Larry Sabato, currently predict Republicans adding two or three seats to easily retain their majority.

Even the chair of the Democratic Congressional Committee, New York’s Rep. Steve Israel, told the National Press Club in early April: “It’s a tough climate for us right now.”

In the 2012 House races Democrats won 50.6 percent of America’s votes with a popular President Obama at the top of the ballot. Although they won the majority of votes they picked up only 8 seats, leaving them 17 shy of majority control. The Democrats’ voters are concentrated in blue states and even high turnout has minimal impact on Republican districts.

Another problem for Democrats this year is the absence of President Obama’s name on the ballot. His star power has a history of driving up voter turnout among core Democrats, young people, women and minorities. But his name is not on this year’s ballot. And after the bungling of the start of computer enrollment for healthcare the president’s support among Democrats slipped. It has slipped even more among Independent voters. That has caused the president’s popularity to drop into the mid-40 percent range. History is pretty clear here. Second-term incumbents almost always see their party lose seats, an average of 29.

Also bedeviling to Democrats are the results from polls asking voters if they prefer having Democrats or Republicans in charge of the House. Voters are about even, with Democrats holding only a slight, 41-39 percent edge, according to Real Clear Politics. That translates to political strategists as Democrats not having a strong political wind at their back as they sail into the election.

But let me offer the contrarian argument: There is still hope for Democrats to win the House majority!

First, the Democrats are lucky to be running against the House Republicans. Polls show the GOP has a measly 30 percent approval rating. House Republicans are even less popular with about an 18 percent approval rating, according to the most recent polls.

Democrats in the House have nearly twice the approval rating, at 30 percent in the same Quinnipiac poll.

Infighting between so-called ‘establishment Republicans’ and ‘Tea Party Republicans’ compounds the Republicans’ low favorability. The party’s image is captive to incumbent Republican fears of not being sufficiently conservative to stave off a challenge from a Tea Party challenger in primary races. That’s why House Republicans just passed a budget with cuts to education and savings from making Medicare a private plan. Basically the House GOP, in their preoccupation with the far right, just handed Democrats a great weapon for beating up House Republicans in the fall races.

“The Republican budget [is going to] define the next seven months,” said DCCC chair Israel. “With this budget the Republicans are turning their back on the middle class.”

Another reason for the Democrats to have some optimism about House races is the retirement of several popular Republican incumbents and changing demographics. Here are two races that illustrate how holding the House majority may be more difficult for Republicans than the experts would have you believe.

When moderate Republican Jon Runyan (R-N.J.) retired he set off a chaotic fight between Tea Party and establishment Republicans in the district. The local Republican establishment candidate, Tom MacArthur, is battling for the nomination against Tea Party insurgent, Steve Lonegan. Not only are they tearing each other up before the general election but also both are vulnerable to charges of being carpetbaggers. Each man served as mayor of a New Jersey town outside the district. Aimee Belgard, a Democrat, is now positioned as an even pick to win a seat that previously looked safe for Republicans.

Then there is the demographic problem for Republicans. In Colorado’s Sixth District Republican Rep. Mike Coffman has seen a sharp increase among his Hispanic constituents. That rising tide led Coffman to back a bill to give legal status to children of illegal immigrants who are in school or join the military. But he is facing a formidable challenge from the former Speaker of the Colorado House of Representatives, Andrew Romanoff, who is telling voters about the GOP’s refusal to act on immigration reform.

Those races explain why no one should be surprised if Democrats find a way to chalk up some House wins this fall.",-1,http://thehill.com/opinion/juan-williams/203583-still-hope-for-democrats-in-november
22042,Williams,Juan,thehill,"The dark and dysfunctional 112th Congress, now drawing to its close, will go down in history as one in which the bad behavior of lawmakers led to a downgrade of the nation’s credit rating and the creation of the impending fiscal cliff.

The Gallup approval rating for this Congress, at one point, reached a historic low of 12 percent.

This Congress passed the fewest bills of any Congress since the end of the Second World War. Now, there will be a lame-duck session and negotiations to put in place a temporary bridge to get past the fiscal cliff.

But the 112th Congress is still not likely to surpass the low number of bills approved by the Congress of 1947 — the one President Truman famously dubbed the “do-nothing Congress.”

Polarization and gridlock have paralyzed Congress. But now, a bright ray of hope for ending those twin curses is emerging from election results in California.

The optimism begins with changes in the system for electing lawmakers in the Golden State, home to the largest congressional biggest delegation.

In 2010, a diverse group of the state’s biggest political stakeholders — including the California Chamber of Commerce, the AARP and then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger — united to support a ballot proposition creating a bipartisan commission that redrew the geographic lines for California’s congressional districts.

The proposition also changed the rules for the general election.

The old system pitted the winners of the party’s primaries against each other. The new system provides for the two candidates with the most votes in an open congressional primary to move on to the general election — even if they belong to the same party.

Last Tuesday’s election in California was the first under the new map and new rules.

And the results are shaking up the political status quo.

Out of California’s 53 House races, seven incumbents lost their seats as they ran in more diverse districts — in which candidates had to appeal to more diverse neighborhoods and political groups.

That is far above the replacement rate in recent congressional elections.

Among the seven losers are some of the most politically hardline members of Congress.

For example, 80-year-old Democrat Pete Stark, who has been in Congress since 1973, is both dean of the California delegation and a hardline liberal.

He lost to a 30-year-old Democrat who finished second to Stark in the primaries and would not have been able to challenge him in the general election under the old rules.

Similarly, Democrat Laura Richardson, the focus of several ethics inquiries, lost to a fellow Democrat who would not have been able to challenge her in the general election under the old rules.

Another potential casualty of the new rules: Republican Rep. Brian Bilbray, who opposed the DREAM Act, which provides a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. as children.

The new lines for Bilbray’s district include more Hispanic voters, and they supported an immigration-friendly Democrat, Scott Peters.

Bilbray is trailing his opponent, but has yet to concede defeat.

Dan Lungren, another sharp-edged conservative, lost in his newly expanded, more diverse Sacramento County-based district to Ami Bera Amerish (Ami) Babulal BeraFormer GOP lawmaker jumps into California recall election Democratic lawmakers propose B hike for State Scars of Capitol attack permeate high-security inauguration MORE, an Indian-American.

It is also worth noting that several longtime California incumbents like Reps. David Dreier, Jerry Lewis, Wally Herger, Elton Gallegy and Lynn Woolsey decided to retire this year.

Their decisions may have been based on the fact they would have had to run in newly drawn, more competitive districts.

Overall, 11 members of California’s 53-person delegation will be freshmen next Congress.

California’s incumbent members of the House had an 85 percent rate of reelection, but that is lower than House’s overall rate of 91 percent of returning incumbents.

The number of Latinos coming to Washington from California is increasing from six to nine, bringing more racial diversity to the Capitol.

Under California’s new system, entrenched incumbents are forced to defend their record and underdogs have a better chance to have their case for change heard by the voters.

Entrenched political machines and their money are less relevant.

Under this new system, the 24/7 news cycle and partisan bloggers, which encourage the loudest and most extreme voices, are not as able to define the race and control the outcome.

The bottom line is that voters have more choice among candidates competing for the middle ground, not to be a champion of one political extreme.

That is potentially creating a new brand of congressional politics.

In addition to California, 12 other states had their congressional redistricting maps drawn by an independent commission.

California is the most populous state in the union, and the election results there indicate these commissions could soon be adopted by other states.

They are also, potentially, a way to break the partisan gridlock in Washington.

This may be California dreaming. But our long congressional nightmare begs for any sign that Congress might be healing its broken system.
