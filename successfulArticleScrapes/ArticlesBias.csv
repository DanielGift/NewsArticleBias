Mr. Ginn has been closely following Sweden, which has kept children under 16 in school and let most businesses stay open while restricting gatherings of more than 50 people. His daily briefings frequently cite Sweden’s state epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, who has argued that government lockdowns lack a “scientific basis” and “people should be able to keep a reasonably normal life.” Dr. Tegnell recently estimated that 40% of Stockholm’s population would be immune to the virus by the end of May.

That could bring Sweden closer to “herd immunity” than countries that have sought to suppress spread altogether. “We need to ‘segment and shield,’ ” Mr. Ginn says, “and let the epidemic go through”: “The question is: How are you going to best protect those that are vulnerable in the larger population?”

…

Some belittle him as an “armchair epidemiologist.” He retorts that “facts and data are independent of your credentials.”

Citing academic research and government data, Mr. Ginn argued that public-health experts were focusing too much on “flattening the curve . . . while ignoring the economic shock to our system” of shuttering businesses and schools and ordering Americans to stay home.

“When 13% of Americans believe they are currently infected with COVID-19 (mathematically impossible),” he wrote, “full-on panic is blocking our ability to think clearly and determine how to deploy our resources to stop this virus.” The message was well-timed—the day he posted it, Gov. Andrew Cuomo ordered “nonessential” New York businesses to close.

Mr. Ginn’s essay drew 2.6 million page views in 24 hours—and a barrage of liberal criticism. Carl T.

Yet if Medium meant to stifle debate, its action backfired. Mr. Ginn has since become an informal organizer of a small battalion of well-credentialed dissenters.

They had fun, fun, fun, ’til their governor took their beaches away. Local officials in Orange County last weekend opened beaches amid a heat wave, drawing inland residents from Los Angeles, Riverside and San Bernardino Counties. But Gov. Gavin Newsom on Thursday overruled the county, claiming that surfers and sun worshipers weren’t respecting social-distance rules.

Local officials protested. “Despite what’s being reported, the majority of our beachgoers are complying [with] social distancing,” Huntington Beach police tweeted. San Clemente limited visitors to walking, running, swimming and surfing. “The overwhelming majority of Newport Beach residents and visitors were families or practicing social distancing,” the city’s police and fire chiefs stated. Aerial images showed the beach was far less crowded than it looked in news photos taken with a zoom lens.

The traditionally Republican county’s elected officials have denounced the governor’s heavy hand. “We have here an opportunity to embrace personal responsibility while also taking care of our neighbors,” Supervisor Michelle Park Steel said. “Governor Newsom clearly doesn’t share that faith.”

This isn’t only a fight between county conservatives and Sacramento liberals. It’s also an example of how progressives hurt the low-income people they claim to help. Mr. Newsom says he doesn’t want people coming to the coast and spreading the virus, which has hit inland counties harder.

Gavin Newsom said this week. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer defended an order that, among other things, banned the sale of paint and vegetable seeds but not liquor or lottery tickets. “Each action has been informed by the best science and epidemiology counsel there is,” she wrote in an op-ed.

But scientists are almost never unanimous, and many appeals to “science” are transparently political or ideological. Consider the story of John Ioannidis, a professor at Stanford’s School of Medicine. His expertise is wide-ranging—he juggles appointments in statistics, biomedical data, prevention research and health research and policy. Google Scholar ranks him among the world’s 100 most-cited scientists. He has published more than 1,000 papers, many of them meta-analyses—reviews of other studies. Yet he’s now found himself pilloried because he dissents from the theories behind the lockdowns—because he’s looked at the data and found good news.

In a March article for Stat News, Dr. Ioannidis argued that Covid-19 is far less deadly than modelers were assuming. He considered the experience of the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which was quarantined Feb. 4 in Japan. Nine of 700 infected passengers and crew died. Based on the demographics of the ship’s population, Dr. Ioannidis estimated that the U.S. fatality rate could be as low as 0.025% to 0.625% and put the upper bound at 0.05% to 1%—comparable to that of seasonal flu.

“If that is the true rate,” he wrote, “locking down the world with potentially tremendous social and financial consequences may be totally irrational. It’s like an elephant being attacked by a house cat. Frustrated and trying to avoid the cat, the elephant accidentally jumps off a cliff and dies.”

Dr. Ioannidis, 54, likes metaphors.

5,Finley,Allysia,wsj,"Democrats started down the road to socialism, then took an abrupt U-turn in South Carolina and have been speeding away ever since. One reason is that young voters haven’t shown up for Bernie Sanders in the numbers he’d hoped.

True, Mr. Sanders won 74% of those under 30 in last week’s Michigan primary, according to exit polls. But that was down from 81% in 2016. Their share of the electorate also declined, to 15% from 19%. Voters over 45 made up 63% of the Michigan electorate this year, compared with 55% in 2016. They overwhelmingly favored Joe Biden.

Other states show similar patterns. Under-30 voters still heavily favor Mr. Sanders, but his support in this age group fell by 36 percentage points in New Hampshire, 17 in Nevada, 14 points in Massachusetts and Virginia, and 15 in North Carolina. These states all voted before the field narrowed to Messrs. Sanders and Biden, but that wasn’t enough for Mr. Sanders to carry Michigan, as he did in 2016.

Exit polls show voters under 30 made up a smaller share of the Democratic electorate this year than in 2016 in New Hampshire (6 percentage points), South Carolina (4), Alabama (4) North Carolina (4), Tennessee (4), Texas (5), and Virginia (3). Voters over 65 increased their share by 8 points in New Hampshire, 10 in South Carolina, and 7 in Massachusetts, North Carolina and Tennessee.

Young Democrats also appear to be aging out of their enthusiasm for Mr. Sanders as they mature and start making money. Wages for young workers are rising faster than for any other age group, which may have diminished the salience of his populist economic message. Mr. Sanders’s support this year among millennials in their 30s has been considerably lower than among those in their 20s. In Michigan, he won 53% of voters 30 to 39 compared with 74% of those under 30. In Iowa, 86% of voters under 25 in Iowa supported Mr. Sanders in 2016. This year only 55% of those 25 to 29 did.",2,https://www.wsj.com/articles/young-voters-outgrow-bernie-sanders-11584398337
6,Finley,Allysia,wsj,"Pete Buttigieg seeks to become the first Democrat since 1924 to win the presidential nomination without serving as governor or U.S. senator. He’s pitching his experience as a small-city mayor as just what the country needs: “We have to start getting Washington to look like our best-run cities and towns, instead of the other way around,” he said last weekend in New Hampshire. The argument was enough to carry Mr. Buttigieg, 38, to a close second-place finish in Tuesday’s primary.

Mr. Buttigieg can point to some successes in South Bend, Ind. But his eight years of leadership, which ended last month, left the city of 101,860 neither one of America’s best-run cities nor a model of political comity. He came into South Bend like he has the presidential campaign, striking gauzy, aspirational themes. He rode the national recovery to modest economic gains but ran into trouble on the hard urban problems of crime and racial politics.

He took over a city that had long been in decline. South Bend’s population peaked at 132,445 in 1960, more than two decades before his birth. In 2011, the year he was elected, Newsweek listed South Bend as one of America’s top 10 “dying cities”—a onetime manufacturing hub that had never recovered from the shuttering of the Studebaker auto plant in 1963. “What is particularly troubling for this small city is that the number of young people declined by 2.5% during the previous decade, casting further doubt on whether this city will ever be able to recover,” Newsweek wrote.

City Hall was about to undergo a generational change. Mayor Steve Luecke was stepping down at 61 after 15 years in office. Mr. Buttigieg, then 29, jumped into the ring. “I think the fact that I’m young is precisely why I can move the ball forward and break some old habits,” he said. “The fact that I’m not currently an elected official, I think, helps me.”

“As the youngest of the candidates, 29-year-old Buttigieg exudes energy and enthusiasm,” the South Bend Tribune wrote in an editorial endorsing his candidacy. Although he was the least-known of the Democratic primary candidates, he raised the most money—enough that one opponent accused him of “trying to buy an election.”",2,https://www.wsj.com/articles/south-bends-beta-test-for-mayor-pete-11581718733

Mr. Castro may have been the Democratic convention's keynote speaker but Mr. Booker stole last night's show.

The seasoned and charismatic Newark, N.J., mayor commanded the stage not unlike New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, exhibiting a self-deprecating humor and utilizing wit to deflect questions. How'd the former Cardinal tight-end get into Stanford? A 4.0 and 1600, er, ""4.0 yards per carry and 1600 receiving yards."" The best political advice he'd gotten came from Gotham Mayor Michael Bloomberg: ""Before you become mayor, become a billionaire.""

He sidestepped questions about his love life and the gubernatorial race—or as he put it, showed off his superb ""tap-dancing"" skills. Instead he gushed about Mr. Castro's wife and pledged to challenge Mr. Christie in 2013 if Mr. Castro would run for governor in Texas in 2014. But he wanted to ""be careful"" about encouraging too much speculation because ""Chris Christie is listening"" and ""he controls the state police.""

The Newark mayor also flogged his post-ideological bona fides, even as he heralded the opportunity to turn Texas into a blue state and made several swipes about Mitt Romney's 47% remark. Changing demographics and the growing Hispanic population are helping plant ""the seed for that state to go blue very, very soon,"" he said.

He dismissed conjecture that the White House had sent him to the dog house for having defended Mr. Romney against attacks on Bain Capital. However, he carefully toed the administration's line last night, describing Bain investment managers as being very good at creating profits but not necessarily jobs.",2,https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390444180004578017901446095508
8,Finley,Allysia,wsj,"Pop star Taylor Swift raked in $266 million from her 2018 album tour and tops the Forbes list of highest-paid celebrities. So it’s ironic that progressives are hailing Ms. Swift, 29, as a martyr of capitalism. She complained that a music agent (and Democratic fundraiser) backed by a private-equity firm was refusing to let her play her own tunes Sunday at the American Music Awards, where she’ll be feted as Artist of the Decade.

“Unfortunately, @TaylorSwift13 is one of many whose work has been threatened by a private equity firm. They’re gobbling up more and more of our economy, costing jobs and crushing entire industries,” Elizabeth Warren tweeted. The Massachusetts senator needs to calm down.

At issue is a contractual dispute between Ms. Swift and Scooter Braun over the rights to her original recordings, known as masters. Mr. Braun this year bought Big Machine Records, the label that catapulted Ms. Swift’s career some 15 years ago, for a reported $300 million with the backing of the Carlyle private-equity firm.

When Ms. Swift signed with Big Machine, she also relinquished the rights to her recordings in return for an advance on record sales and promotional support.

That’s how most stars get started. The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry estimates that a major record company invests between $500,000 and $2 million in a newly signed artist between advances, recordings, video production, tour support and marketing. Artists earn royalties only after the label recoups its advances from record sales.",2,https://www.wsj.com/articles/liberal-teardrops-on-taylor-swifts-guitar-11574379813
9,Finley,Allysia,wsj,"Few observers view crimson-red Kentucky as a political bellwether. But next week’s gubernatorial election, pitting Republican Gov. Matt Bevin against Democratic Attorney General Andy Beshear, may answer a question on many minds: Can an unpopular GOP incumbent with a penchant for provocation win re-election amid a divided electorate?

Donald Trump won Kentucky by 30 points in 2016 with strong support from blue-collar workers and religious conservatives. Two years earlier Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell handily defeated Alison Lundergan Grimes, the Democratic secretary of state. Republicans hold five of the state’s six U.S. House seats; the exception is a district surrounding Louisville.

But Democrats do better at the state level. They controlled the state House from 1923 to 2016 and the governorship for 36 of the 40 years before Mr. Bevin’s election in 2015. Republicans now control both legislative chambers, but the attorney general and secretary of state are Democrats.

Kentucky isn’t likely to turn blue anytime soon, though it resembles Pennsylvania and Ohio with its shrinking Appalachian towns, economically diversifying industrial outposts, and metropolitan areas drawing young, college-educated voters. These shifting demographics help explain why Mr. Bevin’s re-election has turned into a dogfight.

The GOP governor’s roots are blue-collar, not bluegrass. He was raised in rural New Hampshire and attended Washington and Lee University in Virginia on an ROTC scholarship. After serving in the U.S. Army, he did a turn as a financial consultant and moved to Louisville to manage investments.",2,https://www.wsj.com/articles/kentucky-governors-race-tests-trumps-re-election-strategy-11572649034
10,Finley,Allysia,wsj,"Pacific Gas and Electric Co. is getting incinerated by California politicians for shutting off power to two million residents amid heavy, dry winds. The publicly traded San Francisco-based utility has been found responsible for two dozen or so wildfires since 2016, some caused by power lines sagging from steel towers more than a century old.

The purpose of the blackouts was to avoid more damage from an aging grid that has not been adequately maintained. In January PG&E filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy to restructure tens of billions of dollars in liabilities, including for wildfire. Democrats, including Gov. Gavin Newsom, are predictably lambasting the company for prioritizing profits over safety. San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo says he wants to turn it into a nonprofit.

Yet PG&E exemplifies the left’s “stakeholder” model, according to which businesses are accountable not only to their shareholders but also their workers, the environment and local communities and society at large. In practice, that means businesses exist to serve their political overlords.

Utilities are among the most heavily regulated businesses. In California, their rates and return on equity—that is, profits—are set by the California Public Utilities Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Every three years PG&E must submit funding plans to the CPUC, which holds public hearings with “stakeholders,” including customers and activist groups.

The commission and the state Legislature can also dictate energy investments. State law requires utilities to obtain 60% of their power from “renewable” sources by 2030. The commission has also ordered utilities to buy energy from homeowners with solar panels, paying them a higher rate than wholesale power providers get. Last year the commission directed PG&E to install 7,500 electric-car charging stations at apartment buildings and workplaces.",2,https://www.wsj.com/articles/stakeholder-capitalism-in-action-11571696787

Democrats have recently sought to impose the state’s online privacy, auto emissions and corporate-diversity diktats nationwide. Businesses have no choice but to abide by the rules California makes if they want to reach the state’s 39 million residents. Applying those rules nationally makes sense for companies that want to avoid market fragmentation.

Now state lawmakers are trying to force the National Collegiate Athletic Association to do the same. Last week the Legislature in Sacramento unanimously passed the Fair Pay to Play Act, which would require large public and private universities in the state to let student athletes accept compensation for use of their names, likenesses and images.

This would violate the NCAA’s bylaws, yet the bill forbids the organization from punishing colleges and athletes that break its rules. Letting California’s college athletes pocket endorsement money would put colleges in other states at a competitive disadvantage, so the NCAA would be under pressure to drop its longstanding pay-for-play prohibition.

That’s what the bill’s supporters are hoping for. Los Angeles Lakers megastar LeBron James, who skirted prohibitions on amateurs accepting gifts as a high-school player and then skipped college, has tweeted an endorsement: “California can change the game. This is only right waaaayy overdue.”

Letting college athletes cash in appeals both to the free-market right and the social-justice left. Why shouldn’t student athletes get paid for their hard work and talents, which earn tens of millions of dollars for their coaches, colleges and the NCAA?",2,https://www.wsj.com/articles/californias-dreaming-about-paying-student-athletes-11568577090

The game was less competitive than the score suggests. The American women got 10 shots on goal compared with the Netherlands’ single strike. At the end the U.S. women hoisted their fourth World Cup trophy—there have been eight tournaments in all—complementing their four Olympic gold medals. No other country has won more than two World Cups, though many have been investing millions of dollars in their women’s teams.

There was plenty of controversy. The U.S. women were criticized for their unapologetic displays of supremacy, especially running up the score to 13-0 in a first-round game against Thailand. Defender Ali Krieger was slammed for saying the U.S. has “the best team in the world and the second-best team in the world”—meaning that America’s benchwarmers could beat any of the other 23 teams’ starters. ‘‘Arrogant, entitled and self-centred, the US women’s soccer team couldn’t be more Trumpian,” seethed one Irish columnist.

At the same time, U.S. top scorer Megan Rapinoe antagonized the president by saying she’d spurn an invitation to the White House. Liberals also hailed the American women’s discrimination lawsuit against the U.S. Soccer Federation for paying men’s players more.

The main reason for the pay disparity is the prize money FIFA, soccer’s international governing body, allocates for the men’s World Cup is more than 10 times as large as the women’s. But all of this misses the ball. The U.S. has long been a beacon of opportunity for female athletes. America’s superiority in women’s soccer is owing to both the players’ athletic prowess and the country’s democratic ideals, which have helped the national team flourish.",2,https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-u-s-women-rule-the-world-11562626251
13,Finley,Allysia,wsj,"A decade ago many conservatives watched with delight as deep-blue California struggled beneath double-digit unemployment and gaping budget deficits. But the schadenfreude faded as the Golden State’s fiscal and economic picture brightened—at least on paper. Unemployment has dipped to 4.2%, and the state this year recorded a $21 billion surplus, due in part to a 2012 tax hike on the wealthy. Gov. Gavin Newsom this week signed a $215 billion budget that boosts spending on housing, schools and child care. It even includes a sales-tax exemption for diapers.

So are we seeing the triumph of progressive policies in California? Have high levels of taxation and government spending at long last bought prosperity? Hardly. Californians are paying, one way or another, for their state’s liberal decadences.

Though the state is home to 12% of the U.S. population, nearly half of the nation’s “unsheltered” homeless now live in California. Last year the number of homeless rose 16% in Los Angeles and 17% in San Francisco. In Los Angeles the explosion of homelessness has given rise to a host of related problems: public defecation, rodent infestations and medieval diseases like typhus. Liberals blame a shortage of “affordable housing,” which notably is a function of local zoning and state environmental policies that for decades have limited development. As usual, the left believes the solution is more government spending.

Voters in Los Angeles have voted to raise property and sales taxes and spend the money on reducing homelessness, but they have continued to oppose building new shelters. San Francisco Mayor London Breed last fall opposed a ballot initiative to impose a gross-receipts tax on large businesses to curb homelessness. The city was already spending more than $300 million on homeless services, she said, and “before we double the tax bill overnight, San Franciscans deserve accountability for the money they are already paying.” Sixty percent of voters supported the measure anyway.

Desperate to mitigate the scourge of vagrancy, Californians last fall approved $6 billion in state bonds for housing.

14,Finley,Allysia,wsj,"The Constitution guarantees due process and equal protection under the laws. Democrats in California are pushing legislation that would eviscerate both and set a terrifying precedent that threatens to send any project opposed by liberals—toll roads, housing developments, even private schools—into a purgatory of regulation.

For nearly two decades, Sen. Dianne Feinstein and a rear guard of environmentalists have been trying to block the Los Angeles-based company Cadiz from developing a groundwater basin in the Mojave Desert. In 1998 Cadiz began plans for a groundwater bank on 50 square miles of private land in the Mojave overlying two huge watersheds that have accumulated tens of millions of acre-feet of water over the centuries and could sustain the state’s 39 million residents for years.

Cadiz wants to store runoff from the Colorado River and mountain streams during wet years like the last one and transport some of the groundwater each year—about 50,000 acre-feet—to urban areas. A groundwater bank is akin to a savings account in which owners save earnings in times of plenty to draw down in lean years. Storing water underground reduces evaporation and environmental impacts, which is why green groups like the Natural Resources Defense Council have long preferred groundwater banks to reservoirs.

The U.S. Interior Department approved Cadiz’s plan in 2002, but this was only the start of a tortuous regulatory review that seems to have no end. Mrs. Feinstein has lobbied regulators at all levels to intervene, claiming the Cadiz project would harm the Mojave’s rich wildlife, including the bighorn sheep and desert tortoise.

To assuage environmental objections, Cadiz scaled back its proposed water exports by two thirds and negotiated to use Arizona & California Railroad’s right of way to build a 43-mile underground pipeline connecting to Southern California’s water supply. In 2012 the Santa Margarita Water District approved a final environmental impact report under the California Environmental Quality Act, concluding that the project’s only significant effects would be temporary dust from construction and population growth made possible by an expanded water supply. San Bernardino County also signed off on a plan to ensure Cadiz’s operations would not threaten the aquifer’s water quality or desert wildlife.",2,https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-flood-of-regulations-threatens-to-leave-california-dry-11559341185
15,Finley,Allysia,wsj,"Starbucks plans to eliminate plastic straws from its stores by next year. Lyft has committed to “carbon neutrality.” Candy-maker Mondelez says all its wrappers will be recyclable by 2025, and Goldman Sachs has banished paper cups. But there’s scant evidence that these gestures benefit customers, shareholders, employees or the environment.

Consider Starbucks’ decision to ditch plastic straws for recyclable lids, supposedly reducing plastic waste. Straws are a tiny share of waste, accounting by one estimate for only about 0.025% of the eight million tons of plastic that flow annually into the ocean. Anyhow, the new lids contain more plastic than the straws. The lids are ostensibly recyclable—but consumers have to separate them from the cups and throw them into recycling bins. Who’s going to do that?

Even the lids that make it into bins will probably end up in landfills. They’re made of polypropylene, which used to be sent to China to recycle. But China recently stopped accepting U.S. waste, complaining it was too dirty. At least that saves the carbon emissions from shipping it across the Pacific.

Then there are practical concerns. Starbucks in 2008 set a “bold goal” to serve 25% of its beverages in reusable cups by 2015. It later revised the goal down to 5%, in part because it was inefficient for baristas to wash dirty cups while other customers waited. Cleaning mugs also requires water and paper towels, which end up in the trash.

As Bloomberg Businessweek recently recounted, Dunkin’ Donuts spent nearly a decade devising an alternative to foam cups. Some decomposable cups were too expensive in large volumes, while others, which were manufactured from recycled materials, simply collapsed. Dunkin’ settled on cups made from “ethically sourced paper.” In most places, they can’t be recycled.

Goldman Sachs last year decided to ban paper cups from its offices and asked employees to bring mugs instead. Earlier this year, the bank announced it would stop carrying throwaway utensils in its cafeterias and replaced plastic soda bottles with aluminum cans in vending machines. Too many employees were throwing the items in the trash rather than recycling.

But how many bankers are willing to wash dishes at the office? Many will instead eat out. As for bottles vs. cans, aluminum production consumes huge amounts of energy and produces masses of CO2.

There are other actions corporations could take that would be more beneficial to the environment—for instance, setting office thermostats a few degrees higher or providing employees paid time-off for tree-planting or highway-cleaning projects.

So why are businesses taking these costly and often counterproductive actions? They’re trying to show employees, customers and shareholders—including institutional investors with a political agenda—they care about the environment. But how many investors buy shares in a company because of its “sustainable” policies? And how much do office paper-cup purges aggravate employees and reduce productivity? How much do the higher costs of these policies reduce earnings and lower share prices?

How many consumers care if the food they buy comes in recyclable packages? How much do higher costs from more expensive materials reduce purchases? How often do businesses bother to undertake cost-benefit analyses before implementing such policies—and how often are they merely following the lead of other companies or bowing to political pressure?

Perhaps the primary reason for such policies is to meet a demand for virtue signaling. Customers want minor inconveniences. They can feel good about driving 10 minutes to buy a $5 cup of coffee as long as they feel bad about it.

As state treasurer, Ms. Raimondo pushed through the nation’s boldest public pension reforms in 2011, which reduced political pressure to raise taxes. Rhode Islanders elected her governor in 2014. Early in her first term, she promoted a business-friendly environment. But that reform legacy and Rhode Island’s future are now in question.

The youthful Democratic governor with national ambitions is veering left as the Ocean State’s economy wobbles. Public unions and progressives smelling political weakness are goading her to sign legislation that would repudiate her reforms and economic agenda. Will Ms. Raimondo sell out Rhode Island taxpayers?

Despite pockets of cultural conservatism, Rhode Island is a heavily Democratic state whose politics are dominated by public-sector unions. More than two-thirds of government employees are unionized; only New York’s percentage is higher.

Ms. Raimondo, who co-founded the venture firm Point Judith Capital in 2001, attained the governor’s office in 2014 by surviving a brutal three-way primary. She campaigned on turning around the economically struggling state, which got slammed by the housing crisis. Her reform message attracted well-heeled donors who hoped she would give other Democrats courage to tackle public unions.

During her first two years, she resisted calls to raise taxes and wooed businesses to Rhode Island with government handouts and a promise of fiscal stability. But as her party lurched left, she began to tiptoe that way too.",2,https://www.wsj.com/articles/blue-state-politics-are-eroding-little-rhodys-big-reforms-11556920706
17,Finley,Allysia,wsj,"Drug manufacturers and pharmacy-benefit managers are bickering over who’s to blame for rising prescription prices at the drugstore. At a Senate hearing in February, CEOs of seven drugmakers took turns lambasting PBMs, and on Tuesday the benefits managers will get the chance to defend themselves. As usual, the biggest culprit is government, which is why the Trump administration’s plan to ameliorate the problem should be met with caution.

As AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot recently noted, the current system of drug pricing “is not sustainable—for patients, payers and society as a whole.” The way that system works—or rather the way it’s evolved to operate, since nobody thinks it works—drugmakers pay rebates to PBMs, which negotiate discounts for insurers in return for favorable placement on the list of covered medications.

These quasi-kickbacks were once mutually beneficial, but now drugmakers accuse PBMs of driving up list prices with increasingly greedy demands for rebates. That’s bad for consumers, who pay full price if they haven’t met their deductibles or fall into Medicare’s coverage gap. It’s also bad for pharmaceutical companies. Sanofi has said it raised U.S. list prices by 4.6% on average last year, but its average net price after rebates fell 8%. PBMs say they pass rebates on to insurers, which in turn reduce premiums. But it’s unclear how true that is because the contracts among manufacturers, PBMs and insurers aren’t transparent.

Enter the Health and Human Services Department, which proposes to restructure rebates in Medicare to reduce out-of-pocket costs. The intentions are good, but the rule’s complexity may produce even more opportunities for regulatory arbitrage.

HHS wants to remove a “safe harbor” for drug rebates under a 1977 federal anti-kickback law. That law bars manufacturers from issuing coupons to Medicare patients that might induce them to choose more-expensive drugs at their insurer’s expense. But in the 1990s HHS exempted some discounts, including rebates that promote price competition. Drugmakers started using rebates in part to dodge the ban on coupons. Now HHS wants to limit the safe harbor so that only direct-to-consumer rebates funneled through PBMs—but not coupons—would be allowed. This seems to add needless complexity to an already convoluted payment system.",2,https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-dubious-prescription-price-plan-11554503340
18,Finley,Allysia,wsj,"The decision by Cook County prosecutors to drop charges against “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett for staging a fake hate crime against himself prompted a fierce response from Mayor Rahm Emanuel and the Chicago Police Department last week. Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, who is running to replace Mr. Emanuel in Tuesday’s election, was more circumspect.

“I think it’s really important that the state’s attorney be allowed to provide a fuller explanation as time goes on,” Ms. Preckwinkle said in a debate Tuesday. On Friday she added: “There are a lot of questions. . . . Only through a focus on transparency and accountability can, I think, the public have some confidence that justice was done.”

This muted response raised eyebrows, since Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx is a stalwart ally and Ms. Preckwinkle’s former chief of staff. The Smollett absolution presented an unexpected political gift to opponent Lori Lightfoot, a former assistant U.S. attorney, who has made fighting public corruption the theme of her campaign. Ms. Lightfoot demanded a “fulsome explanation” for why prosecutors let Mr. Smollett walk. She called the decision “demoralizing to police” who had investigated the allegedly phony hate crime.

Chicago’s mayoral election is a power struggle between Democratic Party bosses and activists—the city’s rusted-out machine versus its progressive grass roots. And the Smollett case has become a key flashpoint.

The nation’s third-largest city has long been ruled by the Democratic machine. Although Mayor Emanuel once served as a Washington power broker, he was never embraced by Chicago’s machine or unions. Kingpin Richard M. Daley served as mayor for 22 years (1989-2011), but Mr. Emanuel is stepping down this year after two tumultuous terms rather than fight an uphill re-election battle amid deteriorating city finances, increasing property taxes, high crime and a restive electorate.",2,https://www.wsj.com/articles/after-smollett-chicagos-mayoral-runoff-turns-nasty-11554057616

Founded in 1933, it focuses on practical learning: There are no seminars on intersectionality or cultural appropriation, no rock-climbing walls, organic vegetable gardens or ethnic theme houses. In other respects, Monroe is similar to other small colleges. It has dining halls, libraries, student clubs and a Title IX coordinator. “I have 850 athletes, 1,000 people in dormitories, 1,000 foreign students,” says Marc Jerome, Monroe’s president and something of a force of nature, on a recent visit to the Journal’s offices. “We look and feel like a traditional college—an urban college.” Its main campus in the Bronx, on New York City’s northern rim, and it has sites in nearby New Rochelle and the Caribbean nation of Saint Lucia.

Monroe provides training in fields like information technology, nursing and culinary arts, and its student outcomes are exemplary. A Monroe student is 10 times as likely to graduate on time as one who enrolls at a nearby community college, and the college’s 3.9% student-loan default rate is among the lowest in the state. It also ranks among the top three colleges in New York for graduating Latino and black students.

Yet Monroe is controversial because it is organized under the tax code as a for-profit entity. For the past decade Mr. Jerome has battled liberal officials, in the administrations of both President Obama and Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who insist that “predatory for-profits” are harming low-income students.

The “language alone causes harm,” Mr. Jerome laments; it “makes it like a culture war issue.” He’s especially stung by “the use of the word ‘predatory’ to describe every proprietary institution,” which he says “is just wrong and immediately stifles thoughtful discussion.”",2,https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-successful-school-a-progressive-target-11552688550

When Americans think of California, they tend to think of Silicon Valley, Hollywood and the golden coast—""a place where the grass is really greener, warm, wet and wild"" as Santa Barbara native Katy Perry swoons in ""California Gurls.""

The 25-year-old sixth-grade teacher was found dead in her home near Lancaster, Pa., naked from the waist down. She had been beaten, strangled and sexually assaulted. Police collected a semen sample, ran it through a DNA database, and found no matches. The crime went into a cold-case file.

In June police arrested a 49-year-old suspect, Raymond Rowe, a local disc jockey known as “DJ Freez.” They found him with the help of Parabon NanoLabs, a Reston, Va.-based forensic DNA company. “There was well over 1,000 people investigated for Christy’s murder, and Raymond Rowe was never on that list,” CeCe Moore, who heads Parabon’s genetic-genealogy lab, tells me. Ms. Moore, 50, has used a combination of modern genetic technology and old-fashioned family trees to help law enforcement track down criminals long on the lam.

An estimated 18 million people have taken at-home DNA tests from companies like AncestryDNA and 23andMe. The tests can help you discover distant relatives or learn about your ethnic composition. Sen. Elizabeth Warren famously took one in October to test her claim that she had Cherokee blood. It turned up evidence of a Native American ancestor six to 10 generations back, but didn’t have the desired political effect. This month it was reported that she had apologized privately to a leader of the Cherokee Nation.

Ms. Moore doesn’t have much to say about Ms. Warren, but notes that most people who take tests to corroborate family stories of Native American ancestry “show no genetic evidence of that oral history”—though it’s possible a Native American ancestor “did indeed exist but is too far back in time to be detected.”

24,Finley,Allysia,wsj,"California Gov. Gavin Newsom made a down payment on his promise to address the Golden State’s housing challenges last week by suing Huntington Beach, a predominantly Republican redoubt in Orange County. The city’s crime? Rezoning a parcel of land to restrict low-income housing. “Some cities are refusing to do their part to address this [housing] crisis and willfully stand in violation of California law,” Mr. Newsom proclaimed.

Like most liberals, Mr. Newsom wants to use litigation and regulation to solve California’s housing problems. It appears lost on him that most of these problems are the result of regulation and litigation.

Home prices and rents in California have long exceeded those in most other states as demand from its booming population has vastly outstripped supply. Over the past 50-plus years, California’s population has doubled. Lawmakers in Sacramento responded with more than a dozen laws intended to increase the housing supply, though most have had the opposite effect.

In 1967 the state mandated that local governments plan “for the housing needs of all economic segments of the community.” The California Department of Housing and Community Development has set eight-year housing quotas for different demographics—very low, low, moderate and above-moderate income. Cities must formulate plans to ensure enough land is zoned to meet their quotas. These blueprints must also “promote infill development and equity” by rehabilitating existing structures, “protect environmental and agricultural resources,” and ensure that housing “is located in an area appropriately planned for growth,” not to mention reducing greenhouse gas emissions and encouraging “efficient” land use.

In other words, the state has been trying to cram more people into tightly packed urban spaces along the coasts—only about 1% of land in coastal urban areas is vacant and developable—where land costs are astronomical. And as demographers Joel Kotkin and Wendell Cox have pointed out, California has pushed policies that severely restrict or even prohibit construction of detached single-family homes on undeveloped land.",2,https://www.wsj.com/articles/californias-liberal-governor-hauls-a-conservative-city-to-court-11549060961

As the federal government shutdown heads toward its third week, parents in Los Angeles are also bracing for a possible shutdown of the public-school system. On Jan. 10, the 33,000 members of United Teachers Los Angeles plan to go on strike. The Los Angeles Unified School District is trying to stanch red ink and avert a state takeover, while UTLA seeks to arrest a decade long decline in membership. But like the standoff between President Trump and congressional Democrats over funding a border wall, this brewing schoolyard brawl is as much about politics as it is about money.

The Supreme Court’s Janus ruling last summer barred governments from forcing nonunion employees to subsidize collective bargaining and union political activities. Teachers unions across the country now face increased pressure to come up with big gains at the bargaining table to retain members. They must also find new sources of revenue to compensate for lost “agency fees,” previously assessed from employees who opt not to join the union.

In 2017, school reformers and charter advocates captured a majority on the Los Angeles Unified School District board. Last May, the board hired Austin Beutner, a former investment banker and Los Angeles Times publisher, to turn around the financially and academically struggling district. Only 22% of fourth-graders scored proficient in math on the National Assessment of Educational Progress in 2017, which is less than the 30% average among large city school districts. Despite additional state resources for low-income schools, a learning chasm persists between whites and minorities. Only 14% of Latinos were rated proficient, compared with 61% of whites.

Charter schools, which enroll about 154,000 students districtwide, provide low-income parents an escape valve. But tens of thousands of students remain on waiting lists and many families are moving to nearby districts with better public schools.

Should the social-media giant remove misleading and vile content, opening itself to charges of censorship? Or is it better to take a laissez faire approach and let falsehoods spread unchecked, even if it invites criticism from politicians?

Now chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg and chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg find themselves at the center of a viral fake-news story. The New York Times last week published a story purporting that Facebook executives whitewashed Russia’s use of their platform to spread misinformation during the 2016 election, among other lapses, and then employed crude tactics to deflect public furor.

The left’s reaction has been as overblown as the story. “Embattled and in over his head, Mark Zuckerberg should—at least—step down as Facebook chairman,” read a Washington Post column. A Times media columnist chimed in: “The Facebook Movie Told Us What We Needed to Know About Mark Zuckerberg.” Hint: It isn’t flattering.

Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal proclaimed the Times story another “chilling reminder that big tech can no longer be trusted.” Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Mr. Blumenthal and two other Democratic Senators demanded that the Justice Department investigate whether Facebook hid information and retaliated against critics.

Both Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg have sidestepped responsibility for Facebook’s alleged transgressions. “The reality of running a company of more than 10,000 people is that you’re not going to know everything that’s going on,” Mr. Zuckerberg said.

Republicans then exploited their power over decennial redistricting to bolster majorities in Congress and legislatures while advancing conservative reforms including right-to-work legislation, school vouchers and limits on the power of government unions.

Democrats now aim to copy the GOP playbook. Led by former Attorney General Eric Holder, liberals this year targeted governorships and state legislatures from Nevada to Maine. Capitalizing on disgust with Donald Trump, Democrats picked up seven governorships and flipped six legislative chambers.

As a result, Democrats next year will boast complete control of 14 state governments—six more than they do now—including Colorado, New Mexico and Nevada. They also broke the GOP’s hegemony in Kansas, Michigan, New Hampshire and Wisconsin.

These gains will strengthen Democrats’ hand over redistricting after the 2020 census, effectively foreclosing conservative reform in the majority of states for the next four years, and advancing a liberal agenda on the local level that has foundered in Washington. Yet Democrats owe their success more to Republican turmoil than any triumph of progressive policies.

Scott Walker narrowly lost his bid for a third term to Democrat Tony Evers, the superintendent of public instruction.

But the Packers have struggled during the first half of the season and will have to get better fast to keep their playoff dreams alive.

Wisconsin Republicans are also scrambling as Election Day approaches. The GOP has maintained a lock on the statehouse since 2011. Two years ago, voters here backed Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton, the first time a Republican presidential candidate carried Wisconsin since 1984. But Democrats this year prevailed in two special elections for state Senate seats in districts Mr. Trump won by 17 points. In April a liberal won an open state Supreme Court seat for the first time since 1995, in part by prevailing in the traditionally conservative suburbs of Green Bay and the Fox Valley.

Buoyed by these victories, Democrats this fall are running a spread offense. They have targeted several more Senate seats with the aim of taking a majority. Speaker Paul Ryan’s departure has given them a shot at his Janesville U.S. House seat. If the blue wave is strong enough, Democrats could even unseat Republican Rep. Glenn Grothman, who represents the Milwaukee exurbs.

But their paramount objective is to sack Gov. Scott Walker, who sharply curbed public-union power in the state.

Mr. Stefanowski’s lament seems to reflect the mood of voters. In Quinnipiac University’s latest state poll in August, only 25% of respondents approved of Democratic Gov. Dannel Malloy’s job performance. Seventy-one percent rated the state’s economy as “not so good” or “poor.” And with good reason: Connecticut’s economy has shrunk at an annual compounded rate of 0.5% since 2009.

The story is set in the sleepy fictional backwater of Maycomb, Ala., in 1935. A black man, Tom Robinson, stands accused by 19-year-old Mayella Ewell and her father—lower-class whites who live on relief—of rape, a capital offense. Atticus Finch is Tom’s defense lawyer, and the trial turns into a public spectacle—“a gala occasion”—as all the townspeople flock to the county courthouse.

Mayella alleges that after she asked Tom for help breaking down a dresser in her house, he took advantage of the situation to violate her.

For Republicans, this year’s midterm elections have that sort of ominous feel. Liberal intensity has been building across the country, fueled by revulsion at Donald Trump.

Arizona, the land of Barry Goldwater, has long leaned right. Between 1952 and 2016, Democrats carried the state in only one presidential election, in 1996.

36,Finley,Allysia,wsj,"ObamaCare made it more difficult for health insurers to turn a profit on individual plans, since it prohibited them from charging consumers more based on their medical risks. But the law also created a huge growth opportunity for insurers: Medicaid.

Over the past decade, federal and state spending on Medicaid has nearly doubled to $570 billion—roughly as much as the revenues of United Health, CVS, Anthem, Aetna and Humana put together. California alone will spend nearly $100 billion on Medicaid this year.

The Medicaid rolls predictably swelled during the Great Recession as people lost jobs and left the workforce. But many never returned to work. ObamaCare gave states the option, starting in 2014, to expand Medicaid eligibility to able-bodied people earning up to 133% of the poverty line. The feds promised to pick up nearly all the costs.

Two-thirds of states have cashed in on this “free” government lunch. Between 2008 and 2016, Medicaid enrollment nationwide rose 24 million to a total of 71 million, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. By comparison, only five million more Americans signed up for plans on the private individual market.

Struggling to manage this Medicaid surge, states have increasingly come to rely on private health insurers. About 270 “managed-care organizations” administer half of federal Medicaid dollars. Under these arrangements, insurers are paid a capitated rate—that is, a flat monthly payment per enrollee, set to reflect what actuaries estimate will be the average cost to provide covered services. Unlike on the ObamaCare exchanges, insurers are paid higher “premiums” for covering sicker patients.",2,https://www.wsj.com/articles/obamacare-is-robbing-medicaids-sickest-patients-1532558335
37,Finley,Allysia,wsj,"Nine years into a bull market, housing prices in California have reached record highs. Investors are enjoying soaring capital gains, which in turn has created a windfall for the state budget. California is now sitting on $16 billion in budget reserves while many states struggle to balance their budgets. But beneath this patina of prosperity, many cities are careening toward bankruptcy. Schools are laying off employees and slashing programs. Some districts complain they are having trouble retaining teachers. What gives?

California property taxes, which fund local governments, are capped by the state constitution’s Proposition 13 at 1% of a home’s value and can’t rise by more than 2% annually. So although housing costs have soared since the recession—the median home price in San Francisco is $1.6 million—cities and school districts aren’t rolling in the dough.

At the same time, municipalities are getting socked with big bills from the California Public Employees’ Retirement System and the California State Teachers’ Retirement System, known as Calpers and Calstrs. For years the two funds overestimated their investment returns while underestimating their expected payouts. This helped keep local-government and worker pension costs low for a while, but now the state, cities and school districts are having to play catch-up.

School-district pension costs have more than doubled since 2013, and the state legislative analyst’s office predicts they will climb another 30% over the next two years. For every dollar cities spend on worker salaries, they have to pay 32 cents to Calpers. This effective payroll “tax” charged by Calpers will increase to nearly 50 cents on the dollar by 2024. Retirement costs already equal 44% of teacher pay in San Francisco.

“Cities want to make it clear that our foundation is rocky at best,” Dane Hutchings, a representative of the League of California Cities, told the Calpers Investment Committee last month. “It’s crunch time, and quite frankly, we simply cannot stand another market slowdown or substandard returns.”",2,https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-california-is-losing-teachers-and-laying-off-secretaries-1530314621

39,Finley,Allysia,wsj,"‘California finally deserves a great Governor, one who understands borders, crime and lowering taxes. John Cox is the man—he’ll be the best Governor you’ve ever had,” President Trump tweeted last week. Who is John Cox?

He’s the leading GOP candidate for governor in California’s June 5 jungle primary. All candidates regardless of party appear on the same ballot, and the top two finishers face off in November.

The 62-year-old father of four is a devout, pro-life Catholic and supply-side conservative who served on the national steering committee for Jack Kemp’s 1988 presidential campaign. As a businessman, he founded several successful professional ventures.

He’s also a serial political candidate. He ran for the U.S. House (2000) and Senate (2002) in his native Illinois, losing both times in the primary. He came up short again in a 2004 bid for Cook County recorder of deeds. Four years later, he threw his hat in the ring for president—yes, president of the United States.

Mr. Cox’s campaign for governor of California is another long shot. But House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy has persuaded President Trump that Mr. Cox could help Republicans hold the House in November. Here’s the calculation: Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom has a decisive polling lead, but Mr. Cox is vying for second place along with former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, a Democrat. A GOP shutout at the top of the ticket in November could dampen Republican enthusiasm. And if Mr. Villaraigosa makes it to the general election, he could boost Latino turnout and help Democrats flip the seven California GOP House districts where Hillary Clinton outpolled Mr. Trump in 2016.",2,https://www.wsj.com/articles/welcome-to-the-jungle-primary-1527201664
40,Finley,Allysia,wsj,"Detroit's bankruptcy—the largest municipal filing in U.S. history—has turned some common assumptions about local government on their head. No longer should anyone believe that general-obligation bonds backed by a government's ""full faith and credit"" are risk-free or that public pensions can't be cut.

But all of this was already clear to Richard Ravitch. Forty years ago, during New York City's fiscal crisis, Mr. Ravitch struck a deal with the state, city, banks and unions to avert bankruptcy, an experience that the veteran budget wonk chronicles in his memoir, ""So Much to Do: A Full Life of Business, Politics, and Confronting Fiscal Crises."" It comes as no surprise that Mr. Ravitch was recently appointed by federal judge Steven Rhodes as a court consultant in Detroit's bankruptcy.

Mr. Ravitch, now 80 years old, grew up on Manhattan's Upper West Side, where he attended the progressive Lincoln School run by Columbia University Teachers College. His rebellion against his New York roots took the form of enrolling at Oberlin College in Ohio, but it was short-lived: When his father unexpectedly died of lymphoma, Mr. Ravitch came home and finished his degree at Columbia. He got his first taste of machine politics when he joined the Tammany Hall club, where he was told that ""if too many Democrats voted in the 1952 presidential election, too many Democrats might vote in the 1953 primary,"" thus diluting the machine vote. ""This was my introduction to the reality that politics is complicated,"" he writes.

So Much to Do By Richard Ravitch

(PublicAffairs, 254 pages, $26.99)

Mr. Ravitch is an old-school liberal who believes that government has an important role to play in improving the lots of the less fortunate. During the 1960s, for example, he lobbied aggressively for more government investment in affordable housing and helped establish the New York City Housing Development Corp., which he describes as ""the leading local housing agency in the nation.""

But he is also a pragmatist and believes that politicians do a disservice when they promise more than what they can reasonably expect to deliver. A case in point: the New York State Urban Development Corp., which Republican Gov. Nelson Rockefeller established in 1968 to acquire real estate via eminent domain in order to build public housing. The governor, Mr. Ravitch writes, made the common ""mistake of overestimating government's capacity to do good.""

The UDC was overleveraged and on the verge of bankruptcy when, in January 1975, Gov. Hugh Carey called in Mr. Ravitch. He rescued the failing UDC by persuading the legislature to agree to a $110 million bailout and then setting up a shell agency to issue new debt to repay old borrowing. Ultimately ""all the notes and bonds eventually got paid, with interest."" Gov. Carey rewarded Mr. Ravitch by handing him another herculean task: saving New York City.

By May 1975, the city was on the verge of bankruptcy. During Mayor John Lindsay's first term, from 1966 to 1969, city spending increased by nearly 50%, partly driven by new federal programs but also by soaring labor costs. The municipal workforce expanded to 350,000 from 250,000, while the cost of each employee increased by nearly 8% annually. ""Union leaders, then as now, earned their salaries by using their political clout to get more benefits for their members,"" Mr. Ravitch writes. Wall Street banks, he added, ""profited from underwriting city debt.""

Yet Mr. Ravitch neglects to note the effect on the city's finances of New York's 1967 Taylor Law, which authorized public-union collective bargaining and drove up labor costs, and the 1966 adoption of a citywide personal income tax, which was initially levied with a top marginal rate of 2%. (It's now 3.876%.) New tax revenues fueled government expansion, which crowded out the private sector. By 1975, New York City had lost more than 500,000 private-sector jobs and had over a million people on welfare, recalls Mr. Ravitch. The city's troubles came to a head when banks refused to lend it more money to roll over its debts. Union leaders ""cursed the banks,"" even though they had financed the political-labor machine. Police blocked traffic, firefighters called in sick and sanitation workers went on strike to protest proposed layoffs.

Mr. Ravitch negotiated a deal. The state would borrow $750 million to advance to the city; unions would agree to a wage freeze; banks and city pension funds would buy new government bonds; and Washington would extend $2.3 billion in credit in return for new taxes and public employees contributing to their pension funds. (Before 1976, workers paid little, if anything, toward their pensions.)

According to Mr. Ravitch, the heroes of this crisis were union leaders who agreed to use public pension-fund assets to buy the city's debt. The decision of Albert Shanker, the president of the United Federation of Teachers, to buy the new government bonds was ""courageous,"" Mr. Ravitch writes. Yet unions were in fact bailing themselves out with the taxpayer money in the pension funds, something the book neglects to point out. Shanker, an old friend, later invited Mr. Ravitch ""to the union's headquarters to help him enjoy all the food and wine that members of the public had sent to thank him for helping to save the city.""

In his memoir, Mr. Ravitch can seem the Forrest Gump of New York politics, serving as CEO of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and as the state's lieutenant governor, among other posts. He has friends in all corners of the state, and his personal affinities sometimes cloud his analysis. He throws in a good word for most Democratic politicians, except Govs. Mario and Andrew Cuomo, whom he portrays as insular and ham-handed. Though ""as narcissistic as any politician,"" Mayor Ed Koch ""could laugh at himself."" The somewhat inept Mayor "" David Dinkins was—and is—a hell of a nice guy."" Such diplomacy papers over some critical truths. Perhaps the most important one: New York City's bailout established the precedent that some cities are too big—that is, too politically and economically important—to fail.

Mr. Ravitch's recommended solutions to the fiscal problems of America's cities—government transparency and public education—are elusive. But the rest of the country would doubtless benefit from having more scrupulous civic leaders like Mr. Ravitch.

When most people think about the city of Anaheim, Disneyland or the Angels baseball team probably comes to mind. But until recently it was also home to one of California’s fastest-growing housing developments: a homeless encampment.

Along a riverbed not far from Angel Stadium, hundreds of vagrants had pitched tents made out of tarps. The affluent among them set up canopies, the kind that are sold in camping stores. Some even had cots. They stored their belongings in suitcases, bins, strollers and shopping carts. Jugs of water and cans littered the area. Dozens of presumably stolen bicycles were piled on top of each other like abstract art.

The camp was cleared in February after locals complained, but the question is where its residents are supposed to go now. Rising vagrancy in Southern California is creating a Catch-22: People don’t want the homeless living on their streets, but they don’t want homeless shelters in their neighborhoods either.

Last year California’s homeless population jumped 13.7%, compared with 3.6% in New York and 1% nationwide, according to an annual survey by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Most homeless people around the country live in emergency shelters or public transitional housing. But in California they camp outside in public spaces.",2,https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-california-leaves-its-homeless-out-in-the-sun-1526077852
42,Finley,Allysia,wsj,"If you’ve ever taken a statistics class, you’ve probably read Darrell Huff’s “How to Lie with Statistics.” Teachers unions appear to have drawn some lessons from the 1954 book. They’re using misleading statistics to rally public support for teacher walkouts in West Virginia, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Arizona and Colorado. Here are some of their distortions.

• They conflate school funding and state education spending. In Oklahoma, unions proclaimed that per pupil school spending fell by 28.2% over the past decade. That refers to the inflation-adjusted state’s general funding formula. But total per pupil outlays increased by 16% in nominal terms between 2006 and 2016, according to the U.S. Census Bureau’s most recent public education finance report. Adjusting for inflation, that’s a decline of only about 2%.

On average across the country, state funds make up only 47% of total school spending. Most of the rest comes from local property taxes. Since property tax hikes are politically unpopular, unions put pressure on state lawmakers to increase education spending from general funds. That has the benefit of diffusing accountability for local spending.

• They use elevated spending baselines. Teachers unions nearly always compare school spending and teacher salaries today with peak levels before the great recession, which were inflated like housing prices. Between 2000 and 2009, average per pupil spending across the country increased 52%, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. After flat-lining for a few years, per pupil spending ticked up by 7.5% between 2012 and 2015. School spending growth might have slowed over the past several years, but it still increased faster than the consumer price index.

Per pupil funding in Oklahoma shot up 46% between 2000 and 2009. During this period, average teacher salaries rose 52%. While average salaries have since fallen by 5%, even on an inflation-adjusted basis they remain higher today ($45,245) than in 2000 ($44,861) or 1990 ($44,088).",2,https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-to-lie-with-statistics-teachers-union-edition-1525303025
43,Finley,Allysia,wsj,"Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards was elected in 2015 with substantial support from trial lawyers, and he’s now repaying them in kind. The former minority leader of the state’s House of Representatives is effectively extorting oil and gas companies to backfill the budget while engineering what could be a handsome payday for his friends at a politically connected law firm.

Mr. Edwards wasted no time shaking down Louisiana’s energy industry. Shortly after taking office in January 2016, he met with oil and gas companies and issued an ultimatum: Fork over billions of dollars to help restore Louisiana’s eroding coastline or brave a drawn-out legal battle.

“We are struggling to pay for our state’s Master Plan to restore the coast,” the governor wrote in a May 19 letter to the presidents of Louisiana’s two largest oil and gas trade associations, which between them represent more than 100 local companies. “I intend to be involved in all facets of the state’s coastal restoration efforts—including those efforts to secure funding for the Master Plan. . . . At this point, we have two choices—work together toward an amicable solution or spend years in litigation. There should be no doubt that it is in the best interests of Louisiana and the industry to choose the former option.”

Louisiana’s coastline loses a football field worth of land to erosion every 48 minutes. This would put many of Louisiana’s 20 coastal parishes without protective levees underwater by 2100. These areas have been incurring stronger storm surges as wetlands that once provided a protective barrier against approaching hurricanes have disappeared.

But as Mr. Edwards, a Democrat, has acknowledged, oil and gas exploration isn’t solely to blame for coastal erosion. Natural causes—such as changes in the course of the Mississippi River—have contributed. As did levying of the river by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Dredging wetlands for fossil-fuel exploration played a secondary role.",2,https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-governor-and-louisiana-lawyers-plot-an-energy-shakedown-1520030605

Instead, you probably stream movies on your TV at home, and perhaps on your tablet or smartphone. Netflix , Amazon, HBO Go and other streaming services offer many movies within a couple of months of their theatrical release, not to mention a plethora of original content. Netflix’s original movie “Bright,” starring Will Smith, attracted 11 million viewers during the first three days of its digital release—more than many Hollywood blockbusters draw at theaters during their first weekend.

The appeal of streaming is obvious: You won’t waste time and money on a dud. The popcorn doesn’t cost $10. You don’t have to dress up or make plans in advance. “Netflix and takeout” has replaced “dinner and a movie” as the date-night activity of choice.

You’ve probably never heard of biallelic RPE65 mutation—and count yourself lucky. It’s a genetic defect that causes a form of retinal dystrophy. People born with it gradually lose their vision, often while still children, until they go totally blind. But they are now fortunate: In December the Food and Drug Administration approved a new gene therapy called Luxturna that corrects the mutation and reverses the course of the disease. Patients don’t get normal vision back but can read facial expressions and see stars for the first time. It’s a partial cure for blindness.

The disease is very rare, afflicting only a few thousand Americans—and therein lies our tale. Spark Therapeutics , which developed Luxturna, charges $850,000 for a course. Even at that high price, a drug with such a small market might not have been economical to develop as recently as a decade ago. This medical miracle was helped along by a federal law enacted in 2007 with bipartisan support—a rare governmental success, for which economist David Ridley deserves much of the credit.

Mr. Ridley, 48, has spent two decades studying and teaching health-care economics at Duke. In 2006 he and two colleagues published a paper in the journal Health Affairs proposing a way to give pharmaceutical companies an incentive to develop treatments for so-called orphan diseases. Congress authorized the “priority review voucher” in 2007. The FDA has since issued 18 vouchers, including six last year: five for drugs to treat rare pediatric diseases and one for the tropical Chagas parasite, which afflicts more than six million people world-wide.

Here’s how the system works: When the FDA approves a new treatment for a rare pediatric disease or an infectious tropical one, the drugmaker receives a voucher that can be used to fast-track FDA review on another drug. That allows it to bring the latter drug to market sooner, which can help increase sales, beat competitors and extend the patent’s effective lifespan. The vouchers can be sold and never expire. Drugmakers are also required to pay a fee—$2.7 million in 2017—to cover the FDA’s cost of expedited review.",2,https://www.wsj.com/articles/medical-miracles-from-fda-inefficiency-1517007927

The Tennessee native lost Wednesday, after taking a much worse pounding from journalists. When one reporter learned he was a Trump supporter, others started digging.

47,Finley,Allysia,wsj,"Does Google discriminate against white, male and conservative employees? Two former Google workers allege as much in a class-action lawsuit they filed against the company last week. While they may have difficulty prevailing in court, they make a strong case that Google aggressively promotes a political agenda and is far from a neutral broker of information.

Former Google engineers James Damore and David Gudeman claim they were fired for failing to conform to the company’s progressive culture. Last summer Mr. Damore published what was initially an internal cri de coeur against Google’s “ideological echo chamber” that criticized its intolerance for alternative views and suggested biology may make men better suited, on average, for tech jobs. Many Google employees demanded Mr. Damore’s termination and a purge of those who shared his views. Senior managers allegedly told Mr. Damore that he was fired for “perpetuating gender stereotypes.”

Mr. Gudeman was fired after he questioned a Muslim co-worker who claimed he was being targeted by the federal government because of his religion. According to the lawsuit, Google claimed Mr. Gudeman had accused the colleague of terrorism.

Messrs. Damore and Gudeman claim to be victims of sex, race and political discrimination. Discrimination in employment on the basis of race, sex, national origin and religion are prohibited by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. But federal law doesn’t forbid employers to discriminate based on their political or cultural views. So the plaintiffs are suing under California labor law, which prohibits employers from “forbidding or preventing employees from engaging or participating in politics.” Employers also cannot discharge or threaten to terminate employees to coerce them into political action.

To win certification as a class action, the plaintiffs must demonstrate that numerous Google employees suffered a common injury. To win their case, they’ll have to show that Google itself adopted or enforced a policy that forbade employees from engaging in politics and led to systematic discrimination against white, conservative men—or alternatively that Google fired Messrs. Damore and Gudeman to force employees to adopt progressive views.",2,https://www.wsj.com/articles/ok-google-youve-been-served-1516044100

Democrats have argued that Trump voters were duped by fringe websites that traffic in misinformation, and that if those voters were better informed, Hillary Clinton would be president today. A new study by three political scientists—from Princeton, Dartmouth and the University of Exeter—debunks the theory. While fake news is a real problem, the most dangerous distortions are shrouded in a patina of credibility.

The researchers collected tracking data from computers of 2,525 Americans (with their consent) between Oct. 7 and Nov. 14, 2016, and analyzed their news consumption vis-à-vis their political support and knowledge. They sorted “fake” from “hard” news sites, defining the former by the propensity to publish intentionally fabricated stories such as “FBI agent suspected in Hillary email leaks found dead in apparent murder-suicide”—but not unintentional reporting mistakes, false statements by politicians or slanted or misleading reports that were not categorically false.

The researchers extrapolated that roughly 1 in 4 American adults visited a fake-news site around the time of the election. But stories on these sites accounted for only about 2.6% of all the news they consumed.

Trump supporters were likelier than Clinton backers to visit fake-news sites, and the most ardent conservatives were the most voracious consumers. The 10% of Americans with the most conservative online information diets accounted for 60% of visits to fake news websites. That would seem to support the theory that Trump partisans consumed fake news to reinforce their political attitudes.

But the study also finds that “fake news consumption seems to be a complement to, rather than a substitute for, hard news—visits to fake news websites are highest among people who consume the most hard news.” The more time you spend perusing news online or using social media, the more likely you’ll stumble upon and click on provocative, misleading headlines.

Charter schools are the “polite cousins of segregation,” in the words of Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers. Last year the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People called for a moratorium on charters. Film festivals are screening “Backpack Full of Cash,” a pro-union documentary narrated by Matt Damon that portrays charters as separate and unequal institutions.

Pushing back against these invidious attacks is the Thurgood Marshall College Fund, an organization that represents 47 historically black schools. “We cannot afford this kind of issue-myopia in our society,” the fund’s president, Johnny Taylor, wrote in a syndicated op-ed this fall. “If the NAACP continues to reject the educational opportunities school choice provides them, they risk becoming irrelevant—or worse—an enemy of the very people they claim to fight for.”

The cost for the most popular ObamaCare silver plans will increase 37% on average next year. Democrats and insurers are both blaming soaring premiums on the Trump administration, which is purportedly trying to sabotage the law. They complain that loosening the individual mandate and slashing ObamaCare’s advertising budget reduces enrollment among the healthy youngsters who keep premiums in check. They say the White House’s move to end cost-sharing payments to insurers will drive up premiums and repel “young invincibles.”

These arguments are dubious, not least because premiums were rising even before Mr. Trump took office. Since 2013, the average premium on the ObamaCare exchanges has doubled. The real ObamaCare saboteurs were the Democrats who designed and passed such a haphazard law.

Insurers need young, healthy people as customers to offset the costs of covering older and sick people. But the law’s provision allowing young adults to stay on their parents’ plans up to age 26 has removed millions of potential customers from the private insurance market. About 2.3 million people 19 to 25 were added to family health plans between September 2010 and the start of open enrollment in October 2013, according to a report last year from the Department of Health and Human Services.

Democrats for whatever reason didn’t foresee just how many young adults would jump onto their parents’ coverage. The share of young adults with employer-sponsored insurance has risen by more than 10 percentage points under ObamaCare, according to Census Bureau data. Such plans are typically cheaper than the ones available on the individual market, thanks to favorable tax treatment, and companies with more than 100 employees are exempt from many costly state mandates and ObamaCare’s 10 essential benefits.",2,https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-democrats-learned-to-love-insurance-companies-1509402650

Democrats in Sacramento celebrated earlier this month when they passed a raft of bills intended to redress California’s so-called housing crisis. Sorry to spoil the party, but their legislation will do little to address the real problem and could even make things worse for poor and middle-income residents.

Like so many of the state’s problems, the crisis has political and regulatory origins. California’s housing prices have always been high, but the gap has grown amid an increasing mismatch between supply and demand. Between 1950 and 1970, home prices were about 30% above the national average. By 1980 that had widened to 80%. In 2015 it was 150%.

In Silicon Valley the median home costs $1.2 million, about 2.5 times as much as in Seattle. Houses are less expensive inland—about $350,000 in Riverside and Sacramento—but living there often means a long commute. The weather also isn’t much better than in Phoenix or Dallas, so why not move to another state? A net 800,000 people did just that between 2005 and 2015, and many of them earned less than $30,000.

The core problem is that over the past four decades California added only about half as many new housing units as it needed to keep up with population growth, and most of that construction was inland where there is less demand. As a result, real-estate prices in coastal counties have gone through the roof.",2,https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-housing-is-unaffordable-in-california-1506723749

The allegation is that Big Pharma used deceptive marketing to hook millions of Americans on prescription painkillers, which served as gateway drugs to more potent opioids like heroin and fentanyl.

But government health-care programs are among the biggest suppliers of prescription painkillers. The attorneys general ought to be investigating how Medicaid may help promote opiate abuse and addiction.

Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson this summer highlighted a correlation between the ObamaCare Medicaid expansion and opioid overdoses. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that overdose deaths per capita rose twice as much on average between 2013 and 2015 in states that expanded Medicaid than those that didn’t—for example, 205% in North Dakota, which expanded Medicaid, vs. 18% in South Dakota, which didn’t. That’s particularly striking since the energy boom boosted North Dakota’s economy and employment.

ObamaCare defenders note that the disparity in overdose fatalities appears to have begun around 2010—but due largely to sharp increases in a few expansion states, most notably West Virginia. What’s more, the disaggregated data show that the disparity between expansion and nonexpansion states with similar demographics and geography increased markedly after 2013. Between 2010 and 2013, overdose deaths rose by 28% in Ohio and 36% in Wisconsin. Between 2013 and 2015, they climbed 39% in Ohio, which expanded Medicaid, but only 2% in Wisconsin, which did not.

Overdose deaths aren’t the only measure of opioid abuse. Another is hospital and emergency-room admissions. According to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, the number of opioid-related inpatient hospital stays nationwide (among states submitting data) that were paid for by Medicaid increased by about 40% between the fourth quarters of 2012 and 2014—about four times the rate of growth in Medicaid enrollment. Patient stays covered by private insurance increased 4% during this period.",2,https://www.wsj.com/articles/does-medicaid-spur-opioid-abuse-1506289279

If left and right weren’t talking past each other to score political points, they might even agree on a policy that protects the public and states’ rights.

The city of Chicago argued in court this week that Attorney General Jeff Sessions’s threat to withhold Justice Department grants to local authorities that don’t cooperate with immigration officials is an “unprecedented seizure of power.” Thirty-seven sanctuary cities have filed briefs in support of Chicago.

Mr. Sessions used equally hyperbolic rhetoric when responding to the Chicago lawsuit last month: “For the sake of their city, Chicago’s leaders need to recommit to policies that punish criminals instead of protecting them.”

The fight concerns the relatively small Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program, through which the Justice Department funds public-safety initiatives at the state and local level. In July Mr. Sessions said that grant recipients must provide 48-hours notice to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement before releasing any undocumented aliens sought by federal authorities. He also demanded that ICE agents be given access to jails and prisons and reinforced an Obama administration requirement that cities applying for Byrne JAG grants certify compliance with the Immigration in the National Interest Act of 1995, which forbids state and local governments from restricting communications with ICE.

Under the Constitution’s Supremacy Clause, federal laws pre-empt state and local ones. This principle should apply to Chicago’s sanctuary policy, which provides that on-duty employees may not “expend their time responding to ICE inquiries or communicating with ICE regarding a person’s custody status or release date.”",2,https://www.wsj.com/articles/chicagos-immigration-showdown-is-more-about-politics-than-law-1505513409

The U.S. Open epitomizes New York City in all its grandeur. But tennis fans who want a more authentic experience here should try playing on the city’s public courts, where they can witness government dysfunction up close.

Securing a tennis court, particularly during prime hours in the evening and morning, can be more competitive even than playing a match. First you need a $100 city permit, bought online or at Paragon Sports in Union Square. The online application requires you to upload a photo—ostensibly to prevent others from fraudulently using your permit to book a court—and then the permit arrives by mail in two weeks.

About a quarter of every park’s courts can be reserved online for a $15 fee. But those are snapped up fast. Most courts must be reserved in person on the day of play, which usually means at the crack of dawn.

If you’re well-off, you can avoid the hustle and hassle by paying for a one-hour reservation at a private club. That costs $60 to $120, on top of an annual membership that can run thousands of dollars. Clubs do provide superior amenities—for instance, lights. Public courts in Manhattan close at dusk, ironic given this is the city that never sleeps. That means most working people can’t play during the fall, when the sun sets early. The city Parks Department didn’t respond to a query about the lack of lights, but a source told me that it’s too expensive to pay public workers and police to keep courts open at night.",2,https://www.wsj.com/articles/tennis-anyone-not-without-a-permit-1504826697
58,Finley,Allysia,wsj,"Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel once observed shrewdly that a crisis is an “opportunity to do things you think you could not do before.” His words ring especially true in Illinois, which is about to enact one of the largest private-school scholarship programs in the country. The breakthrough has been made possible by a fiscal crisis in the nation’s third-largest school district.

Chicago Public Schools expects to run a $544 million deficit in the coming fiscal year and is at risk of defaulting on debt payments. Legislative leaders in Springfield have been working around the clock on a new school-funding formula that would bail out CPS. In return for his signature, Gov. Bruce Rauner, a Republican, has demanded a tax-credit scholarship program for poor kids to attend private schools. Seventeen states have similar programs, which provide tax credits for contributions to nonprofit scholarship funds.

In 2010 a voucher program passed the state Senate but died in the House primarily due to opposition from Chicago Democrats. But now the city’s Democrats, including House Speaker Michael Madigan, are more receptive. That’s because a straight-up bailout of Chicago schools would invariably reduce funding for downstate districts. It simply doesn’t have enough support in the state House to pass.

Schools across the state, including those in Chicago, may not open on time if lawmakers don’t pass a new funding formula next week. Democrats could blame the debacle on Mr. Rauner, but shutting down schools statewide to force a bailout of Chicago schools isn’t popular anywhere—not even in Chicago. And CPS desperately needs state cash to maintain access to credit markets due to its history of financial mismanagement.

In 1995, amid financial duress, the state established a block grant to help Chicago pay for special education, transportation and nutrition programs. In 2017, Chicago schools benefited to the tune of $250 million. As part of the deal, the state handed control over Chicago teacher pensions to then-Mayor Richard Daley, who took a 10-year “holiday” from payments. According to the Illinois Policy Institute, this allowed the district to divert more than $1.5 billion from teacher pensions to pay and other perks.",2,https://www.wsj.com/articles/republicans-wont-let-chicagos-school-crisis-go-to-waste-1503701116

When Ben Franklin proposed in 1749 what eventually became the University of Pennsylvania, he called for an academy to teach “those Things that are likely to be most useful.” Today the university lays claim to having incubated the world’s biggest cancer breakthrough. In 2011, a team of researchers led by immunologist Carl June, a Penn professor, reported stunning results after genetically altering the T-cells of three patients with advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia, a cancer that affects white blood cells.

The patients had failed to respond to many different traditional therapies. Yet two of the three patients experienced miraculous recoveries after Dr. June and his team gave them infusions of their own doctored white blood cells. Seven years later they remain cancer-free. The third patient died after showing improvements, though might have been saved had the treatment begun earlier.

The results, published in the New England Journal of Medicine in August 2011, opened the field of cancer immunotherapy. “It was a tipping point,” recalls the 64-year-old Dr. June. “There was an amazing outpouring because we showed for the first time that it could work.”

And it worked spectacularly well—more than 90% of pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in a subsequent clinical trial went into remission after being infused with Dr. June’s CAR T-cells (the acronym stands for “chimeric antigen receptor”). Last month an advisory committee of the Food and Drug Administration unanimously approved the therapy to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The FDA is likely to give final approval within weeks.",2,https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-hiv-became-a-cancer-cure-1503092082
60,Finley,Allysia,wsj,"If ObamaCare’s expansion of Medicaid were measured merely by growth in enrollment and spending, California’s Medi-Cal program would rank as a huge success. Since 2012, Medi-Cal has added six million beneficiaries, primarily able-bodied adults of working age. Covering them last year brought California nearly $20 billion in additional federal funds. If Medi-Cal were a state, its population of 14 million would make it the fifth-largest in the U.S. The program’s $103 billion budget is about three times the size of Illinois’s general fund.

But despite the surge in enrollment and spending—or perhaps because of it—Medi-Cal has failed to fulfill its stated goal of improving health-care access for the indigent and disabled. A recent report from the Santa Clara County Civil Grand Jury highlighted the conundrum many of the state’s Medicaid enrollees face: “You’ve Got Medi-Cal, but Can You Get Medical Care?”

By extending Medi-Cal to younger, healthier people—many of whom could be better served by the kind of bare-bones private insurance that ObamaCare outlawed—California has made it harder for those who most need low-cost care to get it.

Medicaid operates as an open-ended entitlement, meaning the federal government covers a predetermined share of state spending, regardless of the total cost. Traditionally, the feds have matched California’s outlays dollar for dollar. States where the per capita income is lower receive a more generous match. Nevada, for example, receives about two federal dollars for each one it spends.

ObamaCare encouraged states to expand Medicaid so that it covers people with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty line—in other words, up to $16,400 for an individual. After the Supreme Court struck down ObamaCare’s mandated expansion, the federal government induced states to sign up by initially assuming 100% of the cost for these people. That will slip to 90% in 2020, though it’s still a bargain for most states.",2,https://www.wsj.com/articles/medicaids-potemkin-health-coverage-1500419200
61,Finley,Allysia,wsj,"Amazon’s $13.7 billion bid for Whole Foods has stirred speculation among investors, business reporters and consumers. If Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has a strategy for marrying the online and brick-and-mortar operations, he hasn’t explained it—and perhaps for good reason. It’s rarely wise to show your cards to competitors or regulators.

A decade ago, the Federal Trade Commission turned Whole Foods CEO John Mackey’s statements against him in an antitrust suit that sought to unwind its merger with Wild Oats Markets. Mr. Mackey said Whole Foods’s goal was to “eliminate a competitor” that a conventional supermarket might otherwise purchase and use as a “growth platform.”

Markets are dynamic—meaning businesses face constant pressure from competitors that offer innovations or lower prices. In 2007, then-Sen. Barack Obama asked Iowa voters, “Anybody gone into Whole Foods lately? See what they charge for arugula?” At the time, Iowa didn’t even have a Whole Foods, and Republicans seized on his statement to portray him as an out-of-touch elitist. Now you can buy a box of arugula at a 99-cent store.

The problem is that FTC regulators defined competition so narrowly when evaluating prior mergers that they failed to see the market for the trees. Antitrust enforcement actions that sought to prevent grocery stores from consolidating have helped Amazon, which has been able to expand unencumbered by the FTC. Now supermarkets may be in a weaker position to give Amazon a run for its money.

After Whole Foods proposed the Wild Oats merger in 2007, the FTC accused Whole Foods of trying to corner a distinctive “premium natural and organic” market. The agency argued that Wal-Mart , Safeway and Trader Joe’s—all of which are among Whole Foods’s top competitors today—drew different clienteles and thus were not direct competitors.",2,https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-myopic-antitrust-policy-helped-amazon-gain-dominance-1498688044

Nine-term Rep. Darrell Issa spent his four years as head of the House Oversight Committee tormenting the Obama administration. Liberals aim to spend the next two years reciprocating. Mr. Issa was barely re-elected last year, winning by fewer than 1,700 votes, and Democrats have made him a top target of their campaign to reclaim a House majority in 2018.

Mr. Christie, a former federal prosecutor, campaigned on a list of 88 ways he would fix the Garden State, from overhauling public-worker pension plans, to eliminating political patronage jobs, to cutting income taxes across the board.

Eight years on, voters have wearied of Mr. Christie’s personality-driven politics and grown disillusioned by his failure to turn the state around. His 20% approval rating is the worst of any governor in the country. So it’s perhaps no surprise that the Democrats running in Tuesday’s primary to succeed the term-limited Mr. Christie are trying to capitalize on this moment to push the state even further left.

Although Mr. Christie made incremental government reforms and spending cuts, significant problems persist. Moody’s estimates that the state’s $527 million budget shortfall will increase to $3.6 billion annually within the next half decade. Three months ago the rating agency lowered New Jersey’s credit score—the 11th downgrade on Mr. Christie’s watch—citing pension debt and meager economic growth.

New Jersey’s local property taxes remain the highest in the nation. In 2010 Mr. Christie championed a law capping annual increases at 2%, but local governments have blown through the limit via exemptions for debt service, state emergencies and public pensions and health-care costs. The average property tax bill on the median $430,000 home in Rutherford is $11,200.

The income tax isn’t much better. Mr. Christie has vetoed Democratic legislation to reimpose a millionaire’s tax that lapsed in 2009, but New Jersey’s 8.97% top rate is still the sixth-highest in the country. The high corporate rate of 9% is part of why the Garden State comes in last on the Tax Foundation’s business-climate ranking.",2,https://www.wsj.com/articles/after-chris-christie-how-far-left-can-new-jersey-go-1496431255

This year, Mayor Rahm Emanuel must scrape together $1.1 billion, nearly a third of the city’s $3.5 billion general budget, to make a balloon payment to the city’s pension funds. Separately, the city’s schools face a $1.1 billion deficit driven by a $634 million pension bill. This all has created a quandary for Mr. Emanuel.

Investors appear unlikely to finance worker pensions. Last month Moody’s downgraded Chicago bonds to junk after the state Supreme Court ruled in effect that pensions were inviolable. What’s more, creditors got burned by such bond deals when Detroit and the California cities of Stockton and San Bernardino went bankrupt. (San Bernardino has offered to repay holders of pension obligation bonds just one cent on the dollar.)

So how does Mr. Emanuel plan to pay the city’s pension bills? Gambling. The mayor wants state lawmakers to authorize a city-owned casino whose revenues would exclusively fund pensions. He says the casino would be a win-win for workers and taxpayers.

Ashland, a small Appalachian town on the Ohio River, was once an industrial powerhouse. Fifty years ago, nearby coal mines churned out cheap energy and raw materials for steel production. But in recent decades the region has suffered a series of blows. In 1998 Ashland Oil relocated to the Cincinnati suburbs. Two years ago, AK Steel laid off 600 workers. Last year CSX Railroad cut 100 jobs due to reduced traffic from the coal mines. Unemployment in Greenup County stands at 8.9%.

Last month President Trump—who won the county with 71% of the vote—ordered an investigation into whether aluminum imports were jeopardizing national security. It’s a step toward the tariffs that protectionists hope will revive America’s Rust Belt. But the best hope for towns like Ashland is innovation and investment by men like Mr. Bouchard.

He’s the kind of businessman who might appear on a union hit list. The CEO cut his chops in derivatives trading before buying the scraps of a bankrupt Chicago steel company in 2003 with his brother James. Within five years, the Bouchard brothers had built their company, Esmark, into the nation’s fourth-largest steel conglomerate.

They sold it for $1.2 billion to the Russian steelmaker Severstal in 2008, shortly before the stock market and steel industry crashed. Thousands of workers subsequently lost their jobs. Mr. Bouchard blames the United Steelworkers. He had first tried to sell a partnership stake in Esmark to the Indian company Essar Steel. But the United Steelworkers sought to force a sale to Severstal, which the union perceived as more labor-friendly. Had the Essar deal been consummated, Mr. Bouchard says, “every one of those people would have their jobs today” because all of the company’s debt would have been paid off.",2,https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-mill-that-right-to-work-built-1495234889

The ballot initiative was backed by a phalanx of progressives—Napster founder Sean Parker provided the seed funding—and liberal interest groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union. But now as state lawmakers debate how to regulate the industry, one worry is that the Teamsters will hijack the process and corner the pot market.

California was the first state to legalize medical marijuana, in 1996. For two decades, local governments took the helm on regulation, which worked fine so long as most growers and dispensaries were mom-and-pop operations. But large businesses with sprawling operations necessitated a uniform statewide system. In 2015 the Legislature issued guidelines regulating the cultivation, manufacturing, delivery, testing, taxation and sale of pot for medicinal use.

The regulations, modeled on those enacted to control alcohol after Prohibition, established 17 different licenses. Manufacturers and cultivators can hold dispensary licenses, and dispensaries can be licensed to grow weed. But third-party distributors are required to negotiate the exchange between growers and retailers.

These middlemen are responsible for collecting taxes and transporting pot to laboratories for testing. They are forbidden from cultivating or selling cannabis. This framework of three tiers—cultivation, distribution and retail—is supposedly intended to ensure that every ounce of pot can be accounted for and that growers don’t illegally divert their product to the black market.

Law-enforcement officials are urging lawmakers to adopt the same model for recreational marijuana, since they believe a small number of wholesalers would be easier to audit than thousands of growers and retailers. They’re joined by the Teamsters, who hope to cash in on the pot market. “I’m not hiding our self-interest,” Teamsters lobbyist Barry Broad told Politico. “This is a growing industry and we’d like it to grow unionized.”",2,https://www.wsj.com/articles/big-labor-looks-at-californias-marijuana-market-and-sees-green-1494023212

Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton were quick to praise Mr. Cuomo’s political ploy, whose true target isn’t New Yorkers but Democratic voters in Iowa and New Hampshire.

The governor presents himself as a champion of the middle class, but it has been fleeing the state in droves due to the lack of jobs and high cost of living. More than 191,000 New Yorkers decamped last year for other states, 43,000 of them to Florida alone. About three-quarters of the state’s counties have lost population since 2010, when Mr. Cuomo was elected. The New York City area continues to grow thanks largely to an influx of foreign immigrants.

Alas, the plan for tuition-free college merely redistributes income while giving the middle class little actual help. In fact, many of the scheme’s putative beneficiaries may be harmed.

Consider the terms and conditions for the state scholarship. To qualify, students must come from families earning less than $100,000 ($125,000 by 2019)—and they must attend school full-time and graduate on time. The State University of New York estimates that about a fifth of its undergraduates would be eligible. A mere 2% of students at the City University of New York would qualify—in part because of low graduation rates, just 5% for full-time students at CUNY’s York College.

Wolves were once hunted to near-extinction, but thanks to the Endangered Species Act there are now nearly 6,000 of us in the lower 48 states. A few years ago the federal government removed wolves from the endangered-species list in Idaho and Montana after ranchers complained we were gorging on livestock.

That means more of us might migrate west.

My uncle OR-7 became a celebrity a few years ago when he visited California, where wolves hadn’t been seen for more than 60 years. The state Department of Fish and Wildlife assigned several biologists to track him. They even created a “wolf management plan,” hoping that wolves would make a comeback in the state.

In 2014 the California Fish and Game Commission listed us as an endangered species.

From Amazon to eBay and Uber to Airbnb, digital technology has revolutionized everyday life. But when you get sick, you might as well take a time machine back a few decades. You phone your doctor’s office to make an appointment. You sit in a waiting room stocked with old magazines. The physician writes down notes about your symptoms and stores them in paper files. When you’re done, a receptionist hands you a little card with the date and time of your next visit.

Alexi Nazem, a 34-year-old physician-turned-entrepreneur, has some ideas about how to bring American medicine out of the fax-and-landline age and into the 21st century. “Our goal is to be the Airbnb of health care,” he says of Nomad Health, the startup he co-founded and now leads as CEO. That oversells it a bit: Whereas Airbnb connects ordinary lodgers with spare rooms, Nomad is a business-to-business proposition. It does, however, bring doctors into the gig economy.

That could help attenuate a pending shortage of physicians. Residency positions at hospitals aren’t increasing nearly fast enough to meet the growing demand for services as baby boomers age and senior doctors retire. By 2025, the U.S. will be short between 61,700 and 94,700 doctors, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges. In 2014 there were 782,210 active physicians under 75, a mere 2% increase from the prior year.

Republicans have been trying to pass charter-school legislation since 2009, only to be stymied by Democrats, who had a lock on the governorship and state House.

But charters’ time in the Bluegrass State may have finally arrived. In 2015 Republican Matt Bevin, a charter-school champion, was elected governor. Then last year Republicans seized control of the Kentucky House for the first time since 1921 and unseated Speaker Greg Stumbo, a staunch opponent of school choice. Republicans now hold large majorities in both chambers of the General Assembly—64 of 100 seats in the House and 27 of 38 in the Senate.

Even teachers unions and local school boards seem resigned to the inevitability of allowing charter schools. To limit the damage to their interests, they’re trying to exploit divisions among Republicans to keep charters tightly contained by conceding regulatory authority to the local boards.

Kentucky schools rank about average nationwide, though large disparities exist among districts. Last year 77% of middle-school students in the Cincinnati suburb of Fort Thomas scored “proficient” on state math tests. Four miles away in Newport, only 30% did.

Ho hum. Just another hang-up caused by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, a century-old law that protects more than a thousand avian species.

“We’ve dealt with this on all sorts of things on every project we’ve worked with in the Bay Area,” noted Metropolitan Transportation Commission spokesman Randy Rentschler. In 2015 demolition of Oakland’s Bay Bridge was delayed after cormorants refused to vacate the aging structure for the artificial nests workers created from Christmas wreaths.

The 1918 migratory-bird law was originally crafted as a treaty with Canada—Mexico, Japan and Russia later signed—to protect migratory birds from poachers who made a bundle selling their feathers. Recall the ornate feathered hats worn by actresses in the 1913 play “Pygmalion.”

Under the act, it’s a federal crime to “pursue, hunt, take, capture or kill” migratory birds. The list of protected species has soared to 1,026, including common fowl like crows, ducks and finches. President Obama alone extended protections to nearly 200 species.

Meanwhile, what constitutes criminal conduct has become decidedly fuzzy. Taking an egg is blatantly illegal. Prosecutors have argued that the law also covers subtler activities that inadvertently cause harm to birds.",2,https://www.wsj.com/articles/if-you-kill-a-migratory-duck-your-goose-may-be-cooked-1487203949
73,Finley,Allysia,wsj,"What can a Victorian-era novel depicting provincial English society teach us about modern politics? For starters, the more politics change, the more they stay the same.

George Eliot’s opus “Middlemarch” (1872), set in a small English town in the early 1830s, isn’t on most high school or college core reading lists. It should be. The novel’s vexing political questions foreshadow the debates taking place today.

“Middlemarch” unfolds against the backdrop of rapid industrialization and a rising middle class. At the time, only the landed aristocracy could vote. Due to urban migration—there was no redistricting to account for population shifts—cities were underrepresented. Meanwhile, the gentry controlled sparsely populated “rotten” boroughs whose voters were under their thumb.

In the novel, political agitators recruit the wealthy landlord Arthur Brooke to run for Parliament on a program of democratic reform. Eliot portrays Mr. Brooke as a frontman for the populist movement and observes that “the very men who profess to be for him would bring another member out of the bag at the right moment.”

Democratic activists choose him because he’s an empty vessel: “Mr. Brooke’s mind, if it had the burthen of remembering any train of thought, would let it drop, run away in search of it, and not easily come back again.” He’s flawed in other ways: Mr. Brooke’s opponents disparage him as “a damned bad landlord” who is “currying favor with a low set.” They make hay out of his poor treatment of tenants.",2,https://www.wsj.com/articles/george-eliot-knew-a-thing-or-two-about-21st-century-politics-1486426060

Grocery and convenience stores can offer paper or reusable bags, but the law requires them to charge at least 10 cents a pop. While pot is now legal in the Golden State, plastic bags are contraband. Welcome to the liberal dystopia.

California’s bag ban is a classic marriage of economic protectionism and government paternalism, dressed up in environmental virtue. As with so many other progressive policies, the ban is likely to have unintended consequences.

The statewide bag ban was hatched by politicians in Sacramento, in part as a solution to a problem created by . . . politicians in Sacramento. In 2006, the state Legislature passed a law that required large grocery stores to run recycling programs to collect plastic bags. To obtain grocers’ support for the law, the Legislature prohibited cities or counties from imposing fees on plastic bags.

San Francisco responded to this prohibition the following year by banning plastic bags entirely. Nearly 150 cities and counties followed suit, though the local rules varied. Sonoma County put a fee on paper bags, requiring grocers to charge a minimum of 10 cents. Nearby Marin County imposed a 5-cent fee.

The justifications for banning plastic bags have also varied. Liberals in San Francisco proclaimed that the city’s ban would reduce global warming and America’s reliance on foreign oil. Yet only about 3% of plastic bags are produced using oil, according to a 2014 report from the Reason Foundation. Most are made from natural gas, which is now cheap and abundant in the U.S. Many reusable bags, on the other hand, are derived from oil, and produced in Asia to boot.",2,http://www.wsj.com/articles/in-california-paper-or-plastic-is-against-the-law-1485560488

You may have read—a couple of thousand times—that Rep. John Lewis didn’t attend Donald Trump’s inauguration on Friday. About 70 other House Democrats also didn’t show. But Jim Brown, the legendary Cleveland Browns running-back, was on hand to demonstrate support and hope for the new president. And that may end up doing more good for more people as the U.S. enters a new political era.

At 80, Mr. Brown is moving a little slower than when he bulldozed cornerbacks like a Caterpillar tractor, which no doubt took a toll on his body. He walks with a pigskin-handled cane inscribed with personal emblems such as his Syracuse University football jersey number, 44. But the Hall of Famer’s mind is as quick as ever.

Mr. Brown was named most valuable player in four out of his nine seasons in the pros (1957-65), and he’s considered among the best players of all time. But it’s his longer, arguably more consequential career battling gang violence that brought him to Washington this week and Trump Tower last month to meet with the president. He wants to enlist Mr. Trump to help make America’s inner cities great again—or at least better.

Although Mr. Brown voted for Hillary Clinton, he says he has to “respect the man who’s smart enough to know what to say and to win against all odds. And if that man will accept me on any level, that’s a privilege.”",2,http://www.wsj.com/articles/an-nfl-legend-trump-and-americas-gangs-1484956591

Since 2012, California’s economy has grown faster (an annual compounded 3.4%) than every state save Texas (4.8%) and Colorado (3.6%), according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Tech has led the upswing, but agriculture and manufacturing have increased, too. Lo, California two years ago eclipsed France to become the world’s sixth-largest economy, with a GDP of $2.46 trillion.

The state continues to defy conservatives’ predictions that its progressive tax and regulatory policies—from carbon “cap and trade” to limits on suburban sprawl—will strangle the economy. Democratic politicians tout California’s apparent resurgence as vindication for liberal governance. Yet the Gilded State is prospering despite the government-imposed handicaps, and for much of the middle class the economic luster is illusive.

The seat of wealth-creation is Silicon Valley, where tech King Midases enrich nearly everything they touch, from real estate to retail.

In 2011 Ms. Raimondo, then the state treasurer, spearheaded a bold reform of Rhode Island’s public-pension system that made her reviled among government unions. Yet she lived to fight another campaign. After being elected governor two years ago, she set about making her state great again for business with regulatory and tax reforms.

This year’s election has spurred soul-searching within the Democratic Party. A debate rages between progressives who argue that Democrats need to double down on the party’s current strategy—that is, dividing the electorate into identity groups and promising a government program for every pot—and those like Ms. Raimondo who believe that boosting economic growth is the only sustainable path for their country and party.

Soon after the election, Ms. Raimondo dropped by the Journal’s offices while on a trip to New York. “Rhode Island is on the move again,” she declared. “I want businesses to know that.”

With a population of just over one million, the state is easy to overlook. Its western frontier bordering Connecticut is rural. Donald Trump overwhelmingly won these towns.

Thomas Wolfe once wrote that you can’t go home again, but Evan Bayh—a former two-term Democratic governor and U.S. senator from Indiana—is trying. After casting the deciding 60th vote for ObamaCare, Mr. Bayh retired in 2011 and cashed in as a fixer on Washington’s K Street. Now he’s running against Republican Rep. Todd Young—and his own liberal voting record—to reclaim the seat.

On Friday, the trim 60-year-old dropped by King Ribs Bar-B-Q in west Indianapolis for a retail campaign stop. After chatting with some customers (who admitted to being Democratic operatives after praising Mr. Bayh), the candidate spoke with a small gaggle of reporters. Within half an hour of arriving, he left with his lunch packed to go. The Potemkin stop almost seems to be a metaphor for his campaign.

There are maybe two dozen highly competitive House races this fall, but few are as consequential as the cage match in New York’s 19th Congressional District. In this bucolic Big Apple exurb, John Faso—a Paul Ryan conservative—is battling Zephyr Teachout—an Elizabeth Warren protégé—for the seat being vacated by Republican Rep. Chris Gibson.

The sprawling district straddles the Hudson River, running from Poughkeepsie in the south all the way up to Albany. You’ll find wineries, craft breweries and family farms scattered amid panoramas evocative of 19th-century American landscape painting. In the crunchy college town of New Paltz where Ms. Teachout recently staged a rally with Bernie Sanders, there’s an apple orchard trail, a solar-power festival, a yoga center larger than many schools and a strip club with “salad bar” and “hiring” signs out front.

Interspersed between the district’s tony towns are former industrial cities struggling to reinvent themselves. Fifty miles west of the Hudson are the Catskill Mountains, where Manhattan’s gentry own vacation homes. Drive another 50 miles west and you’ll hit the Southern Tier, New York’s Appalachia. The candidates have a lot of ground to cover, literally and politically.

Voter registration is split evenly between Republicans and Democrats, and independents bat both ways. In 2012 Mr. Gibson and President Obama each carried the district by six points, though the Republican held his seat two years later in a 28-point landslide.

The vagrancy endemic to San Francisco seems to be spreading to the Golden State’s suburbs. Blame it, at least in part, on Californians’ well-intentioned efforts to reform the criminal-justice system by releasing low-level offenders from jail.

Encampments with an estimated 500 homeless have formed in the dry Santa Ana riverbed by Angel Stadium and the city’s civic center. Last month the Santa Ana City Council declared a public-health crisis due to dangerous and unsanitary conditions, such as used syringes and human feces.

The collateral damage includes some 8,000 employees left jobless and 40,000 students, including 7,000 veterans.

The school’s destruction illustrates how regulators driven by political animus—and without courts or other legal findings—can sacrifice innocents to achieve their objectives.

One victim is Roger Parks. After serving 23 years in the Air Force, in 2013 he enrolled in an electrical engineering program at ITT’s campus in Everett, Wash., while working full time as a supervisor at a cement plan. The hands-on training “was a good fit,” he says.

Mr. Parks needed a B.A. to advance in his company and was three months shy of graduating when ITT closed. Now he’s afraid he will have to redo his education.

It’s the first day of school at Scholarship Prep Academy, a K-8 charter-school startup in a barrio in Orange County, Calif. The new school is housed in a church, where classrooms are named after colleges such as Harvard and Ohio State.

Like many charters, Scholarship Prep serves an underprivileged community. About 90% of its 300-some students qualify for a free or reduced-price lunch. Most parents walk their kids to school because they don’t own cars, and the Orange County Board of Education doesn’t fund bus transportation. This is just one of the obstacles that co-founder Gloria Romero faced when launching the school with Jason Watts.

Getting to opening day hasn’t been easy. A long list of challenges had to be met before the school could open—not least navigating the bureaucratic barriers set up by the teachers unions and their friends in government to block the charter-school competition.

Ms. Romero, a Democrat and a former majority leader of the state senate, has spent two decades championing school reform and knows her way around the education bureaucracy. Since many charters are initially rejected by their local school districts, she short-circuited the approval process by directly petitioning the county Board of Education, which typically hears appeals. Even so, the board’s staff tried unsuccessfully to impose cumbersome conditions on the charter, such as requiring that expenditures over $10,000 had to be approved by the board.",2,http://www.wsj.com/articles/opening-day-at-a-new-charter-school-1472598196
83,Finley,Allysia,wsj,"Democrats were writing obituaries for California's GOP after winning a supermajority in the state legislature last November, thus gaining veto-proof power to raise taxes. But their legislative lock may have slipped after this week's special election in which Republican farmer Andy Vidak appears to have defeated a Democrat—in a heavily Democratic senate district—who had championed high-speed rail and a higher minimum wage.

If Mr. Vidak wins an outright majority—late Friday, he led with 49.8% of the vote and provisional ballots were still being counted—his victory would put Republicans two senate seats short of reclaiming their veto on tax hikes. But more important, the election has exposed the Democrats' soft underbelly in California's Central Valley—a no man's land in state politics—and given Republicans a rallying point.

""This is the shot in the arm that shows that we are doing some things right,"" California Rep. Kevin McCarthy, the House GOP whip, says.

Three months ago, Democratic state senator Michael Rubio surprised his party by resigning midway through his first term to take a job in Chevron's lobbying shop. The 35-year-old moderate from Bakersfield had just been elevated to head the senate Environmental Quality Committee and was expected to propose regulatory reforms the week he tendered his resignation.

While Mr. Rubio cited personal issues for leaving the legislature—he has a daughter with special needs—another likely concern was the realization that his career and clout in Sacramento were limited by who he was and where he came from. Unlike his coastal counterparts, Mr. Rubio supported exploiting the rich hydrocarbon and shale deposits that underlie his Valley district.

The oil industry, he told a local TV station in February, shared his view ""that we need to provide an opportunity for people to go to work and provide for their families""—a statement that borders on heresy in California's Democratic Party.

After delivering pro forma eulogies for Mr. Rubio, Democrats in Sacramento chose Kern County supervisor Leticia Perez to run for his vacated seat. They figured that a young Latina with a background as a public defender would have no trouble winning in a gerrymandered district that was 60% Hispanic and in which Democrats boasted a 22-point registration advantage. In 2010, Mr. Rubio won the seat by a 21-point margin.

Meanwhile, local farmers and businesses recruited the 47-year-old Mr. Vidak, a third-generation Valley farmer who narrowly lost his challenge to Democratic Rep. Jim Costa in 2010, to run on the Republican ticket. The white, middle-aged man appeared to come straight from the California GOP's central casting, but Mr. Vidak is more salt-of-the-earth than many of his new compatriots in Sacramento.

""My dream always was to have a few cows,"" Mr. Vidak says. After graduating from Texas Tech in 1991 with a degree in animal business, he worked agricultural jobs in California. With his savings, he bought land in Kings County to grow cherries and raise a small herd of cattle in the hills of Tulare. Such is the California dream east of the coastal ranges.

Mr. Vidak's campaign theme was the bifurcation of California: the coastal liberal elites versus the Valley folks. ""We're getting left behind here,"" he says. ""They don't view us as important.""

Case in point: The unemployment rate in Mr. Vidak's district is about 15%—two to three times as high as in the Bay Area—and exceeds 30% in some communities. The culprit? ""Our water has been cut off by the far left,"" he says.

Regulations to protect smelt from the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta water pumps have created a California water shortage, which is particularly acute in the Valley. This year farmers south of the delta will receive only 20% of their contracted allocations. An irking irony is that the smelt's biggest killer is the wastewater that Sacramento dumps into the delta.

""It's fish versus farmer,"" he says, and liberals are siding with the fish.

Other species-protection policies have removed thousands of acres of land from production, endangering the livelihoods of farmers and ranchers. Meanwhile, California's bullet train, beloved by liberals, will slash through Mr. Vidak's district and raze hundreds of farms, homes and businesses.

""We don't have clean drinking water in some areas of our district,"" Mr. Vidak says. ""And they want to build an $80 billion bullet train!""

His election opponent, Ms. Perez, endorsed the bullet train ""as the biggest jobs plan in California history."" However, she campaigned principally on raising the state minimum wage to $9.25 from $8, an issue that plays well in union-dominated, urban areas but didn't resonate with the Valley's farmers and small business owners.

Notwithstanding her Hispanic heritage, Ms. Perez appeared out of touch with Valley voters' values and concerns. She raised twice as much money as Mr. Vidak, but 90% of her contributions came from outside the district.

Despite Democrats' huge funding and voter advantage, Mr. Vidak was leading Ms. Perez by six points late Friday. If he fails to win an outright majority of the vote, the two will square off in a runoff on July 23.

Assuming Mr. Vidak wins, Democrats will have an opportunity to reclaim the seat in 2014. Yet they won't have an easy time since he'd be defending a newly drawn district with a smaller Democratic voter advantage.

Democrats may have a tougher time at the polls in general next year: Green policies like the state's renewable energy mandate, cap and trade and a low-carbon fuel standard will start kicking into high gear in 2014. What's more, Mr. Vidak's strong showing has put the state GOP in the unfamiliar position of feeling hopeful.

New party chairman Jim Brulte says the apparent upset is an encouraging sign that the pendulum in California is starting to swing the Republicans' way. ""Now will we be able to capitalize on it?""

Yet the president’s rosy portrait of America appeared surreal amid the continued economic malaise, racial discord and global disorder. And his optimism contrasted sharply with the cynical tone he’s taken over the last eight years, which has helped fuel the electorate’s rage.

“We’ve seen deficits come down, 401(k)s recover, an auto industry set new records, unemployment reach eight-year lows,” the president declared, rattling off a litany of achievements including killing Osama bin Laden, enacting ObamaCare, striking a nuclear deal with Iran and doubling clean-energy production. “By so many measures, our country is stronger and more prosperous than it was when we started.”

He later extolled compromise—“democracy doesn’t work if we constantly demonize each other”—and sought to unify Americans a la his speech at the 2004 Democratic convention: “I see Americans of every party, every background, every faith who believe that we are stronger together—black, white, Latino, Asian, Native American; young and old; gay, straight, men, women, folks with disabilities, all pledging allegiance, under the same proud flag, to this big, bold country that we love. . . . That’s the America I know.” Yet this isn’t the President Obama that voters have come to know.

Silicon Valley startups like Airbnb (founded in 2008), TaskRabbit (2008) and Uber (2009) have flourished amid the past eight years of languid economic growth by providing a platform for users to exchange goods and services. The so-called sharing economy increases productivity by leveraging underused resources (e.g., unoccupied housing) and labor.

But the tech disrupters are now being targeted by labor unions, plaintiffs’ lawyers and government rent-seekers. Also on the attack are liberal politicians who fear that new economic opportunities could undermine their goal of making more people dependent on government.

87,Finley,Allysia,wsj,"Donald Trump got a post-convention gift Friday when WikiLeaks released a trove of hacked emails that showed Democratic National Committee leaders conniving against Bernie Sanders.

Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz disparaged Mr. Sanders’s party loyalty in one email and called his campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, a “damn liar.” The party’s CFO, Brad Marshall, suggested trying to make an issue of the Vermonter’s religion: “Does he believe in a God. He had skated on saying he has a Jewish heritage. I think I read he is an atheist.” Amy Dacey, the party’s CEO, replied: “AMEN.”

It’s hardly news that the Democratic machine assisted Hillary Clinton throughout the primary. The party scheduled debates at times likely to draw few viewers—for instance, Sunday night at 9 p.m. Still, it’s bracing to see the political cynicism lain out in black and white.

The uproar cost Ms. Wasserman Schultz her job, as the chairwoman announced she will step down at the end of the convention. She leaves after having accomplished her mission of nominating Mrs. Clinton, for which she is being rewarded with a titular position as head of the Clinton campaign’s “50-state program” to elect Democrats nationwide.

At first the party establishment expressed remorse only that the improper collusion was exposed. Mr. Marshall, the CFO, apologized Saturday. “I deeply regret,” he wrote in a post on Facebook, “that my insensitive, emotional emails would cause embarrassment to the DNC.” The following day, after Ms. Wasserman Schultz announced her resignation, President Obama lauded her service, saying that “her fundraising and organizing skills were matched only by her passion, her commitment and her warmth.” Mrs. Clinton thanked her “longtime friend” for “getting the Democratic Party to this year’s historic convention.”

Meantime, Team Clinton is using Russian hackers as a diversion. “Sources are saying the Russians are releasing these emails for the purpose of actually helping Donald Trump,” campaign manager Robby Mook said. Campaign Chairman John Podesta sensed “a kind of bromance going on between Putin and Trump, which is distinct from this leak.”

The truth is that the entire party establishment opposed Mr. Sanders. Last fall President Obama tamped down on the furor over Mrs. Clinton’s email indiscretions by saying that “I don’t think it posed a national security problem.” More than 600 of the party’s 712 “superdelegates” backed Mrs. Clinton, even as most polls showed Mr. Sanders performing better against Republicans in November.

On Saturday the rules committee for this week’s Philadelphia convention attempted to mollify Sanders supporters: A majority of the committee voted to establish a postelection commission to consider reducing the role of superdelegates. This was intended to avert a floor fight on an amendment altogether eliminating superdelegates, which would have likely bled into a recital of party grievances.

Yet the sop did not placate disaffected Sanders voters, who view the episode as a symbol of the “rigged” political system. Thousands of protesters stormed the city’s center on Monday, demanding that the party “nominate Sanders or lose in November!” Mr. Sanders’s exhortations to back Mrs. Clinton were greeted with boos.

After getting jeered by her home-state delegation Monday morning, Ms. Wasserman Schultz was removed from the schedule of speakers. Late afternoon, the DNC finally apologized for “inexcusable remarks made over email,” saying it “does not—and will not—tolerate disrespectful language exhibited toward our candidates.” Democratic Party leaders are now rushing to tame the liberal furies they fanned for so many years.

They worry that Sanders voters—particularly working-class whites—are not tethered to the party. The WikiLeaks flap provides Mr. Trump an opening to preach that they’ve been cheated.

Most are party leaders and elected officials, who can function as a check on the rise of a factional candidate with dim prospects of winning the general election.

Meanwhile, Democrats in Philadelphia are thinking of dumping superdelegates. More than a dozen progressive groups including the Courage Campaign and MoveOn are backing an amendment to eliminate superdelegates in future primaries. The amendment, which is sponsored by 50 of the rule committee’s 187 members, will come up for a vote on Saturday. It needs to garner support from at least 25% of the committee’s members to be brought to the convention floor next week.

Many progressives complain that superdelegates (which make up about 15% of total delegates) can subvert the will of the people. “Our party’s most important nominating process includes a system of unpledged superdelegates that allows Democratic elected officials and party insiders to vote however they please,” wrote rules committee member Aaron Regunberg, a Rhode Island state representative, in an op-ed for MSNBC.com. “That flies in the face of every one of our democratic values.”

The superdelegate system was an antidote to the party’s McGovern Commission, which instituted reforms to the Democratic nominating process after the tumultuous 1968 election. Intended to empower minorities, the putative reforms resulted in a proliferation of state primaries and reduced the influence of Democratic power brokers.

By strengthening the party’s left wing, the rules changes contributed to Democratic routs in the 1972 and 1980 presidential elections. In 1972 George McGovern won just 37.5% of the popular vote and carried only one state (Massachusetts). Eight years later, Jimmy Carter did little better, with six states and 41% of the popular vote. After the 1980 election, the party created superdelegates to act as a moderating influence.",2,http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-sandernistas-revenge-1469229977
89,Finley,Allysia,wsj,"The Republican convention has been marked by a randomness that seems to reflect the candidate’s own political confusion.

Mr. Trump has yet to articulate a governing philosophy beyond an unerring belief in his own power to make America great again. Maybe he’ll bring his philosophy into focus Thursday night, but the odds of that happening, judging by the convention chaos so far appear, are about as likely as hitting the slots jackpot at the Trump Taj Mahal.

The convention began Monday with a fracas over rules; GOP power brokers and Trump delegates shut down dissenters, notwithstanding Mr. Trump’s insistence that he wants to unify the party. His lieutenant Paul Manafort then pilloried governor John Kasich—a popular Republican leading a swing state vital to any GOP presidential candidate—for not attending the confab. The message: You’re either with us or against us.

On Monday night, Mr. Trump’s wife, Melania, delivered an anodyne speech, but chaos and controversy ensued after it was discovered that some parts were lifted from Michelle Obama’s 2008 convention speech. The Trump campaign spent Tuesday denying accusations of plagiarism.

But as it became clear that the controversy wouldn’t fade on its own, writer Meredith McIlver on the Trump staff issued a Wednesday morning mea culpa for the “innocent mistake.” Mr. Trump refused to accept her resignation and tweeted this gem: “Good news is Melania’s speech got more publicity than any in the history of politics especially if you believe that all press is good press!”",2,http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-political-mystery-of-a-chaotic-convention-1469052601

California’s delegation is usually banished to the back of the hall at GOP conventions because the state isn’t competitive in presidential elections. But this year the delegates were all selected by the Trump campaign and pledged to vote for him on the first ballot. No threat of anyone making a scene in front of the cameras.

The delegation includes former Rep. Doug Ose, who played a lead role in quashing dissent against Mr. Trump’s nomination on the convention rules committee. Rep. Duncan Hunter, who in February was among the first members of Congress to endorse Mr. Trump, has led the New York businessman’s congressional outreach. While California’s convention delegates may all be loyal to Mr. Trump, many Republicans fear that the nominee could cause collateral damage to the state party and down-ballot candidates—and that the damage could be irreversible.

Since 2012, GOP voter registration in California has dropped to 4.8 million (27% of the electorate) from 5.2 million (30%), while Democratic registration has increased by 600,000 to eight million voters (45%). This partisan shift has been occurring for the past two decades since Pete Wilson championed an initiative barring illegal immigrants from using public services. But the GOP’s decline has accelerated over the past year as many moderate Republicans have defected and more Hispanics and young voters register as Democrats.

Mr. Trump’s candidacy also threatens to depress Republican turnout while driving more Democrats to the polls. Casualties could include three freshmen Republican state Assembly members who won election in 2014 by reaching out to minority groups. A liberal backlash could sweep out these Republicans, giving Democrats a supermajority in the state Assembly.",2,http://www.wsj.com/articles/quaking-in-california-1469041986

The Indiana governor, she said, is “one of the most hostile politicians in America when it comes to public education.”

Donald Trump has been vague on education, and his running mate’s efforts to expand school choice in Indiana have been largely overshadowed by the state’s culture wars. So it is nice to see Mrs. Clinton calling attention to Mr. Pence’s strong record of school reform. The Trump campaign ought to be doing the same.

In 2011, Mitch Daniels established private-school vouchers for low- and middle-income students in public schools, a program that Mr. Pence has steadily expanded by extending eligibility to siblings of voucher recipients, children living in failing public-school districts and those with special needs.

During the past few years, Indiana has also lifted the $4,800 cap on voucher awards, and the state has allowed students to continue receiving vouchers if their parents’ incomes exceed the threshold (150% of the poverty line). This year, Indiana extended the application window so that children contending with bad public schools can transfer at midyear to private schools.

Since 2012, the number of recipients has increased 10-fold to 33,000 students, while state funding has swelled to $132 million from $15 million. Nearly 60% of students in the state now qualify for vouchers.

But his recent remarks in an interview with Politico’s Glenn Thrush suggest that the senator from Texas might also stay true to political character by rewriting the GOP primary.

In the interview, Mr. Cruz blamed his defeat principally on the media, which “liked to paint me as some whacked-out theocrat” and putatively gave Donald Trump $3 billion in free publicity. “I think many of the mainstream media players are liberal Democrats,” he continued. “They believed Donald was the easiest candidate for Hillary to beat. And I think many of them wanted him to win the nomination.”

Bashing the media is popular sport among conservatives, so this may score sympathy points for Mr. Cruz, in addition to helping him rationalize his defeat. However, the rabble-rousing Texan has for years enjoyed gushing praise from the likes of Fox News, Breitbart and National Review, and he was the favorite of Steve Deace, a popular Midwest radio talk-show host.

Mr. Cruz also benefited from free political advocacy by groups such as Heritage Action, which supported his political imperatives to shut down the government to repeal ObamaCare in 2013 and to strike Planned Parenthood funding last year. When his kamikaze missions inevitably failed or backfired, he flogged his Republicans colleagues for supposed cowardice.

Another historical revision: Four weeks before dropping out of the primary, Mr. Cruz claimed to Mr. Thrush, “we were winning this race. We had won five states in a row, by double-digit margins, over the course of three weeks. Utah, North Dakota, Wisconsin, Colorado, Wyoming. Every one of those was a double-digit victory. Very, very different states.”",2,http://www.wsj.com/articles/ted-cruz-rewrites-primary-history-1468884618

Discussions about the future of self-driving cars have overtaken a matter involving Tesla of more near-term interest: Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s offer to purchase SolarCity (where Mr. Musk serves as board chairman) for between $23.96 and $25.73 per share, a 25% premium over SolarCity’s stock price.

Mr. Musk said that bringing electric cars, solar panels and battery storage under one corporate roof would produce operational synergies and create “the potential for Tesla to be a $1 trillion market cap company.” That’s about 32 times Tesla’s current valuation.

Neither company, though aided considerably by government renewable-energy subsidies, has ever recorded an annual profit. Last year Tesla lost $889 million—nearly three times as much as in 2014—while SolarCity’s loss doubled to $769 million. Investors may be feeling déjà vu as a shadow has fallen over the solar industry.

In April, the renewable-energy conglomerate SunEdison filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy following an Icarus-like fall. A year ago, former CEO Ahmad Chatila predicted that his company would be worth $350 billion by 2020—about 35 times its market capitalization at the time. Nine months later, the stock price had plunged by 99%, to 21 cents per share.

SunEdison’s stock first began to tumble last July when Mr. Chatila proposed paying $2.2 billion for the rooftop-solar installer Vivint Solar (the deal was scrapped in March), which activist investors lambasted as overpriced. It soon became clear that SunEdison’s growth, enabled by debt and complicated financial engineering, was unsustainable.",2,http://www.wsj.com/articles/for-tesla-the-forecast-is-partly-cloudy-1468184123

The Education Department projects that 1,400 vocational programs educating 840,000 students won’t survive its gainful-employment rule, which ties federal student aid to debt and earnings.

But the administration isn’t content with shutting down for-profits: Now regulators and prosecutors are even going after a businessman who waved the white flag and converted his vocational schools into nonprofits. With this administration, it’s a sin if you ever tried to make a buck.

In 2012 Carl Barney merged the CollegeAmerica, Stevens-Henager College, Independence University and California College San Diego with the nonprofit Center for Excellence in Higher Education (CEHE), which promotes reforms in college philanthropy. The 75-year-old British immigrant, who had been the for-profit colleges’ sole proprietor, tells me that he wanted to reduce his day-to-day responsibilities and channel more resources into education rather than paying taxes. “I didn’t want to be as involved,” he says. “I wanted to put more money back into the colleges.” He became the chairman of the new group of nonprofit colleges.

As the merger was being completed in 2012, Colorado Attorney General John Suthers, a Republican, began an investigation. In November 2014, the AG sued CEHE. According to the complaint, the colleges duped students into enrolling with deceptive ads such as one promising to help them “make more money and have a real career.”

The Colorado lawsuit cites poor graduate outcomes, yet Mr. Barney’s schools outperform local community colleges.

But even if Mr. Sanders loses on Tuesday, he could be a winner for California’s liberal politicians: The self-described socialist is expected to turn out masses of young people, and that could be a boon for down-ballot left-wing candidates for the state legislature.

In heavily Democratic California, the party’s primary is when most legislative contests are decided, and those can hinge on a few hundred votes. Despite California’s open primary, in which the top two finishers regardless of their party face each other in November, it’s unlikely that two Democrats will emerge unless there’s very low Republican turnout. The Sanders effect could give Democrats a supermajority in Sacramento, pulling the party—and the state—even further to the left than it already is.

Public unions, liberal groups, government reformers and businesses are wading into the primary in a big way. Because of term limits, there are six Senate (of 40) and 16 Assembly seats (of 80) open. The goal of many working to influence the primary is to shift the moderate-liberal balance of power in the Democratic caucus, since the Republican minority is usually irrelevant except for close votes to block tax increases.

Consider the 27th Assembly-district race in Silicon Valley, where six Democrats and one Republican are on the primary ballot. The general election is unlikely to be competitive since Democrats outnumber Republicans in the district by more than two to one.

The leading Democratic contenders are Madison Nguyen and Ash Kalra, both of whom have recently served on the San Jose city council. In 2012, Ms. Nguyen supported sweeping public-pension reforms—which Mr. Kalra complains “eroded employee morale and created the most toxic labor-management relationship in the city’s history.” Labor groups have endorsed Mr. Kalra, while Ms. Nguyen enjoys support from government reformers, like former mayor Chuck Reed, who hope to elect more moderate Democrats to the legislature.",2,http://www.wsj.com/articles/california-liberals-await-the-bernie-effect-1464907199

Shortly before the May 3 Indiana primary, a video of a Donald Trump supporter accosting Ted Cruz went viral. Surrounded by a throng of Trump fans shouting “career politicians have killed America,” the Texas senator tried to engage the man in a mock debate—without much success. Mr. Cruz made several attempts to discuss Mr. Trump’s record, then finally gave up and told the man that Mr. Trump “is playing you for a chump,” adding: “Ask yourself . . . why the mainstream media wants Donald Trump so desperately to be the Republican nominee?” The Trump supporter—whose favored candidate reportedly has enjoyed $2 billion in free media coverage—replied: “They’ve backed you every chance they get.”

Episodes like that, combined with Mr. Trump’s romp through the Republican presidential primary season, have shaken many people’s faith in the American electorate. But what if Trump voters, however uninformed, are still making a rational decision by backing him?

That is the contrarian argument advanced by political scientist Samuel L. Popkin of the University of California, San Diego, who has studied public opinion and elections for half a century. A native of Superior, Wis., the 73-year-old Mr. Popkin has also served as a consultant for the presidential campaigns of George McGovern, Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and Al Gore. Mr. Popkin is perhaps best known for applying the rational-choice theory of economics to voting.

His seminal 1991 book “The Reasoning Voter” argues that voters are public investors who “expend effort voting in the expectation of gaining future satisfaction.” They “combine, in an economical way, learning and information from past experiences, daily life, the media, and political campaigns” to make reasoned judgments about politicians.",2,http://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-voters-not-so-irrational-1462572038

The U.S. women’s team has won three World Cups and four Olympic gold medals since 1990. The men? They failed to qualify for this year’s Olympics and haven’t gotten past the quarterfinals in the World Cup since 1930. “Yet somehow,” Mrs. Clinton said, “the men are making hundreds of thousands of dollars more than our women.”

This would be outrageous if it were true. But it isn’t. Democrats are using the equal-pay issue to increase the turnout of female voters in the fall. The U.S. women’s soccer players have a different interest: Landing a better labor contract. The women’s national team and the U.S. Soccer Federation have been tangled in a labor dispute, and the players are trying to put pressure on their employer with a yellow card for gender discrimination.

In December the players-union lawyer sought to invalidate a 2013 memorandum of understanding that extended their prior collective-bargaining agreement, which expired in December 2012, through the end of this year. The action appeared to be preparing the way for a strike, which is prohibited by the agreement. In February the Federation sued the union to enforce the contract.

The risk of a strike before the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro this summer increases the women’s negotiating leverage. The union hasn’t publicly articulated its demands, but players last year complained bitterly about often having to play—as the men’s team rarely does—on artificial turf, which can be less forgiving than natural grass. Then there’s the dubious equal-pay matter.

Last month, five top women’s players filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission alleging gender discrimination. Players on the women’s team, they contend, earn as little as 40% of what their male counterparts are paid, despite having generated more revenues last year.",2,http://www.wsj.com/articles/womens-soccer-plays-a-phony-pay-game-1461623962
98,Finley,Allysia,wsj,"In the New York Republican primary on Tuesday, Donald Trump needs Long Island to come in strong for him. Ted Cruz and John Kasich need to over-perform in New York City and upstate to limit the front-runner’s delegate haul.

Why? Because of the intricacies of New York’s closed “winner takes most” Republican primary. Three delegates per congressional district (81 total) and 11 statewide are awarded. A candidate who wins a majority in any district or statewide captures all of the delegates. Otherwise, the district winner nets two and the second-place finisher receives one; statewide delegates are distributed proportionally. To pick up any delegates, a candidate must clear 20%.

The Real Clear Politics poll average in recent days had Mr. Trump (53%) well ahead of John Kasich (23%) and Ted Cruz (18%). Mr. Trump could make a clean sweep, but to grab the 11 statewide delegates by winning an overall majority he would likely have to rack up large margins in Long Island’s four congressional districts. That’s where a quarter of the state’s 2.7 million registered Republican voters reside. He will need to compensate for his relatively weaker support in the Big Apple and upstate.

Both Messrs. Kasich and Cruz have a shared interest in preventing the front-runner from clinching a majority. But the Texas senator and Ohio governor are also competing head-on for second place in upstate and western New York. Mr. Cruz especially needs to boost his support in these Republican-rich areas to ensure that he picks up some statewide delegates in case Mr. Trump doesn’t win a majority.

Most polls have Messrs. Kasich and Cruz running even in these regions, with Mr. Trump running just below 50%. Mr. Kasich performs better than Mr. Cruz in New York City and its suburbs, where there are fewer Republican evangelicals and more moderates. Last week a Siena College Research poll showed Mr. Kasich leading Mr. Cruz 32%-10% in the suburbs and 22%-19% in the city.",2,http://www.wsj.com/articles/gop-delegate-hunting-strategies-for-the-new-york-primary-1461022745

Yet the Obama administration has decided to block a privately financed project that could supply water to 400,000 Californians, even though the project has been approved by an alphabet soup of state and local agencies. The result will be to trap vast amounts of a precious resource beneath the Mojave Desert. Is water the new fossil fuel?

This tale of political and regulatory obstructionism begins in 1998, when Cadiz Inc., a Los Angeles-based company, developed plans for a groundwater bank and well-field on 70 square miles of private land overlying the base of the Mojave’s massive Fenner Valley and Orange Blossom Wash watersheds. Over centuries the aquifers there have amassed as much as 34 million acre feet of water, enough to sustain all of California’s households for several years.

However, tens of thousands of acre feet percolate into salty dry lakes and evaporate each year. Cadiz proposed capturing and exporting the groundwater to Southern California residents. The Cadiz Valley Water Conservation, Recovery and Storage Project could also help store occasional excess flows from the Colorado River that would otherwise drain to the Pacific Ocean.

Water experts such as those at the Public Policy Institute of California have recommended using groundwater banks to recharge aquifers during wet years and expand the state’s storage capacity. Relative to dams, storing water underground reduces evaporation and environmental harm.

None of this mattered to various green lobbies and California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who complained that the water project would deplete mountain springs and harm wildlife. But environmental reviews by hydrogeologists confirm that the nearest spring—located 11 miles away and 1,000 feet above the aquifer—would not be affected. Nor would fauna, which don’t rely on groundwater. After an exhaustive review, the U.S. Interior Department approved the project in 2002, but Sen. Feinstein maintained her opposition.",2,http://www.wsj.com/articles/trying-to-get-water-to-california-but-torpedoed-by-regulators-1460154453

Yet he has fallen victim to Sacramento syndrome, the phenomena in which Democratic politicians get taken hostage by labor unions and begin to identify with their captors.

On Monday Mr. Brown signed legislation raising California’s minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2022, from $10. The bill also gives in-house health-care workers three days of sick leave annually. “Economically, minimum wages may not make sense,” he noted. But “morally and socially and politically, they make every sense because it binds the community together and makes sure that parents can take care of their kids in a much more satisfactory way.”

That assessment—franker than you usually hear from the left—leaves out perhaps the most important angle of the minimum-wage increase in California: It brings together the state’s Democratic caucus, which has recently experienced fissures on environmental regulation, as well as race-based preferences in college admissions. Only two Democrats in California’s legislature voted against the minimum-wage bill.

Democrats claim that raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour will help one-third of California workers, but the real beneficiaries will be labor groups. Increasing the minimum wage could make it easier for unions to convince workers in lower-paying industries to fork over a share of their paycheck for union dues. It will also jack up the “prevailing wage,” which is used as a pay benchmark in collective bargaining and in construction-project labor agreements.

But millions of workers—including more than 99% of farmworkers and food-preparation and service employees who earn less than $15 an hour—may see their hours reduced, if they keep their jobs, as employers automate work and use other means to control labor costs.",2,http://www.wsj.com/articles/big-labors-maximum-leverage-in-california-1459965934

It’s a warm, sunny Saturday afternoon. More than 10,000 people have gathered here at the University of Central Florida’s CFE Arena—one mother and her high-school son had driven five hours Friday evening—to hear Donald Trump speechify.

The crowd, a sea of red, white and blue, waves placards that say “The Silent Majority Stands with Donald Trump.” Many have donned “Make America Great Again” trucker caps and “Trump 2016” T-shirts. At a bazaar outside, vendors hawk unofficial Trump merchandise, such as shirts with the candidate’s face superimposed on Superman.

The depth and range of Mr. Trump’s support has been reflected in polls and election exit surveys, which generally show him leading the Republican field among voters of all ages, and all levels of education and income. In Mr. Trump, many GOP primary voters have found a sort of messiah—or false prophet if you ask his opponents—who promises to restore American leadership and strength in the world.

However, the lesson Mr. Cruz seems to have drawn from his disappointing third-place finish is that he didn’t play the restrictionist card enough.

So now he’s trying to trump Donald Trump on immigration. This isn’t a winning strategy, but it may reflect an insular Cruz campaign that is struggling to convey a broader vision. In an interview on Monday night with Bill O’Reilly on Fox News, the Texas senator declared that he would use Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to round up and deport all 12 million immigrants in the U.S. illegally, no exceptions. “That’s what ICE exists for. We have law enforcement who looks for people who are violating the law and deports them,” he said.

If “Tommy O’Malley from County Cork in Ireland is over here and he overstays his visa and he has got a couple of kids and he settled into Long Island,” Mr. O’Reilly pressed, would a President Cruz “send the feds to his house, take him out and put him on a plane back to Ireland?” Mr. Cruz replied: “You better believe that.”

Then he added:

“Donald says once he deports them, he would let them back in as citizens. I will not—and for anyone who is concerned about—do not want to see wages driven down. And, I think Donald Trump and Marco Rubio are wrong to drive down wages and take away Americans’ jobs by giving 12 million people here legally U.S. citizenship.

The former state solicitor general therefore should be familiar with the Ninth Commandment: Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.

At the Faith and Family Presidential Forum in Greenville, S.C., last Friday, Mr. Cruz claimed that Marco Rubio didn’t support Congress using its “constitutional authority to defund Planned Parenthood.” The Texas senator insisted that Republicans “could have defunded Planned Parenthood in the wake” of cringe-inducing undercover videos that captured doctors discussing the business of trading in aborted fetal parts.

“But too many Republicans in Washington, especially leadership, were afraid to stand and fight,” Mr. Cruz declared. “Marco Rubio has spoken out about Planned Parenthood. But when these videos came out, I stood with millions of Americans calling on Republican leadership to use the power of Congress to defund Planned Parenthood and to cut off the money. And Marco stood up and said: ‘No, we shouldn’t.’ ”

This narrative distorts legislative history and Mr. Rubio’s record. After the videos surfaced, both senators backed stand-alone legislation to defund Planned Parenthood and channel government money to alternative women’s health-care programs. While the bill failed to draw enough votes to overcome a filibuster, it had the virtue of putting Senate Democrats on the record supporting the organization’s ghastly practices.

This wasn’t enough for Mr. Cruz, who then tried to shoehorn an amendment to defund Planned Parenthood into a continuing resolution—a strategy that risked a government shutdown reprising his futile crusade in 2013 to repeal ObamaCare. A government shutdown would have threatened the GOP’s Senate majority as well as its White House prospects and thereby hurt the pro-life cause.",2,http://www.wsj.com/articles/cruzs-bad-faith-blast-at-rubio-1455751257

If there is a silver lining, it’s that maybe conservatives will finally sober up and stop indulging their self-destructive impulse to choose the “most conservative” candidate or the one with no internal censor (or compass). They may finally realize how important electability is—and take a fresh look at Marco Rubio.

After an uninspiring performance in New Hampshire, the Florida senator used the South Carolina debate on Saturday as a mulligan to dispel criticisms that he is too callow and glib. While discussing immigration and foreign threats, Mr. Rubio came across as confident and capable without sounding robotic.

At the end of the night, Ted Cruz and Donald Trump were the ones looking juvenile after they engaged in a playground game of “liar, liar.” Mr. Trump sounded as uninformed as usual, though his supporters may not care. He had no solution for out-of-control entitlement spending other than promising, as so many politicians have before him, to eliminate waste, fraud and abuse. His harangue against trade deals and endorsement of an exit tax for companies that move abroad showed a shaky grasp of economics.

Unlike the front-runners, Mr. Rubio projected hope. Recalling the election of 1980, he noted that Americans “were scared about what kind of country their children were going to live in and inherit. And yet somehow Ronald Reagan was able to instill in our nation and in our people a sense of optimism. And he turned America around because of that vision and ultimately because of that leadership.”

Ronald Reagan aside, Mr. Rubio’s chiaroscuro contrasting the dark present with a bright future seems more to echo John F. Kennedy, who notably was also a youthful senator when he sought the Democratic nomination in 1960. In his acceptance speech at the convention, Kennedy said: “We are not here to curse the darkness, but to light the candle that can guide us through that darkness to a safe and sane future.” There are other similarities.

The Powerball jackpot, which is administered by a conglomeration of dozens of state lottery associations, is expected to hit $1.5 billion by the Wednesday-night drawing. That fabulous-sounding prize isn’t close to what the winner will take home.

The jackpot’s cash value is $930 million for a lump-sum payment. The total gets to $1.5 billion only if you opt for the “guaranteed” annuity paid out over 29 years.

The money for the annuity is invested in ultra-low-yield, U.S. government-backed securities, so unless you want to finance the U.S. government’s growing debt, you’d be better off taking the $930 million lump sum. Or what’s left of it after the taxman wades in. Assuming there’s a winner for this drawing—not a done deal, since the odds of hitting the right number are 1 in 292.2 million—the actual lump-sum payout will be closer to $475 million after Uncle Sam and state governments take their cuts.

The top marginal federal income-tax rate is 39.6%. You’ll be dunned 52.3% if you live in New York City, 49.5% in Oregon. The good news is that neither California, where the top marginal rate is 13.3%, nor Pennsylvania tax prize money from tickets bought in their states.

This goal will be nearly impossible to achieve with California’s current population, projected to grow by 30% over the next 35 years to 50 million. So ecovangelists are trying to block any economic development that could help support more people.

The Newhall Ranch project in north Los Angeles County, which aims to provide housing for nearly 60,000 people as well as tens of thousands of jobs at stores, schools and recreational centers, is the most recent target. With energy-efficient lighting, comprehensive recycling, bike trails and drought-tolerant landscaping, the 12,000-acre planned community would be a green Levittown. But the proposed development—one of the biggest in state history—has been under siege from its inception in 1994 by environmental activists.

The California Supreme Court recently rejected Newhall’s final environmental-impact report. The court’s legally nebulous decision could delay construction for years—and cast a pall over future development.

Newhall’s report, which the Department of Fish and Wildlife approved in 2010, was more than 5,000 pages, with hundreds of pages dedicated to analyzing its greenhouse-gas emissions as required by recent regulatory amendments to the 1970 California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The state wildlife agency projected that Newhall would reduce greenhouse-gas emissions 31% by 2020 relative to the California Air Resources Board’s 2008 “baseline” model. This was a larger reduction than the 29% cut that the board has mandated statewide.

The report also included measures for the developer to restore habitat for species potentially affected by the development, such as the coast horned lizard and Townsend’s big-eared bat.

The supermarkets that anchor the strip malls of Southern California’s suburbs are nearly as commonplace as public schools. And they rise and fold in an intensely competitive marketplace.

Case in point: Haggen Food & Pharmacy. The company filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in September and said it would close 127 of its 164 stores, including all of those it recently acquired from Safeway and Albertsons after those two chains merged in January. The bankruptcy came a mere six months after Haggen’s arrival in Southern California.

Consumers here are used to rapid change in the supermarket landscape, where new entrants frequently run out competitors. This change usually benefits consumers by producing lower prices and more options. But Haggen’s failure is a tale of how misconceived government intervention in markets backfired.

In March 2014, Safeway and Albertsons announced plans to merge their 2,400 stores, some of which operate under alternate brands. As with most mergers, the goal was to produce efficiencies from scale and increase negotiating leverage with suppliers. Albertsons CEO Bob Miller argued that the cost savings would help the companies stay competitive with Kroger, the country’s largest grocery retailer, as well as with warehouse stores, specialty grocers and discounters. Even dollar stores nowadays sell produce and dairy.

For example, within a few miles of one Albertsons in Tustin, a city in Orange County, there’s a Trader Joe’s, a Ralphs (Kroger), a Stater Brothers, a Sprouts Farmers Market, a Dollar Tree and two converted Haggens.

Margins in the supermarket business typically range from 1% to 2%, so minimizing overhead and labor costs is imperative. However, union collective-bargaining agreements drive up the price of labor. Supermarkets like Albertsons are struggling to compete with nonunion shops like Wal-Mart, Trader Joe’s, Whole Foods and even German upstart Aldi—which plans to open 45 stores in California next year.

In January the Federal Trade Commission threatened to block the $9.2 billion merger unless Albertsons and Safeway agreed to divest 168 stores across the West. The FTC opined that the merger would significantly reduce competition in 130 local markets and “increase the likelihood that the prices of food, groceries, or services will increase, and that the quality and selection” would decrease.

To reach this absurd conclusion, the agency leaned on the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, a simplistic measure of market concentration calculated in this case for each geographic area. The FTC ignored that many consumers shop for groceries near where they work or their children play soccer, not just in their home neighborhoods. The agency also ignored warehouse, specialty or discount stores as competitors to supermarkets, though they may present these retailers with the biggest threat because of their lower prices.

In January the FTC brokered the sale of 146 Safeway and Albertsons stores to Haggen, which at the time operated only 18 stores in the Pacific Northwest. The FTC also required that the store conversions take place within six months. Although not an explicit condition of the deal, Haggen agreed to honor existing collective-bargaining agreements so that workers at the converted stores maintained their seniority, pay and benefits.

“The proposed buyers appear to be highly suitable purchasers,” the FTC claimed, “and are well positioned to enter the relevant geographic markets and prevent the increase in market concentration and likely competitive harm that otherwise would have resulted from the Acquisition.” The agency appointed a monitor to oversee the store conversions.

By midsummer Haggen had grown ninefold and increased its workforce by 400%, but Southern California grocery shoppers were grumbling to the press about higher prices at Haggen stores. Haggen blamed Albertsons for allegedly providing inaccurate pricing data.

The bigger problem seems to be that the small Northwestern chain expanded too fast into foreign territory and could not cut its labor costs enough to stay competitive. In August, Haggen announced it would close more than two dozen stores, presaging its bankruptcy filing on Sept. 8.

The United Food and Commercial Workers is now blaming a “profit-hungry Wall Street investor”—Comvest Partners owns a majority of Haggen shares—for the tumultuous bankruptcy. Last week a bankruptcy court approved the sale of three dozen Haggen stores to Gelson’s and Smart & Final for $92 million. Another 55 stores that were put up for auction fetched $47 million.

In August Democrats in Sacramento sought to assist the union by passing a law—which the California Chamber of Commerce deemed a “job killer”— that would in effect require new supermarket owners to maintain the previous operators’ workforce and collective-bargaining agreements. But it’s unclear whether this law would apply after a bankruptcy fire sale. Like other contracts, labor agreements can be torn up in bankruptcy.

In any case, workers are likely to lose their accrued vacation, and those who work at unsold locations could soon be out of jobs. What’s more, the grocery-store market could ironically become more concentrated—the very outcomes that the California legislature and FTC were trying to prevent with their interventions.

111,Finley,Allysia,wsj,"In the tradition of the Obama administration’s pro-union shenanigans with the National Labor Relations Board, California’s Agricultural Labor Relations Board (ALRB) has teamed up with the United Farm Workers union to shake down workers at the state’s largest tree-fruit grower. Gerawan Farming, a third-generation family farm in Fresno, is trying to fend off the attack.

On Sept. 17, ALRB administrative-law judge Mark Soble issued a long-awaited decision on whether to count the Gerawan workers’ ballots cast in 2013 to decertify the UFW. Given the ALRB’s pro-union bias, Mr. Soble’s decision to throw out the ballots, disenfranchising thousands of workers, wasn’t surprising. Unlike other California agencies, the ALRB employs in-house administrative-law judges to arbitrate complaints. Still, both management and workers at Gerawan Farming were disappointed.

“To destroy ballots after the majority of employees asked for an election is wrong and undemocratic,” said Dan Gerawan, co-owner of Gerawan Farming in a written statement. “Thousands of our employees were told by the ALRB they had the right to vote as they wanted. To now say their votes won’t be counted is wrong and disrespectful to workers and their right of free choice.”

The roots of this story go back to 1990 when the UFW won a close election to organize Gerawan workers. After a single bargaining session, which failed to result in a labor agreement, the union abandoned the farm. In October 2012 the UFW resurfaced, demanding a contract that would require workers to pay 3% of their wages in union dues (between $600 and $1,000 a year). “Their message to our employees was you’re going to accept us or else,” Mr. Gerawan told me recently.

Most of Gerawan’s workforce has turned over since the early 1990s, and current employees didn’t welcome the union’s taking a bite out of their pay. The family-owned business pays grape pickers an average of $16.27, among the highest wages in the industry, and offers benefits that include parochial-school tuition for workers’ children.",2,http://www.wsj.com/articles/planting-a-pro-union-ruling-down-on-the-farm-1443827292

When most people think of this quintessential California suburb, the Angels baseball team or Disneyland probably comes to mind. But a five-minute drive from the “happiest place on earth” takes you to Palm Lane Elementary, ground zero in a fight between teachers unions and parents who are trying to fix California’s broken public schools. The conflict—as so often in American education—boils down to unionized teachers trying to stop minority children from attending charter schools.

Ninety percent of Palm Lane students come from low-income families. About 85% are Latino, and more than half aren’t native English speakers. Palm Lane has been on the California Education Department’s list of underperforming schools since 2003. In 2013 a mere 38% of students scored proficient or better in English on state tests. And Palm Lane is hardly an exception in the area: Four other elementary schools in Anaheim rank even lower on the state’s Academic Performance Index.

But Alfonso Flores is leading a grass-roots insurgency against the union-controlled regime at Palm Lane. The former teacher and father of four kids who attend public schools in Hesperia has used the state’s “parent trigger” law, passed in 2010, to force changes at a half-dozen schools in California. The law stipulates that if a majority of parents at a struggling school sign a petition, they can compel changes in school management or personnel. Sometimes, the parents contract with a charter-school operator. In one case, they hired a new principal. Parents have also used the law as a negotiating tool to force the district to make improvements like adding more staff.

As the new school year was getting started, Mr. Flores sat down with me in the park next to Park Lane that has served as a meeting place and training ground for parents in the trigger campaign.

Lithuanian workers last week began dismantling the last four Soviet statues standing in this Baltic state’s capital—which since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 has been transformed from a depressed East European backwater into a beacon of democracy and free markets.

The glorified monuments to Soviet students, workers, farmers and soldiers on Vilnius’s Green Bridge were erected in 1952 as homage to Communist Mother Russia. In calling for the statues’ removal, Mayor Remigijus Šimašius denounced the heroic depiction of the Soviet system as “big lies.”

Lithuania long ago vigorously repudiated communism. Removing these few remaining Soviet relics now signals the nation’s determination not to be cowed by an imperialist Russia that poses a threat to European democracies.

The apprehensions shared by many Lithuanians stem not just from Vladimir Putin’s incursions in Georgia and Ukraine, but from the country’s long history of Russian aggression and domination. In 1795, the Russian Empire seized most of Lithuania, which became independent again only in 1918.

California is another story. While gasoline in the Golden State is averaging $3.88 a gallon, the average price in the Los Angeles market shot up 65 cents this week to $4.30 a gallon, about 20 cents higher than a year ago. Gas prices surpassed $5 per gallon at some stations, hitting $5.49 in downtown L.A., according to GasBuddy.com.

As usual, purported consumer activists are blaming collusion among putatively monopolistic oil companies. The real culprit is anti-carbon regulation promoted by a cartel of green activists and liberal politicians that is aimed at raising energy costs to discourage consumption. Sticker shock at the pump, like water rationing and high electric rates, is the price Californians must pay for their environmental virtue.

For most of the 1980s and ’90s, Californians paid roughly the national average, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration data. Since 1999—the year Democrat Gray Davis assumed the governorship following 16 years of Republican leadership—California gas prices have sizably surpassed the national average and most of the lower 48 states, principally due to more stringent fuel regulations. California gas taxes are also about 12 cents higher than the national average.

In 1999, Mr. Davis’s Air Resources Board banned the fuel additive MTBE—a smog-reducing oxygenate that in low quantities has been detected in groundwater. It also adopted cleaner “reformulated” fuel standards that raised production costs. A tiramisu of other environmental mandates have been layered into the state’s fuel standards.",2,http://www.wsj.com/articles/sky-high-california-gas-prices-have-a-green-additive-1437174504

For decades, the country suffered chronic water shortages brought on by intermittent droughts amid rapid population growth—a problem only partly ameliorated by aggressive water pricing and conservation. In 2009, after five consecutive dry winters, the government water authority restricted outdoor gardening and agricultural irrigation.

By the end of this year, Israel will have completed three massive desalination plants in Ashdod, Hadera and Sorek that combined are capable of producing 100 billion gallons of potable water each year from the sea. More such projects are in the works. Next year desalination will provide about half of Israel’s water—not including the roughly 80% of recycled wastewater that goes mainly to agriculture—up from zero in 2004 and about 10% in 2009. The drought ended in 2012, and Israel doesn’t need to worry much about the next one. In a mere five years, desalination has turned a scarce resource into a commodity that may soon be exportable.

On the far side of the world, in another state often portrayed as a promised land of milk and honey, Californians are suffering perhaps the worst drought in a millennium. Desalination to the rescue? Carlos Riva, the CEO of Boston-based Poseidon Water, hopes so. But the same political and regulatory forces that have already exacerbated the state’s water shortage are standing in the way. Mr. Riva’s diplomatic way of putting it: “Water is a simple molecule, but a complex commodity.”

Most of the bureaucratic effort in California is going into cutting consumption. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation has turned off the spigot of water trickling from the Sierra Nevadas to farmers in the Central Valley. Gov. Jerry Brown last month ordered urban water agencies to cut usage by 6% to 36% (based on per capita consumption) and threatened $10,000 fines against noncompliant residents and businesses.

“Monopolizing San Francisco capitalists,” Mr. Muir wrote in a 1908 Sierra Club Bulletin, are “trying with a lot of sinful ingenuity to get the Government’s permission to dam and destroy the Hetch Hetchy Valley for a reservoir, simply that comparatively private gain may be made out of universal public loss.”

In 1913, the Democratic Congress passed and President Woodrow Wilson signed the Raker Act, authorizing San Francisco to build dams, powerhouses and pipelines to shuttle water and hydropower from Yosemite to the Bay Area. Contemplating the valley that would soon be a lake, Mr. Muir lamented: “The destruction of the charming groves and gardens, the finest in all California, goes to my heart.”

A century later, environmentalists have revived Mr. Muir’s crusade amid perhaps the most severe drought in over a millennium. Last month, a group of environmental activists organized under the sobriquet Restore Hetch Hetchy sued in state court to raze the O’Shaughnessy Dam and drain the reservoir, which now supplies water and power to 2.6 million Bay Area residents. If successful, the lawsuit would create a severe water shortage in the Bay Area, which has been among the areas least affected by the drought in the West. The lawsuit, a new front in a decades-long internecine battle between San Francisco grandees and environmentalists, is exposing some peculiar contradictions of liberal politics.

But how many gallons are needed to save a three-inch delta smelt, the cause célèbre of environmentalists and bête noire of parched farmers?

To protect smelt from water pumps, government regulators have flushed 1.4 trillion gallons of water into the San Francisco Bay since 2008. That would have been enough to sustain 6.4 million Californians for six years. Yet a survey of young adult smelt in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta last fall yielded just eight fish, the lowest level since 1967. An annual spring survey by state biologists turned up six smelt in March and one this month. In 2014 the fall-spring counts were 88 and 36. While the surveys are a sampling and not intended to suggest the full population, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service warns that “the delta smelt is now in danger of extinction.”

The agency acknowledges that its “existing regulatory mechanisms have not proven adequate” to arrest the fish’s decline since its listing under the Endangered Species Act in 1993 and that “we are unable to determine with certainty which threats or combinations of threats are directly responsible.”

Herein is a parable of imperious regulators who subordinate science to a green political agenda. While imposing huge societal costs, government policies have failed to achieve their stated environmental purpose.

The smelt population has been shrinking since the 1970s, with a few intermittent rebounds. In 2008 the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service issued a 396-page “biological opinion” identifying delta pumps, which export water to Central Valley farms and Southern California, as a major culprit in the smelt’s decline.

March Madness—the manic three-week tournament that culminates each college basketball season—may be the most celebrated vernal rite in the U.S. other than Easter. Last year’s games averaged 10.5 million viewers, with more than 21.2 million fans tuning into the championship between the universities of Connecticut and Kentucky.

The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) will rake in about $800 million from the broadcasting rights to this year’s tournament—a more than 500% increase from two decades ago.

Now, two decades later, the Raiders, Rams and San Diego Chargers are all jockeying to move back to L.A.—the Chargers decamped after their inaugural season in 1960—to the delight of local football fans. Yet there are only two openings since the L.A. market can’t support three teams, and the league will fund a new stadium only if it can be shared by two. Behold as teams play chess on the gridiron.

According to NFL Executive Vice President Eric Grubman, who is refereeing the three-player game, the league started aggressively exploring the Los Angeles market a few years ago as its financial position improved and it became clear that some teams might not secure public financing to replace their aging stadiums. “We began to place an emphasis on a league-driven stadium development,” says Mr. Grubman. In effect the NFL told team owners that if you come to L.A., we will help you build a stadium.

“This has had the effect of putting pressure on the home markets,” Mr. Grubman notes, though he denies that the league’s intention is to use the city as leverage. The Seattle Seahawks, Indianapolis Colts and the Minnesota Vikings have all at one time floated relocating to Los Angeles ostensibly to get local politicians to belly up to the bar.

Former California Gov. Gray Davis quipped in an ESPN interview in 2011 that maybe after the NFL had “ransomed money from every other city, they might come back to L.A.” In 1999 the Democratic governor helped squash L.A.’s bid for the league’s 32nd expansion franchise, which instead went to the Houston Texans, by refusing to pony up taxpayer money for a new stadium.",2,http://www.wsj.com/articles/allysia-finley-turning-fantasy-football-into-reality-in-los-angeles-1425080047

Mr. Rauner took a warm-up swing at the unions with a speech in Decatur, which happens to be the home turf of AFL-CIO President Michael Corrigan. For starters, he wants to do away with project labor agreements (PLAs) “that are basically what the unions have worked out with the politicians” who “they influence with campaign cash and then impose those contracts on the businesses that contract with the state.” Mr. Rauner complained that PLAs, which usually require contractors to pay union wages and benefits on public construction projects, increase costs by about 18%.

Also on his agenda are “right to work zones” that allow local voters and governments to decide whether workers should be required to join a union and pay membership dues as a condition of employment. While the Republican doesn’t intend to make Illinois a right-to-work state—he wouldn’t have the votes in the heavily Democratic legislature—he fundamentally supports “employee empowerment,” which is his preferred term for right-to-work. So cities like Decatur could pass their own right-to-work ordinances without the state enacting legislation.

His other ideas to make Illinois more business friendly include cutting workers’ compensation and unemployment insurance costs. He also wants to curb “lawsuit abuse,” which he says is “pushing doctors and health care providers out of the state.” One problem is “we’re one of the few states that elect our judges” and “we have unlimited ability for trial lawyers to donate political campaign cash to judges in their elections, the same lawyers who argue cases in front of those judges.”

Mr. Rauner’s more urgent, and less glamorous, job will be closing a $5 billion deficit over the next two years without raising taxes. The personal income and corporate tax increases that Democrats passed in 2011 partially sunset this year, and the governor has suggested extending the sales tax to some services to fully phase out the income-tax hike and close the budget gap. That will be a heavy lift in the legislature.

The Swiss central bank’s recent gambit jolted global markets and currency traders, but as Mr. Federer suggested, a rising franc will also take a bite out of his winnings. In the past two weeks, the Swiss franc has appreciated by about 15% relative to the Australian dollar. Mr. Federer was bumped Friday in the third round and will take home 60,000 Australian dollars ($47,599) in prize money, which will now be worth about 8,000 francs ($8,868) less. Had he won the championship, the Swiss currency spike would have cost him 400,000 francs ($443,298).

124,Finley,Allysia,wsj,"Judging by his State of the State address Tuesday, Republican Chris Christie doesn’t want to be president as much as he wants an express ticket out of Trenton.

The New Jersey governor unofficially kicked off his White House campaign with a speech that almost seemed intended to antagonize the Democratic state legislature—the same legislature whose support he needs to pass pension and tax reforms he says are so important to New Jersey’s economy. In some ways the speech resembled President Obama’s State of the Union addresses—more cynical than aspirational.

Mr. Christie lamented that businesses are fleeing New Jersey because of high taxes supported by Democrats, but then he took credit for $630 million in corporate handouts last year, as if corporate welfare is anything to brag about. That $630 million was nearly enough to pay last year’s state pension bill, which Mr. Christie said the state had insufficient funds to cover.

The state’s unemployment rate has fallen to 6.4% from 9.7% in January 2010 when Mr. Christie took office. That’s still well above the jobless rates in neighboring New York (5.9%) and Pennsylvania (5.1%). As for those deriding New Jersey’s slow-growing economy? “That’s politics,” the governor says.

Mr. Christie’s approval rating has plummeted to 39% from 73% two years ago. Part of the governor’s problem may be his fractious relationship with the legislature and his failure to deliver on pledges. Last spring he broke his promise—enshrined by law—to adequately fund pensions in return for Democrats voting to reduce benefits. Now he’s exhorting Democrats to cut a deal on more aggressive pension reforms.",2,http://www.wsj.com/articles/political-diary-escape-from-new-jersey-1421343675

Ms. Wylde says her role as president of the Partnership for New York City is to support “whoever is chancellor” of public schools and to encourage collaboration among their stakeholders, namely the teachers union. Thus the Partnership has backed Mr. de Blasio’s Potemkin reforms supported by the teachers union, but was missing in action during last year’s pivotal battle over charter schools.

The Partnership includes CEOs of 200 New York-based businesses that attempts to influence policies. Its views are especially important now because business is one of the only counterweights to a city government dominated by public unions. So when Ms. Wylde abdicates leadership on education reform, she is effectively turning over city schools to the mighty United Federation of Teachers, or UFT.

Not long ago the Partnership was a vociferous champion of school reform. The group led the charge for state legislation in 1998 that authorized charter schools and in 2002 that established mayoral control of New York City public schools.

Between 2002 and 2013, the number of New York City students attending charters grew to 70,000 from 2,400. As of June 2014, there were 197 charters with 83,200 students enrolled and about 50,000 on wait-lists. More than 90% of charter students are Hispanic or black. Math proficiency rates increased by twice as much at charters than at district schools last year.",2,http://www.wsj.com/articles/allysia-finley-new-yorks-partnership-for-the-education-status-quo-1420675242

127,Finley,Allysia,online,"‘We just know for a fact that if you can always get more money, you will look to the money rather than to alternative spending practices,” California Gov. Jerry Brown explained two years ago in an interview with University of California students. This inadvertent moment of candor occurred while the governor was campaigning for a giant tax hike (Prop. 30) that has now put him in a jam.

To get out the college vote for the 2012 tax initiative, Mr. Brown threatened to slash state funding for the University of California’s 10 campuses if his referendum failed. The UC Board of Regents warned that the cuts would compel them to jack up tuition by $2,400—about 20%—at midyear. The tax hike sailed through in no small part because of this double-teaming.

Yet now the governor’s former UC allies are unhappy with their sliver of the revenue spoils. So they’ve revived the tuition-increase threat, hoping to extract more tax dollars from the state. Prodded by UC President Janet Napolitano, the regents on Thursday voted to raise tuition by up to 5% annually for the next five years if the state doesn’t pony up more cash.

All this has politicians and the regents quarreling like a married couple that just won the lottery. Herein is a parable in the conflicting values and priorities of liberal governance.

In last year’s budget, Mr. Brown agreed to boost state funding for the UC schools by 4% to 5% annually in return for a four-year tuition freeze. The governor also proposed a host of reforms intended to make the state universities more efficient, including increasing online education, requiring professors to teach more classes and cutting pay for administrators.",2,http://online.wsj.com/articles/allysia-finley-playing-chicken-with-tax-dollars-and-tuition-in-california-1416612138
128,Finley,Allysia,online,"House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy fashions himself the California GOP’s top gun, so we want to know: How did Republicans squander all eight pick-up opportunities and wind up with a net loss of one seat in the Golden State?

Democratic freshmen Ami Bera of Elk Grove, Scott Peters of San Diego, Julia Brownley of Ventura and Raul Ruiz of Riverside appeared most vulnerable. All four won close races in 2012 thanks to unusually high Democratic turnout driven by the presidential race and a pair of highly charged ballot initiatives to raise taxes and restrict union political spending.

Republicans were also poised to take out Democratic Reps. Jim Costa, Jerry McNerney and John Garamendi in the parched Central Valley where farmers have been denied water to save fish. Redistricting has whittled down the Democratic voter advantage in Rep. Lois Capps’s Santa Barbara district to fewer than four points from what had been 20. Republicans also stood a chance of holding retiring Rep. Gary Miller’s seat in Rancho Cucamonga, which the incumbent won two years ago thanks to a fluke resulting from the state’s top-two primary.

Yet with nearly all ballots counted, it appears that Republicans have gone 0-9 in toss-up races that were almost all decided by margins of fewer than five points. Most were eminently winnable in a year with record low turnout—fewer than half of registered voters who cast ballots in 2012 did so this year—and no competitive top-of-the-ticket races to rally the Democratic base.

The National Republican Congressional Committee appears to have written off most of these contests. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, the NRCC did spend about $3.1 million and $2.9 million on the Bera and Peters races, respectively, but Democrats spent more in these districts and invested in others. Support from NRCC was especially critical for Republican challengers since Democratic incumbents in many races raised four to five times as much cash.",2,http://online.wsj.com/articles/political-diary-house-gops-california-washout-1416497965

130,Finley,Allysia,online,"Republican Bruce Rauner, a former private-equity manager, spent more than $20 million of his own money to defeat Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn. So what is he going to do next? Kick off another campaign, naturally.

Mr. Rauner faces perhaps the most daunting task of any governor in the country. Illinois has the nation’s worst credit rating, most insolvent pension system and barely any job growth. A Democratic state legislature can override his vetoes, and its chief power broker, House Speaker Michael Madigan, has every incentive to undermine the new governor given that Mr. Rauner’s likely Democratic challenger in 2018 will be the speaker’s daughter, state Attorney General Lisa Madigan.

First, Mr. Rauner will need to peel off enough Democrats to phase out the state’s 2011 “temporary” income and corporate tax hikes, which will begin to sunset at the end of this year. Democratic leaders want to force Mr. Rauner to break his campaign promise to roll back the tax increases and to sign onto a limited extension next year.

So the onus will be on Mr. Rauner to corral a dozen Democrats in the House and 10 in the Senate to support his tax plan. The good news is that the legislature includes a large faction of moderate Democrats who are fiscally conservative but culturally liberal. The bad news is that the legislators are in hock to Mr. Madigan, who’s also the chairman of the state Democratic Party.

We’re told that Mr. Rauner will soon announce a fundraising campaign to counteract the Madigan machine. The Republican hinted at his plans last year in an interview with WLS Radio. “We’re going to raise a PAC, we’re going to raise a fund dedicated to the state legislature, members of both parties who take the tough votes,” he said. “We’ve got to protect the members who take tough votes.”",2,http://online.wsj.com/articles/political-diary-bruce-rauners-next-campaign-1416239596
131,Finley,Allysia,online,"California environmentalists offered referenda last week to ban fracking in San Benito, Mendocino and Santa Barbara counties, as a political test for a possible statewide initiative. They found that there isn’t an abundant reserve of public support.

The fracking bans passed easily in the northern coastal counties of Mendocino (with 67% of the vote) and San Benito (57%), but those are among the most liberal and least populous counties in the state. Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown won re-election by 40 points in Mendocino and 25 points in San Benito. Some 20,000 ballots were cast in the two counties, out of 5.5 million statewide.

The two counties also aren’t rich in fossil fuels. Most drilling in California occurs along the Central Coast and in Los Angeles and the Central Valley, where oil producers hope to use fracking to extract oil from the Monterey shale deposit.

Environmentalists are particularly eager to wall off these areas from fracking, which could unlock vast untapped reserves. Yet they haven’t found much support in the state legislature. A ban on drilling in state waters off Santa Barbara died in the legislature this summer—months after eight Democrats senators killed a statewide fracking moratorium by voting present.

The county initiatives were an attempt to go around the legislature. The referendum in Santa Barbara banned fracking, steam injection and other “high-intensity petroleum operations.” Supporters warned that fracking could cause earthquakes and contaminate the water supply, notwithstanding tight state regulations.",2,http://online.wsj.com/articles/political-diary-california-greens-eye-fracking-ban-1415638431
132,Finley,Allysia,online,"Teachers unions took a drubbing on Tuesday after spending more than $100 million to try to elect their allies and steamroll education reformers. Like good Democratic team members, now the unions are blaming President Obama for their sweeping losses while taking credit for their few slim, hard-fought wins.

“The Republicans successfully made it a referendum on the president,” American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten said on Wednesday, by way of explaining the union’s thumping. “In the few places where you had issues like education and you had a good candidate who could get through the torrent of negative ads, we were able to win.”

Kudos to Ms. Weingarten for her optimism and ironic humor in the wake of defeat. Reformers like Republican Govs. Rick Snyder in Michigan, Scott Walker in Wisconsin, Nathan Deal in Georgia and Sam Brownback in Kansas did cut through a torrent of negative union ads and prevailed.

Teachers unions this election provided an object lesson in how to lie with statistics by lambasting school reformers across the country for “cutting” education spending. According to one ad, Mr. Brownback signed the “largest single cut to education in Kansas history.” Florida Gov. Rick Scott stood accused of taking a $1.3 billion sledgehammer to schools, and Mr. Snyder of slashing $1 billion from education.

Yet in Kansas, total per pupil spending has increased to $12,960 from $12,283 since Mr. Brownback was elected in 2010, despite a $412 per pupil decline in federal aid. Mr. Snyder has increased education spending by $660 per student over his four-year tenure, while Mr. Scott has increased annual state funding for schools by 20%—nearly $2 billion—over the past four years.",2,http://online.wsj.com/articles/allysia-finley-teachers-unions-flunked-their-midterms-1415318909
133,Finley,Allysia,online,"Liberals are casting the governor’s race in Kansas as a referendum on conservative governance. But if Republican Sam Brownback loses re-election, the fault may actually lie in his failure to govern more conservatively.

A Fox News poll on Friday had the governor trailing state Senate Minority Leader Paul Davis by six percentage points, though a YouGov survey over the weekend shows Mr. Brownback ahead by a point. The conflicting polls suggest that this race will come down to turn out—that is, whether Mr. Brownback can rally conservatives to show up on Tuesday to counter enthusiasm among his opponents.

Our sources say that Mr. Brownback’s biggest problem is that he’s allowed Democrats to control the debate. Rather than trumpet his achievements, the governor has gotten bogged down repudiating claims about fictitious spending cuts to schools. In fact, total education expenditures are at an all-time high. Facts aside, conservatives will never win a debate over school funding because Democrats will distort the statistics. And in their opinion, government can never spend enough on schools.

The governor instead ought to be sketching out a bold agenda for a second term. When I asked Mr. Brownback a few weeks ago about his goals if he wins re-election, he ticked off increasing education funding, tackling the state’s water shortage and reforming poverty (i.e., welfare and entitlement) programs. The former two are indistinguishable from Mr. Davis’s campaign platform. And the governor isn’t talking about the latter, maybe because he’s afraid of giving liberals more fodder.

Mr. Brownback’s other big problem is that he’s squandered his hard-won conservative majority in the legislature. In 2012, the governor and his allies at the state Chamber of Commerce defenestrated moderate GOP senators who had opposed his tax cuts and obstructed other policy reforms. But then the governor retrenched.",2,http://online.wsj.com/articles/political-diary-why-the-kansas-governors-race-is-close-1415045757
134,Finley,Allysia,online,"If Rhode Island Treasurer Gina Raimondo loses the governor’s race on Tuesday, it won’t be because she bucked the public unions by championing pension reform. It will be because she bucked her own economic principles and the Catholic Church in order to reconcile with the Democratic left.

Ms. Raimondo ran away with the Democratic nomination last month by campaigning as a centrist. She flogged her 2011 pension reforms—which rank as perhaps the most aggressive nationwide—and argued against raising taxes. Her primary opponents, Clay Pell and Angel Taveras, ran to the left and split the public-union vote.

Although a Democrat hasn’t been elected governor in Rhode Island since 1990, Ms. Raimondo emerged from the primary as the prohibitive favorite. Democrats enjoy a four-to-one voter registration advantage over Republicans, and Ms. Raimondo boasted nearly as high approval ratings among Republicans and independents as Democrats.

Trouble was that the Republican nominee Allan Fung, mayor of Cranston, had quickly consolidated his base and turned to courting the labor vote. A Providence Journal/WPRI-TV poll earlier this month showed union members favoring Mr. Fung by 12 points. Ms. Raimondo could lose if public unions and their liberal allies sit out the election or vote for Mr. Fung from spite.

So Ms. Raimondo, a Catholic, sought to shore up her left wing, first by repudiating Mr. Fung’s “economic philosophy, which is one of cut social services, cut government and cut taxes and you automatically have job growth.” It’s “a wrong-headed economic theory,” she professed last month.",2,http://online.wsj.com/articles/political-diary-raimondo-loses-her-religion-1414682063
135,Finley,Allysia,online,"To increase their clout in California, Republicans will need to nominate more diverse candidates, though they needn’t compromise their core principles. A case in point is Republican Carl DeMaio, an openly gay fiscal conservative who’s challenging San Diego’s freshman Democrat Scott Peters.

A new SurveyUSA poll shows the race deadlocked, notwithstanding recent sexual-harassment accusations by an ex-DeMaio staffer. San Diego County District Attorney Bonnie Dumanis this week cleared Mr. DeMaio of any alleged wrongdoing, though it appears that voters had already dismissed the dubious charges. Mr. DeMaio, a former San Diego city councilman, leads the Congressman by 16 points among independents and runs nearly even among women.

This is particularly notable since Mr. Peters has from day one been working to paint Mr. DeMaio as a tea-party troll, a tack Democrats are using up and down the state against Republican challengers. One ad declares that “DeMaio’s funded by Tea Party extremists, who oppose pay fairness for women” and has “pledged to support their extreme agenda in Congress.”

Mr. Peters’s problem is that Mr. DeMaio doesn’t exude extremism. For instance, he supports increasing guest-workers visas and asserts that any kind of fix to ObamaCare should continue to provide health coverage for pre-existing conditions. Climate change, he says, is affected by human activity, but a “global challenge.” He believes the federal government should allow states to regulate marijuana.

National Republican leaders last year recruited Mr. DeMaio to run in California’s 52nd Congressional district in part because his homosexuality would help the GOP recast itself as more inclusive. But more importantly, he’s a solid fiscal conservative and reformer. In 2010 he campaigned successfully against a ballot measure to increase the city’s sales tax by half a cent. He also championed the city’s 2012 pension reform—supported by two-thirds of voters—that shifted future hires to a 401(k) plan.",2,http://online.wsj.com/articles/political-diary-big-tent-republicanism-1414181926
