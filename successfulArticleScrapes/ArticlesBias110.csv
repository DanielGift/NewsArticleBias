0,Andrews,Helen,theamericanconservative,"Empire of Pain: The Secret History of the Sackler Dynasty, by Patrick Radden Keefe (Doubleday: 2021), 560 pages.

It hasn’t been easy to get to the bottom of the Sackler story. From the beginning, the family hid its business dealings in a tangle of subsidiaries. When reporter Barry Meier blew open the story of OxyContin in 2003 with his book Pain Killer: A Wonder Drug’s Trail of Addiction and Death, the Sacklers convinced his employers at the New York Times to ban him from writing about opioids over a contrived conflict of interest. Depositions have been sealed, whistleblowers intimidated, critics bought off, publications threatened with lawsuits.

Patrick Radden Keefe got the full Sackler treatment when he published his blockbuster article “The Family That Built an Empire of Pain” in the New Yorker in 2017, which launched the trend of taking the Sackler name off various endowed buildings, galleries, and professorships. Their lawyer fired off dozens of letters to Keefe’s editors alleging factual errors and threatening to sue Keefe if he proceeded with this book project. Some unknown party even sent a mysterious man in an SUV to stake out Keefe’s house. These attempts at intimidation failed, and we now have the book, Empire of Pain: The Secret History of the Sackler Dynasty.

Sadly, the Sacklers are an underwhelming lot to have ruined so many lives. They were not evil geniuses. Of the original three brothers, Arthur, Mortimer, and Raymond, two got their degrees from an unaccredited medical school that closed down shortly after they graduated. Raymond’s son Richard, who ran Purdue Pharma during the height of the OxyContin surge, couldn’t manage to get into a better med school than SUNY Buffalo (he later transferred to NYU), even with his family’s money.

The only impressive Sackler was Arthur, the eldest of the original three, and his genius was not for medicine but for advertising. In the field of pharmaceutical marketing, “Arthur invented the wheel,” as one of his employees put it. It was his innovation to get around the legal ban on direct-to-consumer medical advertising by targeting doctors. “It was laughable, he asserted, to suggest that a physician might be seduced by a glossy layout in a medical journal in the same manner that a housewife might be swayed by a slick ad in a magazine,” Keefe explains. His tactics made a bestseller of the antibiotic Terramycin in 1957 and, later, of the early sedatives Librium and Valium.

His advertising firm came to the attention of the FBI during the McCarthy era. Sackler had a habit of hiring refugees, immigrants, and blacklisted journalists who had been fired from other jobs for their political connections. The result, Keefe says, was a radical atmosphere around the office. “On one occasion, a Swedish designer, who was a communist, made a scene by starting a small fire in the office and burning some of the firm’s own advertisements, to indicate his distaste for such ‘capitalist trash.’” According to one coworker, “We all thought it was hilarious.”

The FBI might have been onto something. It was not until the FBI files were FOIA’d by Keefe and other researchers that it became publicly known that at least one Sackler brother, and possibly all three, were Communist Party members. Raymond and his wife Beverly Feldman cared enough to transfer their membership to the Boston chapter when they moved there in 1944 and then back again to New York when they relocated. Arthur was close friends with millionaire Soviet spies Alfred Stern and Martha Dodd. One veteran Daily Worker journalist who worked for Arthur told a researcher in 1991 that, as he understood it, “all three Sacklers had been party members early on.”

There certainly was a Soviet grandiosity to Arthur’s vision for “narcobiotics,” a catchall term for the tranquilizers of the future, which he predicted would be dispensed as easily as antibiotics. All forms of distress had a biological basis, he believed, so naturally all pain and even unease should be treated medically. (He told his second wife she was wasting her time with psychoanalysis when she tried therapy during the breakdown of their marriage.) By boosting sales of Librium, Arthur wasn’t just serving his client. He was pursuing his vision.

The slogan the Purdue sales reps came up with for OxyContin in 1999 would have made Arthur (who died in 1987) proud: “The One to Start With and the One to Stay With.” The Sacklers’ innovation, and the source of their moral culpability, lay in overcoming doctors’ reluctance to start patients on strong opioids out of fear of addicting them. After Purdue’s campaign claiming, based on spurious studies, that addiction to OxyContin was vanishingly rare, sales jumped from $50 million in 1996 to more than $1 billion in 2000 and oxycodone became the most prescribed drug in America.

Their second sin was not changing course when it became clear from Purdue’s own sales data that doctors were running pill mills. Here the Sacklers had assistance from conservative think tanks such as the American Enterprise Institute. AEI fellow Sally Satel wrote in 2004 that “the typical OxyContin addict does not start out as a pain patient who fell unwittingly into a drug habit… When you scratch the surface of someone who is addicted to painkillers, you usually find a seasoned drug abuser.” Keefe notes that Purdue Pharma was a five-figure AEI donor.

Emails sent in 2001 and finally made public in 2019 reveal that Richard Sackler was equally contemptuous of opioid addicts. “Abusers aren’t victims, they are the victimizers,” he wrote to an unidentified correspondent, who responded, “The whole thing is a sham and if people die because they abuse it then good riddance.” Alas, Richard wrote back, “calling drug addicts ‘scum of the earth’” won’t play well “when I’m ambushed by 60 Minutes.”

So the Sacklers’ defense that they didn’t know their product was fueling an epidemic is false. They did know. They just didn’t care. But their other defense has more merit: that they were not the only ones responsible.

Medicare Part D, for example, caused the annual price of a typical oxy prescription to drop from $39,420 to $2,677. Three-fourths of the growth in opioid prescriptions between 2001 and 2010 came from government programs. Seniors discovered they could sell their pills on the street for huge profits, and young people connived to qualify for Social Security Disability Insurance and the Medicaid card that went with it. “For a three-dollar Medicaid co-pay,” Sam Quinones explains in Dreamland, “an addict got pills priced at a thousand dollars, with the difference paid for by U.S. and state taxpayers.”

In 2018, President Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers prepared a report on opioid prices and their contribution to the crisis, but the Justice Department and the Department of Health and Human Services attempted to suppress it. According to Trump CEA chief economist Casey Mulligan, then-HHS secretary Alex Azar, who was among Medicare Part D’s architects during the Bush era, did not want anyone connecting that great Republican policy success with the opioid epidemic. Clearly the Sacklers are not the only ones trying to bury their role in the crisis.

The point is that the opioid epidemic was something that was done to Middle America. They “trusted the science,” as we are now constantly exhorted to do. OxyContin was marketed to them and subsidized for them as a safe alternative to morphine by people who knew that it was not. Far more than the tobacco plaintiffs who claimed to have been duped by the cigarette companies, the people who became addicted to OxyContin really were duped.

Keefe ends his book with the settlement that the Trump Justice Department reached with Purdue Pharma in October 2020, which was far less comprehensive than the Master Settlement Agreement with Big Tobacco. No individual executives were charged and the Sacklers’ personal fortune was left intact. Keefe seems disappointed by the deal, which may be fair enough, but litigation might not be the best way for a healthy polity to process something like the opioid crisis. The black-and-white world of the law requires boiling down the Sackler family story into narrow questions of legal liability. To appreciate their moral responsibility demands a fuller telling, the kind of sweeping dynastic saga that Keefe has given us.",1,https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-sackler-familys-dynasty-of-guilt/

That is the thesis of a new report from the Institute for Family Studies by Laurie DeRose and Lyman Stone, More Work, Fewer Babies: What Does Workism Have to Do with Falling Fertility?",1,https://www.realclearpolicy.com/2021/03/23/more_workism_fewer_babies_769353.html
3,Andrews,Helen,theamericanconservative,"The fertility rate in America would be higher if we made it easier for women to balance work and family—so goes one theory. Universal child care and other forms of aid to working mothers are this theory’s favored policy solutions.

But what if the problem is not work but workism? That is the thesis of a new report from the Institute for Family Studies by Laurie DeRose and Lyman Stone, More Work, Fewer Babies: What Does Workism Have to Do with Falling Fertility?

“Workism,” as DeRose defines it, is any culture where a person’s job has “a moral and even an ideological value where self-expression is through work.” The report’s evidence shows that countries that place a high value on work as a source of meaning have low fertility, even when those countries support families in other ways.

The Nordic countries used to be cited as proof that you could have a modern, self-expressive, feminist culture and high fertility, as long as government supported childbearing with generous social benefits and egalitarian-minded men pitched in around the house to ease the burden of women’s “second shift.”

Unfortunately for that argument, the Nordic countries have all seen a sharp drop in fertility in the last ten years. Finland, Norway, and Iceland are all now at their lowest birthrates ever recorded.

To turn those trends around, governments should not focus on child care, paid parental leave, or other such work-focused programs, because, according to this report, any solution that “raises the salience of career-mindedness” will not succeed in raising fertility. Framing government support for families as a matter of making it easier for moms to get back to work is therefore a trap.

“Easing work–life balance is pro-natal,” Stone explains, but “increasing social emphasis on work: anti-natal.”

The implicit target of this report is the brand of girlboss feminism that says that the solution to any family or fertility problem is to make women feel more empowered. If women aren’t having as many children as they would like to have, then it must be because they are being constrained by the patriarchy (in which case their husbands and bosses need to be more feminist) or a lack of resources (in which case give them money). I wrote a little bit here about why more money is not an adequate solution to America’s family crisis. But for more on why work-oriented feminist empowerment is not adequate either, read this new report.",1,https://www.theamericanconservative.com/state-of-the-union/more-workism-fewer-babies/
4,Andrews,Helen,theamericanconservative,"The Inevitable: Dispatches on the Right to Die, by Katie Engelhart (St. Martin’s Press: 2021), 352 pages.

Sometime around 2019, it started to look like assisted suicide would be one of the rare culture war battles that social conservatives were going to win. Mainstream publications like the Guardian and the New Yorker published negative articles about the Dutch and Belgian euthanasia regimes. The case of Noa Pothoven sparked bipartisan outrage: Despite having no illness other than depression, the Dutch 17-year-old was given palliative care and helped to die at home (though she was not actively euthanized, as initial reports suggested). A consensus seemed to be forming across political lines that when more than a quarter of deaths are induced, as is the case in the Netherlands, that is not a good thing.

Katie Engelhart wants to change all that. Her new book The Inevitable: Dispatches on the Right to Die, underwritten by a New America fellowship, is a report on the current state of assisted dying. It’s an excellent read, full of good reporting. I highly recommend it as literary nonfiction. But it is also a presentation of the most up-to-date version of the pro-euthanasia argument, one that assimilates and responds to the backlash, and is thus a preview of what to expect when that debate heats up again.

Naturally the most obvious addition, this being the Black Lives Matter era, is identity politics. Euthanasia is said to be okay because it does not disproportionately affect minorities. “I don’t know of a situation or condition in medicine that we’ve worried so much about for which the risk factors have been wealthy, white, and insured,” jokes one doctor quoted by Engelhart. Before Oregon passed its pathbreaking euthanasia law, many feared it would be used to target the poor and socially marginal. In fact, patients who seek out physician-assisted dying are mostly well-off and educated, and overwhelmingly white.

But that’s true of suicide in general: White people are more likely to commit suicide than black people. Antidepressant use is highest among the college-educated. If the demographics of assisted suicide look more like the demographics of regular suicide than, say, cancer—where whites and the college-educated are not overrepresented—doesn’t that suggest that the two are more similar than advocates would like to claim? That euthanasia is more of a psychological phenomenon and not just a rational response to unbearable pain?

Engelhart herself concedes that euthanasia is rarely about pain. “What surprised me most, looking through the Oregon Health Authority data, was that most people who ask to die are reportedly not in terrible pain,” she writes. “The vast majority cite ‘losing autonomy’ as their primary end-of-life concern. Others worry about ‘loss of diginity,’ loss of the ability to engage in enjoyable activities, and ‘losing control of bodily functions.’”

The best chapter in the book is the profile of Maia Calloway, a woman in her late 30s with rapidly progressing multiple sclerosis who goes back and forth on whether to travel to Switzerland to end her life. She is put off by the way the founder of Dignitas comes across on television, “emotionally detached and a bit full of himself,” and even when she finds another clinic she likes better, she wavers. When Engelhart leaves her, Maia still plans to go to Switzerland someday, but in the meantime is binge-watching news about Russian election interference and getting really into the Mueller report—which says something both about the affluent liberal tinge of this issue and also about how tenaciously human beings find reasons to cling to this world.

The overall impression of the pro-euthanasia movement left by this book is that it is driven by Boomers. I am not saying that because I just wrote a book about Boomers; Engelhart notices it, too. The notorious “Dr. Death” of Australia, Philip Nitschke, is described to Engelhart as “a child of the Sixties” by his partner Fiona. Nitschke targets his rights-based euthanasia pitch at seminars to a Boomer audience. “The men and women of his generation—people who had fought for civil rights and women’s rights and the end to the massacre in Vietnam—shouldn’t have to bow and scrape to healthcare bureaucrats in their final years,” as Engelhart summarizes it. “Boomers getting into their twilight years,” Nitschke observes, “just want access to lethal drugs.”

Liberation is the keynote of Boomer politics, and that’s how Engelhart frames euthanasia: as a liberation movement. She compares today’s “euthanasia underground” to the Jane Collective, which performed thousands of illegal abortions in Chicago between 1969 and 1973. “Hadn’t I read about underground women’s groups that offered abortion in the years before Roe v. Wade?” she writes. “Didn’t I know that whenever the law falls short, people find a way?”

Abortion is the right comparison, but not for the reason Engelhart thinks. Social liberals have gotten the idea that all their culture war fights are like gay marriage: once they win, it’s over. But after Roe v. Wade, conservatives did not slink away defeated. Far from it. The issue is even more divisive today than it was in 1973. Such will be the course of the euthanasia issue, even if more states join Oregon and California in legalizing it or if those states expand their eligibility criteria.

Euthanasia will never achieve gay marriage’s widespread acceptance because it is, fundamentally, unsettling to the human conscience. There is a reason the people who campaign for it tend to be creeps. Engelhart deserves credit for admitting honestly that she is sometimes unnerved by Nitschke, for instance by the way he felt exhilaration and “this sexual urge” after killing his first patient: “Reading his description years later, I shuddered. He had liked it.”

Personally, I was most disturbed by Dr. Lonny Shavelson, the Bay Area assisted suicide specialist profiled in the first chapter, who added fentanyl to his drug cocktail after being inspired by a drug abuser. “He had got the idea from a New York Times article about an opioid addict who overdosed after sucking the fentanyl out of some prescription pain patches and letting the solution dissolve in his check. ‘Wow, why can’t we do that?’ he had wondered.”

But this unsavoriness should not obscure the fact that there is in fact room for common ground on this issue, even between such natural enemies as the Final Exit Network and the Catholic Church. People forget that in the first landmark euthanasia case, Karen Ann Quinlan’s in 1975, it was her Catholic parents and their priest who wanted to pull the plug. It was the medical professionals who resisted, not because they thought Quinlan should live but because they were afraid of legal liability. Bureaucratization made a prolonged mess of American dying more than any scientific advances did. Opposing this bureaucratization and acknowledging that sometimes it is right to let go are natural points of agreement between the two sides.

Engelhart observes that many elderly patients who feel ready to die don’t dare mention this to their doctors and nurses, or even their friends, because they fear being reported as a suicide risk and put into “lockdown psychiatric watch, stripped of their belts and shoelaces and privacy, for hours or days.” That is another natural point of agreement: We should all want people at the end of life to feel able to discuss these matters with total candor. But even with all the candor in the world, euthanasia will never be something most of us can accept as normal. The stories that Engelhart presents, whether or not this was her intention, give a glimpse of why.",1,https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/on-the-front-lines-of-assisted-dying/

6,Andrews,Helen,lawliberty,"Richard Reinsch (00:04):

Today we’re talking with Helen Andrews about her new book Boomers: The Men and Women Who Promised Freedom and Delivered Disaster. Helen Andrews is senior editor of The American Conservative, before that managing editor of the Washington Examiner, she was a Robert Novak Journalism Fellow and her writing has appeared in numerous journals, including The New York Times and First Things, among others. She’s also written for Law & Liberty in the past. So we’re glad to have her on the program to talk about Boomers, Boomer nation.

Helen Andrews (00:53):

That’s us! We are the boomer nation.

Richard Reinsch (00:55):

So Helen, what got you interested in writing about the Boomers? I mean, there’s been obviously a lot said about them. What did you want to add?

Helen Andrews (01:03):

Well, I’m a millennial to start by laying all of my cards on the table. And the millennials and the boomers are natural enemies, in many cases because the boomers are our parents. And as I looked around the world, when I graduated from college in 2008, into the teeth of a massive financial crisis, I started thinking that the world that my generation had inherited was not the one that we were supposed to, that something had gone wrong, somewhere. And so I wanted to trace back, where mistakes had been made, in the economy, in politics, in religion, in the family. And every time I tugged on a thread, I found that it led me back to the generation that came of age in the 1960s, and started running the world in the 1990s. And that was the baby boomers.

Richard Reinsch (02:00):

Something that I’ve always thought about with the baby boomers. And I think about it in terms of my own family, one of my grandfathers grew up on a farm during the Great Depression, in northern Indiana. He talked a bit about that with me difficult times, then very early in his life goes off to fight in a world war in the Navy, and then comes back. And GI Bill goes to college, becomes an engineer, and raises a family. And when I juxtapose his early life with the life he was able to create for his children. And this is I think, throughout the baby boomer generation. And so he would be a part of what’s called the silent generation. So we have a boomer generation that grows up, obviously, underneath the specter of nuclear war. But they grow up compared to previous American generations and conditions of unparalleled prosperity, and peace, and good education systems, largely very much intact families. And what do you think goes wrong there?

Helen Andrews (03:13):

The long and short of it is that the boomers, as you say, came of age, at a time of unparalleled prosperity. I don’t think America has ever been wealthier in the fullest sense than it was in the 1950s and 60s. And it was also a time of great social cohesion. All the things that make American society great, we’re still functioning at full capacity then, our churches were exceptionally strong in the 1960s, our civil society, and informal volunteerism, all of that good stuff, was hitting record highs in the 1950s. And all of this together gave the baby boomers a sense that that was just the natural order of things, that the natural state of the world is for everybody to be rich, and for society to work well. And for there to be high levels of trust among the people who live together. And they behaved on that assumption over the next six decades. And the result was that they thought they could act out and destroy institutions and that society would continue to function in the wonderful, healthy way that it had when they were young kids.

Helen Andrews (04:31):

And of course, that’s no longer the case. Prosperity, as we have discovered is not the natural order of things, and that if you destroy institutions like the churches, then the result will be what you see today in the Protestant mainline, which has churches their moribund, is not on their literal deathbed. So that was what happened to the boomers. They came of age at the time when everything was great. And they assumed it would always be that way, no matter how badly they acted.

Richard Reinsch (05:00):

Question, in your research for this book did you ever take up the question, something that I’ve been interested in. What’s the interaction between, say, the silent generation and these children that they’re raising? And it seems to me at some level, there was just a failure to inculcate time-honored habits and the American past, at some level, did you think about that?

Helen Andrews (05:26):

I did. But the thing that first made me start questioning that narrative, that it’s actually the silent generation fault. And the greatest generation fault is reading about the phenomenon of the 1960s in other countries because, of course, the baby boom 1960 that was a global phenomenon. And the people in Germany and France, who asked themselves, why is it that all of our students are rioting in the streets and throwing cobblestones at cops in 1968? The answer they came up with was, well, they hate their parents because their parents bequeath them a world of war. Their parents were the generation of fascism and collaboration. And that’s why these young Frenchmen don’t trust anybody over 30. I thought, well, that’s almost the opposite of the situation you had in the United States. Here, the narrative is that the generation that were the boomers’ parents were the good guys, and they made things too nice for their kids. And that’s why they hated them. And you can’t have two opposite explanations for an identical phenomenon. So eventually, I ended up concluding that the generational boomer phenomenon, the 1960s, that rebellion, was a product just of simple demographics, when you have a very large generation, as the boomers were, when they become of age, they start to throw their weight around because there are just so many of them and that makes their desires just so important to the rest of society. So that was what was going on not in the actual… The substance of generational debate did not have a lot to do with it.

Richard Reinsch (07:00):

You profile six boomers in your book and you in many ways mirror very successful book Eminent Victorians by Lytton Strachey, which was a very successful book at the time for dispelling a vaunted legacy of the Victorians in the English mind. I take it you wouldn’t mind taking that place here in America with regard to the boomers, you profile Steve Jobs, Aaron Sorkin, Jeffrey Sachs, Camille Paglia, and Al Sharpton. I’m wondering, why not Bill Clinton? Isn’t he the quintessential boomer?

Helen Andrews (07:35):

He was absolutely on my shortlist. And the reason why I ended up passing his name off, even though he is as you say, the quintessential boomer, I agree with you 100% is that I wasn’t sure there was a lot left to say about Bill Clinton that hasn’t already been said. And also, I got a chance to say most of what I wanted to say about Bill Clinton in the chapter on Aaron Sorkin. Because if people out there don’t know, if you watch an episode of The West Wing, there’s a 75% chance that at least one of the plotlines in that episode is ripped from the headlines, as they say in Law and Order from something that actually happens in the Bill Clinton White House. If you know anything about the Clinton years, you will see familiar news stories and anecdotes pop up in The West Wing all the time. So that was where I got my chance to say what I have to say about Bill Clinton.

Richard Reinsch (08:32):

And then in that regard to Hillary Clinton. I know there is so much that has been said about them. It’s the handprint. The boomer generation is so large, and their print on all aspects of American society continues today. And it to me he just exemplifies that and what he was able to achieve and also dissolve.

Helen Andrews (08:56):

And also Clinton was a man who squandered what were great gifts, not just the power that he was granted that he then abused, but the gifts that God gave them. He had many virtues, and he did not turn them to as good use as he should have. And that’s the boomer story in a nutshell.

Richard Reinsch (09:14):

Okay. You profile first, Steve Jobs, he seems to be the one you’re the most sympathetic to.

Helen Andrews (09:22):

People have told me that I get gradually less sympathetic as the book goes on. That may be true.

One of the most fascinating subjects to me of California and business in Silicon Valley, is how the hippie side and the aggressive capitalist side are two sides of the same coin, that they are more alike than people tend to anticipate.

Richard Reinsch (09:28):

Yes, with Jobs, you profile him. Why?

Helen Andrews (09:33):

Because you really can’t tell the story of the last sixty years in the United States without talking about technology. And nobody shaped our view of technology more than Steve Jobs. He’s also somebody who exemplifies California more than just about anybody. If you bought Apple products in this century, you’ll probably remember turning over on the back of your iPod or whatever and seeing made in China, but designed in not in America, designed in California. So Apple was very much a California company. And if you think about the boomers’ effect on the world, pretty adequate way to summarize, it would be making us all look a little bit more like California. And that’s what Steve Jobs represents to me.

Richard Reinsch (10:20):

Jobs in the Apple company and creating the smartphone, which has, I mean, in my mind, transformed so many things and in conjunction with social media, in terms of how we interact with information and interact with one another. Jobs also you write about, there’s certain countercultural strains in Jobs, but also certain other strains as well, in terms of I didn’t know that he wasn’t going to allow pornography apps to be sold on Apple products, et cetera. And he said, “We’re going to do what’s right for our customers.” So there was this interesting, sane part of Jobs that you profiled.

Helen Andrews (10:58):

Absolutely. He was a quintessential boomer in some ways, but the anti-boomer in other ways, the stand against pornography in the Apple Store is one example. He hated politics. I mean, he would go to a meeting at the Obama White House if they invited him just because there’s always a hobnob with powerful people. But the strain that you see in Silicon Valley now where everybody’s very woke and political, he just had no time for that. And he insulted Bill Gates and his dabbling in philanthropy. For Steve Jobs, he was a true-believing capitalist. That was what he thought was his contribution to the world, which is, in many ways very unboomerish, as well.

Richard Reinsch (11:42):

There’s the side of Silicon Valley that it was this myth of the hippie in the garage, inventing new tech products that we would use, but it was about creativity, with some amount of bourgeois productivity and business acumen, but this was really the flowering of a new ethos and way of being in business. And do you think Jobs fulfilled that? Or is he a crossways, with that?

The reason why the boomers are failing to be a bulwark against crazy woke fanaticism is that they feel like these kids are just believing the same values that they do. You see it in Silicon Valley all the time, the people who run Google in the top management positions, the boomer generation people have the same values as sensibly as the millennials who are terrorizing them. It’s just that they thought we could pursue those values and still be nice to each other.

Helen Andrews (12:07):

One of the most fascinating subjects to me of California and business in Silicon Valley, is how the hippie side and the aggressive capitalist side are two sides of the same coin, that they are more alike than people tend to anticipate. I think my favorite thing that’s ever been written about Silicon Valley is Tom Wolfe’s essay that’s collected in his collection, Hooking Up about noise in the early founding fathers of Silicon Valley. And because he’s Tom Wolfe, one of the things he notices is the way everybody’s dressed. And he notices that California has a much more casual style and you can spot somebody from East Coast Wall Street when they come out to visit a Silicon Valley company in a second because they’re the only ones wearing a suit and tie. But when I talked to boomers, just to have my personal acquaintance about things that they thought had changed in the last 50 years, one of the things that a lot of them mentioned was workplace attire, that is a lot more casual now than it used to be. And that’s a great example of the Californication of the rest of America. It used to be, you only saw that kind of thing on the west coast. Now you see it everywhere showing up in jeans and sneakers to an office job. But one of the boomers that I talked to about this phenomenon made a chilling observation, he said that this casual workwear coincided exactly with longer hours, that it used to be even in my hardcore New York law office, that everybody kept basically nine-to-five or nine-to-six hours, everybody understood even your boss, that everybody ought to be home for dinner. And it was only as the go-go ’80s started going and especially into the ’90s that they started thinking it’s okay to ask your employees to start staying till 10 o’clock at night on a regular basis. And so supervisors said, “Well if I’m going to do that, I can’t ask them to be in an uncomfortable suit all that time.” So in that way, the rise of casual wear in the office went hand in hand, with employers demanding more and workers losing leverage in the workplace. It’s not about self-expression and dressing how you want no, it’s about them squeezing every drop of labor they can out of you. So I think that’s the kind of California workplace the Steve Jobs represented.

Richard Reinsch (14:26):

As you say that I think I’m recalling something I read about Marissa Mayer, who was the CEO of Yahoo, that started on the ground floor of Google, that she didn’t go home for 30 days or something like that, something ridiculous like that in the early days of Google. I guess one thing that comes to mind here is so the wokeplace phenomenon in some ways in which is such a part of Silicon Valley and it’s become at least what you and I do. It’s something we interact with every day, an unpleasant reality. And that’s post-boomers though, isn’t it? Isn’t that something that, did they prepare the way for that? Is that a part of this merging of workplace and values and virtues? Or does that come after them? And it sparks the question. Are we afraid of an America after the boomers? Do we fear what that might look like? One place is, the presidential race, we were actually afraid of the next generation of Democratic politicians. So we chose Joe Biden.

Helen Andrews (15:27):

I think that’s absolutely right. But we can’t let the boomers off the hook because the reason those Millennials are so terrifying, is because of the things that the boomers taught them. And the reason why the boomers are failing to be a bulwark against crazy woke fanaticism is that they feel like these kids are just believing the same values that they do. You see it in Silicon Valley all the time, the people who run Google in the top management positions, the boomer generation people have the same values as sensibly as the millennials who are terrorizing them. It’s just that they thought we could pursue those values and still be nice to each other. They weren’t fanatical about it. So the millennials know that they have the leverage in these battles. Because the boomers claim to believe in the very same thing. So yeah, the boomers are the last barrier between the coming insanity that is the world takeover of absolutely everything. But they were the ones who created the monster in the first place.

Richard Reinsch (16:37):

I want to skip, this being Law and Liberty. The last person you profile is Justice Sonia Sotomayor, talk about her for a minute. There was a lot of interesting facts about her in your reporting that I wasn’t aware of. But one of the things it calls to mind and is and there’s another person you profile before her, the Reverend Al Sharpton, that there’s this awareness, particularly for later stage baby boomers of how civil rights has turned into maybe not so much transformational, you talk about that, but a way in which one can really further one’s own projects.

Helen Andrews (17:17):

I think that’s an accurate description of Sonia Sotomayor and she learned it back in college. She writes in her own memoir about how… she went to Princeton on a full-ride scholarship. And rather than express gratitude for being able to attend an Ivy League University for no money, she decided to attack the university for cultural genocide for not having enough Puerto Rican professors.

Richard Reinsch (17:43):

She used that term cultural genocide?

Helen Andrews (17:46):

I don’t think she used the term cultural genocide, but she did say the obliteration, eradication of an entire culture it was something suitably hyperbolic.

Richard Reinsch (17:56):

Yes.

Helen Andrews (17:57):

But we shouldn’t hold it against her. She was an undergraduate at the time, and undergraduates are just naturally hysterical. The real fault lies with the Princeton administration, which responded to the blackmail letter that she sent them about not having enough Puerto Rican-born staff, by falling all over themselves, and saying, “Oh, of course, we’ll appoint a diversity manager right away.” And that was an early lesson for her, that if you just invoke the right narrative of victimhood, everyone will fall over themselves to comply with what you’re requesting. And that’s the way that the law is, that’s not just a product of culture, that’s a product of civil rights laws, and has come to be interpreted. And now that she’s the one doing the interpreting, she’s very happy to expand its reach so further.

Richard Reinsch (18:43):

Yeah, and that institutionally, obviously, that goes on today, throughout all universities, Princeton’s response to the latest round of protests we’ve been experiencing in this country is to accuse itself of systemic racism and to promise ways in which it’s going to counteract that including building more majors devoted to the studies of other cultures that aren’t affiliated with European civilization. Sotomayor, though, you talk about her pushing forward. There’s a conversation one time she has about affirmative action with a law partner of a major firm. And I thought it was a law partner quizzing her about does she think it’s fair for minorities to be in certain positions when they’ve likely obtain those positions through race and affirmative action? And she’s incensed about this. And I can understand how that would be an aggressive question to ask someone from a minority background.

Helen Andrews (19:46):

You’re right that that was an aggressive question on the part of the law partner. The setting this clarifies the anecdote for listeners is that she was a three L at Yale Law School about to graduate and go look for a job and it was at a job fair when all of the big firms in New York and across the country come to Yale Law to interview prospective hires. And it was at a dinner of about a dozen people where the partner was there and went around the table quizzing people. And he really got into it with her saying, “Do you think you’re only here because you’re Puerto Rican? Do you think it’s fair for our firm to hire people on affirmative action grounds when we know they’re going to wash out in a couple of years?” And she complained to Yale Law and said, “If you don’t do something about this, I will file a complaint, saying that that firm should not be allowed to send partners here to interview law students for jobs ever again.” And the firm submitted a letter of apology and was actually forced to submit two letters of apology because the first one was not apologetic enough. But the reason why I liked that anecdote is that there is an exact parallel one about Antonin Scalia. When Scalia got out of Harvard Law, he went to interview at a Midwestern big law firm, I think Jones Day and the partners there said, “Oh, you’re a Catholic? Well, then you must believe in blue laws saying that we got to close our shop on Sundays. Don’t you think that’s imposing religion? Aren’t you just a retrograde, Pope follower, or whatever?” And he really aggressively attacked his Catholicism. He was, of course at the time, the only Catholic at the table. But the reason law partners do that is to see how you respond under pressure. Because judges will sometimes get into it with you, and sometimes the judges will be wrong or irrational. So seeing how you respond to aggressive, angry, irrational questioning is something that prospective hirers might want to know if you’re applying for a job as a lawyer. And Scalia himself, even though a lot of the questions they asked him were unfair and racist, just gave as good as he got. He really got into it because he enjoys the feeling of debate. That’s what he lives for. And the fact that Sotomayor responded in such an opposite way. There’s a lot about their respective characters.

Richard Reinsch (21:57):

Just, as I was thinking about Sotomayor, one thing that came to mind, you probably came across this, PJ O’Rourke has this analysis of the baby boomer generation that is so large, and it takes into account so many different aspects of America, given that how rapidly America changed as they came into their own, that there’s this first tranche of baby boomers who are the most left-wing, and were the most committed to social change, were the ones leading protest later as an early adulthood, then you have this middle group, who moderates more, and they’re following. But they’re also the first ones to really go home and call it a day. And then you have this later group, which he puts Barack Obama in, who pretty much figure out which way the wind is blowing and adjust accordingly. So maybe they’re left-wing, maybe they’re moderate, maybe they’re something else, they’re corporate, or whatever. They’re willing to cut deals. And he says, “This is precisely how the boomers understood Barack Obama and the famous Reverend Wright episode where Obama was in his church, presumably, while this man was preaching and saying a lot of hateful things. And Obama’s response was, “Yeah, I didn’t take any of it seriously. And I was just there because I was in Chicago politics. And that’s what people did.” And the boomers instantly accepted that because many of them actually knew that to be the way they’ve handled things in their own lives. I’m curious what you think of that. But is Sotomayor seemed like, as I read your account of her one of the ways in which she found a way to succeed was precisely to rely on the things that she was being given to rely on to succeed?

Helen Andrews (23:39):

Yeah, I’m glad that you brought up the PJ O’Rourke book because, in some ways, the book that I wrote was a response to his. He even wrote a whole book about the baby boomers, which is very acute and very funny.

Richard Reinsch (23:50):

Yeah.

Helen Andrews (23:51):

But it ultimately a little bit too fond. And so when I read it, I thought he hadn’t really stuck tat knife in quite the way that I wanted to see the boomers be treated. So I wrote my entire book because I thought PJ O’Rourke was too nice.

Richard Reinsch (24:05):

Okay.

Helen Andrews (24:06):

But the framing that he uses is really useful. It’s what you say that there are divisions within the boomer generation. I think he compares them to seniors, juniors, sophomores, and freshmen at a high school. They’re all in the same cohort, but they’re different generations. And yeah, that might be a good way to think about Sotomayor. And one occasion, when Sotomayor the younger boomer came into conflict with somebody from just slightly, the generation ahead of her somebody born in their early 1940s was when she was confirmed and Laurence Tribe, the Harvard law professor, decided to attack her and almost along the lines that you’re saying, he said, “For me, left-wing law is a matter of intellect. I have the arguments. I’ve thought about this deeply. I know what I’m doing with bringing my liberalism to the law.” Sotomayor, Laurence Tribe famously said in a memo that he wrote to the Obama administration is, and this is a direct quote, quite simply not as smart as she thinks she is which is rather a rude thing for a Harvard professor to say about somebody who was about to be a Supreme Court justice. But it was really the argument that you’re presenting that for the younger boomers, it was just something they absorbed, they were not on the front lines of these protests, they did not arrive at their liberal opinions through deep thought or outrage response to social conditions. They just saw that it was the dominant belief system and adopted it because that’s what you do to get ahead. And Tribe was worried that in close cases, when the outcome depended on the liberal justices managing to win arguments with Anthony Kennedy, Sotomayor would not be impressive enough in those intellectual arguments to get Kennedy’s vote because her liberalism was not sufficiently intellectual. Now, I think the moral events or the outcomes of that story, proves something important about the baby boomers, which is that Laurence Tribe was wrong, the non-intellectual, more emotional, more therapeutic style of argumentation that Sotomayor prefers, has actually been really successful. She is everything he said she was. And yet she has won. And she has prevailed in arguments and won in cases. So I think maybe the intellectuals were not as powerful or as influential as they might wish they were. And it’s the people for whom liberalism is just an adopted belief system because it’s in the air supply are the ones who have the power.

Richard Reinsch (26:47):

You note the dissenting opinion, she writes in the Michigan case where voters in a popular referendum had eliminated racial preferences in that state, and a suit was filed that this in and of itself was racial discrimination. And Sotomayor wrote a blistering opinion of basically equating the voters in that state with Jim Crow voters. And there were some other things she said in that opinion as well that were just howlers and she was criticized directly by Chief Justice John Roberts. And also she was criticized by, it was Scalia, I think, but you said that actually referring to this, this may have changed Kennedy’s mind. You argue.

Helen Andrews (27:28):

Yeah. And Joan Biskupic, is a Supreme Court reporter has written biographies of I think, at least three sitting justices, maybe four. But she is a Supreme Court journalist. And she believes based on evidence, that Sotomayor blackmailing dissent was what changed Kennedy’s opinion. And if you look at Kennedy’s jurisprudence, from the moment he was confirmed, he has been a reliable vote against affirmative action. Justice Kennedy did not like racial preferences. So it was a genuine surprise that in this Michigan case that you’re talking about, he ended up on the Sotomayor side. The rumor mill attributed that really startling defections on Kennedy’s part to this blistering dissent, and really something that called out for explanation because it would require something extraordinary for Kennedy to come down in defense of racial preferences.

Richard Reinsch (28:24):

Helen, now, maybe switching gears here. You include, and I thought this is an interesting choice. You include Jeffrey Sachs, in your list. I’m curious why I don’t naturally think of him when I think of him and boomers. But you explore the arc of his career. And I thought that was interesting.

Helen Andrews (28:43):

He was one of the first people that I thought of when I was thinking of people who capture the essence of boomerness, maybe because he personifies the combination of idealism and hubris. Nobody can question Jeffrey Sachs’ idealism. He’s a professional do-gooder, but not a humanitarian in the philanthropic sense. He’s a an economist, which is also, in my mind, very representative of the baby boomers. Their consummate do-gooders are not people who run charities. They’re people who have PhDs in economics, this elevation of social science and expertise to the highest value, and that that’s who we should give true power to people with PhDs. That’s something that the boomers invented, that’s a boomer phenomenon. So you see, it’s right at the intersection of a lot of different boomer qualities, and also one of the three most famous economists living.

Richard Reinsch (29:46):

Yeah. Do you think his contributions and what he has done in the developing world you write about his first foray was in the country of Bolivia, one of the more impoverished countries in Latin America also heavily involved in transitioning communist countries, Russia, Poland into a more market-oriented settings? And then obviously his work goes on in Africa. What do you make of his overall contributions there?

Helen Andrews (30:12):

I think he’s done a lot of good. And this is probably a good moment to mention that I think a lot of the boomers that I’ve profiled, did a lot of good. None of these chapters are intended purely as takedowns. I want to give a full and objective assessment. And in the case of Jeffrey Sachs, I think a fair and objective assessment would have to say he did a lot of really good things. The downside of his career, a lot of people hate him for what he did in Russia. And there’s no question that the transition from communism to capitalism in Russia was devastating. The ’90s were just a horrible decade. And the reason why everybody loves Putin now is because he refers to the 1990s as this national trauma. And so it was, but the terrible things that happened in Russia, happened very frequently because the people in power did not listen to Jeffrey Sachs’ advice. He’s gotten so sick of people blaming him for the catastrophe of the ’90s in Russia that he wrote an entire essay titled, “What I did in Russia,” explaining that all the things that went wrong, were from people not listening to him. And I think most of what he says in that essay, “What I did in Russia,” is accurate. But the way that he approached development economics, was fundamentally deficient.

He was a big believer in not cheating, national particularities. Jeffrey Sachs would frequently say, “Every finance minister I’ve ever consulted with has said, “No, Mr. Sachs, you don’t understand my country is different.” And then the reasons they give me for why their country is different, or the same as the one I get from every other finance minister, I’m an economist. Don’t give me your nation’s history. Give me the numbers. And that is all I need to know.” And that’s a very Harvard and boomerish and social scientific way of approaching questions. I’m married to a Russian. And so I think I can say that the Russians are nationally distinctive people. If you go in and try to treat them like your average homo economicus, you will not come up with an adequate solution to their problems. And I think that that was what was missing from Jeffrey Sachs development economics when he went around the world trying to consult. Just an insufficient appreciation for the complexities and the human factor in this place.

Richard Reinsch (32:48):

You’ve written on empires, the British Empire, and its experiences in Africa. And I think I remember reading essays from you on that. When you look at this and think about that learning and Sachs’ career. Did you ever put those together and what see what washed out?

Helen Andrews (33:02):

A lot of people have accused Jeffrey Sachs of being an imperialist. A lot of people on the left, really the same kinds of people who use the word Neoliberal as a consonant slur. Those guys hate Jeffrey Sachs and colonialist is the word that they always throw at him. And he bristles at that insult. He hates the old empires. Me, I think that the left-wingers are accurate, insofar as they have gone and appropriated an analogy between what Jeffrey Sachs says and what the imperialists do, I just don’t think that’s necessarily a problem, I don’t consider Empire to be a flaw the way that they do. And that was something that I really wanted to talk about in the book because it’s one of the most astonishing achievements of the boomers in the last sixty years. Empire is the most common political form in human history. And many of the greatest governments in human history, those under which human flourishing has reached its highest summits, have been empires, it’s very difficult to make a historical case, for the idea that Empire is per se, a bad thing, or an evil thing. And yet, today, it has become conventional wisdom. All it took was one generation, saying that Empire is evil, for it to be ruled out for all time as a possible political arrangement. And that’s just really weird. One of the frameworks that I adopted and going through what to talk about in the book was to imagine a time traveler, somebody from 1950, or somebody from 1850, or somebody from 1250, transports to today. What things would they find weird? And the fact that we’ve decided empires per se evil would definitely be on the list of things that a time traveler would find very puzzling.

Richard Reinsch (35:03):

Well, I remember William Easterly, which I’ve read some of his books and Easterly and Sachs are opposites in the sense of Easterly, a classical liberal emphasizes trying to allow the spontaneous order of an economy in a developing country to come to fruition. And that this would be the best way for economic growth to happen and human flourishing, and that counteracts Sachs to a great degree. And you said, well, they’re both wrong, and what they should do, I think, they should actually look to the British Empire. I thought that was interesting. Just in light of this conversation, that’s a bold statement, Helen.

Helen Andrews (35:42):

I don’t know if I would say that they’re both wrong. I would also say that they’re both Right. And there are a lot of debates within the discipline of development economics. And Easterly versus Sachs is a good example. And I read a lot of them in the research for this chapter. And they were all very fruitful. They were all really smart people arguing about important topics. But for me, I think it’s worthwhile to take a step back from those debates, which are very insular within the tiny world of professional academic economists. And just consider big questions like how do we make Africa a better place to live in a slightly longer lens, from the perspective of centuries of history because if you get too much into the minutiae, you lose that sense of perspective. And so many people have gone to that wonderful, infuriating continent, trying to make it a better place to live.And a lot of them have done wonderful things. But in the end, humanity is humanity.

And Jeffrey Sachs goes around saying that we can eradicate extreme poverty not alleviate it, eradicate it. And that history lacks, and claims like that, and so do I. And there is no solution to the problems posed by Africa or the problems posed by any human policy, other than imperfect human judgments, and learning from experience. And so the thing that drives me crazy about the boomers and about Easterly versus Sachs and about development economics is the discipline, is that it cuts itself off deliberately, from a wonderful source of imperfect human experience. And that is the history of the 19th-century empires, not just the British, but the French, the Portuguese, everybody who has gone to the third world and tried to make it better, through the means of Empire. If you’re going to say that Empire is evil, and those people don’t have anything to say to us, you’re cutting yourself off from people who were if you learned a little bit more about them, would remind you of yourself and would have really useful things to say to you. So that’s the point of defending Empire is that it’s a resource, and we should learn from it. And if we start off from the premise that all those people were battling evil racists, we’re never going to learn the lessons that they could teach us.

Richard Reinsch (38:24):

I think you’ve got your next book. No, I’m serious. I would read it. Camille Paglia, you are critical of her. I think overall, you discuss what’s been a very interesting career. She’s somewhat, I remember beginning to read her in college, favored by many conservative thinkers because she… Very aggressive ridiculing at times, feminist writers and thinkers, and certain claims of the gay rights movement she’s been very critical of, but you place her within also a boomer deformation of culture.

The baby boomers rewrote American history to center it on themselves. They said that America was a terrible, horrible racist country where nothing good ever happens until about the 1960s when we showed up. So the only good thing about American history is the baby boomers themselves. I don’t know how they got away with that. That’s just transparently narcissistic and ridiculous to try and pull on the American people, but they succeeded. And now the millennials are, to my great dismay, in agreement with the boomers that the only good thing about American history is what the boomers did.

Helen Andrews (39:02):

I understand why conservatives like her. Not only does she beat up on the feminists, but she also was a valuable warrior in the PC wars of the 1990s. She was right there next to Allan Bloom, saying that the western canon is worth studying. And don’t you dare come in here telling me Emily Dickinson is bad because she was white. Don’t even start with me on that. And so good for Camille in taking that line in the ’90s when it took guts to say things like that. Where she parted ways with Allan Bloom was on the subject of popular culture. She loved Madonna. She loves Hollywood movies. Hollywood is just a running theme in all of her books. And that really, to me, is-

Richard Reinsch (39:51):

And pornography.

Helen Andrews (39:53):

Well, that’s almost a story in itself but if you’re a millennial, those are two very important things in terms of explaining how your life is different from how it would have been if you had lived 50 or 100 years ago. On the one hand, your head is stuffed with all kinds of pop-cultural knowledge. I sometimes wonder if the space in my brain that is currently occupied by knowing the tracklisting and personnel of every Steely Dan album might not have been better deployed knowing things like I don’t know the Emperor or Rome or something, anything more useful. But I cease to marvel at the classical literacy of the Victorian once I realized just how much pop culture minutia was occupying space in my own head. And Camille Paglia is right there at the front saying those two things are equivalent. It is just as worthwhile for someone to have an encyclopedic knowledge of the films of Joan Crawford, as it is for someone to have encyclopedic knowledge of the work of Milton. And I just don’t think that’s true.

Richard Reinsch (41:08):

How would she square that then with the defense of the Western canon? Was she just being irksome to PC activists because that’s a contradiction?

Helen Andrews (41:17):

She wanted to elevate pop culture, to the level of the Western canon she held them both in high esteem. She’s a believer in standards, which is one of the things that I respect her for. When the PC wars where people were saying there’s no such thing as standards, everything is relative. She said, “No, shut up. There are standards, there is a difference between things that are good and works of genius, and things that are bad, and not.” She just happens to think that the films of Ingmar Bergman qualify under the heading of works of genius.

Richard Reinsch (41:47):

Where do you think she falters? Or why? Is it because she dismisses perhaps a classical account of the soul and virtues or something along those lines by which one would begin to evaluate of great thought and writing.

Helen Andrews (42:02):

She wanted to put pop culture, side by side with the Western canon. And she assumed that people would learn both of them. But as a millennial, I am in a position to tell her that that is not the way it has worked out in practice for my generation. Yes, she was very successful in getting my generation to be taught to take pop culture seriously. The problem is that that crowded out the Western canon learning that we should have gotten. And I also think it’s important to consider the vast impact of pop culture, not just in education. The boomers were the first generation to grow up surrounded by television. And I think that television has had all of the terrible brain-deadening effects that the doomsayers in the 1950s predicted that it would. One of the greatest anecdotes about Camille Paglia that I mentioned in that chapter is that she had a very famous debate with Neil Postman, the author of Amusing Ourselves to Death, in which he really took aim at pop culture and media, the way that the media landscape was deadening and warping the human mind making us all perpetual adolescence. And in this great debate with Neil Postman, Camille took the side in defense of visual media she said, “TV is great. I wrote my great magnum opus with my TV running in the background.” And that actual debate that she had was inconclusive. But a decade later an anniversary edition of Amusing Ourselves to Death was put out by Penguin Random House, and Camille Paglia blurbed it and she says in her blurb, “I used to think that Postman was just a doomsayer. But now I have come to the conclusion that he was absolutely right.”

Richard Reinsch (44:04):

Wow. Yeah, I remember reading it.

Helen Andrews (44:08):

And I think some of that might be the result of teaching college students to be. Camille Paglia is a working professor. She teaches at a college in Philadelphia. And I think she has seen in her own students, just how ignorant they are of the Western canon. So maybe that’s where that disillusionment came.

Richard Reinsch (44:26):

No, that’s something I hear from professors all the time, every year the students get worse. And this is at universities we think of as elite. And every year, their thinking and writing skills deteriorate. And also the fact of what they know gets less and less relevant. Thinking about and then the conclusion of your book what do we need to unlearn? As I finished your book, it was like, “Wow, if Helen’s right then we really got a lot to do here.” In terms of thinking about the legacy of the boomers, one of the things I took from your book is Millennials are further deepening these holes that have been dug for them by the baby boomers.

Helen Andrews (45:16):

That’s absolutely right. The baby boomers rewrote American history to center it on themselves. They said that America was a terrible, horrible racist country where nothing good ever happens until about the 1960s when we showed up. So the only good thing about American history is the baby boomers themselves. I don’t know how they got away with that. That’s just transparently narcissistic and ridiculous to try and pull on the American people, but they succeeded. And now the millennials are, to my great dismay, in agreement with the boomers that the only good thing about American history is what the boomers did.

And so the millennials are keen to adopt all of the boomers favorite political causes and reenact their methods, have their own 1968 student rebellions in the streets. I think that’s what’s going on with Antifa, I think that’s what we saw over the summer. So in order for things to get better, we first have to break free of the boomers set of values and their way of looking at the world and their version of our story of ourselves. It’s understandable that the boomer version has been able to dominate America for so long because so much of the boomers and why they are the way they are is explainable by their demographic tests, there are just so many of them, and they have outnumbered the rest of us for so long. And that’s why they managed to get away with so much. But as their numbers dwindle, I hope that we are able to take advantage of the boomers weakening demographic positions in order to get some alternative storylines going around there, which the millennials, sadly has so far not shown any interest in doing.

Richard Reinsch (47:04):

Something you note, which I agree with that I have thought about when thinking about the protests this summer. When I hear stories, anecdotally, from boomers of protests that they were involved in, I’ve also talked to people who were counter-protesters in the 1960s. And the awareness that basically America was not out on the side of the protesters, and we forget when we think about the Kent State tragedy, Americans weren’t exactly sympathetic to what they were doing there that day but this has really changed. And you note this and it’s a society where the guardrails have fallen off. And there’s this insistence on, “Well, let’s further deplete what good resources we have.” And as you think about what’s one thing that’s been working well in America the past few decades, and it’s been control of crime, particular in our larger cities, and that’s now at least temporarily, perhaps, fallen off from these latest rounds of protests, which do seem to regurgitate or revive or rhyme with a lot of theories from the 1960s.

Helen Andrews (48:07):

I think the moment that I realized things were going to be different this time around, was when NASCAR went woke, and the NFL went woke, I thought, “Gosh, if even bastions of reactionary culture are falling in line behind the latest woke BLM line, then things must be a lot worse than I thought whatever silent majority I thought was out there, it clearly is not anymore. And we saw that in polling results over the summer, when even after these riots had led to death, and millions of dollars in property damage, you still saw a large majority saying, “Yes, I support Black Lives Matter and their current protests.” So the silent majority is gone. It is absolutely gone. And that means that there’s not going to be a correction of the kind that we saw in the 1970s where America acted out and got its protest on. But then in came Richard Nixon and we have a return to normalcy, round two. And that’s not going to happen this time. So I think the widening gyre is just going to keep on a widening, and I’m very apprehensive. I wish I had a better, more optimistic answer for you, Richard I’m really wishing I had some hope to extend. But I just don’t think I do.

Richard Reinsch (49:27):

I tried to write a piece. It’s in National Affairs right now. I played around with Montesquieu and faction and how there is still a group of Americans who they think they’re moderating our politics and they’re willing to change sides if they think some things are getting out of control. You did see in the 2020 election, this is one of the more interesting things of the 2020 election amongst a very interesting election overall was the willingness of certain minority groups to be open and actually crossover and vote in the Republican party and I think a huge part of that were the protests. And so the silent majority maybe is more silent but is open to appeals along these lines because of these tendencies. So maybe there’s something there.

Helen Andrews (50:13):

I don’t know, people said that Biden winning the nomination was evidence for a silent majority within the Democratic Party. And I can see why people think that because Joe Biden, he’s not even a boomer. He’s a pre-boomer and he says things like “malarkey,” and he’s very old-fashioned. So he’s not a crazy, woke, insane person. And yet, when you see how he behaves, he is perfectly willing to recite whatever woke platitudes his handlers give him. Kamala Harris is number two on the ticket she’s going to be taking over soon and she’s way out in left field on all of this stuff, that people staffing his administration are fully paid up believers in the most extreme version of millennial wokeness. So putting a sensible middle-of-the-road guy at the top of the ticket doesn’t seem to actually help anything. So that makes me maybe even more pessimistic than I was before rather than convincing me of the existence of a silent majority.

Richard Reinsch (51:15):

Okay. Well, Helen on that we can end. The book is Boomers, The Men and Women Who Promised Freedom and Delivered Disaster. We’ve been talking with the author, Helen Andrews, thank you so much for your time. It’s been great.

7,Andrews,Helen,theamericanconservative,"“Shit shit shit … Can you not tweet the toolkit … Our names are on it.” That was the message that Delhi police say 21-year-old Bangalore-based activist Disha Ravi texted to Greta Thunberg on February 2, begging her to take down a tweet she had posted with a link to a Google Docs file. Thunberg quickly took down the tweet and later posted a link to an “updated” document with incriminating details removed.

If there is a secret document that Greta Thunberg doesn’t want people to read, then naturally one is curious about its contents. The so-called “toolkit” may strike American readers as mundane, but that’s only because we have grown accustomed to the astroturf methods of international NGOs. The Indians are taking it very seriously as an intrusion on their sovereignty.

The “toolkit” describes methods for capitalizing on the farmers’ protests that have wracked New Delhi since November, after Narendra Modi’s government passed a package of laws liberalizing agriculture markets. The farm reforms themselves are unobjectionable, a long overdue counterpart to the 1991 reforms that ended the “Permit Raj” in other sectors. But some farmers in Punjab and Haryana fear that deregulation will reduce prices for their crops. Tens of thousands of them have camped out near the capital.

The linked document included sample tweets, suggestions for in-person rallies, and a timeline for an escalating protest campaign climaxing on January 26. Unfortunately, the January 26 protest in New Delhi proved a little too climactic. Roads were swarmed, cell towers were destroyed, and one farmer was killed when, ramming a police barricade, he capsized his tractor. Farmers rushed police lines on horseback with swords, according to the Wall Street Journal.Hundreds of policemen were injured and many hospitalized. The Red Fort, a Delhi landmark, was stormed and the Sikh flag raised on its flagpole, raising worries about connections between protesters and Sikh separatism.

Statements of support for the farmers came from the usual suspects, like Reps. Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, as well as some unexpected ones. Rihanna tweeted “Why aren’t we talking about this?! #FarmersProtest” with a link to a CNN article. Trevor Noah did a flattering segment on The Daily Show. Meena Harris, the niece of the vice president, has been highly active on Twitter in support of the farmers, drawing parallels between the Modi government’s response and the U.S. Capitol incursion and decrying “militant nationalism” and “FASCIST DICTATORS.”

This all looked a bit too choreographed to the Modi government, but they didn’t have a smoking gun until Greta Thunberg tweeted her toolkit. One government spokesman went on TV saying, “This is the box of conspiracy,” as he held up a printout of the toolkit. “These are very concerted efforts, it is not that someone is impromptu making some comments,” said another spokesman. “Especially someone like Rihanna would never know, I don’t think she can even point out on the global map where India is.”

This is the angle that has most outraged the Indian public: the interference of foreign groups. “India’s sovereignty cannot be compromised,” tweeted cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar. “External forces can be spectators but not participants. Indians know India and should decide for India.” Digital records showed that the same activists who collaborated on the toolkit, including Disha Ravi, also participated in a Zoom meeting with representatives of Extinction Rebellion and the Canada-based Poetic Justice Foundation, which, according to its website, “challenges structures of oppression and discrimination through intersectional grassroots advocacy.”

For some Western critics, it isn’t even about the protests at all. It’s about undermining Modi. Journalist Pieter Friedrich, listed in the toolkit as a resource person, is the author of Saffron Fascists: India’s Hindu Nationalist Rulers and a perennial critic of the BJP. Time magazine on February 15 published a breathless article connecting Modi with Donald Trump—“Hindu supremacism found a natural ally in white supremacism”—and suggesting both leaders pose a threat to democratic institutions.

Support within India for Modi remains high. One poll showed 80 percent of Indians support his handling of the protests. A November election in the rural state of Bihar saw the BJP increase its majority, suggesting that many farmers continue to support the ruling party. Indignation is mostly coming from outside the country.

The Time article is right about one thing: Donald Trump’s departure has given some people in the international NGO-sphere the idea that it’s open season on regimes they dislike, including Modi’s. From Vladimir Putin to the considerably less dictatorial Viktor Orbán, foreign leaders who dissent from the Davos line can expect the next four years to be rougher than the previous four, now that the White House is friendlier to would-be liberal meddlers.

Some have detected postcolonial hypersensitivity in India’s reaction, or overreaction, to the Thunberg tweet, which has extended to having Disha Ravi arrested for her involvement with the Google Doc. “What is the toolkit about?” one green activist asked. “It is nothing but a template, just like a booklet, that is being used to disseminate more information on the farmer protests.”

It’s true that India is exceptionally suspicious of any hint of imperialism, especially the creeping kind. India didn’t lose its sovereignty to the East India Company all at once but piece by piece. The British showed up in India to trade, and within a short time, without either side quite planning it, they were running the country.

Considering how sophisticated the methods of international NGOs have become, maybe the rest of us should be more like the Indians. So-called “intersectional grassroots advocacy” is often just a cover for highly organized media manipulation. When activism becomes so routinized that it becomes a “toolkit” that powerful left-wing groups can pop open at any time and use to undermine legitimately elected leaders anywhere around the world, then that activism has ceased to be, in any meaningful sense, democratic. Those who see it as a threat to popular sovereignty are right.",1,https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-toolkit-greta-thunberg-tried-to-hide/
8,Andrews,Helen,claremontreviewofbooks,"Five people died in the chaos on Capitol Hill on January 6. An unarmed 14-year veteran of the Air Force, Ashli Babbitt, was shot point-blank by a Capitol Police officer. Four others, one of them another Capitol Police officer, apparently died of medical emergencies. All of these deaths were tragic and unnecessary. At least one of them, and possibly two, may have been the result of criminal acts—though early reports of Officer Brian Sicknick being beaten with a fire extinguisher are now being, as they say, “walked back.” His family says he died of a preexisting medical condition and have asked the media to stop politicizing his death. Further complicating the official narrative, Officer Sicknick was an avid supporter of Donald Trump.

If it turns out that Officer Sicknick was attacked by a protester, the legal system will—as it should—avenge his death. But the shooting of Babbitt will be investigated and almost certainly found “justified” or, at most, regrettable but no one’s fault except her own. That might even be the correct outcome, and we pray, whatever the verdict, it will be the result of a fair or judicious legal process. Recent experience, however, more than suggests that those perceived as supporting present ruling arrangements are, and will be, treated much more gently than those seen as opposing them.

A full understanding of what happened that Wednesday would begin with the ruling class’s decades-long betrayal and despoliation of what would eventually come to be called Red or Deplorable or Flyover America. But the more proximate cause was the 2020 election—easily the highest intensity such contest of my lifetime. Each side felt that the stakes were existential. The accuracy of those feelings doesn’t matter; their existence was enough to drive events.

As an incumbent seeking a second term, President Trump-even after the COVID lockdowns had tanked America’s previously supercharged economy-seemed to have a lot of things going for him: near-unanimous support from the base, high primary turnout even though he faced no opposition, a seemingly unified party, approval ratings not far from Barack Obama’s in 2012. According to Gallup, in September 2020 56% of Americans reported doing better than they had four years prior—a level that, in ordinary times, would all but guarantee an incumbent’s re-election.

But these were not ordinary times. It was also easy to see—and many friends and supporters of the president did see, and warned about—shoals ahead. The Democrats used the pandemic as an excuse to accelerate and intensify their decades-long effort to loosen and change American election practices in ways that favor their party. In the spring, they began openly talking about staging a coup: literally using the military to yank Trump from power. It’s one thing to hold a “war game” and plot in secret about a president’s ouster, but why leak the result? Only if you want the public prepared for what otherwise would look like outrageous interference in “our democracy.” Democrats and their media allies also, and for the same reason, assiduously pushed the so-called “Red Mirage” narrative: the story that, while you are likely to see Trump way ahead on election night, he will certainly lose as all the votes are counted. This was less a prediction than preemptive explanation: what you see might look funny, but let us assure you in advance that it’s all on the up-and-up.

In response (or lack thereof) to the other side’s assiduous preparations, the president, his staff, his campaign, and his party committed four serious errors of omission. First, they made hardly any attempt to work with Republican state officials—governors, legislatures, and secretaries of state—to oppose and amend rule changes that would disadvantage them and favor their opponents. As far back as the 2016 election, Trump had complained that Hillary Clinton’s popular vote total had been padded by several million votes by illegal immigrants. Yet he and the GOP did very little to tighten state election procedures. Second, after having failed adequately to oppose those changes, they mounted far too few legal challenges to get them overturned or modified. Third, having declined to challenge the changes, they barely even tried to ramp up their own mail-in voting operation to rival the Democrats’. Fourth, despite numerous loud predictions—both as boasts and warnings—that the election outcome would be unclear and disputed in several states, no team was assembled in advance to investigate and, if necessary, litigate the results. Florida 2000 came as a surprise to candidates Al Gore and George W. Bush. Nonetheless the Bush campaign was able to field almost immediately an army of lawyers, including experts on election law, headed by a former secretary of state, the wily James Baker. The Trump team had at least six months’ warning and, as far as I can see, did nothing to prepare.

Reasons to Doubt

Then came the election itself. Unsurprisingly, the “Red Mirage” did appear. But was it a mirage? There are reasons to doubt. (Perhaps the single-best summary of the irregularities is “Memorandum: How the 2020 Election Could Have Been Stolen,” by Claes Ryn, a professor of politics at the Catholic University of America, published online at the American Conservative.)

Vote counting seemed to be inexplicably halted in five states (Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin)—or, more precisely, in Democratic Party-controlled big cities in those states—late on election night as Trump was piling up seemingly insurmountable leads. There are numerous eyewitness reports of election officials in the affected precincts telling the Republican observers to go home, because no more counting would be done that night, only to resume counting as soon as said observers were out of sight. Then suddenly, when the count was made public again, Biden was ahead in all five states.

Officials “found” huge tranches of ballots that overwhelmingly—and in some cases exclusively—favored Biden. Sometimes the dead “voted,” along with other ineligible people (e.g., felons and people who had moved to other states). Meanwhile, registered voters showed up to vote in person only to be told that they had already voted absentee despite having never requested an absentee ballot. There are sworn affidavits alleging the back-dating of ballots; there are mail-in and absentee ballots which appeared without creases (so how did they get into their envelopes?); as well as thousands upon thousands of Biden ballots without a single choice marked for any down-ballot candidate.

Then there are the statistical anomalies. For instance, political scientist Patrick Basham reports in the Spectator that “[i]n Georgia, Biden overtook Trump with 89 percent of the votes counted. For the next 53 batches of votes counted, Biden led Trump by the same exact 50.05 to 49.95 percent margin in every single batch.” What are the chances of that? And that’s only one example.

Beyond the statistical, there are historical anomalies. Since the 19th century, not a single incumbent president who gained votes in his second run has lost. To the contrary, winners often shed votes. Barack Obama’s total, for instance, dropped by 3.5 million. President Trump’s rose by more than 11 million. Certain states and counties have long served as “bellwethers”: win them, and you win it all. President Trump won all the bellwether states and 18 of 19 bellwether counties. Successful incumbents tend to have “coattails”: they carry down-ballot officials from their party over the finish line. The Republicans gained 11 House seats, did not lose the Senate (at least not on election day) in a year when more than two thirds of defending incumbents were Republican, and cleaned up at the state level. Finally, primary voting has long been a leading indicator of the November outcome: dominate the primaries, win the general. No incumbent who received 75% or more of the total primary vote has ever lost re-election; President Trump got 94%.

No precedent lasts forever, and perhaps one or more of these really were broken in 2020. But all of them?

A Leadership Vacuum

All of this, and more, led the president to believe that he had been cheated. Yet despite the gravity of that belief, he did not organize a serious effort on his own behalf—not, as noted, before election day despite ample warning, nor even on the morning after when so many of the predicted irregularities proved true. For a while the president was even silent, and at other times inconsistent. There was no leadership, no rallying point: not for the staff, the campaign, or the party.

From here he drifted into errors of commission. The leadership vacuum encouraged freelancing by outsiders, of whom it was never clear if they were, or were not, speaking for the president, the White House, or the party. Many were credible people with admirable records, but little (if any) experience litigating disputed elections, much less presidential elections in several states at once. Several of them undermined their reputations, if not their prior accomplishments, through the advancement of extraordinary claims. The president seemed at times to egg them on, at other times to ignore them, and at still others to repudiate them. But extraordinary claims demand extraordinary evidence, of which none was provided. This had two predictable, unhelpful, and contrary effects: raising expectations among his base, while persuading anyone hitherto uncertain that any and all allegations of fraud were “baseless” conspiracy theory hogwash.

Which, let’s be clear, they are not—not all of them, at any rate. That’s not to say that any have been proved. They’ve barely been investigated, whether at the federal or state level, in the courts, or by the media. For it’s quite clear that most of the people who really run America don’t want to know what really happened. More to the point, they don’t want you to know. Republican officials fear the uncovering of something that should have obligated them to act. The Democrats are happy with the outcome and either don’t want to look a gift horse in the mouth, or have simply redefined “democracy” to mean achieving the correct outcome, no matter how. And so for all their bleating about “our democracy,” these dedicated ideologues have come to believe the incorrect outcome is ipso facto “anti-democratic.”

Not that uncovering any real facts would have mattered much. Big Tech and the media have made clear that the matter is closed, the science (as they say) “settled,” and will brook no questions. Irregularities that our own State Department considers sufficient proof to declare third-world elections fraudulent are, here at home, not even enough to quality as “evidence.” The standard of proof for Republicans is set so high as to be (deliberately) unmeetable.

All this is to say, the battle to demonstrate fraud in such a way as to force a reversal of the outcome was uphill at best—the system wasn’t going to allow a change to a result it liked—and not helped by the wilder claims made on Trump’s behalf. As a result, no one really knows for sure how much and what kind of fraud was committed, whether it was of sufficient magnitude to change the election result, and, thus, who truly won.

But the worst error of all was to raise expectations well beyond any ability to deliver. To be blunt, millions of the president’s supporters became convinced that the outcome of the election would be reversed and that he would serve a second term. Not merely that this was the right or correct or just outcome, but that it really would happen. The rally on January 6 may have been the spark that set off the run to the Capitol, but the kindling had been accumulating for weeks.

As for the event itself, it may be true, as many participants have said, that at least the first groups to get inside genuinely believed they were not trespassing but simply entering a public building with the knowledge and blessing of those entrusted with its care. One protester who’s already been arrested by the FBI reports having had a door to the Capitol held open for him by a Capitol Police officer. What was he supposed to think? There is video (perhaps by now censored and banned) of Capitol Police standing by while protesters stream in. Perhaps the officers were under orders not to escalate the situation; perhaps they just didn’t know what to do; perhaps some of them even sympathized. The real reason for their passivity is not yet known and likely never will be.

But as in any large crowd—especially one fueled by unrealistic hopes—a few showed up looking for trouble. The sequence of events is unclear still, but the mob spirit eventually took over.

Once inside, the majority of protestors did not burn, smash (apart from, as far as I know, a few windows), loot, or steal. In the aftermath, the unsympathetic New York Times published an account of the damage to the building and found little. Instead, they mostly…wandered around. A few hammed it up for the cameras. In the words of an equally unsympathetic eyewitness account published in the Nation, “the mood was less coup and more college football tailgate.” The only expression of seriousness of which I am aware is a participant recording and posting online his reasons for being there, in moderate and sensible tones. He has since been doxxed and fired, will likely be prosecuted, and have his life ruined. As will, no doubt, many others.

The most striking and least surprising thing about the whole episode is the way it is being treated by official Washington and the larger ruling class. The very same pundits, politicians, professors, and CEOs who, all through spring and summer 2020 had denied, excused, and extolled the mass sacking of some 200 American cities, which cost some $2 billion in damage and three dozen lives, leapt to condemn all the MAGA marchers—the “mostly peaceful” majority as vociferously as the rioting few. Solons who could muster no outrage, or even concern, about the summer’s destruction—Kamala Harris even had lauded the riots and said they should continue—thundered from on high about the “Stop the Steal” march. The new president himself said that the response would have been much harsher had the Capitol been stormed by BLM—apparently forgetting last spring’s numerous scenes of cops literally kneeling before mobs, and authorities’ literal abandonment of police precincts and even whole neighborhoods.

How many campus buildings were taken over and besieged in the ’60s and ’70s (and since) by protesters lionized in every organ of our establishment culture? Also, when left-wing protestors took over the Wisconsin state capitol in 2011, no less than Nancy Pelosi lauded the four-month siege as an “impressive show of democracy in action.” Of course, any pro-Trump protesters who thought that, because the Left is praised for occupying buildings, they would be too (or at least excused) were foolish. But that doesn’t make the hypocrisy any less brazen.

Few law enforcement agencies could find anyone to charge for participating in 2020’s midyear mayhem—in part because most didn’t look. That emphatically includes the United States Department of Justice, which immediately leapt to action against the Capitol protesters, charging 13 within two days. More are sure to follow.

Capping this display of world-historical hypocrisy were the nauseating crocodile tears shed over the alleged disrespect to the sanctity of the Electoral College—an institution the Left has been gunning to discard since the 1970s, and howled against as recently as 2016. And would be howling against now had it delivered the election to Trump. And which they are still (just slightly more quietly for the moment) seeking to scrap, since a national popular vote guarantees a Democratic win in every presidential election henceforth.

Enemies of the State

Some are trying to find a silver lining in all this—“white pills,” as the kids say. Among those advanced are, first, that the event shows that the revolutionary spirit which gave birth to this nation is not entirely dead and may in fact be stirring toward more outward expressions of discontent. Others see our titular rulers’ hysterical overreaction to “mostly peaceful protesters” as a sign that the rapidly consolidating woke hegemony may not be nearly as strong as it appears to be.

However these may be, the event will be treated—is already being treated—as an excuse for the mass curtailment of civil liberties. Private firms acted swiftly, de-platforming not just the president but thousands of his followers. More will follow. The government is gearing up to get into the act, with new legislation proposed by Senator Dick Durbin, and seemingly endorsed by President Biden in his Inaugural Address, that criminalizes speech by linking regime opposition to “white supremacy” and “terror.” Yes, it’s true that everything they’re doing now and will do they were probably going to do anyway. But the speed and intensity with which they are now doing it are entirely the result of January 6. This crisis will not be allowed to go to waste!

The single biggest loser of January 6 was Donald Trump himself. His entire presidency will now be forced and filtered through this one deliberately distorted lens. All the good he did will be demonized, denied, and then forgotten. But collectively, the biggest losers are his supporters. Trump’s sensible program—secure borders, fair trade, a modest foreign policy—will be branded (to the extent that it hasn’t been already) indistinguishable from fascism. And then abandoned—to their detriment.

The vast majority of those who went to the Capitol did so without a plan, but they did have a goal: to be heard. Which was also the reason they voted for Donald Trump in the first place: they had not been heard in at least 30 years. But the actions of a few not only ensured that they would not be heard, but that instead they would get an earful of the same stuff most of them have been hearing their entire lives, only this time much louder: that everyone in the heartland, at least half the South, and anyone who voted for Trump is deplorable and irredeemable; that America itself is systemically racist; that most or all police are stormtroopers; that equal treatment under law is unjust; and that there are, fundamentally, two classes of people in the United States: the genetically deserving and the genetically guilty.

And now, in addition to all that, calls from the wise and good to investigate and “hold accountable” and cleanse from industry and employment people who did not storm the Capitol but who simply supported a politician and his agenda, as if this were somehow criminal. The Washington Post’s Eugene Robinson has proposed an effort to “deprogram” Trump voters. Prominent members of the Democratic Party such as former Labor Secretary Robert Reich have called for a “truth and reconciliation commission” like the kind that has followed the fall of shameful autocratic regimes. (And that, not coincidentally, uncovered little truth and produced even less reconciliation.) The Berggruen Institute’s Nils Gilman—a man who, perhaps not incidentally, recently called for my death—is having none of that. “These people need to be extirpated from politics,” he recently tweeted.

In Gilman and company’s eyes, Trump’s voters have no moral, political, or intellectual standing and no legitimate interests—only obligations arising from their inborn moral culpability. There is no reason at all to address their concerns or listen to them. Indeed, it’s dangerous even to let them speak lest they lead others into error. Worst of all is to allow them to organize around what they perceive as their interests, which inevitably leads them to express and perpetuate racism and other sins.

So that’s what Trump supporters hear; what do they see? Double standards and hypocrisy everywhere. Mike Flynn’s life ruined over a non-crime while the man who ruined it, James Comey, laughs about his handiwork on an Upper East Side stage. Four years of constant lies about Russian collusion and no reckoning, either for those who broke the law to get it going, or those who used their megaphone to keep it going. Changes to the voting system designed to help one party and marginalize theirs. A country flooded with immigration for more than half a century, padding the votes of the other party, driving down wages, and enriching oligarchs. A trade regime seemingly designed to ship their jobs overseas, close their factories, and empty out their towns. A media and intellectual class that no longer makes any pretense of fairness or objectivity but openly operates as the propaganda arm of the regime—to the extent it is not itself the regime. And now, an increasing tendency to demonize all dissent as terrorism and lock out of the political system—permanently—at least 47% of the population.

What we now have, more and more, is a one-party oligarchy. This was the nemesis of the Trump presidency. Like all oligarchies, ours rules by coercion, not consent. It exerts its power primarily by constraining allowable, expressible opinion: it knows that the thing which cannot be said eventually becomes that which cannot be thought. And the chief thoughts it wishes to suppress are objections to its own misrule. When and where it cannot “persuade”—that is, propagandize—it punishes, with the defiant fired from their jobs, made unemployable, cut off from the financial system, even, in some cases, shunned by friends and family. This is not “death,” exactly. But how much less cruel is it, really, to cut people off from human contact and the means of making a living? And how much real misery—and desperation—does it produce?

Against recalcitrant groups, organizations, even whole states, our ruling class uses its control of communications to wage demonization campaigns akin to two-minute hates, except lasting much longer. Witness, for example, corporate America’s united boycott of North Carolina over “transgender” bathrooms and the now-routine practice of Blue states issuing travel and other bans on their agencies or employees doing any business with Red states that don’t entirely toe the latest Blue line.

The Course of Human Events

Christopher Caldwell recently observed in the New Republic that

[i]n the 1860s, three major Western countries—Germany, Italy, and the United States—each fought similar wars of national unification, in which the more dynamic part of the country subjugated the more bucolic (or backward) part. In our time, Democrats are the party of relatively greater technological and demographic dynamism, Republicans the party of relatively less.

Subjugation, certainly, is the aim—with the events of January 6 to be used to justify whatever means are necessary. I wonder, though, whether the effort can turn out as successfully as the examples Caldwell cites. Does the Blue coalition really have the chops—that is, not merely the will but also the wherewithal—to cow and dominate at least 75 million independent-minded, self-sufficient, and (in many cases) ornery Americans?

The ruling class has backed Middle America into a corner. Keeping them there will require a level of cleverness and competence that, to say the least, our would-be masters have yet to demonstrate they possess. If they can manage, it will likely be because of new tools—above all Big Tech—no prior ruling class even dreamed of. Since we’re in uncharted waters here, the possibility cannot be ruled out. But even if technology does turn out to enable present arrangements to trundle on for a while, how long might that be? Five years? Ten? Twenty?

At any rate, there are reasons to believe that a resurgence of American spiritedness is possible—foremost among them the second-highest vote total in history, for a presidential candidate whom the entire socio-intellectual-media complex ordered the people to reject with prejudice. But there are also reasons—e.g., the opioid crisis—to fear widespread resignation and apathy. The longer present conditions can be made to continue, the more reasonable it is to assume that the latter will spread. Should half of America surrender to defeatism and its consolations—booze, drugs, porn, junk food, video games, streaming services, and sportsball—we shall test Blue America’s very high opinion of itself. For at that point we will find out whether the coasts are capable not merely of surviving without the heartland, but of rising to even greater heights without all that dead weight.",1,https://claremontreviewofbooks.com/the-continuing-crisis/
9,Andrews,Helen,claremontreviewofbooks,"As the coronavirus pandemic rages on, institutions of higher education in the United States face an existential threat. Even if they can survive their current budget crisis, what kind of institutions will American universities and colleges be in a decade’s time?

One crucial front in the war over the university pits defenders of the free-ranging pursuit of truth against those who would put political limits on such inquiries. For most of higher education’s history, this dispute was between advocates of academic freedom inside the universities and skeptics of it who were outside. On behalf of conventional mores or the community’s political and economic interests, politicians, or donors, took the position that the pursuit of knowledge is all well and good…until it threatens vital orthodoxies. The example of Socrates has always been both an inspiration and a warning. Heterodox gadflies tend to get swatted.

In the 21st century, however, academic freedom’s most determined adversaries are inside rather than outside academia. A growing army on college campuses would like to restrict the scope of intellectual debate by subjecting academic inquiry to political litmus tests. Over the 20th century, American universities’ students and faculty pushed to make them havens for heretics, dissenters, iconoclasts, and nonconformists. In the wake of their success, many scholars now demand that campuses adhere to their own orthodoxies. Until recently I would have said that many students and faculty want the range of intellectual debate on a college campus to be narrower than the offerings in the New York Times’s op-ed pages. But now, of course, the college graduates hired by the Times are scrubbing its op-ed pages of heresies as well.

***

We have seen the practice of stifling debate and purging dissenters on college campuses, but not the theory. Proponents of an intellectually restricted campus have been more interested in imposing than justifying those restrictions. What Snowflakes Get Right by Ulrich Baer, comparative literature professor at New York University, tries to fill that gap. Baer is not a terribly reliable guide to First Amendment doctrine or American constitutional history, but he calls, explicitly and forcefully, for sharply curtailing the scope of speech and debate on American college campuses.

Baer attracted some notoriety when he published an op-ed in the Times in spring 2017 while serving as NYU’s vice provost. Transferring the article’s clever title to his new book, he emphasizes that the First Amendment is not absolute: before its relatively recent, assertively liberal reading, “free speech” was understood in ways that allowed a great deal of speech to be censored by government officials. In other words, there’s nothing sacred about the current academic regime.

Leaning in part on the work of Yale legal scholar Robert Post, Baer emphasizes that the logic of free speech fits uneasily alongside the core mission of the university. If the university’s central purpose is to advance toward truth via research and teaching, then free speech has always been circumscribed. Universities—quite properly—suppress speech precisely in order to facilitate the academic project. We expect students in the classroom not to be disruptive and derail the lesson. We expect instructors to stick to their knitting, and neither hijack their classes to pontificate on irrelevant issues nor become purveyors of snake oil to unsuspecting minors. We refuse to accept dissertations or monographs that do not reflect professionally competent discourse. In short, we routinely exclude lots of bad speech from the halls of academia.

***

Free speech, post would observe, arises from a democratic ethos. The different, narrower concept of academic freedom arises from the professional ethos of modern higher education. Free speech assumes everyone has an opinion and should be allowed to voice it, no matter how silly or repugnant the rest of us think it might be. In its radical egalitarianism, free speech makes no distinctions between the well-informed and the woefully ignorant. But academic freedom, neither egalitarian nor democratic, protects some speech while dismissing other speech as unworthy. Scholars properly claim the right to engage in professionally competent critical inquiry without having to worry that the university president or board of trustees will disapprove, and we give them that right because we think that such protections are the best means we have for advancing and disseminating human knowledge.

But if that is what universities are all about, then we have little or no interest in protecting members of the university community from the consequences of voicing half-baked political opinions, since such protection has no obvious role in fostering truth through scholarly inquiry. Indeed, it could be counterproductive to the academic mission if universities implied that charlatans and serious scholars were equally welcome. University values might best be advanced by expelling charlatans from the campus rather than allowing them to pollute the information environment and debase the university’s reputation for expertise and truth-seeking.

Baer draws also on postmodern theory, which permeates the humanities, to make a useful point about the difficulties surrounding the free speech debate. Speech is not, or at least not merely, a means by which we discover and communicate what is true and false. Speech can also be an instrument of power. Contemptuous of pursuing truth through speech, the demagogue, like the postmodernist himself, is concerned with manipulating the thoughts and feelings of his audience so as to advance his own political goals. If speech is an instrument of power, then perhaps it should be taken away from those who would wield it for disreputable purposes.

***

Baer aligns himself with the “snowflakes,” to borrow the popular reference to left-wing campus activists that caught on in 2015 after the world saw videos of Yale students confronting Professor Nicholas Christakis over a controversy about Halloween costumes. What the snowflakes get right, Baer thinks, is that some controversial views not only don’t deserve to be debated but don’t deserve to be expressed, on a college campus or in polite society. The specific views he has in mind are ones covered by proposed hate speech regulations. Unlike some hate speech proponents, he makes clear that he wants to suppress not just offensive or harassing slurs directed at individuals, but also substantive ideas that he deems dangerous. He thinks modern democracies, and by extension university campuses, are committed to a creed—non-negotiable, non-debatable, and unquestionable. Central to that creed is the “principle of equality.” Anyone who disputes this principle threatens the community and should be suppressed and excluded.

As a result of taking this position, Baer finds himself juggling two quite different kinds of claims. On the one hand, he embraces Post’s view that universities should be dedicated to advancing the truth and should reject falsehoods. Since it is an article of faith that “equality” is true, whatever that means exactly, then anyone who questions that article of faith is necessarily spouting falsehoods and no longer belongs on a university campus. On the other hand, Baer embraces an explicitly political vision that is at odds with Post’s ethos of expertise. Those who question the principle of equality advance an ideology that is dangerous, just as the advocacy of Nazism is dangerous. For Baer, the best way to address such ideologies is to silence them. Moreover, those who question the principle of equality question a key commitment of an inclusive university, and thereby undermine that commitment. Whereas Post would emphasize that universities prize expertise and professionalism above all else, Baer would emphasize that the universities’ highest value is inclusivity. When values come into conflict, inclusivity must be given priority. Ultimately, inclusion requires the exclusion of all who challenge inclusivity’s tenets.

Post has expounded at length on the statement made by the American Association of University Professors in 1940 that the “common good depends upon the free search for truth and its free exposition.” In this view, professors should enjoy academic freedom because allowing them to pursue critical inquiry, subject only to professional norms, is in the long-term best interest of a democratic society, even if the arguments of the professors are sometimes discomforting to the demos.

At bottom, Baer rejects that claim. He thinks professors should not be allowed to discomfort the demos, at least not on the commitments he particularly values. But once we make that concession, it is no longer obvious what universities are doing, or what purpose academic freedom serves. Baer’s creedal university will eventually swallow his technocratic university as a widening set of controversial social and political issues are shielded from acceptable critical inquiry.

***

What Snowflakes Get Right elides differences between the various kinds of speech that take place on a modern college campus. If the question is whether neo-Nazi activist Richard Spencer should give an academic talk sponsored by the political science department, then the answer is an easy one. But no one thinks that is the question. The activities on a modern university campus cannot be reduced to the faculty’s scholarly pursuits. Speakers routinely visit campus because a group of students finds the speaker interesting or entertaining, or because administrators think the speaker will add luster or excitement to a drab campus. Advancing the search for truth in adherence to disciplinary standards doesn’t enter into it. (In Spencer’s case, the rationale was simply that the university makes its facilities available for use by members of the general public.) Universities open their doors to a host of non-expert speakers precisely because they have long served as venues for public debate as well as for scholarly discourse. We could dramatically reduce academic free speech controversies if we restricted the speaking activities on campuses to professors reading their scholarly papers to entranced audiences.

In practice, universities encompass both of the values that Post identifies, expertise and democracy. Baer ultimately makes clear that he would sacrifice both for the sake of his vision of equality: “In today’s age, we also have a simple solution that should appease all those concerned that students are insufficiently exposed to controversial views. It is called the internet.” Unfortunately, Baer’s allies, using his arguments, think that controversial views should also be driven off the internet. Worse, Baer’s notion of what counts as a view that is too controversial to be aired on a college campus would likely encompass ideas held by the bulk of the American citizenry and a non-trivial fraction of the professoriate.

***

Would he stop there? When discussing the need to exclude speech that questions principles of equality from campus, he reasonably thinks that not much of intellectual importance would be lost if figures like Spencer or alt-right provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos never again appeared on campus. (He could but does not say the same about many popular campus speakers on the political Left.) Though Baer is less forthright about how deeply his exclusionary approach should cut into the heart of academic freedom and be applied to scholarly research and teaching, many “snowflakes” would certainly be all too eager to expunge professors if they fail to pass the constantly evolving political litmus test of the creedal university. Baer’s proposal leads naturally to the demand in a recent letter signed by hundreds of my Princeton University colleagues, calling for the formation of a committee to investigate and “discipline…racist behaviors, incidents, research, and publication on the part of the faculty.”

Baer is cavalier about what an earlier generation of liberals took as a hard-won victory in expanding the space for dissent in America. He breezily notes that things could be different but gives us little indication of how we got here or why. If only we tweaked First Amendment doctrine a bit, he suggests, we could rid ourselves of white supremacists and leave everything else untouched. There is an all too common suggestion that the American Civil Liberties Union protected the free speech rights of Nazis simply because civil libertarians do not mind Nazis. Like many campus censors, Baer imagines that altering the rules surrounding free speech will inhibit only those who disagree with him, never his allies.

He ignores the costs associated with the kind of campus revolution he outlines, and he provides frustratingly few details about how his reimagined university would look and operate. If given free rein, Ulrich Baer’s version of a university is unlikely to resemble the kind that has made American higher education the envy of the world. American universities have evolved over time, and there is no reason to think that the intellectual openness that has characterized them for the past half-century will characterize them a half-century from now. The buildings might survive, but there is no guarantee that free and open inquiry will.",1,https://claremontreviewofbooks.com/speaking-power-to-truth/

Mrs. Roosevelt had briefly considered running for a Senate seat from New York in 1945 after her husband’s death.

The irony of Eleanor Roosevelt, feminist political icon, is that her career was a 50-year vindication of every misogynist cliché about women in politics. Her politics were sentimental rather than rational. She was impulsive and easily swayed, a busybody who meddled in every issue under the sun without bothering to master anything intellectually. She honestly believed we could end poverty and war by all being a little nicer to each other. Hillary at least has a political temperament. Eleanor, had she not married Franklin Delano Roosevelt, probably never would have gone near politics at all.

***

How did a person so unsuited to the political life become the most admired woman in America and “First Lady of the World,” as Harry Truman dubbed her? David Michaelis, biographer of cartoonist Charles Schulz and illustrator N.C. Wyeth, tells the story without ever quite solving the enigma. In the end, the most we can say is that Eleanor was the opposite of her husband. The lesson of FDR’s life was the power of character to overcome unfavorable circumstances. The lesson of Eleanor’s was the power of circumstances to make a heroine out of the most unpromising character.

The place to start is with her face. The bovine eyes, the vanishing chin, the buck teeth, those jowls. During the fight over women’s suffrage, anti-suffragists claimed that only ugly women were interested in politics, to compensate for their inability to find happiness through normal channels. A cruel and baseless generalization, no doubt, but certainly in Eleanor they had their most glaring data point since the Quaker sisters and abolitionists Angelina and Sarah Grimké.

Perhaps it was a blessing that she was homely, otherwise her ferocious desire to be loved could have sent her down the road of her Aunt Edith “Pussie” Hall, whose romantic disasters were the inspiration for Lily Bart in Edith Wharton’s The House of Mirth. Eleanor was the daughter of an alcoholic, and like many children in that situation she strove to be ever more doting and selfless in the hope that one day her father would love her enough to stop drinking. Alas, Elliott Roosevelt pursued self-destruction with the same fixity and determination that his brother Theodore brought to progressive politics. He died at 34 after leaping from his mistress’s window in a drunken fit. Nine-year-old Eleanor was not permitted to attend the funeral, for fear she would encounter her father’s lowlife gambling associates or her illegitimate half-brother.

***

The passion for self-abnegation that she developed trying to rescue her father eventually led her to her fifth cousin once removed, Franklin, another glib charmer whose emotional default was to take and take without giving back. No historian has ever satisfactorily explained what Franklin saw in Eleanor, but for her part, she had another man to please. Michaelis tells the story of how Eleanor nursed Franklin through a bout of typhoid fever in 1912, carrying his trays and dispensing his medicine, until her mother-in-law came for a visit and noticed that Eleanor herself was radiating heat. The doctor took her temperature and found a fever of 104. She’d had typhoid for two weeks. To be uncomplaining was Eleanor’s greatest joy in life.

Some women not blessed with good looks go in search of an alternative source of charm and find it in cultivating their intellect or in a life of good deeds. That is not quite what Eleanor did. Politics was not her way of trying to get people to like her. She long ago had decided that the only way for a charmless girl like her to be happy was not to care whether people liked her or not. This indifference, combined with her position as the wife of a powerful politician, meant that people were constantly asking for her help with some scheme or another and she was constantly saying yes, without worrying that she might embarrass herself or her husband. That was how Eleanor blundered into a political career of her own, almost by accident.

Consider her first major political project as first lady, the Arthurdale development in West Virginia. Eleanor was moved by the desperate plight of out-of-work miners and, because they lived so close to Washington, it was convenient to throw herself into the effort to help them. She insisted that their housing include modern amenities like indoor plumbing and refrigeration, even though that put the homesteads far beyond what the beneficiaries could afford. She tried to have a furniture factory built in Arthurdale, not realizing that subsidizing new competition in the middle of a depression would not sit well with existing furniture makers. By the end of the decade, no factory had been built, most Arthurdale residents were still on welfare, and the unit cost of their homes had risen to $16,635, up from an original target of $2,000. “My Missus, unlike most women, hasn’t any sense about money at all,” FDR shrugged.

***

Her inability to graduate from sentimentality to principle meant that Eleanor was easily blown hither and yon by the gust of events. When Neville Chamberlain signed the peace deal at Munich, she applauded as a pacifist. When her husband advocated war against Hitler, she applauded as a humanitarian, with no sense of inconsistency. Even on the issue for which she was most famous, the rights of African Americans, her strength as an advocate came not so much from passion as from simple-mindedness. This was helpful when it came to asking why black contralto Marian Anderson couldn’t sing for anyone who wanted to hear her in 1939. But when Brown v. Board of Education was handed down in 1954, her “My Day” column on the ruling was almost insipid:

Southerners always bring up the question of marriage between the races, and I realize that that is the question of real concern to people. But it seems to me a very personal question which must be settled by family environment and by the development of the cultural and social patterns within a country. One can no longer lay down rules as to what individuals will do in any area of their lives in a world that is changing as fast as ours is changing today.

This compulsion to find the good in both sides made Eleanor worse than useless during the Cold War. Her naïveté in the face of Communism was staggering. As far back as the New Deal, her idea of vetting the American Youth Congress was just to ask them. “I told them that since I was actively helping them, I must know exactly where they stood politically…. In every case they said they had no connection with the communists.” (Believe it or not, some of them were lying.) Later, during her “First Lady of the World” phase, she reasoned that the way to win the Cold War was simply to outcompete the Communists for hearts and minds: “[T]here are good things in the Soviet world and we should give them credit for these. Then, on our own initiative, we should develop a program that we believe will be of greater advantage to the newly developing nations of the world.”

***

Considering that she had no knack for it, it is tragic that Eleanor should have sacrificed every other sphere of life to politics, but she did. She was a notoriously bad dresser, bad hostess, bad housekeeper. The White House kitchen served hot dogs and peanut butter sandwiches while she was First Lady, to Franklin’s chronic dismay. Nor did she devote much energy to raising their children, leaving that to her mother-in-law and the servants. The American people held this against her when the Roosevelt brood grew up to be feckless and scandal-prone, with 14 divorces among them. If Eleanor had not been off do-gooding, they reasoned, she might have been a better mother.

As the decades rolled on, Eleanor grew further out of touch with the mainstream of liberalism. She did not care for rock and roll (“I have found that stirring up pure emotion with very little reason behind it is never a very good thing for young or old”) and thought John F. Kennedy a step down from Adlai Stevenson. Still, the sheer longevity of her career, and the talismanic power of her surname, made her a pillar of Democratic politics well into the 1960s, particularly in New York State. She did not have to do much; it was enough for her simply to be there. Looking over Michaelis’s sympathetic survey of her long life, one gets the sense that was always the secret of Eleanor’s success. She was not more intelligent, or public-spirited, or kind-hearted than other women of her class. She was simply in the right place at the right time with the right name.",1,https://claremontreviewofbooks.com/do-gooder-in-chief/

The Dictator Who Refused to Die

by tom gallagher

hurst, 360 pages, $34.95

The sinister character ­Salazar Slytherin, of Harry Potter fame, was named after Antonio de Oliveira Salazar, prime minister of Portugal from 1932 to 1968, whom J. K. Rowling had learned to revile during her two years living in Porto in the early nineties. By contrast, the American diplomat Dean Acheson considered Salazar the closest thing the twentieth century had to a philosopher-king. “A libertarian may properly disapprove of Dr. Salazar,” Acheson wrote, “but I doubt whether Plato would.”

Which view is correct? It has been hard for English-speakers to come to an informed conclusion, due to the scarcity of books about the man. Now at last comes a scholarly ­biography of enticing readability from Tom ­Gallagher, professor emeritus of politics at the University of Bradford. ­Gallagher portrays Salazar as a dictator but not a fascist, a Catholic but not a theocrat, a man who possessed all the virtues of a gentleman and almost, but not quite, all those of a statesman.

Salazar was an economics professor who might have lived out many quiet years on the faculty of the University of Coimbra had he not been drafted to run the finance ministry under the military dictatorship that came to power in Portugal in 1926. The budget was then in such a dire state that if Salazar had not been able to set it right, the government would have been forced to go abroad for a loan, which likely would have involved granting a foreign commission control over the national budget. With the country’s sovereignty at stake and economic expertise thin among the generals of the junta, Salazar found himself the indispensable man.

The First Portuguese Republic, which the military coup d’état had overthrown, was an unhappy interlude. In the sixteen years following the abolition of the monarchy in 1910, no fewer than forty-four ministries came and went. The Catholic Church was persecuted, with local politicians banning public processions and the ringing of church bells. Clergy were forbidden to teach in schools and offered government jobs in exchange for renouncing their vows. Streets named after saints and kings were renamed for famous freethinkers. Christmas became the “Day of the Family.” Priests were murdered, convents burned, the Marian chapel at Fátima bombed by terrorists.

Salazar put a stop to the anti-­Catholic harassment. Nevertheless, as Gallagher points out, he did not restore the Church to its former privileges. Civil marriage was preserved, with divorce prohibited only for those who had married in the Church. Religious education was compulsory in schools, but Catholicism was not recognized as the official state religion, nor did the government pay priests’ salaries as it did in Franco’s Spain. The long-serving cardinal patriarch of Lisbon, Manuel Gonçalves Cerejeira, had been a friend of Salazar’s since their college days. This relationship gave the hierarchy a voice in the regime’s counsels, but it also gave Salazar the confidence to part ways with the Church, knowing that his old friend would smooth things over with the faithful.

If Salazar did not run an explicitly Catholic regime, neither did he make a substitute religion of any secular ideology. This, for Gallagher, is proof that Salazar was no fascist. His contemporaries in Germany and Italy wanted to politicize every aspect of life; Salazar wanted the opposite. They shared a disillusionment with parliamentary government—as who would not, after the First Portuguese Republic—but little else. A visitor from Mussolini’s Italy marveled that Salazar made no effort to have the ordinary Portuguese “participate in the life of the state.”

Partly this was a matter of principle for Salazar, who distrusted the passions of crowds. “These good people who cheer me one day, moved by the excitement of the occasion, may rise in rebellion the next day for equally passing reason,” he told a deputy. Partly it was his personality. He abhorred ceremonial occasions, “running to inaugurate things, et cetera,” and preferred to work behind the scenes in solitude. He never married.

It would have been difficult for Salazar to whip up a mass movement even if he had wanted to, considering that, when he came to power, two-thirds of the Portuguese were illiterate. (For comparison, Spain at the time had a male literacy rate above 80 percent.) Portugal was, in many ways, the most primitive country in Europe. The partisan politics that had doomed the First Republic were confined to the urban minority. In rural areas, where most Portuguese still lived, it would have been hard to find someone who could read a newspaper. If fascism is a distinctively modern pathology, Portugal lacked the preconditions for it.

Salazar sought to govern this land of pious peasants by the philosophy of corporatism, a school of thought derived from the teachings of Thomas Aquinas and the social encyclicals of Leo XIII. It holds that rights belong primarily to groups, not individuals, and that society’s classes should strive to be in harmony, not competition or conflict as in capitalism. In practice, this took the political form of an upper house made up of representatives of various community groups, localities, and professions. (There was, for example, a representative of the fine arts and one of fisheries.) The government sponsored official trade unions and employer associations, which met periodically to negotiate salaries, ­prices, and working conditions.

This cooperative system was backed by the coercive power of the International Police for Defense of the State (PIDE), Salazar’s secret police. An estimated twenty thousand civilian informers kept tabs on potential anti-regime activity, from communist bomb plots to unlicensed union organizing. Still, by the standards of the twentieth century, PIDE was not among Europe’s most fearsome secret police. It was not competent enough to be. One American diplomat recalled his consulate once mistakenly receiving a bill from local officials for a “linha de escuta”—a phone tap. “You can’t run a thorough-going fascist state if you are that inefficient,” he reflected.

For improving the quality of life of the ordinary Portuguese, corporatism worked. Per capita income doubled in the decade after 1953. The literacy rate, long Portugal’s shame, rose to 85 percent by 1970. The road between Lisbon and Porto was still a humble, two-lane highway, but Salazar was willing to tolerate a little backwardness. He could have permitted more foreign investment, but he sacrificed a modest amount of economic efficiency in exchange for preserving his country’s independence and the dignity of the workers whose livelihoods would have been wiped out by competition from abroad.

Compare Salazar’s achievement to what his modern heirs have accomplished. When the Carnation Revolution toppled the old regime in 1974, many believed that Portugal would rapidly catch up to the rest of Western Europe. After decades of modernizing rule, Portuguese agriculture and industry still lag behind European standards. Remittances from workers abroad remain a crucial prop to the home economy. The only difference is that now Portugal is billions of dollars in debt to the European Union. The 2010 financial crisis revealed just how much independence Portugal had sacrificed, as well as how prevalent corruption remained, with the friends and relations of politicians drawing generous salaries from state-affiliated banks and utilities.

The strongest criticism of ­Salazar, which even a sympathetic biographer like ­Gallagher endorses, is that he clung for too long to Portugal’s imperial possessions. Salazar was not ashamed of his African empire. Portugal had long prided itself on being the most racially enlightened colonial power, with some justification. Native Portuguese were encouraged not only to settle in Angola and Mozambique but to intermarry with the local population to create a “new Brazil.” Public accommodations were integrated. In Lisbon, the United States promoted Foreign Service officer Clifton Wharton to be Europe’s first black consul general, precisely because the Portuguese were expected to be more welcoming of a black diplomat than other Europeans, as indeed they proved to be.

But the anticolonial rebellions that began in 1961 were too much for the regime to bear. Frustration with the seemingly endless war was a major factor behind the 1974 revolution—especially resentment of the military draft, which put one in four adult males in uniform. Salazar believed the war was winnable because he blamed it on the Soviet Union, which provided the rebels with guns and surface-to-air missiles, and the United States, which provided them with rhetorical support and covert CIA subventions. Without this outside help, the rebellions would have collapsed. Salazar did not want to turn the clock back to the nineteenth century, just to 1959, before his American ally started sponsoring violent uprisings against his country. Considering what has become of the ex-colonies since independence, Salazar’s position should not immediately be dismissed as ­reactionary.

Does the career of Salazar hold any lessons for the United States today? It would be difficult to import his brand of corporatism, since so much of his success depended on Portugal’s size. Like Lee Kuan Yew, Salazar benefited from ruling a country small enough that a single man could stay on top of the details. Portugal’s size also helped him to manage dissent. In a country no bigger than the state of Indiana, the exile of a few well-targeted dissidents could neutralize the threat of violent rebellion for a generation. An American leader would have to resort to mass suppression to achieve the same effect.

Interestingly, Gallagher claims that Western liberal democracies have already adopted their own form of corporatism. After World War II, he observes,

There was a growing tendency among ruling politicians to ensure that issues previously seen as belonging in the political arena were removed and decided “pre-politically” by NGOs, civil servants, and the European Union. Experts drawn from civil society and elsewhere became important players in their own right just as the corporative actors in Portugal had been.

Certainly, American society is more and more managed “pre-politically” by various elites—bureaucrats, tech companies, NGOs. The difference is that our corporative actors answer to no higher authority. The Portuguese had Salazar single-handedly mediating among society’s various interests. They also had a shared idea of the common good and a Catholic moral vocabulary to which competing parties could appeal. Without these external constraints, rule by elites is not corporatism but oligarchy. By presenting a balanced picture of the Salazar regime, Gallagher’s book helps us to understand the difference.

13,Andrews,Helen,newsweek,"The following essay is excerpted from Helen Andrews's new book, Boomers: The Men and Women Who Promised Freedom and Delivered Disaster, with permission of Sentinel, an imprint of Penguin Publishing Group, a division of Penguin Random House LLC. Copyright © Helen Andrews, 2021.

It's always the people who most hate the idea of turning into their parents who end up doing so.

The millennials blame the boomers for wrecking the country, yet rather than break free from their influence, we continue seeing the world in their terms. Our social justice activists devote their lives to the same causes, with only the most minute updates in terminology but an agenda otherwise unchanged. Our rebels wear the same Che Guevara T-shirts, do the same drugs, obsess over the same music. I remember being surprised back in high school that the stoners cutting class behind the gym all had Black Sabbath and Pink Floyd patches on their jackets, and not anything more contemporary.

Worst of all, millennials seem intent on making the boomers' same mistakes. This is a book about the baby boom generation that has so far gone without mentioning the antiwar movement, Chicago 1968, Days of Rage or long hot summers. For some people this is an unthinkable omission, because street protests were what the 1960s were all about.

The reason for de-emphasizing street protests is, first of all, that they did not work. Adam Garfinkle's revisionist history of the antiwar movement, Telltale Hearts, notes that the protests had no effect on decision makers in the Johnson administration and little effect on public opinion, except to give second thoughts to the many Americans skeptical of the war but repulsed by Abbie Hoffman. Civil rights had fewer victories after the ghetto riots started, not more.

One cannot even make a case for the street protests having had some deep cultural impact despite their political ineffectiveness, because for most participants it was nothing but a jolly interlude, after which they retired to the suburbs and a happy bourgeois life. The revolution did not come, and soon even Angela Davis grew up and got tenure.

Yet it is precisely this interlude that millennials are most determined to reenact. In the summer of 2020, when cities from Portland to Raleigh erupted in street violence and mobs looted storefronts, lobbed Molotov cocktails and tore down public monuments, journalists rushed to compare it to 1968, with Joe Biden standing in for Hubert Humphrey and Antifa in the role of the yippies. The question on everyone's mind was whether the unrest would be as bad this time as it was 50 years ago.

The answer is that it would be much worse, at least in its long-term effects, because all of the civilizational cushioning that gave boomers the leeway to act out without permanently destroying the country has been eroded. The only thing worse than a street protest that's all just fun and games is one that isn't.

The 1960s left Americans with an idea of street protest, even violent street protest, as something with minimal risks. You go to a march, have some fun, raise some issues and then the country goes back to normal. Of course, it is easy for us to say in hindsight that the 1960s were bound to turn out fine. At the time, there were serious people who worried that street revolts might lead to an actual revolution.

The Kerner Commission, the federal inquiry into the causes of the urban riots of 1967, is famous for the line in its final report warning of two Americas, ""one black, one white, separate and unequal."" But before that, an earlier draft written by Lou Goldberg, a sociology grad student on the commission's Washington staff, was less sonorous but more chilling:

The beginnings of guerrilla warfare of black youth against white power in the major cities of the United States: that is the direction that the present path is taking this country.... Twenty men, dedicated, committed, willing to risk death, and with intelligence and imagination could paralyze an entire city the size of New York or Chicago.... The history of Algeria or Cyprus could be the future history of America.

Bill Ayers was no Saadi Yacef, so Americans were spared the fate of the pieds noirs. There was no protracted war over urban territory, because middle-class families just moved to the suburbs. As for the boomer troublemakers themselves, they discovered when they aged out of their adolescent rebellion that there were good white-collar jobs waiting for them on the other side, underwritten by a strong economy favoring the college educated. The social stability that marked their 1950s childhoods had not yet been completely destroyed. Revolt never escalated into revolution because everyone had too much to gain from peace, the revolutionaries included.

14,Andrews,Helen,theamericanconservative,"In 2013, the conservative bloc on the Supreme Court was ready to issue a ruling in Fisher v. University of Texas that would have limited the use of race in college admissions, when Justice Sonia Sotomayor persuaded Anthony Kennedy to change his vote. It was not the cogency of her arguments that persuaded him.

Kennedy had been a reliable vote against affirmative action throughout his twenty-five years on the bench, as recently as Grutter v. Bollinger in 2003, when he dissented from Sandra Day O’Connor’s opinion upholding affirmative action as long as race is only one narrowly tailored factor out of many. But sometime between oral argument on October and the announcement of the opinion on June 24, Sotomayor circulated a blistering draft dissent that made Kennedy change his mind.

That draft dissent has never been published, but when the veteran Supreme Court reporter Joan Biskupic started asking around about what had happened with Fisher—which Court watchers noticed was not announced until the last week of the term, months after the other cases argued in October had been decided—she heard from insiders that “I would soon see a version of it.”

Apparently the text of that draft was repurposed for Sotomayor’s dissent in Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action (2014), which upheld a Michigan state constitutional amendment banning racial preferences. Justices don’t always read their dissenting opinions aloud from the bench when decisions are announced, but in Schuette, for the first time, Sotomayor read hers.

Her dissent begins with an introduction comparing the voters of Michigan to the white majority that imposed Jim Crow, a comparison that Justice Antonin Scalia, in his concurring opinion, called “shameful.” It crescendos to a deeply personal explanation of why her colleagues’ hopes for a color-blind solution to racial inequality are “out of touch with reality,” introducing the boomer vocabulary of therapy and trauma into the normally arid language of judicial opinion:

Race matters for reasons that really are only skin deep, that cannot be discussed any other way, and that cannot be wished away. Race matters to a young man’s view of society when he spends his teenage years watching others tense up as he passes, no matter the neighborhood where he grew up. Race matters to a young woman’s sense of self when she states her hometown, and then is pressed, “No, where are you really from?” regardless of how many generations her family has been in the country… Race matters because of the slights, the snickers, the silent judgments that reinforce that most crippling of thoughts: “I do not belong here.”

Some justices on the current Court respond badly to emotional blackmail. Chief Justice John Roberts was so incensed that he wrote his own two-paragraph concurrence entirely devoted to criticizing Sotomayor for attacking the majority in such personal terms (“People can disagree in good faith on this issue, but [it] does more harm than good to question the openness and candor of those on either side of the debate”). Scalia, as we saw, thought such histrionics disgraceful.

But on Kennedy—the man who loved to be hailed as the conscience of the Court, who pondered tough questions by walking back and forth across his office courtyard in the pose of Rodin’s Thinker, the man to whom wags applied the term “the Greenhouse Effect,” after New York Times correspondent Linda Greenhouse, whose approval Kennedy craved—on Kennedy, it worked.

Those “slights” and “snickers” that say “I do not belong here” are a staple of Sotomayor’s public persona. Her memoir, for which she received a reported $1.175 million advance, is full of references to her insecurities. At lectures in front of middle schoolers, on The Daily Show, on The View (where the ladies addressed her as “Sonia”), Sotomayor reassures her audiences that even with all her accomplishments she still hears a voice in her head asking, “Am I really here? Do I really belong?” Like many boomers, Sotomayor has shaped her persona around a psychological narrative of personal growth, from self-doubt to self-acceptance.

When she was nominated as President Barack Obama’s first Supreme Court appointee, it was hoped that Sotomayor could become “the people’s justice.” Her biography was compelling: growing up poor in the Bronx, diagnosed with diabetes when she was seven, alcoholic father dead when she was nine, raised thereafter by her nurse single mother and loving abuelita. There was some controversy during her confirmation over a speech in which Sotomayor expressed hope that a “wise Latina woman, with the richness of her experiences, would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn’t lived that life.”

Her defenders responded that the “wise Latina” quote was merely arguing for judges to draw on the richness of their diverse backgrounds. In her Schuette dissent, however, Justice Sotomayor showcased not the richness of her Latina background but only its resentments.

Hard as it may be for her to believe, Sotomayor is not the first Supreme Court justice to feel out of place. Charles E. Whittaker was appointed by Eisenhower, after Earl Warren, and his short tenure was blighted by his feelings of inferiority. He was not Hispanic, or female, or even Jewish. He was a straight white Protestant male from Kansas. But he had dropped out of high school at sixteen and gone to an unaccredited night school for his law degree, and colleagues like Felix Frankfurter and William O. Douglas intimidated him. “You know Charlie had gone to night law school, and he began as an office boy and he’d been a farm boy, and he had inside him an inferiority complex,” one justice told Earl Warren’s biographer. “He used to come out of our conferences literally crying…he’d say, ‘Felix used words in there I had never heard of.’ ” Eventually Whittaker had a nervous breakdown and resigned in 1962.

Coming from humble beginnings does not determine how someone will end up. Everything depends on how a person handles it. Harry Truman attended the same unaccredited Kansas City night school as Whittaker, before poverty forced him to drop out, and Truman turned out fine. A disadvantaged background made Charlie Whittaker a neurotic. It made Sonia Sotomayor a bully. The boomers’ preoccupation with oppression, identity, and grievance would create many bullies, because it turns out that thinking of yourself as a victim can make you heedless of the ways your actions victimize others.

Sotomayor learned early in life that something about her gave her the power to make authority figures hop. As a sophomore at Princeton, she and other members of the activist group Acción Puertorriqueña sent a formal letter of complaint to the federal Department of Health, Education, and Welfare accusing Princeton of not hiring enough Hispanics. “The facts imply and reflect the total absence of regard, concern and respect for an entire people and their culture,” she explained to The Daily Princetonian in May 1974. “In effect, they reflect an attempt—a successful attempt so far—to relegate an important cultural sector of the population to oblivion.”

Within weeks, HEW sent a federal official to New Jersey to meet with Sotomayor and an associate provost, who agreed to send Sotomayor an official minority hiring plan by the end of June.

Looking back on those years in her memoir, Sotomayor describes her undergraduate experience as a struggle to fit in, but in activism she found a psychological reinforcement more potent than belonging: power. The tone of her letter was hardly ingratiating. By pre-boomer standards, it was abusive. But far from urging this intemperate full-ride scholarship student that she should make more of an effort to fit in, Princeton quickly hired a Latino assistant dean of students who was on campus in time to greet Sotomayor when she returned for her junior year in September.

Her complaint to HEW was not, strictly speaking, a protest. The officials who received it welcomed its message. So did Princeton. The minority hiring plan “would have been prepared and submitted whether or not there had been a student complaint,” an administrator admitted later. Shortly before Sotomayor sent her letter, the board of trustees had voted $200,000 to refurbish the Third World Center, the campus hub for minority student groups, including Acción Puertorriqueña. The university was not only willing but eager to meet activists’ demands. Any posture of protest on the students’ part was mere playacting.

Sotomayor encountered more resistance when she tried the same gambit at Yale Law School. At a recruiting dinner for law students in 1978, a partner from the firm Shaw, Pittman grilled her about affirmative action: “Do you think you would have been admitted to Yale Law School if you were not Puerto Rican? . . . Do law firms do a disservice by hiring minority students who they know do not have the necessary credentials and will then fire in three to four years? . . . Do you consider yourself culturally deprived?”

No doubt he was testing her to see how she would react. When Antonin Scalia had a similar dinner with prospective employers at the Cleveland-based law firm Jones, Day shortly after graduating from Harvard Law, the partners hammered the devout Catholic on blue laws mandating Sunday shop closings, which Scalia was the only one at the table to support. “They really put it to him,” one of his hosts remembered, “and he handled it beautifully.”

Sotomayor did not accept her interrogation in a similar spirit. She filed an official complaint accusing Shaw, Pittman of violating Yale’s antidiscrimination policy and questioning their right to recruit on campus in the future. A faculty-student tribunal found in Sotomayor’s favor and demanded a letter of apology, which Shaw, Pittman sent and then redrafted in more abject terms when their first letter of apology was deemed inadequate by Yale officials.

Funnily enough, when Sotomayor showed up for her one-on-one interview the day after the disastrous group dinner, the partner who had grilled her invited her to come to Washington for more interviews. He thought she had handled the questioning well.

The journey from Bronx housing project to Ivy League law school had taught Sotomayor resilience. But it also taught her that bullying would yield results, that she would never pay a price for acting out; on the contrary, that she would be rewarded. This was, in a way, an appropriate lesson for her to learn. She was about to enter a profession that made a decades-long mission of bullying America.

The United States has been known as a land of lawyers since the eighteenth century. Edmund Burke and Alexis de Tocqueville both remarked on it. But it was not until the boomer era that the profession really came into its own, thanks in part to the rise of public interest law, the legal equivalent of an industrial revolution.

In the first half of the twentieth century, a nonprofit with a name like the German Legal Aid Society could be assumed to provide pro bono legal work for indigent clients from the demographic group named in its title. The Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, founded in 1968, was more interested in changing the law, winning cases that would set far-reaching precedents.

Eventually, many of the big public interest law firms stopped accepting routine cases lacking landmark potential. The purpose of public interest law at that point was to take the liberal eruptions of the Warren Court, which had caught the country by surprise, and make them routine. There were fifty full-time public interest lawyers in the country when Chief Justice Warren resigned in 1969. By 1975, there were six hundred.

Many of the great Warren Court cases were brought by independent individuals like Clarence Earl Gideon and Ernesto Miranda, whose cases were taken up by groups like the ACLU late in the process, if at all. The precedent-setting cases after 1970 were more likely to have been conceived, designed, and executed by nonprofit law firms from the very beginning. The Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, on whose board Sonia Sotomayor served from 1980 to 1992, launched and won cases forcing New York to offer bilingual education in public schools, redraw city council districts, and print government forms in Spanish, all without going to the trouble of winning an election.

The industrial manufacture of left-wing precedents was not the practice of law as it had been known for centuries. Common law offenses like barratry and maintenance had to be thrown out the window. The purpose of those antique torts had been to prevent third parties from subsidizing legal action for purposes of their own, using the client as a cat’s-paw. Subsidizing legal action for purposes of your own, independent of your client’s, is what public interest law is.

Traditionally, attorneys are not allowed to solicit clients but must wait for clients to come to them. This, too, is to ensure that cases are brought only by clients who are personally invested in the outcome and whose self-interest can be appealed to in reaching a reasonable settlement.

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, by contrast, used to send its lawyers around the country in the 1970s canvassing for plaintiffs who had been discriminated against at work. When the EEOC decided to go after a particular employer, it would put ads in the local paper inviting former employees to come and testify (and, of course, collect their share of the payout if the case was successful). The Supreme Court ruled in the 1978 case In re Primus that a lawyer for the ACLU was permitted to solicit clients by mail, contrary to bar regulations, because she did it for a political cause and not for her own profit.

By the time the gay rights movement hit its stride at the turn of the century, no one any longer thought it odd that such far-reaching social changes should be accomplished through highly choreographed plaintiff selection and organized harassment of shop owners. The old Brandeisian notion that cases must involve an “earnest and vital controversy” arising naturally from the frictions of society was dead.

As judges came to decide more matters that had previously been left to elected politicians, the judicial process came to resemble politics in all its rowdiness. More than 500,000 pro-choice protesters descended on Washington in advance of the oral argument in Planned Parenthood v. Casey in 1992. This demonstration would have been recognized as inappropriate in an era when judicial impartiality was still taken seriously. If judges merely apply the law, it should not matter what half a million demonstrators think.

The protesters’ show of force was rewarded. When the Casey decision came down, it explicitly grounded its refusal to overturn Roe in the need to protect “the people’s acceptance of the judiciary.”

The circus quality of modern Supreme Court nominations is a direct result of this politicization. Like public interest law, this spectacle is something genuinely new. For most of the Supreme Court’s history, nominees did not even attend their own hearings. The Left is to blame for the current state of affairs, and not just because it was Democrats who fired the first shot against Robert Bork in 1987 and launched the war of escalation that has led to the current stand-off. Empowering the judiciary to meddle deeper in politics in the name of constantly evolving constitutional rights is what has made the stakes of each nomination so high. The people who talk in lofty terms about the exalted role of judges in our democracy are the ones responsible for forcing the nomination process down in the muck.

Sotomayor did not enjoy her confirmation process. A White House “war room” is a grueling experience for any nominee, and Sotomayor did not approach hers in an obliging frame of mind. “There were private questions I was offended by,” she complained later. “I wondered if they ever asked those questions of the male candidates. But the society has a double standard.”

In fact, Anthony Kennedy remembers being asked by White House lawyers when he first had sex and if he’d ever had an STD or dabbled in S&M, among other intrusive questions, and that was before the advent of 24-hour cable news when scrutiny of hearings was less intense.

White House staffers also told Jeffrey Toobin of The New Yorker that Sotomayor resented being forced to prepare detailed answers on “the full range of constitutional law,” making her sessions “tense and laborious.”

To be fair to Sotomayor, she had a rougher confirmation than most. Her critics did not hesitate to criticize her in the most demeaning terms. “Bluntly put, she’s not nearly as smart as she seems to think she is,” Laurence Tribe told President Obama in a confidential memo that was later leaked. He wanted his Harvard Law dean, Elena Kagan, nominated instead, not just because she was smarter, but because she would have a better chance of persuading Anthony Kennedy to side with the liberals in cases where he was a swing vote. With Sotomayor, “her reputation for being something of a bully could well make her liberal impulses backfire and simply add to the fire power of the Roberts/Alito/Scalia/Thomas wing.”

Even more humiliating was Jeffrey Rosen’s hit piece in The New Republic, “The Case Against Sotomayor,” which again hammered her supposed intellectual shortcomings. Anonymous quotations from clerks who worked with Sotomayor on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals piled insult on insult. “Not that smart and kind of a bully on the bench,” said one. “She has an inflated opinion of herself, and is domineering during oral arguments but her questions aren’t pen- etrating and don’t get to the heart of the issue,” said another. Rosen’s idea of giving a balanced view was to quote a third clerk as saying, “She’s a fine Second Circuit judge. Maybe not the smartest ever, but how often are Supreme Court nominees the smartest ever?”

The irony was that Tribe and Rosen had both defended affirmative action in the past. It probably did not occur to Professor Tribe when he was defending the Bakke decision in a public debate with Alan Dershowitz in 1977 that the principles he was propounding (“Lower scores and grades need not mean lower ability”) would come back to bite him. He probably believed that for the really important stuff, like Supreme Court nominations, affirmative action would yield to pure meritocracy. Lucky for him, he did not accurately predict what forms of persuasion would work best on Anthony Kennedy.

It annoyed Sotomayor to read these attacks on her competence, especially from anonymous sources and especially from writers on her own political side. She blamed racism: “People kept accusing me of not being smart enough. Now, could someone explain to me, other than that I’m Hispanic, why that would be?”

If attaining the summit of her profession put Sotomayor in a reflective mood, she might have cast her mind back on the Shaw, Pittman partner thirty years earlier who tried to get her to think through some of the unintended consequences of affirmative action, how it can rebound on its supposed beneficiaries and affect the way they are perceived. This was exactly the kind of thing he was talking about.

15,Andrews,Helen,penguinrandomhouseaudio,"With two recessions and a botched pandemic under their belt, the Boomers are their children's favorite punching bag. But is the hatred justified? Is the destruction left in their wake their fault or simply the luck of the generational draw?In, essayist Helen Andrews addresses the Boomer legacy with scrupulous fairness and biting wit. Following the model of Lytton Strachey's Eminent Victorians, she profiles six of the Boomers' brightest and best. She shows how Steve Jobs tried to liberate everyone's inner rebel but unleashed our stultifying digital world of social media and the gig economy. How Aaron Sorkin played pied piper to a generation of idealistic wonks. How Camille Paglia corrupted academia while trying to save it. How Jeffrey Sachs, Al Sharpton, and Sonya Sotomayor wanted to empower the oppressed but ended up empowering new oppressors.Ranging far beyond the usual Beatles and Bill Clinton clichés, Andrews shows how these six Boomers' effect on the world has been tragically and often ironically contrary to their intentions. She reveals the essence of Boomerness: they tried to liberate us, and instead of freedom they left behind chaos.

“Helen Andrews has written the first book to treat the Baby Boomers not just as youthful dreamers but also as ruthless wielders of power, and to account for what their dreams have cost us. A groundbreaking reassessment of the last generation by one of the bravest and best writers of this one.”“Baby boomers (and I confess I am one): prepare to squirm and shake your increasingly arthritic little fists. For here comes essayist Helen Andrews, incendiary new critic of left-wing pieties, youthful scourge of 'disastrous' sixties idealism and its legacies, and all-round millennial conservative whippersnapper par excellence. Even when infuriating or wrong—and Andrews can be both—she is irresistibly intelligent, writes like a dream, and asks questions so uncomfortable and fundamental that the bravery, honesty, and moral seriousness of her approach cannot be gainsaid.—shall we go there?—is an essential book for our woebegotten time. Excuse me, folks, while I kiss the sky.”“As a committed but self-hating Baby Boomer, I've read Helen Andrews' work with an uneasy mixture of trepidation and admiration—admiration because she combines a luminous intelligence with a wit that's as glistening and sharp as a straight razor, and trepidation because I realize she is about to turn those weapons on me and my kind. We deserve it, of course, but that doesn't make it any less scary.”",1,https://www.penguinrandomhouseaudio.com/book/617494/boomers/
16,Andrews,Helen,firstthings,"If you ask me why conservatism has become intellectually impoverished, my answer is going to be a lot more prosaic than David Brooks’s. He starts his decline-of-the-conservative-mind column with a relatively rare allusion to his years working for National Review , and I could do the same but I don’t want to talk out of school. So I’ll stick to something any attentive reader might have noticed, which is that NR and NRO have filled their writing stable with a heck of a lot of think tankers. Almost every article that isn’t written by someone on staff is written by someone from Heritage, AEI, Cato, Hudson, or Hoover. I’m just speculating here (I have no inside knowledge on this question), but the most obvious reason for relying so heavily on think tankers is that they come cheap. Unlike freelancers, think tankers will put up with nonexistent-to-nominal fees because their salaries are being paid by someone else. Alas, think tankers—with a few exceptions—are not exactly known for the felicity of their prose or the originality of their thinking. They also think almost exclusively in terms of policy prescriptions—i.e., what Congress or the president or state legislatures can do—because that’s what they’re paid to care about. The result is that a lot of conservatism journalism today is (1) so badly written that it is difficult to read with any pleasure, (2) entirely unimaginative in its application of conservative principles, and (3) narrowly focused on either the Hill or the horse-race. All because of the market forces that come into operation when think tankers flood the market with cheap, reliable, and minimally acceptable journalism.



That’s one explanation for why conservatism is dumber than it used to be. Many others are equally valid. But the one explanation that I refuse to accept is the one Brooks and Rod Dreher both hyped this week (which is also the Left’s favorite critique—not that there’s anything wrong with that). This theory says that conservatism has been mortally weakened by the replacement of fusionism with small-government absolutism—an overemphasis on liberty and an underemphasis on tradition and community.



Brooks:

In the polarized political conflict with liberalism, shrinking government has become the organizing conservative principle. Economic conservatives have the money and the institutions. They have taken control. Traditional conservatism has gone into eclipse. These days, speakers at Republican gatherings almost always use the language of market conservatism — getting government off our backs, enhancing economic freedom. Even Mitt Romney, who subscribes to a faith that knows a lot about social capital, relies exclusively on the language of market conservatism. It’s not so much that today’s Republican politicians reject traditional, one-nation conservatism. They don’t even know it exists . . . .



The Republican Party has abandoned half of its intellectual ammunition. It appeals to people as potential business owners, but not as parents, neighbors and citizens.

. . . Robert Nisbet saw all this in the 1950s, and wrote about it in The Quest For Community (see Patrick Deneen’s short essay on the value of Nisbet’s contribution).



Ever read that book? Ever read Kirk’s The Conservative Mind ? Weaver’s Ideas Have Consequences ? These are treasure troves of traditionalist conservative thought and insight—all of it now so alien to what conservatism has become that to read them is like meeting a long-lost ancestor, a rich uncle who offers you an inheritance you didn’t know you had.



Turn off talk radio. Turn off the cable. Quit buying books from flashy Republican Party publicists. Take up the old traditionalist masters—Kirk, Nisbet, Weaver, and their philosophical school—and read. One day, their wisdom may revive American conservatism from the sterility and sloganeering of Conservatism, Inc. Since the Industrial Revolution, there have been dozens of micro-movements that have attempted to soften the edges of cold, hard conservatism with something more warm-hearted, usually with an emphasis on community or tradition over the market. British politics in particular seems to throw one up one every few decades like clockwork: Young England (1830s), Tory Democracy (1880s), Distributism (1910s), and now Red Toryism.



The trouble is, these movements never seem to go anywhere. You’d think they would, since their common message is stuff everyone can agree with: There are things more important than money, it’s better to be caring than unfeeling, when people are in trouble they deserve a little help, etc. (Well, some people had a tougher time with the definition. Randolph Churchill said, “To tell the truth, I don’t know myself what Tory Democracy is. But I believe it is principally opportunism.”) Yet conservatism rumbles on, unchanged by these fads.



I hope Dreher won’t take it as an insult if I suggest that he and Crunchy Conservatism have more in common with these marginal movements than with Burke and Kirk. So it’s funny that he accuses his opponents of “thinking conservatism began in 1980,” as he seems to have overlooked his own obvious antecedents and, you know, drawn the appropriate demoralizing conclusion.



I have a lot of affection for the Distributists. I treasure life’s charming little inefficiencies—fancy clothes, time for leisure, and I cook a lot more elaborately than I need to. But there’s a limit to how inefficient I can afford to be, and the only way to calculate that limit is money. I don’t want capitalism or politics to give me the things I care about, they just need to leave room for them. Which is why the fact that the balance of fusionism has tipped toward shrinking government doesn’t mean traditionalism isn’t alive and well.

Heaven preserve us from politicians who appeal to their constituents as parents and neighbors! Most of us have actual family and neighbors for that.That particular line reminds me of the tenured radicals who argued that college instruction should recognize that students are not just scholars but also human beings of particular genders and races, as well as citizens with democratic responsibilities (the solution: politicize the curriculum). It’s quite true that my citizenship, my faith, and my heritage are more important to me than my college major—but they are miles outside a professor’s job description. Like Stanley Fish says, save the world on your own time . And introducing extraneous themes doesn’t just distract from real education, it corrupts it. Professors who want to talk about thethings, rather than the appropriate things, end up doing more harm than good—and the same goes for politicians. Double.There was an Australian politician who wanted to run his reelection campaign on a theme of togetherness rather than tax cuts, and it’s a shame that more Americans aren’t familiar with what his colleague Neville Wran said to talk him out of it: “It’s all very well to go on with all that spiritual stuff, but if the greedy bastards out there wanted spiritualism, they’d join the f—ing Hare Krishna.”Rod Dreher takes Brooks’s case for the intellectual poverty of modern conservatism and pursues it further, but—and I mean this respectfully—he phrases his argument in a way that left me feeling affronted. He exhorts conservatives to study the great traditionalist thinkers of the past, when it seems to me that he’s the one who could use a history lesson:",1,https://www.firstthings.com/blogs/firstthoughts/2012/09/if-conservatism-has-gotten-dumbed-down-its-not-from-any-rout-of-the-traditionalists
17,Andrews,Helen,firstthings,"Black Earth: The Holocaust as History and Warning

by timothy snyder

tim duggan books, 462 pages, $30

F

aced with the challenge of finding something new to say about the Holocaust, a lesser author will offer a picture of Nazism that resembles his present-day political opponents. In a strange reversal, Timothy Snyder opens Black Earth by presenting a Nazism that resembles his own side. He claims that the only way to understand the Holocaust is to grasp that “­Hitler’s thought was ecological,” his dominant theme not race but the “planetary ecosystem.” A bizarre argument, all the more so because ­Snyder is a green himself—the second half of the book’s subtitle, the Holocaust “as warning,” refers to his thesis that we can avert the next genocide by taking drastic action on climate change. Having made Hitler out to be a radical environmentalist, Snyder then has to pirouette like a dervish to explain that climate skeptics are Hitler’s real modern-day heirs. Fortunately for Snyder and his fellow environmentalists, he never succeeds in painting Hitler green in the first place.

It is not the Führer’s well-known love of animals that Snyder is referring to when he calls Hitler’s thought ecological. The green kernel he detects at the heart of Hitler’s worldview is more abstract: The earth’s resources are limited, and man must struggle to survive within those limits like any other animal. This starting point made Hitler’s worldview dangerously unfettered in some ways and dangerously narrow in others. Unfettered, because nature red in tooth and claw has no place for moral scruples. Narrow, because it prevented Hitler from seeing that mankind can rise above the Darwinian struggle over limited resources through cooperation, through ­scientific innovation, or even by deciding that competition for resources is not all there is to life. “Denying the science that promised alternatives to war” is the pessimistic flaw that Hitler and climate skeptics allegedly have in common—and “war” is not too strong a word for what Snyder thinks will happen if we don’t put more money into solar panels. Instead of German imperialism in Eastern Europe, the flashpoint will be famine in the Middle East or Chinese hunger for land in Africa.

As Snyder develops his portrait of an ecological Hitlerism, first for historical and then for polemical use, he runs into two problems. The first is that his portrait bears no resemblance to today’s climate skeptics. Quite the opposite. The only limit on our resources is human ingenuity? Preach it, cries Matt Ridley from the back! The ­apocalyptic mode of debate makes people overrate their problems and demonize their opponents? Tell Bjørn ­Lomborg something he doesn’t know. Mankind is more than just another animal? “Ecological panic” (one of Black Earth’s catchphrases) is a ­recipe for political blunders on a massive scale? Which side does ­Snyder think he’s addressing?

The second problem is that his portrait looks nothing like ­Hitler, either. Naturally the concept of Lebensraum plays a starring role in Snyder’s argument that Hitler was obsessed with natural resources. In particular, he contrasts Lebensraum with what “Hitler himself knew . . . was a ­political alternative in the 1930s: that the German state abandon ­colonization and support agricultural technology.”

Hitler understood that agricultural science posed a specific threat to the logic of his system. If humans could intervene in nature to create more food without taking more land, his whole system collapsed. He therefore denied the importance of what was happening before his eyes, the science of what was later called the “Green Revolution”: the hybridization of grains, the distribution of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, the expansion of irrigation. Even “in the best case,” he insisted, hunger must outstrip crop improvements. There was “a limit” to all scientific improvements. Indeed, all of “the scientific methods of land management” had already been tried and had failed.

One hesitates ever to say that Hitler has been selectively quoted, a phrase from which the whiff of exculpation cannot be fumigated, but it is telling that ­Snyder quotes phrases rather than whole sentences. Chasing down his citations to their source finds Hitler professing the greatest respect for agriculture science. (“The history of human agriculture is one of continual progress . . . from the ancient hoe to the modern steam plow, from barn manure to today’s artificial fertilizers.”) He does not say agricultural science had “failed,” as Snyder alleges, only that there were limits to what it could be expected to achieve for Germany at that time—a reasonable position considering that German agriculture’s productivity per hectare was already 50 percent above the world average and double what prevailed among its eastern neighbors.

Agricultural science could not achieve the miracle of allowing Germany to feed itself from its own territory—this was indeed Hitler’s belief, and also the belief of the ­Allied occupation authorities, ­Henry ­Morgenthau excepted. But that did not prevent the “Official Party Statement on Its Attitude toward the Farmers and Agriculture,” which appeared over Hitler’s signature in the Völkischer Beobachter in 1930, from promising state subsidies for soil enrichment, pest control, fertilizers, and chemical soil testing. “A considerable increase in agricultural productivity,” it declared, “is perfectly possible to achieve.”

F

ar from holding agronomy in contempt, Hitler made the Agriculture Ministry the first economic ministry in his cabinet to be headed by a card-carrying Nazi: Richard Walther Darré, who wrote his doctoral thesis on pig breeding. The notorious Generalplan Ost, the eastern colonization plan that constituted the Reich’s earliest and most explicit blueprint for genocide, was drafted by an agronomist, Konrad Meyer, whose doctoral thesis was on wheat genetics. The highest-ranking SS officer at Auschwitz after Rudolf Höss was Joachim Caesar, head of the camp’s 3,800-hectare agricultural research unit. The Reich Research Council under Hitler gave more money to agronomy than to any other ­biological science.

I belabor the point about agriculture because Snyder makes it the central pillar of his claim that Hitler had an “unusual opposition to scientific solutions,” which he blames for almost singlehandedly spurring the Drang nach Osten: “Hitler denied that science could solve the basic problem of nutrition, but assumed that technology could win territory. It seemed to follow that waiting for research was pointless and that immediate military action was necessary.” But Hitler’s failure to anticipate Norman Borlaug does not make him anti-science any more than Snyder is anti-science for admitting that “the Green Revolution . . . might be reaching its limits.” Once the notion of Hitler as a science-denier collapses, so does any tendentious comparison between Nazism and the “deniers” of today. It is disappointing to see a good historian so far outrun his sources in pursuit of a ­provocative thesis—or a partisan political point.

Was the Holocaust a product of too much government or too little? In a sense, it was both. It is hardly an accident that this incomparable atrocity was committed almost entirely by people in uniforms. On the other hand, as Snyder shows, countries where state structures were destroyed (like Poland and Ukraine) were far more dangerous places for Jews than countries that retained their own functioning governments, even when those governments came completely under Nazi control as in France and Denmark. Bureaucracy can be deadly, but not as deadly as anarchy.

Yet Snyder attempts to argue that genocide in general is caused not by states but by their absence. His present-day political commitments lie behind this overreach, too, though at least this time Snyder has his guns trained on the other side. “A common American error is to believe that freedom is the absence of state authority,” he writes. “The genealogy of this confusion leads us back to the Germany and the Austria of the 1930s.” (Only as far back as that?) “When the Holocaust is blamed on the modern state, the weakening of state authority ­appears salutary.”

Attributing genocide to small government backs Snyder into some strange corners:

What about the states that carried out mass murder of their own citizens? The three most horrifying twentieth-century cases—the People’s Republic of China, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and Cambodia under Pol Pot—were all party-states, where both ­ideology and practice demanded that the state institutions be secondary to party ­institutions, and where the legitimacy of the state was ­completely ­undercut by the ideological appeal made by party leaders to the future of the ­collectivity.

When you find yourself arguing that the problem with Communism was not enough government, it is time to check your math. Snyder has confused law, which Nazis and Communists both despised, and the state, which they liked very much. The crucial ingredient that the mass murders in the twentieth century had in common was an excessive concentration of power, and the state almost always, almost by definition, is where power of that magnitude is found.

But according to Snyder, Hitler was not interested in power. He was only interested in “an endless race war.” He was no fascist, he was “not even a German nationalist,” but a “biological anarchist.” Victory meant nothing to him compared to the struggle. “To Hitler, his fellow Germans were of interest only insofar as they could be rallied to join a mindless war for future racial prosperity.” The very idea of a Nazi state was a contradiction in terms, since “the Nazi party was founded on the assumption of endless racial ­conflict, whereas any traditional state asserts the right to control and limit ­violence.”

There are indeed aspects of Hitler’s thought that suggest a Nietzschean love of conflict for its own sake—his two-in-a-box management style, for example, which involved giving two subordinates the same task and letting them fight it out. But other aspects suggest just the opposite, like his hatred of both duelling (“It proves nothing . . . what matters is not to have right on your side, but to aim better than your opponent”) and hunting (“Is it indispensable, for relaxation, to kill hares and pheasants? . . . It’s lucky we don’t understand the language of hares. They might talk about you something like this: ‘He couldn’t run at all, the fat hog!’”). It is also worth noting that, based on his stray comments about capitalism, Snyder seems to be the sort of leftist who detects an indecent love of brutal competition in anyone to the right of John Kenneth Galbraith.

As for the idea that Hitler was not a German nationalist, it is certainly possible to argue that the man who impoverished his country, destroyed its cities, killed 40 percent of its men born between 1920 and 1925, and made its name synonymous with unfathomable evil did not love Germany well. But as a schoolboy, ­Hitler tweaked his Austrian teachers by waving pencils in the colors of greater Germany. As a soldier in the trenches, he wrote poetry about his love for the Fatherland. Nationalism never superseded his pathological Jew-hatred, but it did precede it, and he clung to it nearly as tenaciously. To say that Hitler was not a German nationalist is absurd.

Snyder’s mentor, Tony Judt, scored a surprise late-in-life bestseller with Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945 and has continued to be a gold mine for his publisher since his death from Lou Gehrig’s disease in 2010. The success of Snyder’s previous book, Bloodlands, made him a contender to replace Judt as the history profession’s most bankable public intellectual. His publishers have just announced a re-release of Snyder’s first book, the ­parochially titled Nationalism, Marxism, and Modern Central Europe: A Biography of ­Kazimierz Kelles-Krauz (1872–1905), which suggests they have picked their horse. There ought to be more American historians who write regularly for the New York Review of Books, and Snyder may well prove to be a good fit for that role. Nevertheless, in Sneyder’s ongoing evolution from biographer of obscure Polish Marxists to the Tony Judt of his generation, Black Earth must be regarded as a step backward.

18,Andrews,Helen,firstthings,"How unsurprising that Dahvi Waller, creator of the recent miniseries about Phyllis Schlafly, Mrs. America, used to work on AMC’s Mad Men. The things people say in this miniseries are laughably retrograde, and everyone looks great saying them.

Whatever other virtues writer-producer Waller picked up working for Matt Weiner, they did not include his notorious attention to detail in period accuracy. Waller is telling a real story about real people, so her duty to get the facts right was greater. But as Schlafly biographer Donald Critchlow has rightly said, some scenes in Mrs. America are “so inaccurate, it’s absolutely shocking.”

The first scene has our title character parading down a runway in an American flag bikini as part of a beauty pageant for a congressional fundraiser. The MC introduces her as “the wife of one of our biggest donors, Mrs. J. Fred Schlafly.”

The woman who wrote A Choice Not an Echo would not have needed to show off her legs or invoke her husband’s money to be invited to a congressional fundraiser. Schlafly had worked at the American Enterprise Institute and co-written a book on nuclear deterrence with Rear Adm. Chester Ward. She was a widely sought-after speaker on defense policy.

What is it that attracts showrunners like Weiner and Waller to reactionary characters whose views they obviously hate? Not just to write about them, but to glamorize them? Schlafly, as played by Cate Blanchett, outdoes her feminist opponents in poise and self-possession (not to mention wardrobe) as much as Don Draper does Pete Campbell.

These showrunners must imagine that their antiheroes are safely in the realm of kitsch. The difference between kitsch and genuine bad taste is that the artist can’t imagine anyone liking kitsch seriously. If no one could possibly believe the things Don Draper believes in the twenty-first century, then it’s acceptable to glamorize him because viewers are only enjoying him ironically.

Waller certainly has every reason to think that Schlafly’s beliefs have been safely rendered unbelievable by unanimous taboo. All of Schlafly’s political victories have, over the four decades since the ERA failed, been effectively reversed by the undertow of elite opinion.

Earlier this year, Virginia became the 38th state to ratify the ERA. The amendment finally received ratification from the required three-fourths of the fifty states—and hardly anyone noticed. Even Ruth Bader Ginsburg urged feminists not to put their energy into fighting a legal case to overturn the congressional deadline that closed the window for ratification in 1982.

Justice Ginsburg is right. Once you’ve decided that the Fourteenth Amendment requires the Virginia Military Institute to go co-ed, what is the point of the ERA anymore? Everything Schlafly warned about—and was mocked as an alarmist for warning about—from gay marriage to unisex bathrooms, judges like Ginsburg have accomplished perfectly well without the ERA through creative readings of the Constitution and the Civil Rights Act.

The only reason to pass the ERA now is abortion. It would give Roe v. Wade the constitutional pillar to rest on that it currently lacks. Of the thirty-five states that ratified the ERA before the original deadline in 1979, thirty did so before Roe was decided. The amendment’s potential to enshrine a right to abortion in the constitution has long been, for many, its greatest attraction.

It is also the issue where Mrs. America is most tone-deaf. Episode 2 focuses on Gloria Steinem’s effort to get an abortion plank into the platform at the 1972 Democratic National Convention. In the candidate’s suite, McGovern campaign manager Gary Hart makes Steinem this offer:

“What if we stay neutral, let our delegates vote their conscience?”



“And you don’t let the right-to-lifers speak? We don’t want anyone saying abortion is murder right before the vote.”



“And we don’t want anyone up there saying women are being butchered on kitchen tables.”



“But women are being butchered on kitchen tables.”



“Yes. We just don’t want to hear about it.”

“When I started writing episode two,” Waller told Esquire, “one of the notes I got back was, ‘How are young women today even going to relate to the idea of abortion being illegal?’ Can you believe that was a note I got?” Hard as it may be for Waller to believe, many young women find an end to legal abortion not only imaginable but desirable. It’s just one of many facts that Steinem’s side would prefer not to hear about.

Mrs. America imagines that it can safely romanticize Schlafly’s pastel-colored suburban world because no woman today could possibly want to go back to it. There are fewer stay-at-home housewives today than there were in 1972, and women today are more likely to have an advanced degree and to work outside the home.

But Schlafly had a master’s degree in government from Radcliffe, and she still believed that God created two sexes for a reason. Anne Marie Whittemore, the Virginia lawyer who defended VMI in its sex discrimination lawsuit, was a graduate of Vassar and Yale Law, and she still believed in the value of sex-segregated education (as well a Vassar woman might). As for working outside the home, women’s firsthand experience with wage labor has rendered less credible, not more, feminism’s promise that employment is the only possible path to self-actualization.

The heroic figure of Phyllis Schlafly will break free from Waller’s kitschy depiction of her, just as she broke free from the role of housewife to become a political organizer and policy intellectual as well as a wife and mother. Fred Schlafly and the reactionary old men of the conservative movement were delighted to see Phyllis forge her own independent path. If Waller discovers that she inadvertently made her antihero too attractive and viewers are rooting for her unironically, will she be just as delighted?

There once was a general who fought a war to protect slavery. That’s not how he would have described it. He would have said he was fighting to protect his way of life from a foreign invader. Whatever construction he put on it, his so-called way of life rested on the sweat wrung from forced labor on plantations and gold earned from buying and selling black flesh.

That general was Samori Touré. The West African chieftain is honored today by black nationalists for resisting French imperialism in the Mandingo Wars of the late nineteenth century, but thousands of Africans were enslaved by Samori’s raiders in the course of building up his empire. After his final defeat in 1898, for more than a decade, columns of refugees tramped into French Guinea to return to their home villages as they escaped or were liberated from Banamba or Bamako or wherever Samori’s men had sold them.

Ta-Nehisi Coates named his son Samori, after the great resister. That means that Between the World and Me, the best-selling anti-racist tract of the current century, which takes the form of letters from Coates to his son, is addressed to someone named after a prolific enslaver of black Africans.

History is complicated, isn’t it?

America is currently in the middle of one of its periodic orgies of tearing down memorials to the past. The iconoclasts always have an advantage in these fights, because their opponents have different breaking points. Some Americans were happy to conciliate the protestors until a mob in Portland defaced a statue of George Washington. Others reserved their indignation for when a mob in Golden Gate Park toppled Junípero Serra, Francis Scott Key, and (of all people) Ulysses S. Grant in one night. In New York, the city council is proposing to trash the city’s statue of Thomas Jefferson, which will at least be accomplished by an orderly vote rather than a howling crowd. Some people have persuaded themselves that that makes it all right.

For me, a line was crossed this week when the faculty at Washington & Lee University voted to demand the school drop the second half of its name to erase its affiliation with Robert E. Lee. The moderate conservative’s justification for why it’s good to tear down Confederate statues but not those of the Founding Fathers is that Confederates are honored for defending slavery whereas the Founding Fathers are honored for other things despite their slave-owning. Whatever the general validity of that maneuver, it is obviously wrong here. Lee was president of the university; he gave it its distinctive character. His service as its leader was one of the great public-spirited acts of his late career, the most enduring of his many postwar gestures of patriotism and reconciliation.

Lee may not be someone you care to defend, even in his most defensible context. The point is that the current crop of fanatics are going to tear down every name and statue — Lee, Grant, Washington, Jefferson, any American hero to the right of Harvey Milk — unless we think of a way that we can all stand together, whatever the differences in our personal lines in the sand.

I have a proposal for a way. It will not require you to change your mind about Robert E. Lee. But before you throw him permanently into the junkbin of history, the general may have a final lesson to teach us.

***

According to Gore Vidal, Norman Podhoretz once confessed to him that “the Civil War is as remote and irrelevant to me as the War of the Roses.” One cannot always take Vidal’s anecdotes as gospel truth, especially about the former editor of Commentary, whom he detested, but certainly there are many people in America today who would say the same thing.

Visitorship at Civil War battlefields has dwindled to record lows in recent years, possibly as a natural consequence of increasing diversity. Personally I think every American citizen should be able to walk the fields of Gettysburg and feel that the history there belongs to them, no matter when their family arrived here. But maybe it’s understandable that someone whose parents immigrated many decades after the war ended, as Podhoretz’s did, should have trouble seeing the Civil War as something that is still, for many people, terribly present.

If you see the Civil War as an intellectual subject in which one might take an interest or not, like Tudor history, then there is no big dilemma in how to deal with it. You can simply choose to identify with the good guys. But if the war has come down to you as part of your inheritance, then the question of how to deal with it is a problem in need of a solution.

Robert E. Lee has always been part of that solution, because no Confederate has been judged more deserving of being honored as a national hero. President Dwight Eisenhower kept a photo of Lee in his office, and when a constituent wrote him a letter saying, “I do not understand how any American can include Robert E. Lee as a person to be emulated,” the general responded eloquently. “Through all his many trials, he remained selfless almost to a fault and unfailing in his faith in God. Taken altogether, he was noble as a leader and as a man, and unsullied as I read the pages of our history.”

The reason we have forgotten why Lee is worth honoring is the same reason we have forgotten why we needed him in the first place: we have lost our appreciation for old-fashioned virtues like duty and filial piety. I saw a pundit on Twitter, otherwise a pretty conservative guy, say recently: “Robert E. Lee literally had the privilege of choosing which army he wanted to lead in the Civil War. He chose wrong.” It’s true that Lee was offered command of Union forces in April 1861, but it is a modern anachronism to assume from this that he had a choice.

Duty is the virtue most associated with Lee, and it really was the guiding light of his life. When his old commander Winfield Scott asked him why he turned down the Union’s offer, despite personally opposing secession, Lee replied, “I am compelled to. I cannot consult my own feelings in this matter.” His loyalty was to Virginia, and he had to follow his state. Later, at Appomattox, Grant wanted Lee to sign surrender terms not just for the Army of Northern Virginia but for the whole Confederacy. Lee believed that was for President Davis alone to decide. Grant did not waste time telling Lee all the reasons it would be better for both sides to have a general surrender signed quickly. As he put it, “I knew there was no use to urge him to do anything against his ideas of what was right.”

Virtue shines best by contrast, so consider Lee next to someone who was his opposite in every way: Massachusetts senator Charles Sumner. Even his defenders must admit that Sumner was a man of deep principle but absolutely no honor. He would break any promise, betray any confidence, reverse any position to serve his liberal causes. He once won a Senate vote by persuading a Republican nay, who had paired with a Democratic yea who was deathly ill, to break his vow to abstain. He used the Constitution as a cudgel against his Southern opponents while feeling himself at perfect liberty to ignore any provision he disagreed with, on the grounds that nothing “against the Divine Law,” as he liberally interpreted it, could be binding.

Sumner’s greatest flip-flop was on pacifism. Peace had been his signature cause even before anti-slavery, going back to a notorious speech in 1845 where he called all wars “organized murder” and denigrated West Point as “a seminary of idleness and vice” that did nothing but train young men in “farcical and humiliating exercises.” When war came, Sumner could easily have sided with the Garrisonians willing to let the South depart in peace, confident that slavery would soon collapse under its own weight and in the meantime glad to have it off their consciences. But Sumner saw that martial law would give Lincoln a constitutional loophole to abolish slavery in every state. So he reversed himself on his oldest moral crusade and became one of the war’s most vindictive cheerleaders.

No one blamed the abolitionists for abandoning their long-held pacificism; the war was the opportunity of a lifetime. But that is the point. Duty means doing the right thing even when no one would blame you for doing otherwise. That’s what made Lee, whatever else you want to say about him, utterly dependable. He was a rock. He could be counted on. The only thing you could count on Sumner to do was to betray all of his allies eventually, even fellow Radicals like Thaddeus Stevens, the minute he convinced himself that they stood in the way of his political goals.

Here we arrive at the question at the heart of the statue debate: Are people constrained by any duties, any external obligations at all, or is everything always up for negotiation? Are we free to choose which heroes we want to celebrate and then equally free to choose again differently tomorrow?

Heredity is one source of unchosen obligations. It was very much in mind when Americans were debating how to handle reconciliation after the Civil War. How could we possibly strike a balance between asking Southerners to swear allegiance to the Union, which was vitally necessary, and forcing them to spit on the graves of their fathers and brothers, which was morally unthinkable to ask from any but an abjectly conquered foe? Amazingly, America succeeded in bringing the South into the country again, but only because we did exactly that: struck a balance.

History is another source of unchosen obligations, one more powerful in many ways than heredity. To be loyal to the United States means being loyal to its history. You can’t treat America like a conquered province, the way the crowds defacing Winston Churchill are treating London. Lee and Sumner were both very stubborn men, which made them superficially similar, but the difference was that for Lee the ultimate arbiter of his conduct was external whereas Sumner recognized no higher judge than himself. Acknowledging unchosen obligations means accepting that some things about America, like its history, aren’t yours to change at will — which is good, because stable and unchanging things are what Americans can unite behind.

The left has a counteroffer to this. We can heal all our divisions, they say, if you will only join with us in rallying behind our revised list of heroes. But that would mean consenting to make your position on your country’s history infinitely changeable, and infinitely changeable at the whim of someone other than yourself. Because, of course, the right side of history we’re all uniting under will be different again tomorrow, and you won’t be on the committee that decides what it is. Nothing is fixed; no principles stand firm. You will be like Sumner, a man in whom nothing can be relied upon except his sense of his own self-righteousness.

To live like that, you must either have an unshakeable sense of yourself, as the egotist Sumner did, or else no sense of yourself at all. There are some political systems that prefer their citizens to be infinitely malleable with no bedrock sense of self, but they are not democratic ones.

***

I used to side with the people who wanted to tear down all Confederate monuments. If Southern gentility means anything, I thought, it means not causing gratuitous offense. It means being willing to accept that a statue might mean one thing to us but something different to our fellow citizens, to whom we have an obligation to be considerate. I took people at their word when they said, we don’t hate the South, we just want you to celebrate what’s best about it, not what’s worst.

That gave them too much credit. In truth, they don’t want to celebrate anything about the South, or America, or the past. Everything falls short of their Year Zero standards. Considering the absolutism of their ideology, perhaps I should have seen this coming. Others did. Either way, Confederates are in the rear-view mirror now and Washington and Jefferson are the ones up for condemnation.

The left argues that name changes and statue topplings are a way for people and institutions to demonstrate their commitment to real change. But at this point, it is not ordinary Americans who need to demonstrate their good faith to the left. It is the statue-topplers who need to convince us that they are genuinely committed to pluralism and not, as their actions would suggest, just sparing some statues temporarily while they bide their time to wait and see what they can get away with tomorrow.

So choose one. That is my proposal. The monument-destroying left should pick a statue they genuinely hate and say: leave it up.

Maybe it’s the Robert E. Lee equestrian statue on Monument Avenue in Richmond. That memorial was conceived in 1870 and not, as many other Confederate statues were, during the reassertion of white rule at the turn of the century. It really was intended to stand for reconciliation, not Southern intransigence. It’s also galling that Ralph Northam is the one who decided to get rid of it. The last person who has any business lecturing the rest of us in racial sensitivity is Governor Blackface.

But it doesn’t have to be Lee. It can be someone else. The point is for the left to demonstrate that they are capable of sharing a country with people they disagree with.If you can’t name a single statue you hate that you would leave standing, then you are a fanatic, and fanatics, even when their zeal is for a good cause, are impossible for the rest of us to coexist with.

Sometimes I wonder what Lee would think if he could see his Richmond statue now, covered in graffiti that the state won’t allow anyone to clean off, not even the obscenities. It would not touch his dignity. Lee had extensive experience with adolescent misbehavior, as a college president and before that as superintendent of West Point. He knew the virtue that young people most need to be taught, because it does not come naturally to them, is self-discipline. “You cannot be a true man until you learn to obey” was one of his favorite maxims. It would sadden him to see protesters who have apparently reached the age of thirty without ever acquiring sufficient self-mastery to wait for Governor Northam’s decision to take effect, or to express themselves without saying “Fuck.” But it would not wound him.

Self-discipline is precisely what we all need to rediscover right now. We need to relearn how to put our own emotions aside and live in peace with other people, even those whose deeply held beliefs offend us. If we don’t, the entire country will be in for a long, multi-year, possibly endless adolescent tantrum, and there won’t be a single remnant of our past left standing at the end of it.",1,https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/a-lesson-from-robert-e-lee/
20,Andrews,Helen,claremontreviewofbooks,"What was the countercultural culture that lasted for a decade or two after the 1960s? To those who rallied behind it, it was a progressive reworking of old values, a drawing out of new possibilities. To those who lamented it, it was a mere looting of the old culture, a decadence, a spending down. In theory it could have been both at the same time. But by the 1970s, Americans were reaching a verdict. They were drifting away from the idea that the country was in the middle of a renaissance and beginning to worry that it was going down the tubes.

This was not just a reaction to a slowing economy. Certainly, in an economy hemmed in by strong trade unions, new environmental regulation, and newly expensive oil and gasoline, it seemed impossible to create jobs. In December 1974 alone, the country lost 600,000 of them. But Americans were concerned more about the culture than the conjuncture.

American automobiles had once been a symbol of the country’s world-bestriding economy. Now their shoddiness was astonishing, embarrassing, no matter how obstreperously auto workers demanded to be compensated as the “best workers in the world.” In 1977, Plymouth brought out a new “T-Bar coupe” called the Volare. “To the new generation of Americans who have never known the driving pleasure of wind through the hair,” the ads ran, “we proudly dedicate our new T-Bar Volare Coupe.” It was a way for Chrysler to avoid saying that it had lost the capacity to build convertibles at an affordable price. Starting in 1978, General Motors began producing station wagons—such as the Buick Century and the Oldsmobile Cutlass Cruiser—in which the rear windows didn’t roll down. Magazine ads for Ford and Cadillac depicted their new models against a dim backdrop of historic ones, as if to console themselves that, if their products were third-rate, they had at least once made better ones.

The prospects for government were, if anything, worse. It was not only that Richard Nixon had been forced from office in a scandal. The three great progressive endeavors of the preceding decades—civil rights, women’s liberation, the attempt to impose a liberal order on the world militarily—had all been resoundingly repudiated by the public. Post-Civil Rights Act, violent crime and drug abuse in inner cities were at record highs. Post-Ms. magazine, legislatures were rescinding ratifications of the Equal Rights Amendment that they had only recently passed. Post-Vietnam War, Soviet troops entered Afghanistan and revolutionary governments came to power in Nicaragua and Iran.

The mood was one of nostalgia and failure. The American public had come to see the political project of the 1960s as dangerously utopian. They brought California governor Ronald Reagan to power to put an end to it. Instead, in ways that neither his supporters nor his detractors have ever fully understood, he rescued it.

What Did the Debt Buy?

Dwight eisenhower warned in his 1961 farewell address, “We—you and I, and our government—must avoid the impulse to live only for today, plundering, for our own ease and convenience, the precious resources of tomorrow.”

By then the country had known massive borrowing, but only in wartime. To fight World War II, the federal government had added $200 billion to its debt—an amount that by war’s end was about the size of the gross domestic product. Although the size of the total credit market (including private individuals) would expand every single year from 1947 to 2008, in the first 35 years after World War II the trajectory of government debt (measured as a percentage of gross domestic product) had steadily declined. Under Reagan it began to rise. In fact, the national debt would triple on his watch. That opened a new chapter in American fiscal history.

Looking at numbers and charts from the 1980s, it is easy to miss the most basic question: Why on earth, at the height of the Baby Boom generation’s productive years, did the government need to borrow in the first place? What did this binge of debt buy? What emergency did it extricate the country from?

From an actuarial and from a human-capital perspective, the quarter-century after Ronald Reagan’s election should have been the easiest time to balance the budget in the history of the republic. The entirety of the vast Baby Boom generation, making up 38% of the voting population, was in its productive years. There were relatively few retirees and dependent children to tend to. The country was (until the Iraq War after 2003) at peace. It set the rules for the global economy. But since Baby Boomers were due to leave the workforce between 2010 and 2030, big obligations for Social Security and Medicare loomed. Those would go unmet.

The borrowing power of the Baby Boom generation was invested in avoiding the choices that the confrontations of the 1960s had placed before the country. What the debt paid for was social peace, which had come to be understood as synonymous with the various Great Society programs launched by Lyndon Johnson in the two years after the Kennedy assassination. We should understand the Great Society as the institutional form into which the civil rights impulse hardened, a transfer from whites to blacks of the resources necessary to make desegregation viable. Desegregation was, as we have said, the most massive undertaking of any kind in the history of the United States. Like any massive undertaking, it required endurance, patience, and prohibitive expense. Almost everyone who did not benefit from it was going to be made poorer by it. Now it was being presented to the public as the merest down payment on what Americans owed.

The best evidence we have is that it was too much for most Americans from the beginning. The rhetoric that brought Reagan two landslides was, among other things, a sign that Americans were unwilling to bankroll with their taxes the civil rights and welfare revolution of the 1960s and the social change it brought in its train.

In retrospect, we can see that by acquiescing in the ouster of Richard Nixon after the previous landslide, those who voted for him had lost their chance to moderate the pace of that change. With the removal of Nixon, promoters of the Great Society had bought the time necessary to defend it against “backlash,” as democratic opposition to social change was coming to be called. In the near-decade that elapsed between Nixon and Reagan, entire subpopulations had become dependent on the Great Society. Those programs were now too big to fail.

They were gigantic. Once debt was used as a means to keep the social peace, it would quickly run into the trillions. One of Johnson’s lower-profile initiatives from 1965, the Higher Education Act, created the so-called Pell Grants to help “underprivileged” youth go to college. Their cost had risen to $7 billion by the time Reagan came to Washington. Although their effectiveness was disputed, there was an iron coalition of educational administrators and student advocates behind them. So Reagan didn’t touch them. They would swell to $39 billion by 2010. And they were not the whole story of federal support for education. According to one sympathetic account, federal grants and loans to college students, adjusted for inflation, were $800 million in 1963-64, $15 billion in 1973-74, and $157 billion in 2010-11.

Such grants didn’t just finance individual educations. They provided a pool of billions in investment capital that spawned new for-profit universities set up largely to collect them. In the 21st century, the largest collector of Pell Grant tuition would be the University of Phoenix, a nationwide open-enrollment “university” founded in 1976. Its students owed $35 billion in taxpayer-backed federal loans. Their default rate was higher than their graduation rate. More and more the vaunted Reaganite “private sector” was coming to operate this way. It was a catchment area set up to receive government funds—usually by someone well enough connected to know before the public did how and where government funds would be directed.

Reagan stinted on none of the resources required to construct Johnson’s new order. Having promised for years that he would undo affirmative action “with the stroke of a pen,” lop the payments that LBJ’s Great Society lavished on “welfare queens,” and abolish Jimmy Carter’s Department of Education, he discovered, once he became president, that to do any of those things would have struck at the very foundations of desegregation. So he didn’t—although Democrats and Republicans managed to agitate and inspire their voting and fundraising bases for decades by pretending he had. Meanwhile, his tax cuts provided a golden parachute for the white middle class, allowing it, for one deluded generation, to re-create with private resources a Potemkin version of the old order.

Those losing out had to be compensated. Consider affirmative action—unconstitutional under the traditional order, compulsory under the new—which exacted a steep price from white incumbents in the jobs they held, in the prospects of career advancement for their children, in their status as citizens. Such a program could be made palatable to white voters only if they could be offered compensating advantages. A government that was going to make an overwhelming majority of voters pay the cost of affirmative action had to keep unemployment low, home values rising, and living standards high.

Reaganomics was just a name for governing under a merciless contradiction that no one could admit was there: civil rights was important enough that people could not be asked to wait for it, but unpopular enough that people could not be asked to pay for it. Reagan permitted Americans to live under two social orders, two constitutional orders, at the same time. There was a pre-Great Society one and a post-Great Society one. Paying for both soon got expensive.

The cost can be measured roughly by the growth of the debt, public and private, over the decades after Reagan’s arrival in the White House. By 1989, the year Reagan left office, according to an estimate by the economist Roy H. Webb of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, the government’s unfunded liabilities (mostly for Social Security, Medicare, and veterans’ benefits) had reached $4-5 trillion, and would rise exponentially if nothing were done. Nothing was done. By the time of the 2016 election, a calculation of those liabilities similar to Webb’s ran to at least $135 trillion.

Ronald Reagan saved the Great Society in the same way that Franklin Roosevelt is credited by his admirers with having “saved capitalism.” That is, he tamed some of its very worst excesses and found the resources to protect his own angry voters from consequences they would otherwise have found intolerable. That is what the tax cuts were for.

Each of the two sides that emerged from the battles of the 1960s could comport itself as if it had won. There was no need to raise the taxes of a suburban entrepreneur in order to hire more civil rights enforcement officers at the Department of Education. There was no need to lease out oil-drilling rights in a national park in order to pay for an aircraft carrier. Failing to win a consensus for the revolutions of the 1960s, Washington instead bought off through tax cuts those who stood to lose from them. Americans would delude themselves for decades that there was something natural about this arrangement. It was an age of entitlement.

Periods of fiscal irresponsibility are often not immediately recognizable as such. Outwardly they can even look like golden ages of prosperity, because very large sums dedicated to investment are freed up for consumption. That is exactly what the standard Solow growth model and other economic descriptions of investment predict. Societies can even go through periods of extraordinary material and cultural radiance when they are on the verge of bankruptcy.

A writer can only marvel at the beauty and variety of electric typewriters that were available to the American public in the 1980s, just before word processing programs would doom them forever: Underwood, Smith Corona, Royal, Remington, Olivetti, and the IBM Selectric, elegant, immovable, authoritative. A reader can only marvel at the quality of newspapers available in the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, before almost all newspapers gave way to ranting opinion websites. They were thick. The biggest New York Times ever, published on September 14, 1987, was 1,612 pages long and weighed 12 pounds. They were thorough, as filled with articles on everything from poetry to politics to philately to philandering as they had been throughout the 20th century, but by the turn of the 21st most of them were in color! Using resources taken from future generations, the Baby Boom generation was briefly able to offer the vision of an easy and indulgent lifestyle, convincing enough to draw vast numbers of people to construct it, like the pyramids or the medieval cathedrals or the railroads.

Immigration, Inequality, and Debt

Draw people it did. collectively, American Baby Boomers cashed out of the economy their forebears had built, shifting the costs of running it not just to different generations but to different parts of the world, through outsourcing and immigration. These, too, are a form of borrowing. Low-wage immigrants subsidize the rich countries they migrate to, and this is especially true of illegal immigrants. They are low-wage precisely because they are outside the legal system. Ultimately, natives pay some kind of “bill” for such labor. Either they invite the laborers into their society, and the costs to natives take the form of overburdened institutions, rapid cultural change, and diluted political power; or they exclude the laborers, and the costs take the form of exploitation, government repression, and bad conscience. Until that bill comes due, immigration must be counted among a country’s “off-balance-sheet liabilities.”

These liabilities are difficult to quantify. Mass immigration can help a confident, growing society undertake large projects—the settlement of the Great Plains, for instance, or the industrialization of America’s cities after the Civil War. But for a mature, settled society, mass immigration can be a poor choice, to the extent that it is a choice at all. Reagan was tasked by voters with undoing those post-1960s changes deemed unsustainable. Mass immigration was one of them, and it stands perhaps as his emblematic failure. Reagan flung open the gates to immigration while stirringly proclaiming a determination to slam them shut. Almost all of Reaganism was like that.

The Hart-Celler immigration reform of 1965 is sometimes overlooked amid the tidal wave of legislation that flowed through Congress that year. It overturned the “national origins” system, passed under the Immigration Act of 1924 and reaffirmed in 1952, that had aimed to keep the ethnic composition of the United States roughly what it was. Even in the mid-1960s, immigrants from Britain and Germany made up more than half of national “quota” immigration—and those countries plus Ireland, Italy, and Poland accounted for almost three quarters.

It is hard to say exactly what the bill’s backers believed they were doing. On one hand, they sang of an America that was triumphing over its historic racism. On the other, they promised even more ardently and solemnly that doing away with national-origin quotas would do nothing to change the American ethnic mix. “Quota immigration under the bill is likely to be more than 80% European,” said its House sponsor, Emanuel Celler.

Once the bill passed, Johnson summoned the Congress to a signing ceremony hundreds of miles away at the foot of the Statue of Liberty, an extravaganza at odds with his soft-pedaling of its importance. “This bill that we will sign today is not a revolutionary bill,” he said. “It does not affect the lives of millions. It will not reshape the structure of our daily lives, or really add importantly to either our wealth or our power.”

He did protest too much. The Hart-Celler bill would alter the demography of the United States. It would also alter the country’s culture, committing the government to cut the link that had made Americans think of themselves for three centuries as, basically, a nation of transplanted Europeans.

“The American Nation returns to the finest of its traditions today,” Johnson said. “The days of unlimited immigration are past.” In fact, those days were past only because of the restrictive laws of 1924—which Johnson was now striking from the books. Johnson’s new attorney general, Nicholas Katzenbach, shared the president’s naïveté. Katzenbach had claimed, more likely from innumeracy than from any intent to deceive, that the new kind of migration would account for precisely “two one-hundredths of 1%” of future population growth. “Without injury or cost,” he proclaimed, “we can now infuse justice into our immigration policy.”

Senator Edward “Ted” Kennedy, younger brother of the slain president, thought this way, too. In shepherding the Hart-Celler bill through the Senate, Kennedy had been just as reckless as Katzenbach and just as wrong as LBJ. “The ethnic mix of this country will not be upset,” he had said. He even named the nine countries that would be the principal beneficiaries of the new open system: China, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Poland, Portugal, Spain, and Yugoslavia. (Of these, only China would figure among the top ten sources of immigrants half a century later.) “The bill will not aggravate unemployment, nor flood the labor market with foreigners, nor cause American citizens to lose their jobs,” he said. “These are myths of the first order.”

But Kennedy added something new to his appeal. Barely a year after his brother’s assassination, he cast the bill’s opponents as unpatriotic and un-American:

Responsible discussion is expected on the provisions of any bill. The charges I have mentioned are highly emotional, irrational, and with little foundation in fact. They are out of line with the obligations of responsible citizenship. They breed hate of our heritage, and fear of a vitality which helped to build America.

Like Katzenbach, who believed that justice could be secured “without injury or cost,” Kennedy had a hard time distinguishing between America’s morals and its interests. It is a confusion that puts one on the road to strife. If morals and interests always coincide, then the person who opposes your interests is probably evil. In Kennedy’s swagger we can see a harbinger of America’s 21st century political culture.

Immigration and the Failure of Democracy

Not only did every promise of the Hart-Celler bill’s sponsors wind up wrong. Even the warnings of the bill’s detractors—excitable pamphlet-pushers like the American Committee on Immigration Policies—underestimated the sea change it would bring. In the three-and-a-half centuries between its discovery and 1965, the United States had received 43 million newcomers (including a quarter-million slaves). In the half-century that followed Hart-Celler, it would get 59 million.

From that perspective, the migration problem that confronted Reagan early in his presidency was still relatively minor. An unintended consequence of the 1965 law was to favor disorderly over orderly immigration. Low-volume European migration had not required a vast rural and border enforcement apparatus, but by the mid-1970s a new kind of immigration was under way. Roughly 3 million illegal immigrants, most of them Latin American agricultural workers in the Southwest, were overburdening public services and making natives uncomfortable.

Even after the Reagan “revolution,” the political parties differed little on immigration. That is how Ted Kennedy, a driving force behind the Hart-Celler law, ended up playing a powerful role in Reagan’s attempts to fix it. In the waning days of the Carter Administration, Kennedy proposed a Select Commission on Immigration and Refugee Policy, chose Notre Dame president Father Theodore Hesburgh to head it, and selected the reading materials that would guide it. Two of the Kennedy commission’s members, Republican Senator Alan Simpson of Wyoming and Democratic Congressman Romano Mazzoli of Kentucky, sponsored the legislation that would become the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA).

Simpson-Mazzoli aimed at a bold compromise. It legalized and offered American citizenship to illegal immigrants who could prove they had been resident in the United States for even the briefest of stays. A Special Agricultural Worker (SAW) program gave permanent residency to workers who could show they had done 60 days of farm work between May 1985 and May 1986, regardless of whether they knew any English or had any understanding of American civics. A quarter-million were estimated to be eligible for the program, but the documentation and testimonials it required were easily counterfeited: 1.3 million wound up using it. Those admitted came to well over 3 million in total.

To keep this easy mass legalization from incentivizing future immigration, the bill proposed shutting down illegal immigration almost entirely. It contained documentation requirements, $123 million in new security funding, and ferocious-looking penalties for businessmen who knowingly hired illegals. Simpson-Mazzoli brought with it the single largest expansion of federal regulatory power since the establishment of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration in 1970.

There was something disquieting about this level of intrusion into the decisions of business owners, even if it had precedents in the New Deal’s National Recovery Administration and in the Civil Rights Act, particularly in affirmative action, which had by then been up and running for more than a decade. That turned out to be the core of the problem. The parts of the law that encouraged immigration—the amnesty, the processing of working papers—were unpopular, but their introduction went smoothly. They were real. The parts that retarded immigration—the border controls, the employer sanctions—were popular, but they proved impossible to enforce. They were fake.

Opponents of mass immigration were inclined to see IRCA as an outright fraud perpetrated on the public. The truth was more complicated. It had to do with a change in the country’s constitutional culture.

The Changing Spirit of Civil Rights

To do away with illegal immigration, Americans would have had to send a strong message, not just in their statutes but in their enforcement practices and their day-to-day behavior, to the effect that illegal immigration, and therefore illegal immigrants, were not welcome. Every poll from the time tells us that Americans intended to convey just such a message. In June 1986, those who wanted less immigration outnumbered those who wanted more of it by 7 to 1 (49 to 7%). Historically, whenever social change began to move too fast, this kind of gruff, coarse, reactionary plurality would “come out of the woodwork.”

Doris Meissner, later the commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, said of the migrants who were in the country illegally, “Everyone assumed they would just leave, that the new employer restrictions would push them out.” That approach to overheated immigration might have worked in a pre-1964 America, but the country had changed. Now there was no woodwork.

Immigration was one of many subjects that were becoming harder to discuss openly. As late as 1975, the Los Angeles Times could still report on economic competition from immigrants, headlining a story “Employers Prefer Workers Who Can Be Exploited, Paid Minuscule Wages, U.S. Officials Say.” That year, 47% of news stories about immigration mentioned its dampening effect on wages. By the turn of the century, only 8% did. In 1976, the Texas Democrat Ann Richards reportedly said, in the course of a campaign for the Travis County commissioners court, “If it takes a man to hire non-union labor, cross picket lines, and work wetbacks then I say thank God for a woman or anyone else who is willing to take over.” It was a sentiment that most Texas liberals of the time would have been proud to avow. By 1990, when Richards made a successful run for governor, “wetback” was an inadmissible slur and the report of the old speech jeopardized her campaign.

In late amendments, the 1986 IRCA bill was filled with language stressing that an employer could be held liable for discriminating on account of national origin. This looked like window dressing, but in the new, post–Civil Rights Act judicial climate, it became the heart of the bill. It turned inside-out the penalties against employers for hiring illegal immigrants. However harsh the “employer sanctions” had originally looked on paper, they required employers to act in ways that civil rights law forbade. An American boss now had more to fear from obeying the immigration law than from flouting it. An INS official sent in 1987 to investigate a factory on Long Island suspected of using illegal labor stressed that he was there “to explain the new immigration law’s provisions on employer sanctions, ‘not enforce them.’” As housing secretary three years later, Jack Kemp sought a waiver that would permit the city of Costa Mesa, California, to offer welfare benefits to the newly arrived, circumventing a legal ban.

In policy terms IRCA is usually described as a mix of successes and failures. In constitutional terms it was a calamity. Presented as a means of getting immigration under control, IRCA wound up mixing explicit incentives to immigrate (via amnesty) with implicit ones (via anti-discrimination law). It provided courts and federal civil rights agencies—both of them staffed with law school graduates and other highly credentialed professionals at the very apex of the American social pyramid—with new grounds for overruling and overriding legislatures and voters on any question that could be cast as a matter of discrimination. That was coming to mean all questions. Every law was turning into an expansion of civil rights law.

In a 1994 referendum, 5 million Californians sought to deny welfare benefits to illegal immigrants, giving the state’s Proposition 187 an 18-point landslide at the polls. But district court judge Mariana Pfaelzer decided they were wrong—on the grounds that limiting state welfare payments amounted to setting immigration policy, which was a prerogative not of the states but of the federal government. And that did it for Prop 187.

The wave of immigrants interacted with the country’s changing legal regime in a way that would make this migration different from the last. Even when it was working best, immigration introduced tensions into the system being built up around civil rights. For one, the success of new immigrants, Harvard sociologist Nathan Glazer noted, provoked “unspoken (and sometimes spoken) criticism” of blacks for their relative slowness to rise. For another, the new migrants were being shepherded into the civil rights system as potential victims of discrimination, not as potential perpetrators of it. Illegal immigrants were attractive to employers because they had fewer rights in the workplace. They were unattractive to the general public because they had more rights in the courtroom.

The rags-to-riches stories of people from the most desperate corners of Asia were similar to those of early immigrant groups. Those stories, often repeated and widely publicized, reunited Americans with the pride they felt in the European melting pot of the early 20th century. In 1983, four years after she had arrived in the United States speaking no English, the Cambodian refugee Linn Yann, whose father had been killed by the Khmer Rouge, won the Zone V spelling bee in Chattanooga, getting “exhilarate” and “rambunctious” right and losing the Chattanooga–Hamilton County finals only when given a word she had not come across in Tennessee: “enchilada.”",1,https://claremontreviewofbooks.com/the-price-of-the-1980s/

Why are any lockdowns still in place anywhere in the United States? The rationale for them was already waning by the close of May. With the riots of the past week, ending them is now a matter of national necessity.

Timid governors and mayors previously calculated that letting the lockdowns run on for a little longer, or phasing them out gradually, was the safe choice. The economic damage couldn’t get too much worse in another week or two, they reasoned, and on the other hand they would be blamed for even the slightest increase in coronavirus deaths if they reversed course too early.

Maintaining the lockdowns is no longer the safe option. Erring on the side of caution now means opening up everything bar nursing homes tomorrow.

Back in February, there was tough talk from some Bernie Sanders supporters that “if Biden gets the nomination, Milwaukee will burn.” Few people really believed that the Democratic National Convention in Wisconsin this August would be like the 1968 convention in Chicago, because Americans have gotten too fat and lazy. Socialists might mouth off on Twitter, but in a First World country like ours, they have too much to lose to really riot.

Then came the lockdowns, and suddenly no one had as much to lose anymore.

The severity of a riot — at a certain point, whether a riot graduates to a revolt — depends on the number of people involved. A rampage of fifty people is qualitatively different from one of five hundred people, or five thousand.

The Los Angeles riots of 1992 were precipitated by a crowd of only about three hundred. The LAPD surrendered the pivotal intersection of Florence and Normandie avenues to a crowd that size on the afternoon of April 29, then came back a few hours later, found a crowd the same size, and fell back again. This signaled to the rioters that the neighborhood would be abandoned to its fate and prompted the mass lawlessness that raged for five days.

There are now more than 40 million unemployed in the United States. Job losses have been concentrated among the young and poor, the kind of people who don’t yet have families and careers to make them circumspect about lawbreaking.

Never before in American history, literally never, has the country had so many people in the combustible demographic of the young and unemployed.

In the face of this unprecedented danger, why are we not giving these people something else to do? For three months, they haven’t been able to go to the gym, pick up girls at a bar, or shout themselves hoarse at a concert. COVID-19 poses less risk to their age bracket than the flu, so why shouldn’t we let them start doing those things again immediately?

Why shouldn’t they go back to work? Not knowing where you’re going to be living in three months, whether you’ll have to crash on couches or if you’ll have any kind of job, is a powerful stimulus to recklessness.

The silver lining of the past week has been the way it has jolted coronavirus worriers out of their lingering anxieties. Most people can now see with their own eyes that nothing bad will happen to them if they stand closer than six feet apart or gather in groups of more than 10, all while data continues to roll in showing the concentration of coronavirus deaths in nursing homes. The idea that ordinary people will be too frightened to go out and get a haircut is ludicrous, and politicians can’t credibly keep barbershops closed after cheering on the protests.

The presence among this week’s rioters of so many college-educated and middle-class people—the sort who would have been too employed to riot in 1968, who probably were too employed to riot six months ago—is highly ominous. We immediately need to reduce the population of potential rioters to ordinary levels, the usual underclass and antifa malcontents, or this year could be worse than 1968.

Much mischief in the world has been averted by the six little words: I can’t, I have work tomorrow. Having somewhere to be in the morning is the best curfew. The lockdowns caused these riots. Ending them can be part of their cure.",1,https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/end-the-lockdowns-now/
22,Andrews,Helen,americanmind,"The case of pornography.

The Supreme Court mostly ruled out censorship of pornography between the 1950s and early 1970s as skin magazines, seedy video stores, and racy novels began to proliferate in mainstream public life. Then along came internet pornography, which the Court also blessed with First Amendment protection in ACLU v. Reno (1997).

We are now over 60 years into our experiment of legalizing pornography and about 20 years into the era of unregulated internet porn. In a report just out from Heritage Foundation, I ask: what have we learned?

More and more every year, if we are willing to look. The most prominent arguments for deregulating pornography came from liberals who demanded a nonjudgmental framework of rights for all. Liberal arguments have been exposed as window dressing for the deeper defenses of pornography from sexual liberationists. Sexual liberationists thought tender monogamous relations were repressive, whereas (they hoped) emancipating sexual diversity and perversity would foster human happiness and freedom.

While their arguments were not totally contradicted by events, liberationists told pernicious half-truths and their reforms yielded inhuman results.

Liberationists and liberals bang the same drum no matter the circumstance, no matter the evidence. Liberals abet liberationists in getting rid of old, supposedly restrictive laws in the name of neutrality. This allows liberationists to sew their new ethic into the fabric of public law and opinion.

Conservatives, meanwhile, are befuddled. Their arguments in support of regulation seem overwrought, if not hysterical. Conservatives must retool in the face of decades of defeat.

Lessons from the First Censorship Debate

Liberals have traditionally drawn their arguments about porn from the First Amendment, which, they believe, protects “free expression” and not just free speech. In the first era of the porn wars, before the internet, they argued that the Constitution as a whole was made for people of fundamentally different views, including different views about what appropriate literature or art was. Some prefer Scarlett Letter, others Fanny Hill (aka Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure). Whatever.

According to liberals, therefore, laws cannot restrict “free expression” unless expression causes “social harms.” William B. Lockhart and Robert C. McClure, two influential University of Minnesota Law professors, supplied the standards for proving social harm under the liberal dispensation in a series of articles during the ’50s. Harms, they argued, must be (a) significant, (b) permanent, and (c) primarily traceable to obscene works in order for those works to be legitimate objects of censorship.

Conservatives defended censorship in the 1950s on this liberal turf and, predictably, they lost. Proponents of censorship like the National Council of Juvenile Court Judges (1954) asserted that pornography caused criminality, “juvenile delinquency” and “acts of violence” including armed robbery, rape, and torture. Scholars such as Fred Wertham in Seduction of the Innocent (1954) asserted the connection between obscene reading material and juvenile crime.

In his famous report on the subject, J. Edgar Hoover affirmed that “we know an overwhelmingly large number of sex crimes are associated with pornography.” Congress established committees during the late 1950s, headed by Democratic Representative Kathryn Granahan in the House of Representatives and Democrat Estes Kefauver in the Senate, to establish the connection between pornographic novels and violent crime. Later, in the 1980s, Attorney General Edwin Meese, author of the last great public effort to take hard-core pornography seriously, issued a report much to the same effect.

Honor must be afforded to these efforts. Concerned to establish that pornography causes social harms which justify regulating it on liberal grounds, conservatives wrongly claimed that pornography directly caused a host of violent crimes. They were laughed out of court until they didn’t even bother trying.

More sophisticated neoconservative critics of liberalism like Harry Clor and Walter Berns thought unregulated pornography harmed society, but not in the ham-fisted way politicos had argued it did. Porn affected people profoundly, they argued, but subtly and indirectly. To end censorship was thus implicitly to promote “self-expression” as opposed to “self-control,” and the supposedly neutral freedoms of liberalism turned out to favor some fundamental views over others.

In the age before widespread acceptance of porn, a legally sanctioned ethic of “self-control” had pointed sexual desire toward marriage. In the age of porn, though, a culture of self-expression encouraged people to see sex as serving pleasure and adult fulfillment instead of enduring, procreative marriage.

Berns and Clor did not win the day. Why? “Self-control” serves some good—and marriage itself was under not a little assault from feminism and sexual liberation theories, among other places. These conservatives thought in terms of “the conditions of freedom”—that is, the social conditions necessary to secure rationality and self-control in a free society. They knew that people had to be rational enough to choose intelligently, but generally they left it up to the people to choose how to live, without prescribing religion or comprehensive good. This respectable, more robust liberalism still mimics the thinner one in subordinating or ignoring the question of what a healthy public teaching on sexuality is and how to enforce it.

Censorship means that some restrictions on freedom serve the interests of happiness and are inseparable from virtue to some extent. These restrictions, based on self-interest rightly understood, expand the vision and interests of democratic citizens—get them to see longer and deeper into their being. Perhaps such an effort cannot succeed without an end like religious faith or marital bliss supported in public opinion.

Lessons from the Internet Era

The 1970s and 1980s seem almost like “the good ol’ days.” Porn was then relatively hard to get and available in clumsy formats. It would almost be a relief, today, to catch one’s son reading Fanny Hill or looking at centerfolds. The game changed when the stigma against censorship met a functioning internet flooded with porn. The ubiquity and compulsive viewing of pornography reveal more clearly its effects. Pornography does not seem to lead to violence or crime. In fact, as today’s libertarian critics of censorship argue, wide consumption of internet pornography coincided with an amazing decline in the number of rapes and violent crimes. This is consistent with the enthusiasms of polymorphous liberationists. The cringey Kronhausens, authors of Pornography and the Law (1958), saw salacious literature as, “more often than not, a safety valve for the sexual deviate and potential sex offender.” Letting off a bit of steam prevents the hydraulic sexual system from exploding. More porn means no BOOM! They claimed to have the patients to prove it.

These defenders of perversity hoped that sexual liberation and frequent release will provide a substitute for virtue or will become the new virtue. Peace, law, and order, they said, would come about when individuals were permitted to indulge sexual fantasies freely. They will not come about through the normal channels of self-control and virtue. Self-control is repression and repression serves authoritarianism or fascism, as Herbert Marcuse held. Occasional masturbation will make a boy less likely to invade Poland!

The following is grounds for deep reflection about male eros: If porn conquers rape and violence, it does so through, metaphorically, emasculating and de-sensitizing men. Pornography has a deadening effect on some men and leads to listlessness, ennui or the spiritual condition of acedia, as Mark Regnerus argues in his book Cheap Sex. Men in this condition become less interested in real women. As a result, many pornography viewers have a more difficult time seeing how sexual assault is different from other assaults. People who watch pornography may shun violence because it is unpleasurable, without genuinely respecting others. Is this progress? Is the porn worth it?

Pascal-Emmanuel Gobry’s recent review article documents these findings. Internet pornography is much more addictive than any previous kind because greater novelty and perversity are always just a click away. This addiction, which as many as half of men suffer from, damages men’s sexuality, their relationships, and the social fabric of which they are a crucial part. Men become less interested in sex with real people (Gobry cites studies showing that erectile dysfunction among men under 40 nears 40%).

As a result, Gobry sees internet pornography as “the new smoking” and “the number one public health challenge in the West today.” Will this smoking gun yield regulation of pornography? Are these deleterious effects, using the formulation from the 1950s which still guides American law, (a) significant, (b) permanent, and (c) primarily traceable to internet pornography? What percent of men would be significant? What does it mean to be primarily traceable? This formulation demands that censors perform impossible feats of scientific jujitsu to restrict a First Amendment freedom. This is the turf conservatives lost the censorship battle on in the 1950s and 1960s. Fighting on that turf is a sure-fire loser.

A Losing Battle

This elite theory of law has, when added to a fast internet, destroyed the conditions for a decent, happy, responsible life—especially among men. Porn is defended as freedom. No one freely chooses pornography addiction, and still today, relatively very few proudly share the details of their role in the pornography industrial complex, whether as consumers or producers. Just as slave owners would have nothing to do with slave traders (as Lincoln observed), porn attorneys would not have their children consort with the scum that head up the porn industry—people who prey on the vulnerability of women and the lust of men. No one hopes that their son or daughter becomes a porn star, though HBO is another thing altogether. The directionless sex idealized in porn is not the story of our lives and is not the story of happiness and virtue.

It is a good sign that we persist in opposing child pornography. Liberationists wanted children to participate in and consume pornography. So Wilhem Reich, author of The Sexual Revolution (1936): “The other ‘morality’ which we reject (abstinence for children and adolescents…etc.) is itself pathological and causes the very chaos it feels called upon to master.” That sentiment was shared among liberationists from Marcuse to the Kronhausens. We consider Reich deranged because children are impressionable and because they might be compromised through repeated exposure. We wish to preserve their innocence for a term. Perhaps, for the same reason, we can be concerned about how porn corrupts adults and especially men.

Our embarrassment and shame are a tip-off that such ground is there to be won—and only this kind of victory is really worth having. Opponents of pornography must subordinate talk of “public health problems” and the “new smoking”—those are arguments used to fight on the liberal turf where, to mix metaphors, the deck is stacked against regulation. Conservatives must make the issue “the conditions of happiness,” not just the “conditions of freedom.” Porn compromises happiness and love—and a free people can, in the interests of happiness, restrain itself through legitimate laws. Porn is a sign of decadence for a great people, not a sign of virtue and health.

A political market exists to connect the decadence of pornography with the great populist movements afoot throughout the West because the issue concerns how freedom and happiness diverge. People may find pornography exciting, but they do not at the same time find it satisfying. That is the opening.",1,https://americanmind.org/features/obscenity-blindness/sexual-suicide-again/
23,Andrews,Helen,theamericanconservative,"Civil Defense Billboard with old cars in front (Photo by Gary Leonard/Corbis via Getty Images)

In February 1960, Gov. Nelson Rockefeller proposed a bill in the New York state legislature that would have required every home in the state to have a fallout shelter. The cost would have been exorbitant, up to two thousand dollars per shelter at a time when the median household income was $5,600 and all borne by the homeowner, minus some tax breaks, but the rationale then was the same as it is now: You can’t put a price on averting mass death.

Duck-and-cover drills are the element of civil defense that survives in the public memory, but in fact civil defense was a wide-ranging multi-billion-dollar program that spanned every decade of the Cold War. Shelters were subsidized and stocked, pamphlets were produced on everything from how to stay fit during long confinement to how to wash your hands to remove radioactive particles. Dog tags were distributed to millions of schoolchildren listing their name, address, and blood type.

But although they weren’t the most important part of civil defense, duck-and-cover drills are a good stand-in for the broader program, because the one thing everyone remembers about them today was equally true of the rest: The purpose was more psychological than practical.

Short of a massive system of ventilated tunnels thousands of feet underground, no system of civil defense could have made any difference in a real thermonuclear war. In the large cities most likely to be targeted, huddling in a basement would offer no protection to anyone. Further out, survivors would at best earn a short reprieve before dying of starvation, fallout, and water contamination. Senator Stephen Young of Ohio put it very simply in 1961: “In the nuclear age, there can be no realistic civil defense program.”

Yet it felt wrong to do nothing. Eminent scientists like Andrei Sakharov, who obviously knew something about nuclear physics, estimated that over 500,000 people worldwide would be killed or made seriously ill by each above-ground nuclear test, never mind a deliberate attack. To counteract such pessimism, equally eminent scientists were found to offer estimates of how many deaths could be averted by preventive measures. A 1961 cover of Life magazine claimed “97 Out of 100 People Can Be Saved” in a nuclear war and was accompanied by a letter of endorsement from President John F. Kennedy: “I urge you read and consider seriously the contents of this issue.”

Those estimates were bunk. The people repeating them knew they were bunk. Even as the Kennedy administration was subsidizing fallout shelters across the country, everyone in the White House from JFK and Ted Sorensen down knew that people would not be saved by them, certainly not 97 out of 100. Newer, more destructive bombs made even advanced shelters obsolete almost as soon as they were built. Nevertheless, people who questioned civil defense were publicly denigrated by Cold Warriors as pacifists and unilateral disarmers.

There were pacifists among the earliest civil defense protesters. Dorothy Day of the Catholic Worker was arrested repeatedly in the 1950s for refusing to take shelter during air-raid drills. But skeptics also included hard-nosed conservatives like military reporter Hanson Baldwin of the New York Times, who understood that fallout shelters did nothing to improve anyone’s chances of survival. In 1962, cities from Portland to Wichita began to cancel their civil defense drills. It wasn’t because they did not take nuclear threat seriously. These local public servants, though not as well-credentialed as the boffins at the Rand Corporation, had enough sense to realize that the rationale behind civil defense did not add up.

The most surprising protesters, and the ones most relevant in the days of covid-19, were the housewives.

Every summer from 1954 to 1961, America’s largest cities participated in Operation Alert, a nationwide rehearsal for a nuclear attack. Policemen cleared evacuation routes and volunteers hustled civilians into basements and subway tunnels. Anyone who stayed out of doors could be ticketed or arrested. Times Square was eerily empty in broad daylight, just as it is now.

Mary Sharmat, a 24-year-old New Yorker and the daughter of a Republican naval officer, hated the whole idea. She knew that her home in Manhattan would be pulverized in the first wave of attacks no matter what she did, and she also did not like the idea of a drill designed to instill fear. So on April 15, 1959, she drew out all her savings, gave it to her husband for bail money, and took a seat on a bench in the center island of 86th and Broadway with her six-month-old son.

At 12:00, the siren started blowing. I sat. Men in little white helmets came out of doorways and frantically ordered people to take cover… A man came to me and Jimmy. He demanded that I take shelter. I said, “I cannot take shelter. I do not believe in this.” He said, “You are nuts.” … Another Civil Defense man came over to argue sense to me and he screamed over the sirens and I just kept repeating, “This is wrong, I refuse to take cover.”

Across town, 21-year-old Janice Smith was arrested in City Hall Park for refusing to take shelter. “All these drills do are scare birds, babies, and old ladies,” she told reporters as she was led away. “I will not raise my children to go underground.”

The two women eventually joined up and launched a coordinated annual protest against Operation Alert that, by 1961, drew 1,800 demonstrators to the main protest at City Hall Park. Operation Alert was cancelled after that year.

“The reasons for my decision were not scientific,” Sharmat admitted of her first protest in 1959, and she was right. Opponents of civil defense were in many ways less rational than its supporters. The particular measures being rehearsed might not save any lives, but in some circumstances they conceivably might, and anyway the psychological effects were real and, one could argue, salutary. They replaced fatalism and lethargy with a sense of resolve and preparedness. Moreover, it cost civilians nothing. It’s fifteen minutes in a subway station — what do you have to lose? Why, except sheer stubbornness, would anyone refuse to comply?

These are the arguments we hear today for wearing masks. The medical case for their use against coronavirus is far from conclusive and, in the case of outdoor spread, practically nonexistent. Dr. Anthony Fauci himself told 60 Minutes in March, “There’s no reason to be walking around with a mask.” But proponents say that when the risk is life or death, anything that might have the slightest chance of helping is worth it. Even if masks turn out to be merely symbolic, they symbolize good things: solidarity, preparedness, a can-do spirit.

That’s how many people saw Operation Alert — but not Sharmat and Smith. Where others saw civilian participants as resolute and proactive, they saw fear and conformity. Stated in bald terms, their position could sound morbid: In a nuclear attack, millions will die, and the responsible thing is to accept that rather than pretend we can avert it. But it was how they felt. Refusing to be afraid was for them a matter of dignity. “I will not raise my children to go underground.”

A more exact parallel for masks, in Cold War terms, would be the dog tags given to schoolchildren and recommended by civil defense authorities even for adults. In an actual war, they could be highly useful. Without them, parents might never know if their child was dead or alive. They cost pennies to make, and often the school board paid that. Wearing them cost nothing.

Dog tags offered potentially massive payoff for effectively zero cost — except, of course, symbolically. They would be a totem of death around everyone’s neck, a constant reminder to be afraid. Even a parent who took the nuclear threat seriously might balk at that.

Would you have forced your children to wear dog tags in those years when nuclear war was a real and present danger? Would you have worn them yourself? If the answer is no, then you should be able to understand those who today resist mandatory masks, both for their practical shortcomings and for what they symbolize. At a certain point one must refuse to live in fear, even when dangers are real.",1,https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/are-mandatory-masks-the-new-duck-and-cover/
24,Andrews,Helen,intellectualtakeout,"Too few have learned about the horrors of communism. Fewer still have escaped it and lived to tell the tale.

Amy Phan West is one such survivor. In 1984, Phan escaped Vietnam’s communist dictatorship by concealing herself in the bottom of one of her father’s fishing vessels before it set out to sea.

Escape wasn’t a question of political preference for Phan and her family. It was one of survival.

In a recent interview with Young Americans Against Socialism (YAAS), Phan told how her grandfather was shot 16 times while laying on her father’s lap.

“My dad told my mom, ‘We can’t have a future in Vietnam. So we have to leave Vietnam because we will die in the hands of the communists,’” says Phan, an entrepreneur who now lives in America.

Meet Amy. 🇺🇸

Now she’s a small business owner in the United States of America.

Before the communist takeover, Phan’s mother and father made a living by fishing. They made enough to feed themselves and put a roof over the heads of their small family, which also included Phan’s twin brother and her younger sister. Phan said life was “beautiful and nice” in Vietnam for a time. Things changed quickly, however, under the communist regime.

“Once the communists took over, everything that [my parents] fished they had to give to the communists, the government,” said Phan. “And if they don’t do it, they make an example of them. Bury them alive.”

Phan’s father realized his family could not survive in Vietnam. So one day he hid them all underneath his fishing boat and set out to sea, taking with them all the food, water, and clothes they possessed. After three days at sea, the family ran out of fresh water. They were saved when they encountered a German oil tanker. The crew took them in, gave them food and water, and eventually carried them to a refugee camp in Thailand.

The conditions at the refugee camp were poor, but eventually Phan and her family were granted asylum in America. But the horrors of communism continue to haunt her.

“I’ve seen women and children raped and thrown overboard on a fishing boat,” Phan says. “I’ve seen people die because of starvation … and eating flesh to survive.”

Phan says she has no wish to relive that experience, and her message to young Americans is simple: cherish and protect the Constitution.

“Right now in America, we still have freedom. We still have freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom to bear arms,” Phan says.”We have freedom to be entrepreneurs, freedom to free market.”

Pointing to freedom in retreat in nations around the world such as North Korea, Venezuela, and China, Phan says Americans must not take these freedoms for granted.

“This country is great because of our Constitution,” Phan says. “So we have to fight and we have to [preserve] that. If we don’t, we will lose it all.”

As moving and powerful as Phan’s story is, many FEE readers will recognize that the horrors of which she speaks are, tragically, not unique.

As Ilya Somin of George Mason University pointed out in a 2017 Washington Post article, communist states killed as many as 100 million people collectively during the 20th century, more than all other totalitarian regimes combined during that period (hyperlinks added):

In China alone, Mao Zedong’s Great Leap Forward led to a man-made famine in which as many as 45 million people perished – the single biggest episode of mass murder in all of world history. In the Soviet Union, Joseph Stalin’s collectivization – which served as a model for similar efforts in China and elsewhere – took some 6 to 10 million lives. Mass famines occurred in many other communist regimes, ranging from North Korea to Ethiopia. In each of these cases, communist rulers were well aware that their policies were causing mass death, and in each, they persisted nonetheless, often because they considered the extermination of “Kulak” peasants a feature rather than a bug. While collectivization was the single biggest killer, communist regimes also engaged in other forms of mass murder on an epic scale. Millions died in slave labor camps, such as the USSR’s Gulag system and its equivalents elsewhere. Many others were killed in more conventional mass executions, such as those of Stalin’s Great Purge, and the “Killing Fields” of Cambodia. The injustices of communism were not limited to mass murder alone. Even those fortunate enough to survive still were subjected to severe repression, including violations of freedom of speech, freedom of religion, loss of property rights, and the criminalization of ordinary economic activity. No previous tyranny sought such complete control over nearly every aspect of people’s lives.

Read the last sentence again: No previous tyranny sought such complete control over nearly every aspect of people’s lives.

Somin gets at the heart of Marxism here. While many see socialism as a philosophy of compassion, the ideology is pregnant with the desire to control others. To be sure, many seek to use this control for noble ends. Eliminate poverty. Reduce inequality. But as FEE founder Leonard Read observed in his classic work Let Freedom Reign, “the bloom pre-exists in the seed.”

This was Read’s way of saying we must look at the means we use, not just the ends we seek.

Ends, goals, aims are but the hope for things to come…They are not a part of the reality… from which may safely be taken the standards for right conduct. They are no more to be trusted as bench marks than are day dreams or flights of fancy. Many of the most monstrous deeds in human history have been perpetrated in the name of doing good—in pursuit of some 'noble' goal. They illustrate the fallacy that the end justifies the means.

FEE’s archives are filled with articles chronicling the horrors of Marxism, from the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 to the tragic collapse that continues today in socialist Venezuela. There are accounts of others who, like Phan, escaped communism only to find the seeds of its rebirth here in America. Some of them are doing their part to help Americans understand socialism and freedom.

It’s a cliché, but sometimes clichés are true: freedom is not free.

If Americans forget this crucial truth, we may one day learn the bitter truth of socialism that Phan and so many others were forced to endure. Phan, at least, appears determined to never that happen.

“If you hear my voice today, this is it,” she said. “Never, never surrender your Second Amendment. Because once you do, they’ll bury you alive.”

26,Andrews,Helen,intellectualtakeout,"Former First Lady Michelle Obama is the most admired woman in the world. Since leaving the White House, she and her husband, former President Barack Obama have earned tens of millions of dollars. Her memoir Becoming topped bestseller lists around the world. She hobnobs with royalty, celebrities, and statesmen. Last year, the couple bought a $12 million mansion on Martha’s Vineyard. They also own houses in Chicago and Washington, D.C.

As it turns out, none of that is good enough.

Michelle says she was forced to give up her “aspirations and dreams” when she and Barack welcomed their daughters, Sasha and Malia.

“My relationship with Barack was all about our partnership,” she said. “If I was going to have an equal voice with this very opinionated man, I had to get myself up. I had to set myself off to a place where I was confident that I was going to be his equal. The thing that really changed it was the birth of our children. I wasn’t really ready for that. That really made it harder. Something had to give, and it was my aspirations and dreams.”

She added, “I made that concession not because he said, ‘You have to quit your job,’ but it felt like ‘I can’t do all of this, so I have to tone down my aspirations, I have to dial it back.’”

She made these remarks in a new documentary about herself titled – like her book – Becoming. It’s the first release in a massive production deal the Obamas signed with online streaming service Netflix. The exact value of the deal is unknown but it is estimated at upwards of $100 million. This is in addition to the $65 million the Obamas were jointly paid for their memoirs.

That fact alone disproves Michelle Obama’s words. This woman is being paid millions to tell us that she was forced to give up her dreams. How can viewers keep a straight face?

In many ways, Michelle and Barack Obama are a great advertisement for a more traditional marriage. She helped further his political ambitions, and the arrangement paid her back in spades.

The Obamas’ massive fortune testifies to that. But Barack’s electoral success actually put Michelle in a much better position to pursue her aspirations and dreams. As First Lady, she could promote causes she believed in and make a real difference. Now as an international celebrity, she is free to do whatever she pleases.

She did not have the “hard power” of the presidency but that also spared her a great deal of the criticism that her husband - as a politician - received. First Ladies are usually more popular than their husbands, and Michelle is no exception.

Michelle’s comments go beyond simple hypocrisy. She tries to score points with her husband’s socially progressive voting base. She suggests a woman cannot be an “equal partner” in her marriage if she takes on a more traditional gender role. That’s false. She also disparages motherhood as a “concession.” In fact, for many women, their aspiration and dream is to have a happy marriage and children – like Michelle.

Unfortunately, traditional marriage and family are noxious to social progressives – feminists in particular. The idea that a woman could be happy and fulfilled by prioritizing her husband’s career over her own is offensive.

As G.K. Chesterton once observed, “[Feminism] is mixed up with a muddled idea that women are free when they serve their employers but slaves when they help their husbands.”

Try to imagine Michelle telling young girls something like: “You should marry a guy with a lot of potential and then help him rise to the top. You can enjoy the benefits of his success.” It’s unthinkable. Even though that’s exactly the path she followed.

Moreover, many of the couples in Barack and Michelle’s rarefied social circle probably did the same thing. A recent study found that most top male earners have a wife who stays home. These elites live very different lives personally than what they promote for the rest of America.

When Michelle Obama encourages other women to put their own aspirations ahead of their family, what she’s really telling them is: “Do as I say, not as I do.”

27,Andrews,Helen,intellectualtakeout,"How will the coronavirus pandemic affect marriages? This has been a matter for speculation in the media since lockdowns began. Looking out my window or taking walks to the local park during the past few weeks (as Kiwis have been able to do all along) and seeing many couples happily walking or cycling with their children, I would say it is doing some marriages good. Some have said openly on television that they have enjoyed the family time bonus.

It is plausible, however, that where there is friction or staleness in a marriage, confinement may make things worse. But then again, the economic fallout of lockdowns, including mass unemployment, may be an incentive to stick together – for security, at least.

More predictable, says W. Bradford Wilcox, a professor of sociology and director of the National Marriage Project at the University of Virginia, is that economic insecurity will discourage even more people from marrying in the first place. Marriage rates have been steadily falling across the developed world since 1970. In the U.S. the rate ticked up a little between 2014 and 2016, but new census figures show an all-time low in 2018.

Wilcox estimates that around a third of American adults today will never marry. This is “a new kind of milestone in American life, and it’s unfortunate because marriage obviously gives meaning purpose happiness and solidarity to most of the men and women who marry in America.”

And yet there could be a silver lining to the COVID cloud, he suggested in a great webinar (see video below) last week with Eli Finkel, a professor of psychology and of management and organizations at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University and director the Relationships and Motivation Lab.

Coronavirus, says Wilcox, could kill off or severely weaken the hold of the “soulmate myth” of marriage that took hold from the 1970s onwards. This is “the idea that marriage is primarily about an intense emotional connection between two people that should last only so long as that connection remains happy, fulfilling and life-giving to the self.”

It is an idea that has opened up an ominous marriage gap in America and elsewhere, on the upside of which is the educated elite who still marry and stay married, and on the downside, increasing numbers of ordinary people who aspire to a soulmate marriage but for whom the model doesn’t work, at the expense of their own happiness and that of their children. Wilcox would like to see it laid to rest, and a return to a more family-centered idea of marriage.

In that way, he argues, married couples would emerge from the COVID era in a better financial and emotional state, and marriage is likely to be a more secure harbor for their children.

Coming from a liberal position on social issues, Finkel nevertheless agrees that the soulmate model does not work for a lot of people, in particular those who do not have the educational, financial and other “resources” to achieve the desired personal fulfillment in marriage.

Those who do have the resources to meet that expectation have “the best marriages the world has ever seen”. Their achievements correlate with high levels of personal happiness – an effect that is twice as strong today as in 1980. Finkel has written about his research on this topic in The All or Nothing Marriage: How the Best Marriages Work (2018) which explores contemporary marriage in relation to Maslow’s hierarchy of needs — usually represented as a pyramid, with the most basic needs at the bottom and self-realization at the top.

But even those at the summit of “Maslow’s Mountain” could be asking too much of marriage, says Finkel. People at every level need strategies – usually quite simple – and other people who can meet some of the expectations.

Wilcox agrees that married couples need others – extended family, close friends, church community and so on; but his conversation with Finkel reveals some fundamental differences.

The psychologist’s view of marriage seems to be, in the end, individualistic: the happiness and stability of family life depends on the spouses being able to satisfy their own high expectations – although a focus on meaning and purpose will allow some couples to transcend the self. He is unwilling to say, therefore, that marriage is the only, or even the best path for family life.

The family scholar, on the other hand, comes from the perspective of virtue – self-giving, generosity, service of the spouse and children – as a path to communion and “peak happiness”. A path, by the way, achievable by people even with fewer resources.

Wilcox also bases his view on the intuition and the evidence that marriage is the best environment for children (except where there is high conflict) and that society should let the younger generation know this. At present, he points out, the educated elite base their own family life on marriage, while allowing public schools, universities, the media and pop culture to tell stories that undermine it, that are not truthful.

Unless society starts telling the truth about marriage, the marriage gap will continue to widen, depriving couples and children of the emotional and financial benefits.

This is an important dialogue that needs to continue.

28,Andrews,Helen,intellectualtakeout,"A friend of mine who traveled China from the 1970s until recently described what the country was like 30 years ago:

Its cities were sprawling, impoverished places with dirt roads and low-rise structures. With few automobiles in the country back then, the Chinese people got around mostly by rickshaws and bicycles. The country had only a few tall buildings and just two sizable airports, in Beijing, its capital, and Shanghai, its financial center. China had no modern highways, bridges or high-speed rails, and the only trains that traversed the country were pulled by antiquated steam engines.

To get an idea of how much things have changed, please watch this 40-second clip of the Chinese city where COVID-19 originated. As the video shows, Wuhan bears no resemblance to the backward, desperately poor place it was just three decades ago. The same is true of cities throughout China.

Over the past 30 years, China has undergone a stupendous, caterpillar-to-butterfly transformation that has created some of the world’s most eye-popping roadways, bridges and architecture. Now within sight of overtaking the United States as the world’s dominant economy, China has also built a massively lethal military that poses a serious threat to America’s long-standing combat superiority – as reported by The Washington Times, China’s military is forcing the Pentagon to confront the end of U.S. battlefield dominance.

How Did This Happen?

From where did the money come that funded China’s dramatic makeover from a Third World backwater to an economic and military superpower? Trillions of dollars used to finance its spectacular ascendancy was handed willingly over by its greatest patron: the United States of America.

Since the late 1980s, China has been allowed – allowed – to extract trillions of dollars from the U.S. economy in the form of massive trade surpluses. As a result, the communist nation now has glistening cities like Beijing, Shanghai, and Wuhan, while America is saddled with fading cities like Baltimore, Detroit, and Atlanta, once-thriving metropolises now marred by urban blight, rampant crime, sorry schools, generational poverty and other canaries in the coal mine of a nation in decline.

And to rub salt in America’s self-inflicted wounds, Chinese nationals who were allowed – allowed – to attend our top research universities and work at our most sensitive high-tech companies robbed America blind, surreptitiously sending many of our nation’s most vital technological and national defense secrets to our communist adversary hell-bent on chopping America off at the knees.

During the presidencies of George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, China was allowed – allowed – to rip America a new one in what will go down as the most lopsided trade and stolen technology bludgeoning in history.

But don’t blame China for the trade imbalances. Its leaders were just doing what a nation’s leaders are expected to do: negotiate the best deal they could get. If the country on the other side of the table is willing to absorb an epic thrashing in the process, so much the better. And the voluntary thrashing America took lasted 28 consecutive years, from 1989 to 2017, a period when much of America’s manufacturing base was allowed – allowed – to sell-out its workers by offshoring production to China.

With America’s worn-out infrastructure badly in need of replacement, our political class instead ran up crushing debt and deficits, squandering trillions of dollars stolen from future generations on endless foreign wars and failed social programs. Meanwhile, China was using its trade-surplus windfall and stolen technology to build some of the world’s most impressive cities and a fearsome military.

In 2017, the United States began a strategic shift in its approach to China. Unless its relationship with the communist superpower is redefined, America’s days in the sun will be over, and the 21st century will be known as the “Chinese Century.”

Finally, my friend believes America’s best days are behind it. Having done business throughout China, he observed that Chinese workers are intensely proud of their country, eagerly working as tirelessly as a colony of ants toward a common goal of national ascendancy.

America once was blessed with widespread patriotism, but over the last half-century, it has been polarized into two camps with diametrically opposite objectives. One side believes America should continue as a two-party constitutional democracy, the other wants that system scrapped in favor of single-party socialist rule.

No matter which of those hardened positions gains ground in November, half of America will continue working at cross purposes with the other half. A country at irreconcilable odds with itself is not a recipe for national ascendancy; it’s a recipe for national decline. The winner? China.

29,Andrews,Helen,intellectualtakeout,"At an April 23 press conference, Gov. Andrew Cuomo sounded indignant when a reporter asked if anyone had objected to New York’s policy of forcing nursing homes to admit recently discharged COVID-19 patients.

“They don’t have the right to object,” Cuomo answered before the reporter finished his question. “That is the rule, and that is the regulation, and they have to comply with it.”

New York isn’t the only state to adopt a policy ordering long-term care facilities to admit COVID-19-infected patients discharged from hospitals. New Jersey, Massachusetts, and California – three states also hit particularly hard by the novel coronavirus – passed similar policies to free up hospital beds to make room for sicker patients.

The practice is coming under increased scrutiny by health experts and family members of deceased patients who say the orders needlessly put the most susceptible populations at risk.

“The whole thing has just been handled awfully ... by everybody in regard to nursing homes,” said Kathleen Cole, a nurse who recently lost her 89-year-old mother who lived at Ferncliff Nursing Home in Rhinebeck, New York. “It’s like a slaughterhouse at these places.”

Cole, who shared her story with the Bucks County Courier Times, told the paper her mother, Dolores McGoldrick, became infected with COVID-19 on April 2 after Ferncliff re-admitted a resident who had been discharged in late March. Two weeks later her mother, a former school teacher, was dead.

McGoldrick is one of nearly five thousand COVID-19 victims who died in New York nursing homes, according to new figures from The New York Times. New York’s high nursing home death toll is not an outlier. California recently released data showing that some 40 percent of California’s COVID-19 fatalities have come from eldercare homes. In Pennsylvania, nursing homes account for 65 percent of COVID-19 deaths. Both states, like New York, had orders in place that required nursing homes to admit recently released COVID-19 patients.

These results are not surprising to some. Health experts and trade associations had warned early on that forcing nursing homes to take on newly discharged COVID-19 patients was a recipe for disaster, noting that such facilities didn’t have the ability to properly quarantine the infected.

“This approach will introduce the highly contagious virus into more nursing homes. There will be more hospitalizations for nursing home residents who need ventilator care and ultimately, a higher number of deaths. Issuing such an order is a mistake and there is a better solution,” American Health Care Association President and CEO Mark Parkinson announced in March after New York’s order went into effect.

David Grabowski, a professor of health policy at Harvard Medical School, sounded incredulous when asked about the policy.

“Nursing homes are working so hard to keep the virus out, and now we’re going to be introducing new COVID-positive patients?” Grabowski told NBC.

Richard Mollot, executive director of the Long Term Care Community Coalition in New York, echoed that sentiment.

“To have a mandate that nursing homes accept COVID-19 patients has put many people in grave danger,” Mollot told the Bucks County Courier Times.

The question, of course, is why states began ordering nursing homes to take in COVID-19 infected residents. The one thing we know of COVID-19, and have known from the beginning, is that the virus is particularly deadly for the elderly and people with compromised immune systems.

State leaders will have to answer that question themselves. But one answer might be that central planning is inherently irrational.

The Nobel Prize-winning economist F.A. Hayek observed that the problem with trying to centrally plan economies and other complex social orders is that central planners cannot possibly access, comprehend, and weigh the vast amount of information relevant to their sweeping decisions.

The only way to cope with this “knowledge problem” is by bringing to bear the special knowledge that each individual has about the matters he or she is intimately familiar with. And that can only happen through decentralized processes, like the market price system.

This lesson has been lost on many, but particularly so on politicians and bureaucrats who imagine they possess the knowledge to design a more perfect social order. As Hayek famously explained in The Fatal Conceit:

The curious task of economics is to demonstrate to men how little they really know about what they imagine they can design. To the naive mind that can conceive of order only as the product of deliberate arrangement, it may seem absurd that in complex conditions order, and adaptation to the unknown, can be achieved more effectively by decentralizing decisions and that a division of authority will actually extend the possibility of overall order. Yet that decentralization actually leads to more information being taken into account.

This is why individuals are more competent decision-makers about their own affairs than governments. For this reason, a society that removes decision-making from individuals and places it in the hands of central planners invites disorder and endangerment, the economist Thomas Sowell has observed.

""It is hard to imagine a more stupid or more dangerous way of making decisions than by putting those decisions in the hands of people who pay no price for being wrong,"" wrote Sowell.

Media were quick to describe the nursing home tragedy as a “market failure,” pointing out that 70 percent of nursing homes in the US are for-profit. This is hardly a market failure, however. Long-term care facilities saw the danger and warned public officials what would happen.

What were they told?

“That is the rule, and that is the regulation,” Cuomo told them, “and they have to comply with it.”

Gov. Cuomo and other officials responsible for these policies are guilty of Hayek’s fatal conceit. In their hubris, they presumed to know enough to centrally plan a complex society’s response to a complex pandemic, and to know more than individuals with local knowledge, industry expertise, and skin in the game, like the elder care experts and businesspeople who tried to warn policymakers about the disastrous effects the policy would have.

This presumption may stem from another kind of conceit: the dictatorial arrogance on display when Cuomo indignantly insisted that unquestioning compliance was the only appropriate response to his mandate.

Tragically, that conceit was quite literally fatal for many of the most vulnerable members of society.

When the CIA wanted to circumvent possible Chinese bugging of its offices in Beijing in the 1980s, it came up with a voice protector or “hush phone,” essentially two masks with tubes running between them. It worked, but no one would use it. George Shultz said he felt “ludicrous” wearing something that made him look “like Siamese-twin elephants joined at the trunk.” Even during planning for Reagan’s state visit in 1984 when secrecy was essential, staff in Beijing simply refused to use a device that made them sound like Donald Duck.

And good for them. There were logistical reasons to reject the hush phone, like the impossibility of more than two people talking to each other at a time, but there is also something creditable about whatever part of Secretary Shultz said: I am a grown man, and I have some dignity.

Everyone is wondering what life will look like at the end of the month. Lockdown bitter-enders insist that the return to normal will not be like flipping a light switch, to borrow Maryland governor Larry Hogan’s expression. Instead, they say, we will need to spend an indefinite period in a twilight zone of half-freedom where lockdown orders have been lifted but aggressive safety measures remain — a “new normal.”

Based on descriptions of the new normal, I am not sure we should allow ourselves to get used to it. As eager as we are to get the lockdowns over with, we must not let desperation compel us to put up with things we shouldn’t.

Ross Douthat thinks that long lines outside grocery stores of people waiting to come inside and shop “may become a permanent feature of the semi-normal landscape.” That’s absurd, and, like the hush phone, there are both good reasons and gut reasons why.

One-way aisles and occupancy caps don’t do much to stop the spread of disease considering how little transmission takes place between shoppers who pass like ships in the night. Also, queuing down the block for groceries is just too grimly Soviet.

Social distancing measures should remain in place even after schools and businesses reopen, many say. But enforced by whom? Continuing to make cops responsible for enforcing a six-feet-apart rule will only lead to more viral videos like this week’s from New York, which depicts the violent conclusion of what started as a social distancing stop.

The New York City Police Benevolent Association says officers shouldn’t be enforcing “vague guidelines and mixed messages.” It wants the mayor to “get cops out of the social distancing enforcement business altogether.” The PBA is right. The alternative is for Americans to get accustomed to being hustled along by police for the crime of picnicking on the grass or reading a book on a park bench, which would be an ominous thing to start shrugging off.

Australia is making its new normal conditional upon citizens downloading a location-tracking app modeled on Singapore’s. The prime minister insists the app is voluntary, but business groups like Restaurant and Catering Australia are already considering requiring diners and shoppers to download the app before being served.

The government says its goal is for 40 percent of the population to download the app, a target still more than halfway off after its first week in the app store. “Downloading the COVIDSafe app is the major obstacle now between us freeing up a lot of these restrictions in a cautious way,” Prime Minister Scott Morrison said, not disguising the ultimatum.

The last time the Australian government requested emergency permission to track its citizens’ phones was the metadata retention law of 2015. As with COVIDSafe, repeated assurances were made about privacy and civil liberties. Later it was revealed that users’ metadata had been used by local city councils in order to track down litterbugs and other mundane offenders who had nothing to do with the law’s original justification, counter-terrorism.

The United States is not Singapore, and there are certain restrictions on our liberty that we won’t tolerate. A government location-tracking app should be one of them. Such excessive post-lockout safety measures are not needed to deal with a disease that is no longer in danger of overloading our hospital capacity. More importantly, Americans’ gut aversion to being overpoliced is worth preserving. Ordinary aspects of pre-coronavirus life should not be sacrificed in order to give those still attached to the lockdowns a psychological on-ramp or a face-saving pretense that their doomsday forecasts were more accurate than they were.

Except for open plan offices. Ban those permanently, for the good of the nation’s health.",1,https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/post-lockdown-insist-on-the-old-normal/
31,Andrews,Helen,herandrews,"Originally published in the January 2019 issue of First Things.

After a lifetime of impeccably correct opinions, Ian Buruma found himself on the wrong side of the liberal consensus in September 2018, when he was forced to resign as editor of the New York Review of Books for having commissioned a piece called “Reflections from a Hashtag” from the disgraced Canadian broadcaster Jian Ghomeshi. One does not get to be editor of the NYRB without having filament-like sensitivity to the boundaries of acceptable opinion. Buruma’s virtuosic handling in 2007 of the controversy over his New York Times Magazine profile of Tariq Ramadan, in which he wrote indulgently of his subject’s radical Islamic views and scathingly of Ayaan Hirsi Ali’s secularist opposition to them, was a model of politically correct equipoise. If Buruma was caught flat-footed this time, it must be the times that have changed.

Unlike Leon Wieseltier, Lorin Stein, ­Garrison Keillor, John Hockenberry, Ryan Lizza, Glenn Thrush, or any of the other editors and journalists who have lost their jobs in the last twelve months due to the movement known as #MeToo, Buruma was not accused of any sexual misconduct. His crime was to give space in his magazine to a man who had been accused (but not, in any of four court cases, convicted) of sexual harassment and non-consensual roughness during sex. Buruma told Slate in an interview five days before his resignation, “I think nobody has quite figured out what should happen in cases like his, where you have been legally acquitted but you are still judged as undesirable in public opinion, and how far that should go, how long that should last.”

Too true, as Buruma found out to his cost. No one has yet figured out what rules should govern the new frontiers of public shaming that the Internet has opened. New rules are obviously required. Shame is now both global and permanent, to a degree ­unprecedented in human history. No more moving to the next town to escape your bad name. However far you go and however long you wait, your disgrace is only ever a Google search away. Getting a humiliating story into the papers used to require convincing an editor to run it, which meant passing their standards of newsworthiness and corroborating evidence. Those gatekeepers are now gone. Most attempts so far to devise new rules have taken ideology as their starting point: Shaming is okay as long as it’s directed at men by women, the powerless against the powerful. But that doesn’t address what to do afterward, if someone is found to have been wrongfully shamed, or when someone rightfully shamed wants to put his life back together.

In the essay that got Buruma fired, Ghomeshi claims to have been a pioneer in online shaming. “There are lots of guys more hated than me now. But I was the guy everyone hated first.” Actually, a better candidate for original victim is Justine Sacco, the PR executive who tweeted to her 170 Twitter followers before getting on a plane to Cape Town, “Going to Africa. Hope I don’t get AIDS. Just kidding. I’m white!” It was during the Christmas holidays when news is always slow, so a Gawker post about the tweet quickly went viral. People around the world were soon enjoying the suspense of knowing Sacco was on a plane with no Internet access and no way to know that she had become an object of global ridicule. That was in December 2013, almost a year before the Ghomeshi story broke.

And before that, in the Precambrian era of online shaming, there was me.

In October 2010, I appeared on a panel to promote a book of essays by young conservatives, Proud to Be Right: Voices of the Next Conservative Generation. The moderator was Jonah Goldberg. One of the other panelists was my ex-boyfriend Todd Seavey. During the Q&A, Todd launched into a rant about my personal failings. He accused me of opposing Obamacare on the grounds that it would diminish human suffering, which allegedly I preferred to increase; of wanting to repeal laws against fistfights for the same reason; of being a sadistic and scheming heartbreaker in my personal life; and of generally living according to a “disturbing” and “brutal” set of values. For three minutes and forty-five seconds, which, unfortunately for me, were captured on film for broadcast two weeks later on C-SPAN2, he made an impassioned case that I was a sociopath.

Todd is not a psychologist, but a psychologist with no evidence to go on except my treatment of Todd might well have arrived at the same conclusion. I treated him awfully. I can only plead in mitigation that I was twenty-two. Todd is from Connecticut and has that charming New England stolidity, and I behaved as if his patience, which seemed so infinite when we were dating, really had no limits. The bit about opposing Obamacare because I favored human suffering was outlandish, and other parts of his rant were not quite how I remembered things, but everything he said, he really believed, and he had arrived at those beliefs by a hard road.

I braced myself for the broadcast. Maybe no one would notice? Within minutes, the offending clip had been posted on YouTube, where it got half a million hits in the first forty-eight hours. It made the evening news on Washington’s Fox affiliate. Greg Gutfeld did a segment about it on RedEye. It was written up in Gawker, the Washington Post, Talking Points Memo, and a hundred lesser sites, and then written up again when Todd expanded his remarks about me into a ­series of blog posts on his personal website. My inbox exploded with media inquiries, none of which I answered, except to give a short statement to Mary Katharine Ham at the Daily Caller:

I wish I could say it was all a plan hatched by our new media consultant, who told us we had to “think outside the box” to make our C-SPAN panel “go viral,” but no, it is exactly what it looks like. As a matter of policy, I don’t comment on my personal life in public, but I will clarify that his tirade thoroughly mischaracterizes my political views. For instance, I do not believe that laws against assault should be repealed—nor do I think there should be an exception in cases when one’s ex-boyfriend behaves unacceptably on national television, though I admit that’s a tougher question. Nor do I oppose Obamacare for the contorted reason he states. I oppose it for the usual reasons.

To the personal friends who emailed commiserations, I replied with an old Aaron Sorkin line about bad publicity: “It’s like seasickness. You think you’re gonna die, and everyone else just thinks it’s funny.”

That, it turned out, was overly optimistic. Everyone at work was supportive (“if you want us to form the committee to horsewhip todd seavey, just say the word,” one colleague emailed, bless him), but no amount of support could counteract the paranoia that settled in over the next weeks and months. My colleagues probably didn’t believe the woman they worked alongside was secretly a comic-book ­villain—but surely the suspicion had been planted? I never knew whether someone on the subway was giving me a second glance because he knew me, or because he recognized me from the video. Fellow journalists reported back to me from conferences where Todd expatiated on my depravity at length—in one case, before an audience that included my boss. An old friend called to say he had posted a supportive comment about me at the New Republic and shortly after received an email from Todd, who had guessed his identity from his screen name, explaining all the reasons I did not deserve to be defended. I wondered how many such incidents I never heard about.

I tried to process the experience intellectually. I read Lord Jim and The House of Mirth. No grand lesson presented itself, which, in a way, was lucky. It meant there was no ideological interpretation I could superimpose on my experience, which would have slowed my progress toward acceptance by allowing me to indulge in resentment and indignation. I couldn’t tell myself it had happened because I was a woman. Had the genders been reversed, I probably would have received less sympathy than I did. I could not blame society, or C-SPAN, or ­Jonah ­Goldberg. A year and a half later, when I was looking for a new job, I could not even blame the prospective employers who demonstrated a marked reluctance to bring me in for interviews. If I had to choose between a candidate whom no one had ever called a sociopath on national television, and one who probably wasn’t a psycho but might be, I would play it safe, too, even if the probability was only a fraction of a percent.

In 2012, I decided I would rather be Lord Jim than Lily Bart, so I accepted an offer from my boyfriend (now husband) to move with him to Australia—the best decision I ever made. On my last night in New York, in a burst of either sentimentality or bravado, I called Todd. We met in Midtown for a drink, and I found, to my surprise, that there was nothing I particularly wanted to say to him. If I was looking for some kind of closure, I wasn’t ready for it yet. In the end I had only one question for him: When we were chatting in the courtyard before the panel, was it some kind of deliberate foreshadowing when he mentioned how much he always liked Pink Floyd’s The Wall and started singing a song from the album that goes, “Since, my friend, you have revealed your deepest fear, I sentence you to be exposed before your peers”? He said it was just a coincidence.

Moving to the other side of the world did not diminish the video’s place in my life as much as I thought it would. It was still the first result when you Googled my name, which presumably is one reason I couldn’t find a job for the first eighteen months. Eventually, I found a position at a think tank. When I released my first report, an Australian MP tweeted a link to the video and asked why anyone should care about this nutcase’s opinions on regulation. Even after I got married and took my husband’s last name, the video still popped up on social media when I did a TV appearance or had an op-ed in the paper. In 2017, when I moved back to Washington, D.C., and started meeting some of the younger writers in town, it took them less than a week to find the clip and ask me about it. Most of them had been in high school when it happened.

In a funny coincidence, the day I began writing this essay, my husband was attending a conference of free-market activists when his lunch table started talking about bad breakups in the conservative movement. One man pulled out his iPhone and said, “If you want to talk about bad conservative breakups, you have to see this.” He put the phone away when Tim told him that the woman in the video was his wife. That was eight years and twenty-one days since the broadcast first aired.

There is a celebrity fashion blog called Go Fug Yourself that specializes—or specialized back in 2011, the one and only time I visited the site—in unflattering paparazzi shots and red carpet disasters. The odd thing about Go Fug Yourself, I discovered, was that all its nastiest posts featured the same tic. After unloading whatever brutal snark she had for Jennifer Lawrence or whomever, the writer would always include the same disclaimer: A celebrity has one job, and that’s to look glamorous, so if you can’t manage the one thing you owe us in exchange for all the money and fame, then find another line of work, and until then lay off the cheeseburgers and hire a decent stylist. This dime-store Joan Rivers can’t think she’s fooling anyone, I thought as I scrolled through the archives to see if every post really included this lame moral alibi. Her motivation has nothing to do with celebrities falling short of their duty to the public. She’s making fun of ugliness for the same reason anyone does: It stimulates our lizard brains.

People who read the Atlantic are smarter than the readers of Go Fug Yourself, but sometimes smarter people don’t make better decisions; they just come up with better excuses. Kevin Williamson was fired by the Atlantic in April 2018 over an unearthed audio recording in which he said that abortion was a form of murder and should carry the same punishment, up to and including the death penalty. The aspect of the resulting Twitter storm that surprised me was not the way his statement was warped out of context into a defense of lynch justice for pregnant teenagers but the purported concern for his female coworkers. “How can you say that you want a workplace that values women when you hire someone who wants 25% of those women dead?” asked feminist Jessica Valenti. When Williamson’s firing was announced, in a memo that made delicate reference to “the values of our workplace,” Valenti responded, “I am very relieved for the women who work at the magazine.”

At the risk of insulting the reader: No one actually believed Williamson was a threat to his female colleagues. It was only a pretext for what was really an exercise in raw power. People made the same kind of excuses when it was my turn in the dunk tank. Again and again, I read commenters insisting that what might at first glance appear to be prurient gossip was, in fact, fair political commentary, because I was a family-values scold and thus open to charges of hypocrisy, or because I was a hard-core Randian who needed a lesson in the dog-eat-dog heartlessness advocated by my idol. As far as I can tell, these characterizations were extrapolated from the fact that I worked at National Review. Certainly they had no basis in anything I’d written (an Objectivist, really?).

The more online shame cycles you observe, the more obvious the pattern becomes: Everyone comes up with a principled-sounding pretext that serves as a barrier against admitting to themselves that, in fact, all they have really done is joined a mob. Once that barrier is erected, all rules of decency go out the window, but the pretext is almost always a lie. ­Matthew Yglesias once claimed that the reason he mocked David Brooks for his divorce was because Brooks had written columns about the social value of marriage, but I do not believe him. He did it because it’s fun to humiliate your political opponents. Moira Donegan claims that she created the Shitty Media Men List—a clearinghouse of anonymous accusations optimally parked for maximum dissemination in the Google Spreadsheet cloud—for altruistic reasons and with no thought of its being used to hurt anyone, but I do not believe her. If it was about protecting women in media from harassment, then why no attempt to sort the true accusations from the false? Why the coy protestations that “I thought that the document would not be made public,” when of course she knew that it would be spread far and wide, or she wouldn’t have bothered creating it?

Donegan’s defenders do not behave like people interested in finding the truth. They stirred up a Twitter mob against Katie Roiphe before her Harper’s piece about the Shitty Media Men List was even published. Claims to be motivated by concern about possible backlash against Donegan, if Roiphe revealed her as the creator of the list, were more than a little disingenuous. Since being outed, Donegan has gotten a book deal with Simon & Schuster and a regular column in the Guardian, which is precisely what anyone could have predicted. When John Hockenberry, also in Harper’s, wrote about his experience being #MeToo’d out of his job at NPR, admitting some charges and explaining why he thought others were bogus, his detractors did not bother refuting his case. They simply ridiculed him. No one has offered him a book deal.

In Trust Me, I’m Lying: Confessions of a Media Manipulator, Ryan Holiday’s memoir of his years as a PR consultant, he describes a roundtable meeting at the Huffington Post where the editors discussed how a certain big company should have handled its recent PR crisis. The editors offered the usual bromides: “Transparency is critical.” “Be proactive.” “Get out in front of it.” Holiday replied, “None of you know what you’re talking about.” The old rules don’t apply in the free-for-all world of online journalism, and they especially don’t work when the figure at the center of the controversy is one lonely individual. If a client came to him because he was being called a racist or sexist on Twitter, Holiday says (pardon the vulgarity), “I would tell him to bend over and take it. And then I’d apologize. I’d tell him the whole system is broken and evil, and I’m sorry it’s attacking him. But there’s nothing that can be done.”

Any attempt to defend yourself or clarify your original remarks is “the equivalent of a squeaky cry of, ‘Why is everyone making fun of me?!’ on the playground,” Holiday says. “Whether it happens in front of snarky blogs or a real-life bully, the result is the same: Everyone makes fun of you even more.” The idea that online shaming is a form of debate—or in any way oriented toward finding the truth—is a delusion. Dialogue is not the point. The day Brett ­Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, the New Yorker—not Gawker, but the New Yorker—ran thirty-two Kavanaugh headlines in twenty-four hours, many of them on the subject of the nominee’s supposed whininess: “The Tears of Brett Kavanaugh”; “An Angry, Tearful Opening”; “Brett Kavanaugh’s ­Damaging, Revealing Partisan Bitterness”; “A Grotesque Display of Patriarchal Resentment.” The man had been accused of being a brutal rapist, and the most prestigious magazine in America ridiculed him for responding to the allegation as any innocent man would have. No, dialogue is not the point.

When I was debating whether or not to write this essay, which, after all, revisits an unpleasant incident that has long been at least semi-­dormant, if not quite forgotten, I saw a headline in the New York Times: “His Body Was Behind the Wheel a Week Before It Was Discovered.” The man, Geoffrey Corbis, had committed suicide in a parked car in the East Village. Only his name wasn’t really Geoffrey Corbis, the Times explained. He had been born Geoffrey Weglarz. He changed it after an incident in 2013 at a ­McDonald’s near his home in Connecticut, when he threw a sandwich at a pregnant server who had given him the wrong order. Newspaper coverage of this funny local fracas did not mention Weglarz’s recent divorce or long-term unemployment after leaving his job as a computer programmer at Dell. He couldn’t find work with the McDonald’s story at the top of his Google results, hence the attempt at a fresh start as Geoffrey Corbis.

It happens more often than you would think. At least half a dozen cases mentioned in Laws of ­Image: Privacy and Publicity in America, ­Samantha Barbas’s 2015 history of shame and libel, end with suicides. Jon Ronson’s So You’ve Been Publicly Shamed describes an English chef living in France who killed himself after his wife-swapping hobby was revealed by the News of the World. It also tells of a rural Welsh preacher who found himself the subject of a photo spread in the same publication for hosting an orgy in his caravan, after which he, too, killed himself. Most victims of public shaming aren’t nationally famous editors like Ian Buruma. They are ordinary folks like “ID Adam,” who lost his job at a box assembly company in Winston-Salem after reports that he racially profiled a black woman at a community pool. It turned out that he, as the pool chair on duty, had asked to see her ID, because, when signing in, she had given an address on a street in the neighborhood where no houses had yet been built. It took him days to get his side of the story into the papers, and it didn’t make him any less fired.

An essay about public shaming should have advice for those people, I thought. When I couldn’t think of any, I called Todd. He had, after all, suffered quite as much from the C-SPAN2 fallout as I had. He left his job at Fox—not right away, but after three months, when he refused to sign a statement from HR saying that such TV appearances were a violation of their “outside media” policy, even though they had never expressed a problem with his extracurricular projects before. Four years later, he returned to the NewsCorp building to film a segment on the Kennedy show, only to be stopped in the lobby by security and told he was on a no-admit list. He makes a living as a ghostwriter now, and his book Libertarianism for Beginners was published to positive reviews in 2016. When I asked if he would do it over again if he had the choice, he said he is now a believer in handling things privately. “In the future, if I get married, if my wife stabs me, you won’t hear me shouting in public about it.”

“Things really can get so much bigger than you and your own efforts that you just kind of have to ride the wave,” Todd said. “I was obscure enough before that any public attention I got was the result of me trying really hard.” He told me he never expected the clip to go as viral as it did, “far beyond my ability to control or even monitor,” which sounded implausible—until I remembered just how unfamiliar these online shame cycles were in the years before Justine Sacco’s tweet. Todd thought he would say his piece—which, in his mind, was not just that I was a bad girlfriend, but that I had a “cruelty-based worldview” that future editors and employers should be warned against unwittingly promoting by giving me work—and that would be that.

Todd’s advice for our fellow-shamed was no better than mine. “When a tsunami is heading for your house, at a certain point you have to say, ‘I’m just gonna stand here and hold this piece of plywood and see what’s left standing when it’s all over.’” Arguing back is no use. “If you’re tweeting, you’re losing.” Even in the immediate aftermath of the C-SPAN2 incident, when Todd attempted on his blog to make his case at length against my evil beliefs, he saw his arguments get lost in the maelstrom, equally ignored by supporters and detractors. If we had a breakthrough in our conversation, that was it: There is no content to a shame storm. It is mindless by its very nature. It is indifferent to truth, even in cases where the truth could possibly be determined. Therefore, like the Ring, it cannot be used for good.

The solution, then, is not to try to make shame storms well targeted, but to make it so they happen as infrequently as possible. Editors should refuse to run stories that have no value except humiliation, and readers should refuse to click on them. It is, after all, the moral equivalent of contributing your rock to a public stoning. We should all develop a robust sense of what is and is not any of our business. Shame can be useful—and even necessary—but it is toxic unless a relationship exists between two people first. A Twitter mob is no more a basis for salutary shaming than an actual mob is for reasoned discussion. That would be true even if the shaming’s relics were not preserved forever by Google, making any kind of rehabilitation impossible.

If Stephen Elliott has his way, would-be shamers will have to consult more than just their consciences. He is suing Moira Donegan for defamation over her media men list, in which his entry reads: “Rape accusations, sexual harassment, coercion, unsolicited invitations to his apartment, a dude who snuck into Binders???” (Binders is a Facebook group for women writers.) What it means to be accused of “rape accusations” will doubtless be clarified at trial. It sounds like the person who wrote this was speaking from rumor herself, which proves how cavalierly career-ending allegations of sexual assault are now thrown around. I have no legal opinion on whether Elliott’s lawsuit will be for #MeToo what Peter Thiel and Hulk Hogan’s heroic lawsuit was for Gawker, but, unless we all begin to respond more responsibly to public shaming, we can expect to see more attempts to (as President Trump put it) “open up our libel laws.”

As for the people who find themselves at the center of an online shaming, I can only report how I made peace with mine. Ironically, the disagreement that gave Todd the idea that I had a “cruelty-based worldview” was over my belief that suffering is sometimes necessary for personal growth, and an essential part of God’s plan for our salvation—a belief that, as a strict utilitarian, Todd completely rejects. We had a dozen fights about it. The irony, of course, is that there is no belief my brush with online shaming confirmed more. I had heard the maxim that there is no humility without humiliation—how true it proved. My first reaction to the video was to feel aggrieved, thinking that I did not deserve what was happening to me, but on the Day of Judgment all my sins will be shouted from the housetops, and Todd’s rant will sound like a retirement luncheon toast in comparison. Of course I deserved it, and worse; most of us poor sinners do.

Of all history’s martyrs to shame, the one whose example consoled me most was Oscar Wilde. He is remembered today as a gay rights pioneer, but, in the letters he wrote after his release from prison, he never rails against the injustice of the law that put him away. He did not think it was a good law, he simply believed that the justice or injustice of the charge against him was irrelevant. What mattered was that he had been rescued from his own pride and selfishness by his experience, when he could not have been saved by any gentler medicine. This lesson, which produced “The Ballad of Reading Gaol” (“I know not whether Laws be right, / Or whether Laws be wrong”), he put into plain prose in a letter written during his exile in July 1897. Sporus was the slave boy that emperor Nero freed and “married”:

To me, suffering seems now a sacramental thing, that makes those whom it touches holy. I think I am in many respects a much better fellow than I was, and I now make no more exorbitant claims on life: I accept everything. I am sure it is all right. I was living a life unworthy of an artist, and though I do not hold with the British view of morals that sets Messalina above Sporus, I see that any materialism in life coarsens the soul, and that the hunger of the body and the appetites of the flesh desecrate always, and often destroy. . . . I learnt many things in prison that were terrible to learn, but I learnt some good lessons that I needed.

The man to whom this letter was addressed was Carlos Blacker, who himself had fled England for France in 1890, when he was accused of being a card cheat. The charge against Blacker happened to be false, just as the charge against Wilde happened to be true, but that made no difference in the two men’s experiences. The truth that Wilde came to understand, which he shared with his fellow exile, was that they should accept their chastening in a spirit of gratitude. Nothing had been taken from them that would not be restored a hundredfold if they allowed their ­experience to do its redemptive work",1,https://herandrews.com/2018/12/11/shame-storm/

Introduction by Terry Clavin

I am nominating Helen Andrews’ fine biography of Henry MacCormac (1800–66), a physician in the Belfast Fever Hospital. Why? Because he was superintendent of a temporary hospital built in preparation for an Asian cholera epidemic that was spreading westwards. (Diseases spread less quickly then – the hospital was completed two years before the epidemic hit Belfast in 1832). He supervised the treatments and strict quarantine measures that ensured Belfast suffered the lowest infection and mortality rate of any city in Ireland and Britain. Furthermore, he went on to perform similar heroics as a consulting physician at the Belfast District Asylum during another cholera epidemic in 1849. These were but two episodes in the distinguished career of this brilliant polymath whose much-mocked advocacy of the health benefits of fresh air influenced the subsequent development of open-air sanatorium treatments for tuberculosis patients. Although he was unappreciated in Ireland during his lifetime, Andrews’ DIB entry makes clear what an inspiring figure he is, particularly for these times.

Henry MacCormac

by Helen Andrews

MacCormac, Henry (1800–86), physician and writer, was born in Carnan, Co. Armagh, fourth among six sons and two daughters of John MacCormac (d. 1811), linen merchant, and Mary MacCormac (née Hall). MacCormac was probably educated at the Royal School, Armagh; the records for this time are unavailable. He studied medicine in Dublin and at the Hôtel-Dieu, Paris, under Guillaume Dupuytren (1777–1845) before graduating LRCS (1824) and MD (1824) from Edinburgh University. He travelled to Africa (1824), visited the Cape of Good Hope, and sailed in a windjammer to Sierra Leone, where his brother, John MacCormac (1794–1865) was a stipendiary magistrate (subsequently chief magistrate and member of the legislative chamber); he explored the remote parts of West Africa for a year and later visited Canada and America.

Around 1828 MacCormac established a practice in Upper Arthur St., Belfast, and was appointed physician (1830) and consulting physician (1836) to the Belfast Fever (later the Royal Victoria) Hospital. In preparation for the Asiatic cholera epidemic spreading westwards from India, the hospital erected a temporary hospital two years before the disease struck Belfast in 1832. MacCormac was appointed superintendent and wisely organised quarantine quarters; he prescribed dilute mineral acids – a widely used treatment till the 1940s – and the city witnessed a lower incidence of infection and mortality from cholera than other cities in Britain or Ireland. The people of Belfast showed their appreciation by presenting MacCormac with a Georgian silver tea service.

On the founding of a medical faculty in the RBAI, MacCormac was appointed professor in the theory and practice of medicine (1837–49) and dean (1840–48); when the faculty was absorbed into QCB in 1849 MacCormac, unlike many of his colleagues, failed to gain a chair. His applications for the chair of medicine at Edinburgh University (1855) and for the chair of materia medica (1857) and medicine (1865) at QCB were equally unsuccessful, possibly because of his perceived eccentricities and dogmatism.

As consulting physician (1849–86) to the Belfast District Asylum (pictured above) for the Insane, he introduced many reforms, including an improved diet, regular exercise, and improved general care and sanitation. When a further cholera epidemic struck Belfast (1849), with an attendant high mortality rate, the asylum was the only public institution to escape death among its patients, which was attributed to improved sanitation and prophylactic doses of dilute sulphuric acid. MacCormac argued for a more humane understanding of the mentally ill, and published several works including Metanoia, a plea for the insane (1861), where he argued that insanity was not a disease of the brain substance but resides in the mind's unconsciousness of its consciousness, thus anticipating Freud and later psychology.

He is best known as a pioneer and tireless advocate in lectures, pamphlets, and books, of fresh air as a means to general health and especially as a prophylactic and cure for tuberculosis; he insisted that his family and his patients slept with open windows, even in sub-zero temperatures, and apparently was once hauled into court for poking his umbrella through the bedroom windows of a patient who refused to open them. He published On the nature, treatment and prevention of pulmonary consumption (1855; revised ed. 1865, 1872), which was translated into French and German; in it, he argued that consumption was avoidable and caused by ‘rebreathed air’ leading to the retention of unconsumed carbonaceous wastes in the lungs, and that effective treatment lay in exposure to the open air. His views were generally considered as eccentric: at a meeting of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society of London (23 April 1861) his thesis was characterised as a waste of time by one member and was refused the customary vote of thanks by the society (Dublin Medical Press, 8 May 1861, p. 334). Elsewhere, especially in Europe, attention was paid to his ideas, which possibly influenced the later practice of the open-air sanatorium treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis. MacCormac subsequently published a pamphlet, The air cure of tubercular consumption as conducted at Davos and the Engadine (1883), addressed to the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society; he reminded them of their verdict and sought acknowledgement of the correctness of his thesis. He tended to have a closed mind to views other than his own, and rejected Robert Koch's demonstration in 1882 of the bacillary cause of tuberculosis, ridiculing Koch's work in Etiology of tubercle, with comments on Doctor Robert Koch's bacillus (1882).

Deeply sympathetic to the poor, he wrote indignantly of the appalling conditions in which they lived, published On the best means of improving the moral and physical condition of the working classes (1830), and gave two hours’ free consultation each day to poor patients. His compassion extended to animals and he devised a plan, published as The painless extinction of life in animals designed for human food (1864). He argued against the capital punishment of murderers: ‘The murderer, we are told, is not fit to live. Is he fit to die? . . . Who among us is entirely fit to live or entirely fit to die?’ (Marshall, 196). His progressive views included the desirability of higher education for women.

Throughout his life MacCormac was a prolific writer, often rising at 4 a.m. and working continuously without a break for four or five hours. His first publication was A treatise on the cause and cure of . . . stammering (1828). Around 1866 he reduced his medical practice and devoted his time to writing. His wide-ranging interests and depth of learning were expressed not only in medical subjects – such as his textbooks, Methodus medendi (1842) and the well received An exposition of the nature, treatment, and prevention of continued fever (1835), in which he questioned the absence of a ministry of health (eventually established in 1919), and bemoaned the lack of recognition of the importance of preventing, as well as treating, disease – but also in philosophy and religion. Untrammelled by any creed, he expressed his faith in the goodness of God and the perfectibility of man in The philosophy of human nature (1847). He translated The meditations of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus . . . with the manual of Epictetus (1844) from the Greek, had knowledge of twenty languages, and at the time of his death, was preparing a dictionary of philology.

A devoted family man, he dedicated many of his books to his relatives and enjoyed an extensive circle of friends. An original and progressive thinker, he received relatively little appreciation in Ireland, but was elected a corresponding member of the National Institution of Washington and the Belgian Medical Academy; a street in Copenhagen was named after him. A father figure of the Ulster medical profession, he died 26 May 1886 at his home, 7 Fisherwick Place, Belfast, and was buried in the city cemetery. In 1892 his son William presented a bust of MacCormac by Shakspere Wood (1827–86) to the Belfast Public Art Gallery and Sir William Whitla donated a figure head to the Ulster Medical Society.

MacCormac married (8 October 1833) Mary Newsam, his cousin; they had two sons and three daughters. Their eldest son, William MacCormac became president of the Royal College of Surgeons of England and was created a baronet; their younger son, John MacCormac (1846–1906) was a director of the Northern Linen Company, Belfast. His daughter married William Burden (1798–1879), first professor of midwifery at QCB. Three of his grandsons became doctors.

33,Andrews,Helen,claremontreviewofbooks,"Here are two sharply different perspectives on the nomination and confirmation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme Court in 2018. Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing was an epic battle. On one side, legal originalists sought to appoint a judge who they believed would interpret cases as the authors of the Constitution intended. On the other, liberals did everything they could to thwart that appointment. Despite their professed reasons, in the last analysis they opposed Kavanaugh because they believe the country has changed so much since 1788 that the Constitution should be reinterpreted to facilitate modern social justice and civil rights projects.

In Justice on Trial: The Kavanaugh Confirmation and the Future of the Supreme Court, Mollie Hemingway and Carrie Severino look back on the Kavanaugh hearings from the standpoint of legally learned moderate conservatives. (Hemingway is a senior editor of the Federalist, while Severino serves as chief counsel for the Judicial Crisis Network, which promotes constitutional rectitude at all levels of government.) They vividly describe how the ostensibly civilized process of confirmation to the country’s highest court degenerated into an appalling and lurid circus, largely determined by a no-holds-barred struggle for public opinion. In The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation, Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly—both reporters for the New York Times—portray the hearings as a referendum on the #MeToo moment and its denunciations of prominent men for sexual liberties allegedly taken with vulnerable women. On this reading the Senate, by eventually vindicating Kavanaugh, dismissed the contemporary demands of aggrieved womanhood.

For Hemingway and Severino, the Kavanaugh confirmation process was a disgrace and an outrage. A man of incontestably good character and impeccable behavior throughout his adult life was implausibly accused of improper sexual advances 34 and 36 years prior to his nomination. The most prominent accusations came from two women who were well-educated and eloquent but uncorroborated in their testimony. The allegations, which included drunkenness and a proclivity while drunk to grope young women, were given a degree of media attention that would have been mortifyingly embarrassing to any respectable person and incalculably disconcerting to his family. Hemingway’s and Severino’s essential point is that this debacle should not have occurred, because it tainted the judicial confirmation process with poisonously defamatory partisan politics. They make their case rigorously.

For Pogrebin and Kelly, however, the most salient feature of the Kavanaugh confirmation process was that it dramatized the struggles of all women who have been scarred by sexual assault. It was a missed opportunity to assure that the offenders in such cases be held to account for their misconduct. Given their starting perspective, these authors make a respectable effort to present Kavanaugh’s side: they concede his fine human qualities and exemplary behavior in all respects throughout his adult life. They do not question his qualifications as a judge, legal scholar, and writer of hundreds of lower court judgments. However, as analysts, they are much less thorough and persuasive than Hemingway and Severino.

* * *

Hemingway and Severino describe how furiously the anti-Trump media tried to discredit Kavanaugh. They establish clearly that, when the accusations against him finally surfaced, the great majority of press coverage was devoted to portraying Kavanaugh as a liar, a perhaps-reformed attempted rapist, and a habitual perpetrator of sexual assaults. The only sources of evidence for these insinuations were the distant and somewhat fuzzy recollections of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez. The other accusers who came snorting out of the undergrowth after decades of silence were too much even for the rather willfully credulous Pogrebin and Kelly. The Ramirez claim (of exhibitionism) was completely unsubstantiated, and Hemingway and Severino dispose of it quite crisply as unworthy of serious consideration.

Since Dr. Blasey Ford testified at the nationally televised hearings, spoke well, and seemed neither whiningly pitiful nor horrifyingly screechy, her claim had to be taken seriously. But it was suspect from the start, because Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of California sat on Blasey Ford’s letter of accusation for over six weeks before pulling it out as a last-ditch effort to stop Kavanaugh’s confirmation. Pogrebin and Kelly pay no attention to this fact. Perhaps more importantly, they completely fail to notice the inconsistencies in Blasey Ford’s testimony that were gently exposed by Rachel Mitchell, the special questioner hired by the Republican majority on the Senate Judiciary Committee. In fact, Pogrebin and Kelly never even question Blasey Ford’s credibility, despite the facts that 1) her claim to be terrified of flying was a fraud (she is a frequent flyer); 2) her assertion that she did not know the Senate Committee had offered to interview her in California was not believable, since every news-watching person in the world was aware of it; and 3) none of the four witnesses named by Dr. Blasey Ford corroborated her story or even professed any knowledge of the alleged incident.

Pogrebin and Kelly have undoubtedly done a lot of work interviewing everyone on the Blasey Ford and Ramirez side, extensively citing acquaintances of Kavanaugh’s who recall his occasional heavy drinking in high school and as an undergraduate at Yale. The authors are aware that the case against Kavanaugh only saw the light of day when Senator Feinstein and some militantly anti-Trump activists—having already leaked the story to the media anyway—persuaded Dr. Blasey Ford that she owed it to American women to go public. Pogrebin and Kelly likewise acknowledge that a person cannot be convicted of something on the basis of an inconsistently recollected and completely unconfirmed incident from 36 years in the past. But that does not deter them from trotting out absurdly detailed accounts of drinking episodes, as if drink always leads young men to sexual aggression. This is not probative evidence of anything. It is not even enough to satisfy the civil law’s “balance of probabilities” standard, which requires only that a defendant be more likely guilty than not.

* * *

The Education of Brett Kavanaugh opens with assertions that Kavanaugh’s Roman Catholic elementary and secondary schools were places where there was some violence (as there is in all schools where there are boys). The book’s clinching arguments are just as abstruse. Almost a year after Kavanaugh’s installation on the court, a majority of Americans in some normally leftish polls had a negative opinion of him. Kavanaugh’s own mother asked the public to look for “what rings true, what rings false,” and Pogrebin and Kelly conclude that Blasey Ford’s accusations “rang true,” though they do not suggest that Kavanaugh’s rebuttals rang false. The reader of their thin volume (about 40,000 words) is left wondering what possessed them to be so curious about Kavanaugh’s consumption of beer in youth, since these innumerable distant recollections don’t lead anywhere.

The authors make a considerable issue out of Kavanaugh’s supposedly aggressive temperament. But in fact it is almost miraculous that someone who was subjected to such harassment, vilification, and provocation managed to maintain his civility throughout. The book pointedly fails to mention that some of the leading auxiliaries of the Blasey Ford-Ramirez allegations were notoriously partisan Democrats and feminist activists with a known history of brinkmanship in these sorts of controversies. Nor do Pogrebin and Kelly note that mainstream media outlets—including their employer, the New York Times—were almost uniformly hostile to the Kavanaugh nomination. Instead, they simply seem to regret that a judge who was probably guilty of drunken assault on Christine Blasey Ford was confirmed—though they implicitly concede there was inadequate legal grounds to reject him.

* * *

Hemingway and Severino’s much more explicit lament is that the confirmation process in this case became a vicious and shameful battle having nothing to do with the normal criteria for elevating a judge. They argue that this happened because of the underlying battle between strict and flexible interpretations of the Constitution. They have written a factual and illuminating account of a memorable struggle. Pogrebin and Kelly, by contrast, are good reporters nibbling around the edges of the real issues rather emotionally, dressing up their feminist grumbling in pseudo-legalese (including rather annoying chapter titles in sometimes questionable Latin).

Neither book presses what I consider to be the two most important points raised by the Kavanaugh controversy. The first is that even if he had done what Blasey Ford accused him of, it wasn’t a penetration or even necessarily an attempted rape—though it was, if it occurred, very distasteful misbehavior. But it would have had nothing to do with his fitness to be a Supreme Court Justice 36 exemplary years later. Second, neither book makes the observation that the American justice system is itself a shambles. It costs the United States 10% of its GDP per year to produce masses of civil litigation that would be rejected by courts in other advanced countries as frivolous and vexatious. In the criminal justice system, over 90% of cases return a guilty verdict—95% of those without trial, because the perverse plea bargain system incentivizes confession before the prosecution has even formally made its case. Through conservative and liberal periods, the Justices of the Supreme Court have sat for decades like berobed suet puddings while the 5th, 6th, and 8th Amendment rights to an independent grand jury, due process, just compensation for property seizure, prompt justice, an impartial jury, access to counsel, and reasonable bail, have all been put to the shredder. That is why the United States has between six and 12 times as many incarcerated people per capita as other large prosperous democracies: Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom. All the pieties uttered about the rule of law by both sides in the Kavanaugh dispute don’t “ring true” to anyone who has had any experience of how the cancerous American justice system really does work, despite the best efforts of many fine people such as Justice Kavanaugh.",1,https://claremontreviewofbooks.com/confirmation-bias/
34,Andrews,Helen,realclearbooks,"During a democratic town hall event hosted by the Human Rights Campaign and CNN on October 10, 2019, then-candidate Beto O’Rourke proposed revoking the tax-exempt status of churches and religious organizations that oppose gay marriage. “There can be no reward, no benefit, no tax break,” he intoned, “for anyone, or any institution, any organization in America, that denies the full human rights and the full civil rights of every single one of us.” O’Rourke’s abuse of the term “civil rights”—his pandering attempt to borrow the moral grandeur of 1964 in order to abrogate the First Amendment—is no longer an anomaly.

36,Andrews,Helen,americanmind,"Perversion can never be stripped of shame.

Reason dot com bloggers and libertarians of every stripe (left and right) are freaking out. Why? Because “Conservatives are coming for your Pornhub.” And they are right to be afraid.

In early December, four U.S. Representatives sent a letter to Attorney General William Barr, asking him to enforce existing anti-obscenity laws and shut down the porn industry (yes, America has anti-porn legislation on the books; yes, there have been zero prosecutions since the Obama administration). In the letter, the Representatives note that “15 state legislatures have declared that pornography is causing a public health crisis.”

The language of porn as “public health crisis” or even “epidemic” is the standard line among conservatives. Josh Hammer’s article in First Things, which takes libertarians to task for their opposition to the enforcement of anti-porn law, uses it. So does Pascal-Emmanuel Gobry’s doorstopper piece in American Greatness. In short, porn harms the people who create it, the people who watch it, and the people who try to date and marry porn addicts.

But the “public health crisis” line is actually a dead end. We are not dealing here with children inhaling toxins from an oil refinery. We are dealing with men enslaving themselves to the pleasure they get from watching an infinite supply of other people have sex. It is neither useful nor honest to talk about pornography as a “public health” problem. People know their porn habit isn’t just bad for them—it’s wrong. When so many of us derive our greatest physical satisfaction from something we know is debasing us, more than our health is at stake. Our humanity is.

Our infinitude of porn must be seen as the whole that it is, irredeemably vile in what it is doing to us. Even before the explosion of online pornography, obscenity was firmly illegal. Yet now we are told it is sacrosanct. A polity worth living in is a polity that keeps pornography away from our children and protects adults from its predatory producers and consumers.

We’re Not Doing This for Our Health

Gobry’s essay, “A Science-Based Case for Ending the Porn Epidemic,” while rife with helpful data, skirts this point. His big comparison is the gradual emergence of a public health consensus around smoking and the nascent public health research around porn. Policy will follow science, eventually. But does this comparison even make sense?

“I’ve been a smoker since my early 20s,” Gobry writes. But he admits it—he knows all the public health data and yet he still smokes.

So it is with porn. Despite rock-solid, irrefutable scientific evidence and complete unanimity that smoking poses dire health risks, millions of people still smoke and we have yet to ban it outright. So why take this as the model for banning porn?

Here is the biggest problem with the whole “public health crisis” language. Imagine for me that sexologists (is that a real thing? sounds perverted ) could prove that watching porn for 15 minutes a day lowered your blood pressure, prevented heart disease, and diminished your chance of stroke. Would you then endorse porn every day for everyone? Of course not. Even if it improved our physical condition, it would still debase our humanity.

That’s why more and more Americans, including young people, are rediscovering the conclusion that we can tell porn is wrong because we can tell it is porn. There is nothing good about it. Damn the public health effects. Pornography is wicked. This isn’t a handwashing campaign. This is a moral crusade.

And the inherent end this crusade must seek is a ban on pornography.

Shame, Shame, Shame

Banning porn will require a pervasive sexual re-norming. This is a democracy, and we’re going to have to figure out how to get people on board with it. Even if we did convince people of the public health case, where would that leave us? With erectile dysfunction-type warnings in the first five seconds of every porno? We need something better than that.

For a path forward, look to an unlikely model: the gay rights movement. In 2008, my home state of California voted in favor of a statewide constitutional amendment to enshrine marriage as exclusively between a man and a woman. Yes, that was California. Remember? In less than ten years, the Supreme Court declared the amendment illegal—in large part because such legislation had become unthinkable for many Americans (including the ones who themselves had voted for it just eight years previous).

So how did they do it?

Gay rights activists repeatedly and publicly shamed us, saying that if you oppose gay marriage, you hate gay people. That line, repeated and modified and transposed in a million different ways, sexually re-normed America in the space of a decade.

Now, it’s our turn for a sexual re-norming of America. Conservatives can turn Americans against porn. How?

You might expect, at this point, for me to go all Andrea Dworkin, anti-porn radical feminist and say that porn supporters—people like Matt Welch who complains that we’re coming for his Pornhub and C.J. Pearson who says that if you don’t like porn, don’t watch it, and the entire Libertarian Party—all hate women. Well, they like porn, so that’s probably true.

But the trouble, really, is that trying to shame people who actually do hate women by calling them misogynists won’t work. They like hating women. This is part of what makes porn so addicting. (Sidenote: The “you hate gays” line worked because people generally did not hate gays, and did not want to hate gays. They just weren’t woke enough to realize that not-hating-gays required being-for-gay-marriage. They were quick to comply once shamed.)

I still believe the shaming route can work, but we have to try something a little bit different. Let’s try calling porn supporters despicable perverts instead. After all, it is true.

For one, virtually everyone is ashamed of using porn. The only people who are not, and who whip it out on the bus or at school, end up in jail or on a sex offender registry. Our own shame about porn—the fact that we do it with the door closed, the windows shuttered, and that we delete our browser history afterwards—tells us everything we need to know. Rather than trying for another half-century to “destigmatize” perversion, how about we actually listen to our shame and let it teach us something for once?

If we could bottle up all the shame and grief men have expressed in their evangelical men’s groups and their Catholic confessionals about their own unremitting battles against pornography, and we could somehow direct it at the legions of despicable perverts who support pornography, I am convinced we could pass a constitutional amendment and build the Great Firewall against pornography before Trump’s second term starts.

Porn in the digital age is unlike porn in any other. The untrammelled ease of access and the algorithmic recommendations that reward addiction put consumers on a highway to watch not only more violent and more degrading sex acts, but to descend ever deeper down whatever rabbit hole of porn enslaves them most. What was titillating yesterday is vanilla today; what was “just a preference” or “kink” today becomes a consuming perversion tomorrow. Like a user chasing a high, the porn viewer is always chasing the next feeling of transgressive shock or psychological surrender. While I give him a hard time, Gobry-the-Smoker’s article is incredibly helpful in illustrating the neurological and technological aspects of this phenomenon. His analysis of the rise of Kink dot com and the ever-escalating brutality of the sex acts that that site produces and records makes for horrifying reading.

Pornography, like prostitution, makes a mockery of sex. Sex is the physical expression of a man and woman’s loving union and a sign of the cosmic potentiality of love, which is ordered to the creation of new life. Porn turns sex into sterile, self-serving, and exploitative pleasure. The only “union” present is the cash nexus—the participants are “uniting” because they’re getting paid.

You don’t want your kids watching porn, you don’t want your spouse watching porn, you don’t want your daughter to grow up to be a porn star. And when you watch porn you hate yourself for it. So why should anyone be watching porn or “starring” in it?

The porn-as-public-health-crisis argument is ultimately a consequentialist one: The consequences of watching porn are bad, so we should ban it. By leaving the argument off at this consequentialist juncture, we accept the libertarians’ first principles and betray the Founding.

After all, J.S. Mill didn’t write the Constitution. We the People did not enshrine the harm principle into law. “You do you and imma do me” isn’t in our founding documents.

But here is what is so incredibly infuriating: Conservatives act like it is. And when we make the “public health crisis” argument, we are just diddling around in the libertarian perverts’ consequentialist arena. Which is what the 2016 GOP platform did. The platform was sorta encouraging because at least it named pornography a “menace,” but it was ultimately discouraging because it boiled the problem down to, guess what? “A public health crisis.”

Luckily, the Right is in the middle of a “re-founding” moment, a reexamination of our core principles and sources profound enough, if carried through, to mark a totally new beginning. At the end of all of it, we might finally get to escape from Consequentialism Land forever. Opposing porn on a morally reasoned basis is how to do this.

Ahmari-French, populists vs. elitists, nationalism vs. fusionism—these are attempts to describe the nature of our movement’s fitful re-founding. What it ends up getting called does not matter (The People v. The Perverts?); what matters is whether the Right’s re-founding leads to an American re-founding. Because if we do not re-found America, we are toast.

Don’t believe me? Ask Clarence Thomas.

Religion or Bust

At the October dedication of Hillsdale College’s new Christ Chapel, Justice Thomas quoted this famous line from John Adams’s 1798 letter to the Massachusetts Militia: “Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious People. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.”

Upon reading this line, you nod your head approvingly. But do you really believe it? Have you actually thought about what Adams’s words imply, for us, right now?

If he is right, America is on the brink of total collapse. Actual religion in this country is, with startling speed, being replaced by atheism, vapid “spiritualities” (New Age and otherwise), and Moralistic Therapeutic Deism of the most gauzy varieties. Of course, this is not news. But if it means the death of “a moral and religious People,” which it does, then it means the death of republican government in the United States.

For all their genius, the Founders did not tie down the patio furniture tightly enough. Now that the typhoon of Liberalism is blowing through, the moral and religious characteristics that made republican government possible in America are being blown overboard.

Patio furniture on the ship of state—mere accessories. That is how libertarians and leftists view American religiosity and morality. In reality though (to switch metaphors wantonly) religiosity and morality are no mere accessories. They are the ballast that keeps the ship of state afloat. They have been punctured, and without a titanic effort of repair, the ship is going down.

What must the American re-founding look like? It cannot just be a shift in mentality—though that is a prerequisite. One essential re-founding task that lies before us—the chief re-founding task without which all else fails—is erasing naïve viewpoint neutrality from our laws in favor of robust state protection for monotheism and natural law. It will not be good for the prose quality of our founding documents, but unfortunately we have no choice but to pass a constitutional amendment that says, “‘you do you and imma do me’ is not part of this Constitution of the United States.”

But we have to build up to this constitutional amendment first—we can’t pull it off straight out of the gate. So first off, advocate for, pass, and enforce laws that presuppose that protecting good religion and natural law is worth doing—laws which explicitly reject perverted utilitarian and consequentialist reasoning.

And that is what the porn debate gives us an opening to do. Stop talking about public health consequences and start telling it like is: Porn is despicable; its supporters are perverts. So long as we tacitly assume that the harm principle marks the bright line beyond which we cannot legislate, we will be abetting the perverts in taking down the ship of state. Once we break their spell, and we start passing laws because they are good for morals, supportive of religion, and in accordance with the natural law, we will be well on our way to America’s re-founding. Perverts beware.",1,https://americanmind.org/features/obscenity-blindness/libertarians-are-coming-for-your-sexual-dignity/
37,Andrews,Helen,americanmind,"Talk of the free market is laughable when it comes to porn.

Helen Andrews has sounded the alarm. That alarm is not an emotionally detached lamentation of our cultural decadence and slide into neo-paganism, but a gut-wrenching cri de coeur intended to persuade both those on the Left and the libertarian “Right” of the need to crack down on Big Porn. Andrews is on sound footing when she decries how evolving technology has sufficiently metastasized our pornography public health crisis so as to render hollow effete classical liberal bromides about simply letting parents do their jobs.

A more muscular approach to Big Porn is indeed needed: One that rises above intellectual sclerosis, institutional inertia, and the reflexive aversion of many would-be allies to wield the levers of political power to “enforce morality.”

As Jesse Merriam demonstrated, there are no legally preclusive strictures that would prohibit a political assault against pornography. The Supreme Court has never asserted—nor could it possibly assert—a First Amendment “right” to manufacture, distribute, or possess smut. On the contrary, obscenity was oftentimes a jailable offense at the time of the American Founding. Merriam cites the scholarship of Hillsdale College’s Thomas West to posit that “there was a broad consensus” at the time of the Founding “that the government not only may but should prohibit any speech that tends to undermine adherence to the Christian faith and traditional family relations—the twin pillars of the American social and moral order.”

The law, in short, is not a hindrance. As Andrews writes, the leading obstacle to genuine political reform is therefore a distinctly cultural one. Ironically, however, that cultural obstacle standing in the way of pornography reform is a nebulous derivative of “free speech” legal principle: Namely, a seductive Enlightenment-inspired faith that the proper cure to harmful “speech” is here, there, and everywhere just healthier “speech.”

Our problem is therefore a misplaced elevation of the notion of the “marketplace of ideas” to an undeservedly lofty pedestal—if not to the position of an outright societal panacea. In so doing, especially in the context of utterly noxious content such as pornography, we have sapped ourselves of the ability to advance forthright moral argumentation about the inherent value of ideas and content. Philosophical liberals of the both the left- and right-leaning variety have vitiated the “marketplace of ideas” and neutered it into a marketplace of brain worms.

Free speech absolutism and a concomitant faith in the power of good ideas to triumph over bad ideas, already ideals with more ivory-tower theoretical appeal than tangible historicist support, are wholly misplaced in the pornography debate. At the risk of stating the obvious, there is nothing “speech”-like about pornography—an industry inextricably linked to human trafficking, lacking any plausible “redeeming” value whatsoever and instead explicitly appealing to the prurient interest. The very act of relying upon the pluralistic “marketplace of ideas” to counter that “speech” therefore amounts to complicity in a fundamental lie: That pornography itself and religious/ethical/cultural/social criticism of pornography are equally deserving of a place in the public discourse.

Resorting to the “marketplace of ideas” platitude strips culture war interlocutors of their most potent rhetorical weapon: The ability to make justice– and inherent-value-themed arguments about smut. By acceding to the lie of the “marketplace of ideas” as a cure-all, we assume “that we cannot and should not distinguish between good and evil, argument and obscenity, truth and falsehood,” as Matthew Schmitz aptly writes. The currency of conservative public discourse must resist the temptations of post-Enlightenment pluralism and procedural fetishization.

It is long past time for us to return home to the more evocative discursive terrain of yesteryear: Justice, human flourishing, virtue, and truth. “The notion of liberty was always attended by the awareness of the distinction between liberty and license,” Hadley Arkes writes, and we on the Right would do well to revitalize that crucial distinction—lest we fall victim to true moral relativism, properly understood. Whatever John Stuart Mill may have said about the necessity of free expression and the pitfalls of censorship in On Liberty, surely he did not intend to rob future societies of the ability to argue that teenagers should not carry around an endless supply of violent orgy videos in their pockets.

The “marketplace of ideas” talking point also fails, in the context of pornography, for yet another compelling reason: Human physiology. “A scientific consensus is emerging that today’s porn is truly a public health menace: Its new incarnation combines with some evolutionarily-designed features of our brain to make it uniquely addictive, on par with any drug you might name—and uniquely destructive,” Pascal-Emmanuel Gobry observes. “The evidence is in: Porn is as addictive as smoking, or more, except that what smoking does to your lungs, porn does to your brain.” There are serious, ruinous health externalities to America’s debilitating porn addiction—and ruinous health externalities are quintessential reasons to regulate human conduct. There are very real, and very unsettling, neurochemical effects on the human brain from exposure to what Gobry calls the “always-on kaleidoscope of sexual novelty.” It is not merely inadequate, but actually farcical, to suggest “more speech” as the only desirable remedy for such an epidemic.

The American Right’s single biggest intellectual capitulation over the past three to four decades has been the unilateral disarmament of all justice-based public policy advocacy. The Left, ever hegemonic, has sought to fill that void via the proliferation of “social justice”-imbued public policy. But leftist “social justice,” of course, is a bastardization of the entire overarching enterprise. The Right must reclaim the moral beachhead of argumentation rooted in justice and truth, which necessarily means eschewing the talking point of hacks and morons that is trite faith in a values-neutral “marketplace of ideas.”",1,https://americanmind.org/features/obscenity-blindness/the-marketplace-of-brain-worms/
38,Andrews,Helen,americanmind,"Aristotle points the way to true virtue through free will.

And now, a word from our old pal Aristotle about the porn crisis.

Here is the philosopher in Book 3, Chapter 5 of his Nicomachean Ethics, discussing how we should regard an alcoholic who commits a crime while blackout drunk (my translation, emphasis added):

The source of the wrongdoing was in himself: for he had control over his choice to get drunk or not…. Maybe it will be objected that he is not the kind of person to be careful about such things. But men cause themselves to become careless by living carelessly, and to be unjust or irresponsible by doing wrong or passing their time getting drunk and so forth…. But this does not mean that they can simply stop becoming wrongdoers and start becoming righteous, any more than a sick man can become healthy just by wishing it so.

Aristotle describes a feedback loop involving habit, character, and action. We tend to behave in certain ways because we are certain types of people, and we become certain types of people by behaving in certain ways. No one is born a drunk. But if we freely choose to drink too much, we find ourselves locked in a reinforcement cycle from which we will struggle to recover. Vice, like coronavirus, is easy to contract and miserably difficult to shake.

This describes exactly the situation in which men all over America find themselves with respect to pornography. Almost everyone who grew up with a smartphone grew up with access to an infinite quantity of empty sex on video. And if we thought we could dip our toes into this ocean of filth with immunity, we were wrong. You can check in any time you like, but you can never leave: we are, in staggering numbers, addicted to porn.

Aristotle also knew that this kind of feedback loop doesn’t happen in a vacuum. Our inborn predispositions, the teachings of our parents, and (crucially) our laws help condition and constrain the choices we make as children. Over time, those choices form us into the kinds of people we become as adults. And then it is us, as adults, who make the laws and build the families. Choice, habit, character, society, law: there is no untying the gordian knot into which these things are woven.

Libertarianism is predicated on the lie that you can untie that knot: that our laws can simply stay out of our personal ethics. They cannot and they never have. And so, as Josh Hammer notes, there is nothing inherently wrong or unconstitutional about writing and enforcing laws which restrict the use of porn. I suspect an actual porn ban would be inadvisable. But to throw up your hands about this issue is not to leave the government out of the question. It is to accept a regime which encourages self-destruction, misery, and shame.

However. In our eagerness to recall that government inevitably does play a role in moral habituation, we are apt to forget another Aristotelian truism: there is no such thing as compulsory virtue. The good and the evil are both species of the voluntary. The source of all morality is the individual who freely chooses—primed and trained by his upbringing as he may be—to do this or that, to harm or help, to indulge or refrain. If the state loses sight of this—if it not only encourages but mandates healthy sexuality—it makes morality meaningless.

The consequences of forced sexual ethics can be glimpsed already in the public schools of California, where children are marched through weird catechisms about transgenderism to which they and their caretakers must assent. The horror of such lessons isn’t just the content: it’s the coercion. Strip the individual of his right to choose—no matter how noble your intentions—and what you thought would be justice turns into an empty, glassy-eyed shell of itself.

The porn crisis—as Bedivere Bedrydant and Marlo Safi insist—is a spiritual crisis. Even if it were possible to ban porn altogether, it wouldn’t cure our nation’s real addiction, which is not to porn but to materialism. Having been fed on a diet of poorly digested Marxism and half-understood Freudianism for decades, many Westerners are now constitutionally unable to conceive of themselves as anything more than meat sacks containing chemicals.

Small wonder that such an outlook has produced men who think sex is not a meeting of souls but a pressing of buttons. And yet it’s those men who must be led, not forced, to think of themselves as something more. To shun porn of their own free will. There are long years of difficult work ahead of us, and it is not only legislative work. In schools, in families, in public, we must be unashamed to teach—and to show—that man is more than dust.",1,https://americanmind.org/features/obscenity-blindness/porn-law-is-not-enough/
39,Andrews,Helen,americanmind,"Pornographic technology has turned sensory overload into sensory degradation.

In 1949, the British research group Mass-Observation conducted a survey into English sex habits, which, among other questions, asked respondents how they had first become aware of sex.

About 20% said their parents had explained it to them.

Eight percent said they had learned it from a book, usually a medical textbook or a pamphlet on hygiene.

Fully a quarter said they had just “picked up” their sex knowledge. “Nobody taught me, they didn’t have to,” said a 52-year-old farmer from Tadcaster. “I had eyes in my head. Mind you, I’ve always lived on a farm.”

For anyone born since 1995, it is not necessary to ask how they became aware of sex. It was by watching PornHub on a friend’s smartphone at the age of 13.

It is hard to get a grip on the scale of the pornography problem because the social-scientific data is so unreliable. The report of the President’s Commission on Obscenity and Pornography, published in 1970, found that 60% of Americans believed “adults should be allowed to read or see any explicit sexual materials that they want to” but also that 73% thought gratuitous sex scenes in movies should “definitely not be allowed.”

If polls are that self-contradictory on what Americans think about pornography, it is hard to have trust in self-reported data on what they’re doing, whether a generation ago or today. The current recognized figure that 43% of men have watched pornography in the last week seems low.

People who want to minimize the porn problem insist that human beings aren’t any more dirty-minded today than they were 50 years ago, or 100, or 2,000. (Think of those Pompeii frescoes!)

It is true that people haven’t changed—but technology has.

An Unprecedented Revolution

Three changes in particular have made porn a bigger problem in the last decade than at any time in human history.

Moving pictures. The most erotic writing pales next to a single image, and the most erotic image is less suggestive than a thirty second MP4. Video is a qualitatively different medium. Think of PTSD: You can imagine someone being traumatized by watching video of a disturbing event, but not just from being told about it.

Privacy. Until around 1982, seeing a dirty movie meant going to a public place, like a porno theatre or a stag party hosted by someone who knew how to operate an 8mm film projector. In 1976, when Travis Bickle took Betsy on their ill-advised date to see Swedish Marriage Manual, there were only 800 porno theatres in the United States. With the advent of video, for the first time the experience of watching video pornography became private. A customer’s only moment of public vulnerability was when he bought the cassette from the video store, and mail order got around even that.

Variety. Between 1988 and 2005—that is, the year before YouPorn went live—the number of porn videos produced each year increased by a factor of ten, from 1,300 to 13,000. The most recent year-in-review numbers from PornHub say that 1,360,000 hours of new material was uploaded to the site in 2019. “The first telegraph message was sent on May 24, 1844,” they explain jauntily. “If you started watching PornHub then, you would still be watching new videos today.”

Moving-picture pornography has been around for a little over a century. It has been available for private viewing for two generations. It has been instantly accessible in infinite variety on the computer in everyone’s pocket for only a decade. It is not an exaggeration to call the current situation unprecedented.

Some have compared online streaming pornography to high-calorie snacks, which our primitive instincts tell us to consume but which modern man had to learn to eat only in moderation after they started being mass-produced in the mid-twentieth century.

I would rate it more disruptive than that. Online streaming pornography is a revolution on par with the invention of the printing press.

Banal Intercourse

Everyone hated the movie The Canyons when it came out in 2013, which was fair insofar as Lindsay Lohan was between her 5th and 6th stints in rehab when they filmed it and director Paul Schrader got better acting out of his male lead, an actual porn star.

But far from being the trashy thriller it appeared, The Canyons was the culmination of Schrader’s career-long meditation on pornography in America. The three films in Schrader’s pornography triptych correspond to three eras of technology: Hardcore (1979), starring George C. Scott, depicts the age of film; Auto Focus (2002), starring Greg Kinnear as doomed Hogan’s Heroes actor Bob Crane, the age of video; The Canyons, the age of smartphones.

Hardcore is currently most famous for the reaction shot of George C. Scott watching a porn film starring his runaway daughter (“Turn it off!”), which, as a meme, has been adapted to as many different uses as the Downfall bunker rant. The point of historical interest for viewers of that scene is that, when the private detective wants to show Scott that film, he has to rent a theatre. Film required special training and equipment just to view, never mind shoot and develop.

The same was not true of video.

“It’s not like film. With video, there’s no processing,” Bob Crane’s partner in crime, played by Willem Dafoe, tells him in Auto Focus. “It’s like the Polaroid of home movies.” The point of Auto Focus is that the instant gratification of the home video porn cycle—pick up girls, record sex acts, watch tape, repeat—turns Bob Crane from an ordinary Hollywood horn-dog into a sex addict.

If you watch the trailer for Auto Focus, you will see Bob Crane telling his agent, who is worried about his client’s reputation, “Sex is normal, it’s good for you, I’m normal”—not very convincingly, with his five o’clock shadow and dirtbag aviators. Contrast this with what George C. Scott says to the Los Angeles hooker he picks up to help him find his daughter. “How important do you think sex is?” she asks him. “Not very,” he says. “Then we’re both alike,” she replies.

Ordinary civilians and professionals both keep sex in perspective. It’s the porn viewer, caught between the two, who becomes obsessive. The obsession only gets worse when the viewer himself becomes a content producer the way Bob Crane does. He suffers all the compulsiveness of unlimited supply with none of the detachment of a professional.

This toxic dynamic is accelerated to 3G speed in The Canyons, which was supposed to be James Deen’s breakthrough crossover from porn to Hollywood but ended up looking more like Lindsay Lohan’s crossover into porn. Three-ways, four-ways, oral sex, choking, Schrader films all of it—and so do the characters.

In the opening scene, James Deen tells his personal assistant that he won’t be going on location for the filming of a horror movie his company is producing because “I’ll be too busy making my own little movies.” The assistant’s naïve boyfriend asks what he means. “On this, dude,” Deen says, holding up his smartphone, and explains to him how Tinder works.

Bret Easton Ellis wrote the script for The Canyons, and it has his signature style of “beautiful people doing bad things in nice rooms” (Schrader’s pithy phrase), but everything that seemed so cool and sleek and glossy in the 1980s has become sterile and tawdry.

Our glamor couple doesn’t even throw parties like the one at the beginning of Less Than Zero. They find exactly as many people as they need for the evening on Tinder, and everybody gets naked within minutes of arriving. It’s more efficient, but how much sadder.

The Myth of the Sexpert

The awfulness depicted in The Canyons is of the Internet age, but the mistakes that made it possible started in the 1960s.

The phrase “utterly without redeeming social value,” crucial to the evolving legal definition of obscenity, originated in the 1960s. Its main purpose is to establish artistic value as a defense. “Well-written obscenity,” one First Amendment lawyer intoned at the time, “is a contradiction in terms.” Before then, artistic quality had been an aggravating factor for obscenity in many jurisdictions.

The eminent Cambridge philosopher Bernard Williams, who chaired Britain’s Committee on Obscenity and Film Censorship, thought this exception was the stupidest part of British obscenity law.

The committee’s final report in 1979 was mostly liberal in its recommendations, but one rule they recommended tightening was the exception for works of artistic or historical merit. If pornography was harmless (as Williams believed it was, as long as it was vanilla), then legalize it for that reason. If it was harmful (like a rape film), then any merits it might possess were irrelevant. Either way, we should dispense with the undignified spectacle of expert witnesses “trying to think of otherwise unknown facts about 18th century London which one might learn from Fanny Hill.”

The most famous such spectacle was the Chatterly trial, the fons et origo of the artistic value defense. There’s a reason it remains the most celebrated obscenity case today, and it’s not just because Philip Larkin namechecked it. Most obscenity has no artistic pretensions whatsoever, but by associating themselves with a distinguished novelist like D.H. Lawrence, pornographers can pretend that their expansive interpretation of the First Amendment is designed to protect great works of literature and not, as in the more consequential landmark case People v. Freeman (1988), the sodomy spectacular Come from Behind, Part II.

Curiously, one literary scholar who did not testify at the Chatterly trial was F. R. Leavis, the most eminent critic in England and also the man most responsible for establishing Lawrence’s reputation back in the 1930s when it was more fashionable to dismiss Lawrence as a coal country barbarian. Leavis defended Lawrence against sneering attacks from T.S. Eliot and Bertrand Russell, but he would not defend Lady Chatterly’s Lover at the Old Bailey. His silence was deafening, but because other English professors were found to testify, the jury did not hear it.

It did not take long after the advent of “redeeming social or literary value” as a defense in the Chatterly trials—decided in most Anglosphere countries between 1959 and 1962—for it to become clear that the rule was infinitely elastic. It starts by making an exception for D.H. Lawrence and ends up covering everything short of a snuff film.

One California prosecutor told an interviewer in 1977 about a case he tried against a hardcore fisting film. “We had pathologists testify that the person would have to be under some kind of drugs or sedatives.” The jury nevertheless returned an acquittal because, as the foreman told the prosecutor, “It had educational value in that it instructed me not to engage in this form of activity.”

Worse than the rule’s flexibility was its introduction of experts into the courtroom.

Before “utterly without redeeming social value” became the standard for obscenity, no expert witness would ever have been called to testify to a book or film’s artistic merit because the question would have been irrelevant. But by 1966, the U.S. Supreme Court was overturning the Massachusetts obscenity conviction of Fanny Hill primarily because professors from Harvard, Williams, and Brandeis told them to.

There was only one expert witness for the prosecution in that case, the headmaster of a prep school who formerly taught English at Boston Latin.

Whose expertise should have counted for more?

I would have said the headmaster, since he taught students closer to puberty whose sexual habits were still developing and therefore knew more about the effects of pornography on young libidos. But Justice Brennan thought that the ability to situate John Cleland in the tradition of 18th-century epistolary fiction was more important.

Really the whole question is misbegotten, because the kind of “expertise” the Supreme Court wanted to rely on doesn’t exist.

Our legal definition of obscenity relies on expert witnesses, but there is no such thing as an expert in sex. Who has sounder judgment, a prostitute or a Catholic priest? A spinster Harlequin writer or a mother of five?

Sex is the kind of thing where constant exposure is more likely to warp a person’s perception than sharpen it. One can be wise on the subject of sex, but not expert.

Media Can Hurt You

Of all the people to be wise on the subject of sex, Paul Schrader is not one anybody would have predicted.

He grew up among the strict Dutch Calvinists of Grand Rapids, who don’t loom large in the American imagination because they haven’t produced very many creative artists, but suffice it to say that if we did have artistic representations of growing up Dutch in Grand Rapids, we would stop thinking of Boston Irish Catholics as our gold standard of uptightness.

Schrader’s parents were so strict that he didn’t see any movies, never mind dirty movies, until he snuck into Disney’s The Absent-Minded Professor when he was 17. It is therefore strange that he should have made so many thoughtful films about pornography. He had to fight to convince his family and his own Dutch Calvinist conscience that moviemaking was an honorable career.

You’d think he’d want to avoid thinking about the sort of movies that confirm their worst suspicions.

But in a way it makes sense. Most of us grew up adhering to the standard liberal articles of faith about freedom of speech: mere words and images can’t hurt us; the cure for bad speech is more speech; censorship offends the dignity of man. Porn is an exception that we don’t like to think about because it makes our brains flash “Does Not Compute.”

Schrader, on the other hand, grew up knowing that media can hurt you, so porn was never a brain-scrambling exception to him.

The films he watched as a teenager, even benign ones about Fred MacMurray and Flubber, really did erode his attachment to his parent’s faith and culture, even though that wasn’t his intention when he went to see them. He and his parents grew apart but they have always agreed on one thing: what we see and hear can affect us for the worse even if we come into the theatre girded with a sturdy Calvinist conscience.

If a book persuades a man to believe falsehoods, he can be persuaded back around to the truth; if a movie degrades a man’s senses, there’s no way for it to be undone. This is true of all degrading media, from trashy celebrity gossip to the Saw franchise. Porn is not a special case, just an extreme one.

There are two obstacles standing in the way of action on pornography today. The first is technological. Solutions exist for that one. The other is cultural, our willingness to try.

We have been too blinded by patently false ideas that no one before the Sixties ever believed—that artistic expression justifies obscenity, that pornography’s effect on the soul is as reversible as a false argument’s effect on the brain—and it has made us reluctant.

An easy cure for that reluctance would be to watch the first 20 minutes of The Canyons.",1,https://americanmind.org/features/obscenity-blindness/
40,Andrews,Helen,americanmind,"The American people have become acolytes of a religion of the flesh.

Translators of Rainer Maria Rilke’s Duino Elegies quibble over how to handle this line of the poem, written in Rilke’s native German: “der gedeuteten welt.” It either means “the interpreted world” or “the deciphered world.” When paired with its antecedent line, the couplet reads: “we’re not very securely at home / in the interpreted world.”

For contemporary purposes, it could be serviceable for us to rechristen the German word as “deciphered” in its English translation. Have the Silicon Valley transhumanists cracked the code for eternal youth quite yet, dusting off the playbook of their Soviet cosmist muses? Mystery is a modern adversary, and no matter how exciting the bobblehead creatives tell us the times are and will become, no matter if the cherry red Tesla in space does its hundredth orbit around the sun, we are bored with our deciphered world.

This is not boredom out of lack of things to do. It’s quite the opposite; a never-ending flow of stimuli (“entertainment”) that rarely spares us a moment to consider limits, place, or duty. A discomfort and alienation with the surrounding creation that has prompted a vast malaise.

Some evidence of our boredom, beyond the gradual dropping like flies of Facebook friends from high school overdosing on fentanyl, is porn. Perhaps we’re not dying deaths of despair from pornography use in quite the same way residents of Cabell County, West Virginia or my hometown in western Pennsylvania are of opioid overdoses. Drug death, of course, is more easily quantified: regression charts and all of the bells and whistles of CDC analytics can be used to study this pathology. As they should.

Pornography addiction, however, isn’t popularly considered a pathology. If anything, it’s integral to American life. In recent years, pornography sites have been more visited than social media sites like Instagram. Evidently, scrolling through an infinite loop of curated brunch photos and pixel-edited breast augmentations and rhinoplasty doesn’t take the edge off or get the brain juices flowing like faux incest pornography.

So, despite the attempted deciphering and reconfiguration of our world down to the microscopic level, we fail to recognize goodness and find ourselves in a metaphysical desert full of interchangeable things and addictions. As we’ve receded into spiritual sloth and boredom, weariness and cynicism, we’ve rejected mystery and wonder as trivial, precluding soulful delight and instead choosing onanism. Americans have become PornHub’s Pez dispensers, seeking out whatever will get the fried pleasure sensors to merely react: a feral, frenetic atavism that goes unchecked and unabated, because (they argue) that’s freedom.

Pope John Paul II’s Evangelium Vitae encyclical from 1995 delineates Church teaching on issues such as abortion and euthanasia and how they relate to creating and enforcing a culture of life—predictably, the less anodyne “culture of death” was easily dismissed as just another rant from another conservative moralist. Indeed, much of what the pope warned about was dismissed as hyperbolic, the secular public being complacent with the comfort of their lifestyles. Worship takes place in one form or another, whether worship of the holy or that of comfort and sensation. As Michael Hanby writes in his essay “The Culture of Death, The Ontology of Boredom, and the Resistance of Joy,” citing Evangelium Vitae, “the worship of sensation functions simultaneously as a distant reflection of the desire for God, and as an attempt to escape the Godless world we attempt to create through voluntaristic freedom.”

In these pursuits we reject God-given tasks in favor of fulfilling our desires, casting out beauty and mystery, especially in sex. The character of sex is bleached out when fertility is no longer a feature, and sex becomes a consumption product. This can seem quite provincial to believe or suggest to others.

Pornography is the ultimate obsession of a bored people looking for escape, relatively inexpensive and often only “costing” immaterial things. In search of novelty as boredom sets in, as it inevitably does, millions of people search for human origami porn, or for pool boy or pizza guy scripted porn to milk the last remaining morsel of imagination left before it’s on to the next thing. We like the idea of mystery and spontaneity, but only just a little, and only when it’s presented on a screen just long enough that it teases us.

Despite the affordability of flatscreen televisions, which think tankers and their ilk seem to believe is a metric of American prosperity, there certainly seems to be a bankruptcy of imagination: one can defend sex in its most objectifying form, but not in the sacred form.

If we can choose to be captivated by our carnal existence, we can choose to fully immerse ourselves in the mysteriously limiting bliss of the spirit. Such ethereal, indecipherable things seem to be perplexing us. Perhaps the truth is more simple: we fear to believe a gift so good could exist.",1,https://americanmind.org/features/obscenity-blindness/porn-is-a-form-of-worship/

42,Andrews,Helen,claremontreviewofbooks,"Keith Whittington’s Repugnant Laws is an impressively thorough, empirical study of judicial review, from the founding to the Supreme Court’s 2017 term. The book makes for rewarding reading; the only disappointment is a too-brief discussion of what the evidence suggests about the present Court and its predicament.

The book employs a novel approach to judicial review by examining cases in which the Court upheld the constitutionality of federal statutes. It is a massive undertaking, for the Congressional Research Service only lists cases when the Court “strikes down” federal statutes, in whole or in part—not when it sustains federal statutes against constitutional challenges. (“Strike down” is an awful term of convenience. The judiciary has no such power—only the power to declare a statute cannot be constitutionally applied by a court.) Omitting “positives”—cases sustaining federal statutes—understates the Court’s role in judicial review; counting only “negatives”—judicial invalidations—overstates the justices’ role as guardians of the constitutional order against an imperious Congress.

Legal research software yielded Whittington some 10,000 potential cases, which he sifted to distinguish serious constitutional challenges from spurious attacks and judicial drive-by pronouncements. (His research is available on his page on the Princeton University website). An overly ambitious doctoral candidate might attempt such a project; the William Nelson Cromwell Professor of Politics could be forgiven if he took a pass. Then again, one would not want anyone short of Whittington’s acumen and integrity anywhere near the reading and coding of those 10,000 decisions and opinions. The reason to trust the data—the only reason—is that Keith Whittington compiled them.

He identifies 1,308 Supreme Court cases in which the constitutionality of a congressional statute was drawn into question. In 345 of those cases the Court invalidated a statutory provision or limited its scope on constitutional grounds; in 963 cases, the Court sustained the statute.

* * *

The principal reference point for Whittington’s analysis is a 1957 article by Yale political scientist Robert Dahl. Contrary to the Court’s image after Brown v. Board of Education (1954) as a heroic, powerful policymaker as well as to apprehensions about the undemocratic nature of judicial review, Dahl argued the Court could not resist America’s dominant coalitions for any length of time. Policymaking coalitions appoint judges and Justices, and surely select like-minded jurists. Thus, Dahl predicted, judicial review would be relatively infrequent and, for the most part, hit old or marginal statutes that dominant coalitions no longer cared about. The only exception was the period between 1932 and 1937 when an “old” Court directly challenged a newly dominant political coalition and invalidated several of its major enactments. But that confrontation proved the point: though Franklin Roosevelt’s 1937 “court packing plan” failed, he soon appointed Justices who supported his program.

Dahl’s article produced a gargantuan literature, to which Repugnant Laws marks a substantial contribution. Whittington distinguishes three broad juridical periods: the antebellum era, when judicial review was not uncommon but (in comparison to later decades) fairly infrequent; the Civil War to World War I, when the pace of judicial review sharply increased; and the century since, when rarely a year passed without constitutional challenges to federal statutes. The most natural explanation for this increase is that judicial review’s frequency has moved in tandem with the sheer volume of federal legislation. But Whittington notes that other factors—for example, changes affecting the Court’s jurisdiction—have played a role. And he argues—rightly to my mind—that fluctuations within those extended periods hold greater interest than the grand arc.

* * *

He generally confirms Dahl’s argument. Judicial review is too frequent to deem the Court a mere lapdog of Congress, but decisions upholding federal statutes far outnumber invalidations. As Dahl predicted, moreover, most invalidations have “struck down” old statutes. (“A great deal of judicial review,” Whittington writes, “is concerned with thwarting the will of long-gone political majorities.”) Many other “strike downs” have concerned marginal statutes or provisions. Whittington concludes—on a decidedly Dahlian note—that judicial review “is a fairly low-stakes game. Political leaders can afford to tolerate an independent judiciary with the power to invalidate statutes because the justices generally do little political damage.” And, yes, the early New Deal years really were exceptional.

All that is worth knowing. But in the present political environment Whittington’s analysis strikes a slightly discordant note. If judicial review is “a fairly low-stakes game,” why does everyone fight over judicial appointments to the point of personal destruction? Put differently, what does the historical practice of judicial review really tell us about this Court and judicial review now?

* * *

The court’s principal role has been to enforce the will of dominant national constituencies against dominant state-level constituencies, usually in the recalcitrant South. But this leaves open questions about the Court’s role vis-à-vis coordinate branches of government. Dahl assumed unified political parties, stable partisan majorities, and shared policy preferences among coalitions. That picture, Whittington writes, underestimates the fissures that have characterized our coalitions—fissures that allow courts to “make headway by advancing their own preferences within the band of indifference established by other political actors.” I suspect Dahl would have accepted Whittington’s point as a friendly amendment. The real problems with Dahl’s model lie elsewhere.

One is the common assumption that the Court, in exercising judicial review, butts heads with Congress—the ultimate home of democratic sentiment and dominant political coalitions. Nowadays, the executive is a far more usual target of judicial control, including constitutional review. The present crisis of human affairs is not between the Court and a legislature that draws all power into its impetuous vortex but between the Court and an overbearing executive. Repugnant laws are less a problem than an executive that leaps constitutional bounds.

That, Whittington might object, is a subject for another day. Fair enough (and he has written eloquently about it elsewhere). The decline of Congress as an effective policymaker, however, and the steady accretion of executive power, are bound to affect the data and analysis of judicial review. For example, the Supreme Court has rewritten entire statutes and made up heretofore unheard-of constitutional avoidance doctrines in the firm expectation that Congress can be trusted to do—nothing. (That conviction prompted the Court, sua sponte, to “fix” major portions of the Affordable Care Act and update the ancient Clean Air Act for the wholly unenvisioned purpose of climate change regulation.) Most of what one really wants to know about the Court’s role as a political actor and its relation to the coordinate branches of government is buried in a swamp of subterranean, infra- or quasi-constitutional doctrines, such as judicial “deference” or “hard look” doctrines that may green-light or, occasionally, torpedo massive regulatory programs.

* * *

A second, closely related problem is the question of what Dahl’s “dominant coalitions” tell us about the present Court’s predicament. Ours is a moderately conservative Court with no dominant political coalition behind—or against—it. Instead, Justices operate in an intensely polarized environment in which the institution that really matters—the White House—is dominated now by one party, now by the other. There isn’t anything like this constellation in the standard political science playbook. So then: does an executive-dominated, polarized, politically contested institutional environment increase the Supreme Court’s maneuvering room (because there is no dominant coalition that could retaliate)? Or does it limit the Court’s institutional autonomy, for fear that constitutional decisions regarding executive power might be viewed through a sharply ideological lens—depending on the ruling, as an abject surrender to the executive or as something close to a coup d’etat? Or perhaps because the president has a much narrower “band of indifference” than a fractious Congress?

Calls for speculation, the lawyers might say. But to my mind a little speculation, informed by historical data, analysis, and cautious comparisons, would have further improved Keith Whittington’s landmark contribution.",1,https://claremontreviewofbooks.com/ten-thousand-cases/

Elizabeth Hardwick, Robert Lowell, and Their Circle

by elizabeth hardwick and robert lowell

edited by saskia hamilton

farrar, straus and giroux, 560 pages, $50

In the summer of 1970, Elizabeth Hardwick may have been the best nonfiction prose writer in America, just as Jim Hines was the fastest man alive and Joe Frazier was the heavyweight champion of the world. She was the queen mother of the New York Review of Books, one of its four cofounders and the reviewer feared even by Philip Roth and Norman Mailer. “I think she writes the most beautiful sentences,” Susan Sontag said reverently, “more beautiful sentences than any living American writer.” Isaiah Berlin called her “the cleverest woman I have ever met.”

The trouble with global superlatives is that they rarely mean anything in the real world. Breaking the 100-meter record by milliseconds could not have been of much practical use to Hines, except possibly if his wife had had her purse snatched. If someone had gotten the jump on Frazier in a dark alley, his heavyweight title would not have made him invulnerable.

For Hardwick, the test of her skill came when, after more than twenty years of marriage, Robert Lowell abandoned her for Caroline Blackwood, a flighty Irish aristocrat obviously too shallow to hold his attention. If being the best writer in the world is good for anything, it ought to be good for persuading the man you love to renounce an unworthy rival and come back to you.

She must have been the best, because it worked. It took seven years, but she persuaded Lowell to return. On September 12, 1977, he flew into JFK from Dublin after breaking things off with Caroline. He took a taxi from the airport to Hardwick’s apartment. The doorman called Hardwick downstairs, and she went outside, opened the door of the taxi—and found Lowell dead of a heart attack in the back seat.

It would be quite a story even if the people involved were ordinary. They happened to be geniuses. They wrote everything down, not afterward but as it was happening. In many ways, what they wrote down was what was happening. Saskia Hamilton has now collected it all: Hardwick and ­Lowell’s letters to each other as well as to friends like Mary McCarthy and Elizabeth Bishop, and even letters between third parties about the two of them. The result is a masterpiece.

The title of the book comes from The Dolphin, Lowell’s 1973 sonnet cycle, which had caused a scandal because Lowell had lifted passages from Hardwick’s letters and printed them in the book, with minor alterations. The ­Dolphin tells the story of a poet leaving his wife Lizzie and thirteen-year-old daughter Harriet for a woman named ­Caroline; Lowell did not bother to conceal anyone’s name. Suddenly thousands of people whom ­Hardwick had never met were passing judgment on her merits as a wife and mother. Marjorie Perloff’s review in the New Republic declared Hardwick a “Super-Bitch par excellence” and Harriet, whose letters Lowell also quoted, “one of the most unpleasant child figures in poetry.”

Everyone expected Hardwick to sue the publisher, which in the end she decided not to do, though her initial angry letter to Robert Giroux implies that she considered it. She emphasizes that she objects not just to being quoted but to being quoted inaccurately. Lowell had fiddled with her wording and altered the chronology in ways that misrepresented her.

His greatest misrepresentation was that Lizzie had spent the first six months of their separation begging to have him back. In fact, it was Lowell who had dropped hints about reconciliation that winter. He sent the fateful telegram from England announcing their break on June 20, 1970. He suffered one of his manic episodes the following month, which frightened Caroline into fleeing London. Thus it was Lizzie who flew in from New York to visit him at the hospital, cut his hair, and do his laundry.

In November, Lowell wrote to Mary McCarthy that “I think I’ll end up by returning to Lizzie and ­Harriet” and sent Hardwick a letter beginning “Dearest Lizzie: I wonder if we couldn’t make it up?” A three-week Christmas trip to New York was idyllic. He wrote a warm letter thanking Hardwick for the visit as soon as his plane landed in London. “Above all you stand out at the airport with your curled hair and beautiful smile that survived the long dull wait.”

Lizzie might have had her husband back then and there, after one year rather than seven—but a few weeks later, Caroline Blackwood became ­pregnant.

Caroline does not come off well in this book. The first words we have from her are an insipid letter telling Lowell why she abandoned him during his August 1970 breakdown: “Your sickness is so distressing to me and I am so bound up with you that I can’t help you and will break down again myself.” Later, when friends warned Lowell that he shouldn’t quote his ex-wife’s letters in The Dolphin, Caroline egged him on. The book would surely hurt Lizzie, Lowell wrote in a letter to a friend, but “as Caroline says, it can’t be other­wise with the book’s donnée.”

Lizzie, by contrast, is delightful. Hamilton gives us several months of pre-breakup correspondence between Hardwick and Lowell, showing that the charm and intelligence of her post-breakup letters were not just a stratagem. They were natural to her. She writes to Lowell that Harriet’s feud with her Spanish teacher over an assignment is dragging on “like a suit in Chancery,” and of a party at Jean van den Heuvel’s where she ran into the foreboding figure of Marian Schlesinger, whom Arthur Jr. had just divorced after thirty years of marriage. Marian looked “like a spectre, but quite a heavy one in purple satin. Arthur must have been out of town and so this moment was seized to include the poor abbandonata.”

Contrary to The Dolphin, ­Hardwick played it cool in the first months of their separation. “If you need me I’ll always be there, and if you don’t need me I’ll always not be there,” she writes. “I wish you a long creative life and a long life just for itself. I have contempt for your present situation, but love for you.” It is only after Caroline becomes pregnant and divorce inevitable that we see glimmers of rage, which become blinding in the letter she sent on July 3, 1971. “I really don’t know how to put into words all the strange feelings I suddenly have,” she writes.

You and Caroline have treated Harriet and me with unremitting meanness. But then, what else has she to do with herself? She drifts about, has babies, destroys lives of both men and women who are really serious and deep by her carelessness and spoiled indifference to consequence and the feelings of others. However, with you—it is a different matter. You have been a person of the deepest moral yearnings and it was that person I loved. . . . I loathe ­Caroline and silly little Tories like Grey Gowrie and their destruction of the dear Yankee genius they will never understand. Anyway, I hope you begin to understand Daddy Lowell better and his empty smiling and “happiness.” Sometimes it is the only way one can bear a ruined life. And I think you have ruined your life . . .

I suppose this letter will enrage you, but I am enraged today. . . . Well, be enraged in your turn. I don’t care. I believe what I say and know it to be true. You will never be free of the thing you have killed in yourself and of your ingratitude and lack of loyalty and love. And no child you produce can be more splendid than the one you ­abandoned.

Her previous letter of June 28 mentioned that she had just begun work on an essay about Sylvia Plath, which may have had something to do with her state of mind regarding poet husbands who neglect their gifted wives.

Feminism is a running theme in The Dolphin Letters. Their mutual friend Adrienne Rich thought that being abandoned by ­Lowell would finally convert ­Hardwick to feminism, which she had previously been too Southern to endorse. (Most of feminism was “bad writing, bald simplicity, and simple-mindedness,” she once told Lowell.) Mary ­McCarthy mentioned in one of her letters to Lowell that Hardwick had seemed doubtful about the possibility of reconciling with him when they’d last met and speculated that “the coincidence of Women’s ­Liberation with what she’s been through, with Caroline, has played, I’d guess, quite a role.” Lowell instantly wrote back to ask what she meant by “your ­mysterious sentence about Lizzie and Women’s Lib. What’s that? Do you mean it’s in the air or something closer?”

It was more than in the air; it was on her mind. The book of essays Hardwick published in 1974, Seduction and Betrayal, is all about long-suffering literary women, including Sylvia Plath. The Plath chapter quotes a Ted Hughes poem (published before Sylvia killed herself, incidentally) that says of wives: “Their brief / Goes straight up to heaven and nothing more is heard of it.” Hardwick made sure this would not be her fate.

Of all the wives in Seduction and Betrayal, the one Hardwick resembles most is not Plath but Jane Welsh Carlyle, wife of Thomas Carlyle, a man whose manic tantrums and selfish demands rivaled even Lowell’s. Coincidentally, Lowell’s letter in reply to Hardwick’s July 3 outburst mentions that he is reading “the best novel in English, Jane Welsh’s letters. . . . The best Victorian marriage, in a way the only one, and miserable.” Jane Carlyle, like Hardwick, was esteemed as a genius by the literary men of her day. Dickens thought she wrote better prose than any woman in England. But Jane never published anything. Her reputation was based entirely on her private letters. Ever since The Dolphin tipped us off to the letters’ existence, readers have wondered whether Hardwick, too, put her genius into her correspondence as much as her essays. Now that the letters have finally been published, we know that she did.

Hardwick continued to write after Lowell’s unexpected death, publishing thoughtful reviews in the NYRB and generously mentoring younger critics. She laughed off inquiries into the whereabouts of the Dolphin letters, which she assumed were “lost or gone . . . I suppose he was so busy cutting them up!” In fact, Caroline had found them and sent them to ­Lowell’s literary executor, who delivered them to Harvard with instructions that they should be sealed until Hardwick’s death. When that sad event came in 2007, there was some confusion among obituarists over how to characterize her marriage. Was it a rare love-match between intellectual equals that they should celebrate, or was she a wronged woman on whose behalf they should be indignant? Hardwick had many years in which to ponder that question, and her answer will not surprise readers of The Dolphin Letters. “I didn’t know what I was getting into, but even if I had, I still would have married him,” she told an interviewer. “Of course I suffered a good deal in the alliance, but I very much feel it was the best thing that ever happened to me.”

44,Andrews,Helen,wsj,"A pun inspired the title of George Weigel’s latest book. The sociology professor Peter Rossi was fond of the phrase “many ironies in the fire.” Mr. Weigel sees many ironies in the Catholic Church’s confrontation with what he calls “the fiery brook of modernity.”

By modernity he means the period in the late 19th and early 20th centuries during which a liberalizing, rationalist outlook challenged traditional precepts, creating conflicts over Catholic doctrine and the church’s attitude toward secular democratic governments. This conflict was sometimes fought with guns, as when Garibaldi’s soldiers put an end to the papal states by conquering them for a united Italy; at other times, only with encyclicals, such as the one from Pius X in 1907 that declared modernism “the synthesis of all heresies.”

Two sides defined themselves in opposition to each other. The arch-reactionary Pope Pius IX locked himself up in the Vatican rather than recognize the new Italian state that had seized his territories. His “Syllabus of Errors” deemed it a heresy to assert that the church should “come to terms with progress, liberalism, or modern civilization.” But even as he wrote, theologians were striving to do just that. Over the following decades, Germans like Ignaz von Döllinger applied modern critical methods to the study of Scripture and church history, and Frenchmen like Maurice Blondel tried to reconcile Catholic theology with modern philosophy. The challenge posed by these modernizers eventually made necessary the Second Vatican Council.

The project that faced John Paul II when he became pontiff a decade after that council, and which Mr. Weigel believes he mostly achieved, was how to maintain the Church’s engagement with the modern world while preventing internal modernizers from going too far. And what looked like conflict was often fruitful tension and even collaboration, Mr. Weigel suggests. “Rather than killing Catholicism, the encounter with modernity has helped the Catholic Church rediscover some basic truths about itself,” he writes. “Even more ironically, the Church’s rediscovery of those truths might, just might, put Catholicism in a position to help secular modernity save itself from its own increasing incoherence.”

The trouble with ironies is that, unlike irons, they are delicate. They depend on ambiguities. The settlement that the Catholic Church reached after Vatican II relied on artful vagueness. Liberals and traditionalists within the church didn’t achieve a compromise so much as an uneasy truce.",1,https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-irony-of-modern-catholic-history-review-the-church-challenged-by-change-11569620654

The Case for Radical Politics in an Era of Extreme Inequality

by bhaskar sunkara

basic, 288 pages, $28

In the spring of 2019, even the staid old AFL-CIO began to dabble in guillotine imagery. The occasion was a dispute between Delta and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. The airline had issued a flier reading: “Union dues cost around $700 a year. A new ­video game system with the latest hits sounds like fun. Put your money towards that instead of paying dues to the union.” The AFL-CIO responded by tweeting an image of a flier reading: “A guillotine only costs $1200 to build. Delta’s CEO made $13.2 million dollars last year. Get outside with your buddies, share some brews—sounds like fun.” Five days after sharing the guillotine meme, the AFL-CIO posted a video in which a self-described “marxist, roofer” gives a two-minute lecture about class and exploitation, which it tweeted with the comment: “We all need to seize the means of production.”

Bhaskar Sunkara has written a manifesto for our socialist moment, a moment he did much to create as founder of Jacobin magazine. He has not entirely succeeded in capturing the spirit of his influential quarterly between hardback covers, partly because so much of the Jacobin experience is visual. Its signature style is an eye-catching cross between an IKEA catalogue and a Brian Eno album cover. The front of the Spring 2019 issue, about the housing crisis, looks like a page of futuristic real estate listings with descriptions like “[rose emoji] comrade citizens [rose emoji] register for summer beach house cozy & sunny” and “public pool ~~~gym [arm emoji] newly_­expropriated.”

Sunkara preserves this whimsicality in his book’s first and most ambitious chapter, “A Day in the Life of a Socialist Citizen,” a vision of our cooperative future through the eyes of a worker at a pasta sauce plant owned by Jon Bon Jovi’s family. He describes two alternatives to capitalism. The first is a Nordic-style social democracy in which you, our factory worker, enjoy a cradle-to-grave welfare state, and “even though having children isn’t for you”—Sunkara knows his audience—you “look forward to your frequent vacations.” The second alternative is democratic socialism, which differs from social democracy in featuring worker control of firms and government control of investment. The rest of the book is a breezy tour of the history of socialism from Engels to the present day, in which Sunkara dials down the playfulness, though perhaps not enough in his chapter on “Iron ­Felix” Dzerzhinsky.

The figure from socialist history that Sunkara most resembles is not any of the worthies described in his book but the British publisher Victor Gollancz, another left-wing child of immigrants with an abundance of capitalist hustle. Like Gollancz, Sunkara is an impresario rather than an intellectual. It is a rarer set of skills. For every hundred scribblers, there is one man who can rally those scribblers around a grander vision. Gollancz’s vision was to bring the message of socialism to the masses, which he did by launching the Left Book Club in 1936. A monthly fee bought subscribers one selection from a catalogue of such titles as Red Star Over China, Soviet Policy and Its Critics, and Forward from Liberalism. At its peak, the Left Book Club had more than fifty thousand subscribers and discussion groups in nearly every city in Britain.

Encouragingly for Sunkara, Gollancz won. Socialism came to Britain in 1945 with the election of the Attlee government. Newspapers said that Gollancz had “done more than any other single man to put a Socialist Government in power.” Eight of the ministers in Attlee’s government were Left Book Club authors. In 1936, the trade publication The Bookseller noted that the firm of ­Victor Gollancz, Ltd. was making great strides “in making books about Socialism ‘respectable.’” Ten years and six million books later, socialism was not just respectable. It was in charge.

Of course, Labour’s victory also depended on changes in the composition of the electorate. The 1918 Representation of the People Act tripled the number of voters in Britain, from 7.7 million to 21.4 million, after which the working class was bound to become more influential. America’s contemporary turn toward socialism is demographic, too. The millennial generation is more liberal in part because it is more diverse. Black, Hispanic, and Asian Americans are all more politically liberal than the white majority. In a Pew survey that asked respondents how they felt about ­various political words (“liberal,” “progressive,” “libertarian”), Hispanics had a higher negative response rate to the word “capitalism” than any other group, including supporters of Occupy Wall Street.

There are those who blame the leftward skew of first- and second-­generation immigrants on Republican-­brand toxicity and insufficient minority outreach. But warmed-over Reaganism has lost its hold on its natural constituency. Why should anyone expect it to capture new converts at a time when the old faithful are fleeing in droves? A better explanation is that immigrants import political terms of reference from their home countries, and no nation in Asia, Africa, or Latin America has a political spectrum in which the right pole is anchored by small-government classical liberalism. It would be strange if immigrants from those countries assimilated instantly to something so foreign.

In order to adapt to a more diverse America, the Republican party may need to move away from that unique Anglo-American hothouse flower, small-government conservatism, and closer to the conservatism that exists everywhere else in the world. These global varieties of conservatism are, importantly, strongly anti-socialist.

Right-wing parties in places like Latin America may not be absolutely in love with capitalism, but they are definitely against socialism, which to them means not just overspending but anti-clericalism and state involvement in every sphere of life, with no zones left sacred. When socialism goes too far and creates an economic mess, conservative parties will embrace pure neoliberalism implemented by technocrats (Spain’s ­Stabilization Plan of 1959, Brazil’s Plano Real of 1994), but when the crisis is over, those technocrats ­realize that their ideas have no popular support. In the absence of an ­emergency, the default economic policy of the average right-wing party is something closer to Trumpian economic nationalism.

One reason America is having a socialist moment is that our working class is in terrible condition, battered by the twin forces of economic globalization and mass immigration. In a tragic irony, at the very moment in the 1990s when politicians had to decide how to confront these challenges, the parties of the working class were captured by neoliberal triangulators like Bill Clinton and Tony Blair, whose loyalties were to the meritocratic elite. The liberal parties of the Western democracies were supposed to be the most powerful vehicles in human history for the political power of the common man. Instead, those parties now represent the interests of “woke capital,” that is, corporations that are equally committed to unfettered markets and liberal social causes and don’t hesitate to use their power under the former to enforce the latter.

The great question in American politics now is which party will take up the cause of the abandoned working class. The answer will depend on which is easier to defeat, zombie Reaganism or woke capitalism. I am not optimistic about the ability of Sunkara and his followers to defeat woke capital on behalf of workers. He can’t even read the state of the battlefield correctly. He claims that “the substantive victories in civil rights for LGBT people . . . came from grassroots mobilization, not Democratic initiatives.” But the forces of wealth and power were decisively on his side in that one.

He can’t tell when capital is on his side, and he can’t tell when it isn’t. If Sunkara’s brand of socialism has a central weakness, it is this: its failure to realize that corporations embrace the modern progressive agenda precisely because so much of it makes workers weaker. Subsidized abortion and contraception, which Sunkara endorses as female empowerment, are loved by corporations because they like it when women put off childbearing until forty. Employees without children are more tractable, willing to work longer hours for lower pay. The borderless, high-immigration world supported by the progressive left serves to keep wages low more than it serves its ostensible purpose of anti-racism. Wall Street was given a scare by Occupy, but it doubled down on wokeness and its reward has been left-wing acclaim, as exemplified by the Vox headline claiming that “Corporations Are Replacing Churches as America’s Conscience.”

I have more faith in the possibility of defeating zombie Reaganism. For one thing, Donald Trump is currently president of the United States. And zombie Reaganism is intellectually weak. The conservatives who resist any departure from free-market orthodoxy all love the graph that shows global capitalism lifting billions of people out of extreme poverty in the last forty years. But the majority of those billions have been in east Asia. The policies that brought prosperity to South Korea, Taiwan, and above all, China have not been those advocated by the Republican old guard. Nothing succeeds like success, and these days free-market absolutism doesn’t have success on its side any more than socialism does.

Without knowing anything else about him, try to guess the political affiliation of the man who delivered this speech:

Today’s society benefits those who shaped it, and it has been shaped not by working men and women but by the new aristocratic elite. Big banks, big tech, big multi-national corporations, along with their allies in the academy and the media—these are the aristocrats of our age. . . . They’ve effectively run this country for decades. And their legacy is national division and decline.

That’s Sen. Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, on the floor of the Senate in May. The things that are attractive in socialism are present in his speech: the appeal to the dignity of ordinary people and to solidarity; the insistence that we can imagine a better future, that it doesn’t have to be this way. Sunkara has made his pitch. Conservatives like Hawley are making theirs. We will find out which one the working class prefers in the next election.

46,Andrews,Helen,wsj,"Most Americans now have in their pockets a computer that can call up the greatest riches of human civilization at the tap of a forefinger, and we use them to look at cat videos. Is there something wrong with us? Simon May thinks so. “The Power of Cute” is a pint-size book with an ambitious aim: to explain the zeitgeist of the Instagram age.

The first challenge facing Mr. May, who teaches philosophy at King’s College London, is to define what he means by “cute.” Clearly size has something to do with it; people are drawn to babylike things, for reasons evolutionary psychologists have elaborated. But to be cute is not merely to be diminutive. The wedding staged by P.T. Barnum between Tom Thumb and 32-inch-tall Lavinia Bump was cute. The dwarves painted by Velázquez in “Las Meninas” are not. The best definition of cuteness unearthed by Mr. May is from the 11th-century “Pillow Book” of Sei Shonagon, the courtier poetess of Heian Japan. “All small things are most adorable,” she writes, offering as her exemplum “the face of a child drawn on a melon.”

Ten centuries later, Japan is still the world capital of cute. The term for it, kawaii, is “the most widely used, widely loved, habitual word in modern living Japanese,” according to the visual artist Takashi Murakami. The government of Japan in 2009 appointed its own official ambassadors of cute: three young women in frilly bows and polka dots who look like living anime characters. The two most quintessentially cute Japanese exports, Pokémon and Hello Kitty, each generate billions of dollars a year in revenue.

Mr. May dates the Japanese obsession with cuteness to World War II. His theory (and he is not the first to propose it) is that cuteness offered a way for the country to shed its reputation for militarism and present a harmless face to the world. “Germany does remorse, Japan does Cute,” he says. The ingredients for this aesthetic were present before 1945, in the miniature arts of bonsai and origami or the high-pitched, deferential giggle cultivated by geishas. But in the decades after the defeat, cuteness became a national obsession. Mr. Murakami complains that kawaii has “castrated” his country. Mr. May suggests that this was the point.

America is rapidly approaching Japanese levels of saturation in cuteness. Websites like Buzzfeed have built media empires by betting on readers’ limitless appetite for photos of, say, baby squirrels stretching. Nor is cuteness confined to the digital realm. New York, Los Angeles and Cleveland now have cat cafes where patrons can get fluffy cuddles with their cupcakes. Crumbs & Whiskers in Washington, D.C., takes appointments, and features a room called the Kitten Lounge, for those who disdain older cats as past their cuteness prime.",1,https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-power-of-cute-review-danger-totally-adorbs-11556898082
47,Andrews,Helen,washingtonexaminer,"When Maryann White, who describes herself as a ""Catholic mom,"" wrote a letter to the editor of the Notre Dame student newspaper asking women to think twice about wearing form-fitting leggings, she did her best to be diplomatic. ""You have every right to wear them. But you have every right to choose not to.""

White was prompted to write her letter after seeing a row of snugly clad rumps in the pew in front of her family at Mass. Now, I can think of many reasons to be against wearing leggings to church, beginning with the fact that it's tacky. The blessed sacrament is supposed to be a more solemn event than Bikram yoga. But White chose to found her objection on the temptation that leggings present to hotblooded males, and so an avalanche of outraged feminists duly descended upon her.

The campus group Irish 4 Reproductive Health organized a Leggings Pride Day, and users as far afield as France posted leggings-wearing selfies to Twitter to protest the reactionary suggestion that sexually provocative dress is not the height of female empowerment. Poor Mrs. White's efforts to be diplomatic earned her no goodwill from the haunch-flaunters. Her letter pleaded, very reasonably, ""Could you think of the mothers of sons the next time you go shopping and consider choosing jeans instead?"" Jeans? To church? Next time, bearing in mind how little good was accomplished by her efforts to compromise with the forces of casual fashion, the Catholic mom is advised to go all the way in her defense of dignified dress at religious services.",1,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/not-a-legging-to-stand-on
48,Andrews,Helen,washingtonexaminer,"Which is more scrupulous, the #MeToo movement or McCarthyism?

The original McCarthyism, I mean — that of the blacklist and the Hollywood Ten, of which the junior senator from Wisconsin was only ever a small part. The anti-Communists whose banner he picked up were, on the whole, more serious and conscientious than Joseph McCarthy himself. For all the publicity and energy he brought to their cause, it was ultimately their misfortune to have become entangled with a namesake whose tactics were not always befitting the seriousness of the threat against which they fought.

The #MeToo movement has become entangled with its own toxic form of hysteria, in its case the tactics of the online mob. The so-called Shitty Media Men List is a good example. In October 2017, a writer in her early 20s named Moira Donegan created a spreadsheet for women to list men working in media who were guilty of sexual misconduct and invited her friends to add to it. The spreadsheet was shared around New York and Washington, eventually listing 70 names. The accusations ranged in seriousness from rape to “creepy DMs.” All were anonymous. Several of the men lost their jobs after the list was leaked on social media, including such pillars of elite journalism as Leon Wieseltier and Paris Review editor Lorin Stein.

This, you might say, was a classic blacklist, right down to the anonymity of the accusers. Which raises the question: How can this sort of thing still happen? Didn’t we establish the last time around that this method of dealing with national problems, even serious ones, was more trouble than it was worth? A closer look at the terminal stages of McCarthyism reveals that it did not come to an end because Americans got together and decided as a country that collective hysteria should be put on hold until the facts about an accused’s case are in. McCarthyism didn’t end because it was unpopular. It ended because a court case made the blacklisting of suspected Communists illegal. The case was Faulk v. Aware, Inc., and its story begins with a publication called Red Channels. The men behind Red Channels were textbook McCarthyites, but they also respected certain ground rules of fairness and due process that their modern successors in #MeToo have preferred to disregard.

The three men responsible for Red Channels all joined the FBI in 1940 and were assigned to the bureau’s Communist Squad. Their duties were infiltrating Russian spy operations and handling various moles and informers. After six years, they left the FBI, partly because the bureau wasn’t allowing them to go after spies as aggressively as they wanted but mostly because they came to believe that the biggest obstacle in the fight against Communism was public apathy. Basic facts about the scope of Communist operations in the U.S. that were obvious to them from their work were completely unknown to the wider public. They therefore decided to start a magazine called Counterattack, in order to, as their mission statement put it, “assist in changing emotional dislike of Communism to informed and documented knowledge.”

Counterattack focused at first on union movements and left-wing activist groups. It pivoted to the entertainment industry after one of the founders came across an amateur pamphlet in an office where he’d gone to sell subscriptions. This document, which was being passed around the offices of advertisers and radio producers, was titled “most undesirable” and gave a list of names of actors and writers to be blacklisted for Communist ties. No explanation of why an individual was on the list, no evidence offered, no indication of who had compiled the list. Just the names. The Counterattack team thought that wasn’t right. They decided to make a more ethical version of the list, “lay it all on the line and sell it over the counter to try to clear the air.”

Communist infiltration of the entertainment industry was a less serious threat than spies in the State Department, but the matter was hardly frivolous. If Communists took over the relevant unions and guilds, they would be in a position to bring production to a standstill any time they liked, giving them effective veto power over what got produced. The nightmare scenario that kept the Counterattack team awake was not that lyrics from “The Internationale” would be slipped into the next Gene Autry picture. It was that someone would replicate the panic caused by Orson Welles’ ""War of the Worlds"" on purpose, in order to create a political crisis.

Counterattack hired a researcher who specialized in Communist infiltration of the entertainment business named Vincent Hartnett, an Irish Catholic from Queens with a masters in apologetics from Notre Dame, where he studied under the Russian emigre Waldemar Gurian, one of the world’s leading experts on Bolshevism. After Pearl Harbor, Hartnett had joined up and become a naval intelligence officer in the Pacific. He stayed on through the postwar years, posted to Eastern Europe, where he observed firsthand the slow-motion Soviet takeover of the governments of Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Romania, seeing for himself all the ways Communists manipulated the democratic process to get themselves into power and then implement one-party rule.

The resulting pamphlet, Red Channels: The Report of Communist Influence in Radio and Television, was a bare-bones affair, not much more than a directory: 151 names, each with a list of the Communist front groups they had been associated with and the nature of their involvement. The entries were almost entirely based on public documents. If it said that so-and-so had appeared at a Henry Wallace rally in 1948, it was because Hartnett had a copy of a Daily Worker article about that rally. The only editorializing in Red Channels was in the introduction, where it emphasized that being listed did not necessarily mean that someone was a Communist or even a sympathizer, only that they had associations that raised questions about their judgment and warranted further inquiry from prospective employers or advertisers.

Not everyone listed in Red Channels saw their careers suffer (Uta Hagen and Gypsy Rose Lee were fine). One who did was an actor named Joe Julian, who decided to sue Red Channels for libel. The first judge assigned to the case recused himself because of his ties to left-wing organizations, which were thought might prejudice him against the defendants. The case ended up being heard by Irving Saypol, who earlier in his career had been the prosecutor in the Rosenberg spy case. As one might expect from the man who sent Julius and Ethel to the electric chair, he ended up dismissing the actor’s case, saying that Red Channels had done nothing more than list facts that, as Julian himself acknowledged, were entirely accurate. They had also done it not out of malice but for a legitimate public purpose, and they had urged their readers to use the information in Red Channels responsibly.

In 1953, Hartnett launched his own operation separate from Counterattack: Aware, Inc., which was more of a consulting firm than a publishing house. Producers would hire him to investigate actors and screenwriters that they were thinking of hiring, the idea being that Hartnett was an expert who could tell the difference between a harmless liberal and an actual Communist sympathizer. Hartnett also continued to put out various newsletters and circulars, including one explaining how an actor or writer could get himself unblacklisted by publicly demonstrating his opposition to Communism.

One of these circulars mentioned a radio personality named John Henry Faulk, a folksy storyteller from Texas. The pamphlet described him as having a long history of involvement in Communist front groups, which it listed with the relevant dates and circumstances. Faulk was let go from his job at CBS soon thereafter — they said because his ratings weren’t very good, he said because of the blacklist. It had been a few years since the last libel case, so Faulk, with the help of $7,500 from Edward R. Murrow to cover his legal fees, decided to take his chances and sue Hartnett. As in the previous case, a lot came down to the judge. The judge selected for the case was the same judge who had recused himself the last time: Geller. This time he did not recuse himself.



He had it right the first time, because in the second his handling of the case was absurdly biased. Geller ruled inadmissible almost all of the evidence that Hartnett offered to back up his assertion that Faulk had ties to Communist front groups. Geller put no stock at all in Hartnett’s expertise, saying, “On the question of Communism, I don’t understand the concept of an expert on Communism. An expert has to be an expert on a scientific subject or something of that character.”

Frankly, Geller could have used the services of an expert in Communism himself, because his grasp of how front groups operated was woefully deficient. Hartnett’s attorney, Tom Bolan, attempted at one point to cite the congressional testimony of former Communist Party operative Louis Budenz, who had told the Senate that one of the ostensibly independent left-wing groups Faulk had been involved with “was worked out originally from my office when I was managing editor of the Daily Worker."" Geller ruled that this testimony could not be cited as proof that the group in question was a Communist front. He added from the bench that Budenz “doesn’t even say that this is a communist front. He says ‘was worked out’ in the office [of the Daily Worker]” — as if that were merely a coincidence.

Bolan tried to cite the U.S. attorney general’s official list of groups with Communist ties, but Geller ruled the document inadmissible. Transcripts from the House Un-American Activities Committee were likewise disallowed. “Those citations, as I have already told the jury, are not binding and do not constitute a finding — a proper finding. It must be a judicial finding,” Geller explained to a frustrated Bolan, who could hardly believe that the judge was placing such narrow limits on his client’s ability to use the term “Communist-linked.” But Geller was emphatic: “Listings by the House Committee or Attorney General do not constitute a judicial finding that an organization is a Communistic or pro-Communistic front organization.”

Even when Bolan tried to read excerpts from Aware’s bylaws, in order to give the jury some idea of what the company’s mission was, Geller prevented him from quoting these documents, saying they were nothing more than “self-serving declarations.” Eventually Bolan got so frustrated with Geller’s constant interventions that he was on the verge of tears. Bolan said, his voice quavering, “I wish you wouldn’t be shouting at me throughout the trial, as you have done from the very beginning. It gets to the point where the pressure is too great for me. You have done it from the beginning.”

Unsurprisingly, given that Hartnett was forbidden from citing any of the evidence he had used when compiling his dossiers, the jury ruled in Faulk’s favor, handing him what was, at that time, the largest damages award in any libel case in American history: $3.5 million. Hartnett knew he was in trouble when the jury foreman came back in the middle of deliberations and asked the judge if they were allowed to award the plaintiff more money than he had asked for.

The amount was eventually brought down on appeal to a mere six figures, but Hartnett and his company were broke, so he was stuck sending little checks to Faulk every month for the rest of his life. Hartnett retired to become an English teacher at a high school in Pelham, N.Y. The author of a book about Red Channels visited the school in the early 2000s and found that students and colleagues remembered Hartnett as an exceptionally kind and caring teacher, if a little reluctant to talk about his political beliefs.

Hartnett was a nice Catholic boy from Queens trying to do what he thought was right, and in the end, he suffered for it. Donegan is a self-described “angry feminist writer” who walked away from the Shitty Media Men List scandal with a regular column in the Guardian and a book deal from Simon & Schuster.

But her story is not over yet, because one of the men on the list is suing her for defamation. Stephen Elliott is co-founder of the online magazine the Rumpus and the author of eight books. His entry on Donegan’s spreadsheet tarred him with “rape accusations, sexual harassment, coercion, [and] unsolicited invitations to his apartment.” He claims total innocence and is suing Donegan for $1.5 million. He also wants Google to trace the Internet service providers of contributors to the original spreadsheet so he can face his anonymous accuser.

The legal case, filed in October 2018, is ongoing. Morally, the case is open and shut. Of the two blacklisters, Hartnett was far more scrupulous in his methods than Donegan. A side-by-side comparison: Red Channels had standards of proof and was based on hard evidence, such as congressional testimony or printed stories from the Daily Worker; Donegan’s list was based on anonymous accusations and hearsay. Red Channels was public; Donegan’s list was distributed secretly. Hartnett actively encouraged the people he listed to come forward and clear their names, even offering to do everything he could, pro bono, to help them demonstrate they had put their Communist ties behind them; Donegan had a rule against removing anyone’s name from the list, because removing a name would invalidate the suffering of the ""survivor"" who had listed it and we need to #BelieveWomen.

When your methods make the Cold War’s most notorious blacklist look soberly judicial by comparison, it is time to re-examine your methods. Donegan herself has expressed no regrets, but what about her enablers? The editors who would never greenlight a story based on anonymous and unsubstantiated allegations but who allow their reporters to write about online controversies in a way that amounts to the same thing? The bosses who immediately fire employees at the center of social media hurricanes even when they proclaim their innocence? Unless the courts deliver a Faulk v. Aware–type blow to any would-be Donegans, it will be up to these enablers to put a stop to this era of seemingly all-powerful social media mobs. Because if there is one lesson to be drawn from the McCarthy era, it’s that they won’t stop as long as it works.

49,Andrews,Helen,washingtonexaminer,"A press release announcing the American Psychological Association’s new Guidelines for Psychological Practice with Boys and Men starts off by apologizing for talking about men at all. “This may seem unnecessary. For decades, psychology focused on men (particularly white men), to the exclusion of all others.”

In fact, the opposite is true. Women have outnumbered men among mental health patients since the 19th century. (To say nothing of the prominence of Jean-Martin Charcot’s experiments on female “hysterics” in modern psychology courses.) If it hates talking about men so much, the APA should have stuck with its first instinct and said nothing at all, since the “guidelines” amount to a jargon-laden declaration of war against everyone with a Y chromosome.

The document, which establishes best practices for psychology professionals, is an indiscriminate grab bag of grievances, all of which its authors attribute to “masculinity ideology.” No distinction is made between serious problems, such as men’s higher suicide rates, and the not so serious one, such as men not wanting to eat their vegetables or talk about their feelings. Everything from homicide rates to heart disease is deemed the fault of toxic masculinity, which psychologists are requested to undermine by instilling their patients with an open-mindedness about gender norms.

Entirely ignored are the ways egalitarianism is responsible for many of the problems cited. Fewer men than women now attend college. How can this be blamed on toxic masculinity when the trend has coincided with the switch to universal coeducation? Maybe male students would do better if their classrooms were a little more masculine. Men report having fewer close friends than women. Could it be because the last bastions of male-only socializing have been eradicated by anti-discrimination lawsuits over the past 50 years? There was never any shortage of close friendships among the all-male cadets at the Virginia Military Institute.

The worst part about the document is the tortured English in which it is written. “Prescriptions and proscriptions for behaviors that either align with or contradict the dominant ideal of masculinity are not linear, uniform, or without resistance.” Speaking as a member of the more voluble sex, if that’s how they expect people to talk, I would prefer a bit of stoic silence.",1,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/not-so-toxic-masculinity
50,Andrews,Helen,claremont,"The word “crisis” hardly captures the dismal situation in Indian Country. Consider just one statistic: the leading cause of death for Indian boys ages 10 to 14 is suicide. In fact, suicide among Native American youths is more than twice the U.S. average, and in Canada, five to seven times the national average. Last April, eleven members of the Attawapiskat First Nation attempted suicide on a single day. Nine were children.

What’s causing this despair? The answer typically offered is racism—which is correct, but not in the sense usually meant. In The New Trail of Tears, Naomi Schaefer Riley, a columnist and former Wall Street Journal editor, explains that Indian policy is a spider web of rules and bureaucracy, converging on one central point: the interests of governments—federal, state, and tribal—routinely trump individual Native Americans’ rights and wishes, ensnaring them in a collectivism subversive of every value necessary to a flourishing society.

Take property rights. Indian country contains some of the continent’s richest natural resource deposits and loveliest tourist destinations. Yet reservation land, generally, cannot be individually owned—it’s owned either by the whole tribe, or by the federal government “in trust” for the tribe. This means it cannot be mortgaged, so it cannot serve as collateral to start businesses or build infrastructure. Layers of federal bureaucracy require multiple permits before Indians can develop land, and tribal governments add their own restrictions on top of that. Thus, writes Riley, “Indian land has become all but useless to Indians themselves.”

The situation is aggravated by a legal system that blocks tribal prosecution of non-Indians for crimes on reservations, and immunizes tribal governments from lawsuits—both of which undermine the legal security necessary for businesses to operate. Unemployment on the Navajo Nation, which is more than twice the size of Massachusetts and home to 175,000 people, is 42%. The average per capita income is $7,269. On the San Carlos Apache reservation, it’s about half that.

* * *

The problems aren’t just legal. One of Riley’s key insights is that identity politics, leftist propaganda, and the welfare state have crippled the mores essential to growth. The notion that “true” Native culture means prelapsarian socialism and the priority of tribal group rights over individualism is worse than false—it’s a racist fantasy concocted by whites who were either seduced by Rousseauian visions of the noble savage or were eager to rationalize Indian removal. Riley quotes one Native leader: “the concept that we never had private property has been foisted upon us.” But that myth has taken such firm root in everything from Disney films to sociology departments that it’s almost unquestioned, even among Natives themselves.

Actually, pre-contact Indians had a robust understanding of private property and were notoriously individualistic. And the disastrous consequences of Western collectivist myths were early noted. The Pequot William Apess, bemoaning the state of New England reservations, complained that Indians “are made to believe they are minors and have not the abilities given them from God, to take care of themselves, [except for making and selling] a few little articles, such as baskets and brooms. Their land is in common stock, and they have nothing to make them enterprising.” He wrote that in 1833.

Things worsened in the century that followed. A series of laws beginning in the 1930s organized today’s tribal governments—forcing groups like the Navajo to choose chiefs when they’d never had any—and elevated government interests over individual rights. Alongside the federal “trust” system, these laws ensured that every necessity of reservation life—education, medicine, housing, employment, and even tribal membership—would come under bureaucratic control. “Indians,” writes Riley, “are the most overregulated race on the planet.” Yet thanks to Supreme Court neutering of the Indian Civil Rights Act, tribal officials aren’t limited by the constitutional rules that protect Americans against state governments, despite the fact that all American Indians are citizens of the United States.

* * *

Centralized planning on reservations stifles individual initiative, all but forbids construction, and offers still more government programs as virtually the only solution. It has, in the words of the Harvard Project on American Indian Economic Development, “maximized the politicization of investment and employment decisions.” That, in turn, maximizes the power of politicians at the expense of tribal citizens, whose only alternative is often the dole. The moral consequences are a crippling culture of anti-individualism and broken families.

Nothing about this is unique to Indians. “The cultural problems on Indian reservations,” Riley concludes, “are really the results of economic and political circumstances that have been foisted upon Indians. If you live in a place where there are no jobs and no access to capital, not working becomes the norm. Any entrepreneurial impulse you have is quickly squelched.” Any group subjected to this mess of infantilizing social science experiments would come out the same. J.D. Vance’s bestselling Hillbilly Elegy (2016) reveals a similar pattern at work among Appalachian whites, where poverty and addiction are prolonged by a mix of entitlement and despair. People come to see success as a lucky stroke, not the result of devoted effort.

Psychologists call this “learned helplessness.” If the malady is concentrated on reservations, that’s because patronizing government policies are so entrenched there—shielded by white romanticism and, on the Native side, an us-versus-them mentality that summarily dismisses criticism as racist. Dependency is not part of any Native American culture, Riley notes. But stifling government policies have now made it the norm.

* * *

Still, Riley’s book is not bleak. on the contrary, she profiles several heroic individuals who are today fighting the odds—and often fighting tribal governments—to improve the lives of Native Americans.

There’s Whispering Pines Chief Mike Lebourdais, who is pushing for legislation to roll back restrictions on native land ownership in Canada. Sadly, the obstacles seem enormous. “The biggest opposition, Lebourdais says, has come from other First Nations…. Aboriginal people in Canada ‘think property ownership is a white thing.’”

There’s Minnesota Chippewa lawyer Mark Fiddler, who defends the rights of children subject to the 1978 Indian Child Welfare Act. That Act imposes a separate set of rules for child welfare and adoption proceedings involving children of Native ancestry—and is often a powerful tool for ideologues who think abused or neglected Indian kids should never be adopted by people of other races. It even bars state courts from using the “best interests of the child” test that ordinarily governs cases involving children. In 2013, Fiddler successfully represented the adoptive couple in the headline-grabbing “Baby Veronica” case, in which a Cherokee father who abandoned his child in utero tried to veto the adoption arranged by the child’s non-Indian, unwed mother. “The theory behind [the Act] is that Indian children won’t be screwed up as long as they’re parented by Indians,” says Fiddler. But what matters to children isn’t race-matching; it’s loving, permanent homes.

And there’s Ben Chavis in California, a Lumbee who worked his way from poverty to earn three Ph.D.s, a fortune in real estate, and a successful tenure as principal of the American Indian Public Charter School (AIPCS) in Oakland. Thanks to his strict discipline and traditional teaching, AIPCS was rated the best high school in the United States, all of its students passing at least one Advanced Placement test. He now runs a school on a North Carolina farm. “Chavis sees American Indians as immigrants to the dominant American culture,” writes Riley. “They’re poor, just like immigrants, and starting from behind, so he’s proposing strategies that have helped immigrants succeed.”

* * *

Sadly, some Indians have what Riley calls “the opposite of an immigrant mentality.” Where immigrants typically hope their children will move up the economic ladder, some Indian parents and activists preach against the American Dream. This is partly an understandable reaction to unjust government policies that until recently outlawed Native religions, forced kids into boarding schools, and sought—in the infamous words of Richard Pratt, founder of the Carlisle Indian School—to “kill the Indian to save the man.” But insularity is a major obstacle to the improvement of life for Native people. Consider Blackfeet lawyer Gyasi Ross’s warning to Native students that “western education is assimilation,” and that “when Native people go away…from the rez for education, and then…just live in middle class splendor away from their homelands…that’s not positive.” Living a fulfilling life of one’s own, Ross thinks, means “buying fully into the assimilation lie.”

Jules, Fiddler, and Chavis prove that such race-first collectivism isn’t shared by all Native Americans, but it’s common enough to sap the ambition of countless youth and to breed hopeless alienation. And such dogma isn’t just reactionary, it’s fundamentally racist. It classifies Natives as the property of tribal communes—just as imperialists and white supremacists regarded them in past ages—rather than as equal individuals in charge of their own destinies. Whether offered by Jacksonians in the 1830s or race-obsessed activists in 2016, it’s the same old serpent that says the pursuit of happiness is for other people.

Nothing today can undo the Sand Creek Massacre or the Trail of Tears. But it is within our power to open the door of opportunity for our fellow citizens. Doing so requires that they cease to be regarded as a separate people. “[Y]ou ask yourselves, ‘What do they, the Indians, want?’” wrote William Apess. “[Y]ou have only to look at the unjust laws made for them, and say, ‘They want what I want,’ in order to make men of them, good and wholesome citizens.”",1,https://www.claremont.org/crb/article/losing-ground/
51,Andrews,Helen,herandrews,"Originally published in the June 2015 issue of Quadrant.

It was at one of the smaller towns along the Trans-Siberian Railway, one of the two-minute stops that are so easy to miss altogether between Novosibirsk and Krasnoyarsk, that the government inspectors boarded our train. My husband Timothy and I were alerted to their presence when the stewardess who had taken our tickets came to our cabin shortly after 9 p.m. and told us that “inspectors of the regime” were aboard, and could we please lock our door and not open it for any reason until she came to fetch us. We did as she said, and also closed the window curtains. It was not necessary to turn out the lights, for we had not figured out how to turn them on or indeed whether they were working or broken. The last thing Timothy said before we lapsed into silence was, “This supports my bribe theory.”

We had good reason to suspect that our presence on the train was not perfectly legal. When we had presented our paperwork at the station in Ekaterinburg, the stewardess had furrowed her brow and fetched the conductor, who looked at our tickets and pointed out that they were for the wrong month. My husband, who had made all of our travel bookings, rent his garments. The conductor thought for a moment then took our passports and told us to follow him.

He led us into a different car of the train and down the corridor to a large private cabin with a wide door, which he told us we could have if we paid half price for replacement tickets in cash, equivalent to several hundred American dollars. We told him we would have to find an ATM at the next station, as there wasn’t enough time before departure to find one now. He glanced at the stewardess, who had followed us, and said that would be fine.

These negotiations were all conducted in Russian, which my husband speaks almost but not quite like a native. His grandmother was born in the White Russian enclave of Kharbin, in Chinese Manchuria, shortly after the Bolshevik Revolution, and like many White kharbintsy she found her way to Australia in the 1950s. Growing up in Sydney, Timothy spoke Russian at home—émigré Russian, which has its archaisms and corruptions but is closer to what you hear in Moscow than, say, Quebecois to French.

My own grandmother was born in Kalamazoo, Michigan, so I understood none of the conductor’s long speech as he showed us our new cabin. All I caught was his repetition of the word “invalid . . . invalid.” I assumed this referred to our tickets and was his way of driving home that we were aboard strictly on sufferance. In fact he was explaining that this was the handicapped cabin. Timothy set down his duffel bag on the bunk and said, “I suppose when I pay him I shouldn’t ask for a receipt.”

As we waited for the government inspectors to pass, Timothy and I held each other in a tight embrace. We lay on the same narrow bunk because to unlatch and pull down the upper bunk would have made too much noise. Also, I imagined at the time that if the inspectors did knock and then force open our door, an embrace might suggest by way of excuse that we had failed to respond because they had caught us in flagrante. In the event, no excuse was necessary. Thirty minutes later, we heard footsteps in the corridor—clicking heels, not the shuffling flats of the stewardesses or the thumping loafers of the conductor. They halted outside our door for a moment and then moved on.

The last I heard of the inspector was her rifling through the hallway trash bin. Not to take it out, just to rifle. I checked afterwards and the herring I had deposited at Omsk was still there. Who knows what she was looking for—perhaps cigarette butts, since smoking had been banned on all trains within the Russian Federation just two weeks before. A few minutes later the stewardess returned to give us the all clear.

* * * * *

When we boarded the train in Ekaterinburg, we were still officially in Europe, not yet over the spine of the Urals. When at last we disembarked at Irkutsk, we were into Siberia proper. Our host there was a lawyer whose name we had been given by the Russian Scouts in Sydney, who had met him at an international jamboree the previous year. The Irkutsk troop had been founded in the 1990s, shortly after the repeal of Soviet-era laws prohibiting all scouting groups except the Young Pioneers. In Australia, the first Russian Scout flag was raised in Bathurst in 1950. Timothy’s mother had been a Russian Girl Guide when she was younger, alongside the boys who would grow up to be Timothy’s scoutmasters. Our Irkutsk scoutmaster was just old enough to have missed ever having been a scout himself.

He took us sightseeing along the Angara River the morning after we arrived. Standing on the marble plaza where we joined the riverside pedestrian path, I could see on the opposite bank a children’s theatre. With its white exterior and its roof of nested triangular peaks, it looked so much like a cut-rate Sydney Opera House that I took a picture. Timothy asked if this waterway was much used by commercial ships.

“The word you use for ‘ships,’ no one would say that,” the lawyer said. “It is derived from the word for ‘steam.’ In 1917 this was correct, but now it is very antiquated.”

Further on we came to a statue of Yermak, the father of Russian Siberia, facing away from the river with a rifle in his hand. The lawyer referred to him as an “explorer,” which is rather an understated way of describing the frontiersmanship of a sixteenth-century Cossack. Yermak’s men were a fell crew even by Cossack standards. When word arrived at the court of Ivan the Terrible that Yermak had graciously donated his newly subjugated eastern lands to the tsar’s domains, the first thing Ivan did was to pardon the messenger, for the hetman Yermak had appointed as his emissary was wanted for murder and had a bounty on his head. It is reported that Yermak’s band were eager to take on such a farflung mission in the first place because several of them had similar warrants nipping at their heels. If this is true, then Russian Siberia was used for the relocation of criminals not only from its infancy but from the moment of its conception.

Siberia became the Botany Bay of Russia, particularly after the discovery of gold and precious metals opened the territory to mining in the 18th century. The problem was not so much a need for labor—the mines paid well enough that there was no shortage—but the need to fill a vast wilderness with enough Slavic bodies that Siberia and its resources would be internationally acknowledged as belonging to Russia. There were only a quarter of a million natives in the entire Siberian territory before Yermak’s conquest—fewer than Australia, half its size, had when Cook landed. Thankfully the populations coexisted more peacefully in Siberia, due to flourishing trade and a shared love of chess.

In 1762, landlords were given the right to banish serfs to Siberia on their own authority, and for the next century the number of exiles averaged nearly ten thousand per year. Only a small fraction were ever required to perform hard labor, the notorious katorga of Dostoevsky’s House of the Dead. Most were simply resettled. Transportation was officially ended by Nicholas II in 1899, not for humanitarian reasons but because the free yeomen who had been streaming into Siberia since the abolition of serfdom had become sufficiently numerous, established, and self-confident to object to their region being used as a dumping ground for European Russian felonry. An official history of Siberia published in 1900 by the Ministry of Communication credited Nicholas’s ukase with “removing from Siberia the shameful stain attached to it as a place of exile.”

Our lawyer steered us away from the river and back to the central district, where he handed us off to another scoutmaster, a woman, and went back to his office. We did not see him again until he came to bid us farewell at the station—dressed in seersucker, the only Siberian I ever saw so attired. Unlike the lawyer, the lady scoutmaster spoke some English, and at a café over milkshakes she asked how I thought Russia compared to Australia.

Timothy hastened to clarify that I was actually an American. I explained that I had moved to Sydney from North Carolina only a few years before. In answer to her question, I said that Siberia and Australia seemed to me to have a lot in common.

“Really?”

I mentioned low population density—hardly the most striking similarity, but I did not want to lead with the convict stain. I further padded my answer with allusion to rugged and overwhelming landscapes and economies based primarily on resource extraction before finally noting certain similarities shared by the two as former penal colonies: a refusal to hold far-off authorities in awe, a proud self-reliance, and on the other hand a willingness to go to the wall for the other bloke because he’d do the same for you. Whether this heritage is the consequence of any cultural influence on the criminals’ part or simply a product of the geographic attributes that make a region suitable for convict settlement in the first place, like remoteness and harsh climate, I declined to speculate.

None of this made her smile, but then Russians do not have the habit of smiling to show that they are listening to you.

“We don’t really think about that. I have a friend in England who sent us a book, big, like this. The title was just ‘Russia.’ We looked up Siberia to see what it said about Irkutsk, Lake Baikal—all it said was ‘gulag’!”

The distinction between Soviet and tsarist systems of exile did not seem a likely avenue of discussion, so I told her how much I had enjoyed the walk through Irkutsk, and how I regretted that we would not have time to see the monument to the Decembrist wives. The memorial, which I had seen in a guidebook, depicts Maria Volkonskaya, the most famous of the women who voluntarily followed their husbands to Siberia after the abortive officers’ revolt of December 1825. This also failed to make our host smile, but in a different way.

“I am a member of a group, we have just finished a project on some of the Decembrist wives. We have sent it to Moscow, and now we are waiting to hear from them.” I asked what sort of project.

“A photographic project, and a history. Also a—how do you say ‘should’ in the past? Should have. A ‘what-should-have.’ And a curriculum for how the story of the Decembrists should be taught in schools.” She said that her group also hosts an annual ball in one of the remaining Decembrist houses.

“Fifty people plus, dancing to real nineteenth-century music. Schoolchildren read poetry.”

I asked if there were any descendants of the Decembrists in Irkutsk now.

“There must be, but I do not know of any.”

Later I asked Timothy why he had not jumped in to defend my comparison of Siberia to Australia, or at least to explain it better in Russian. He said he had wanted to, “especially the economic parallel, which I think is spot on,” but vocabulary had prevented him. “I couldn’t think of how to say ‘strong primary and tertiary but weak secondary industries.’ The closest I came up with was ‘good mines, but not so good factories.’”

* * * * *

We had no more overnight stops for the rest of the journey, just three nights on the train and then Vladivostok. We told the young man who drove us to the Irkutsk station where we were going, and he said with delight that he had a brother in “Vladi.” “We are from a very small town, but it produces the best aluminium in the world. For rockets and planes.” We asked if he had ever visited his brother. “No, because it is an eight hour flight and I am afraid of flying.”

There was no Russian Scout contingent in Vladivostok, as far as we knew, but a journalist friend of Timothy’s uncle had offered to show us around. She proved to be quite the hometown booster. Timothy explained to her how he had originally wanted to take the branch of the Trans-Siberian that terminates in Beijing, in order to see Mongolia, but I had insisted on seeing Vladivostok. She grasped my arm and said in English (not a strong language for her), “I love you.”

Her acquaintance with Timothy’s uncle came through their shared interest in the White Russian diaspora, which had led them to the same archives and online discussion forums. As we walked to lunch, she pointed out the hotel where Admiral Kolchak had stayed during the Civil War, in the months before the Bolsheviks shot him, and the separate hotel where his mistress—more of a common-law wife—had stayed in order to maintain appearances.

Much of her conversation revolved around history of this sort, so, via Timothy’s translation, I asked as many questions as I could think of—about the famous Czech Legion, which had briefly conquered Vladivostok during World War I, about the Soviet years when Vladivostok was a closed city, about whether Yul Brynner’s kids keep up their local ties. Apparently there is one who does, named “Rock.”

Timothy asked whether I would like him to enquire her opinion on Siberia’s convict legacy. I told him he had better make it an open-ended question. He asked her how Siberia came to be settled.

“Government policy. Under the tsar, there were incentives for people to come—land grants, remission of taxes, subsidized fares, many incentives for families to relocate. It was like the west in America, a frontier society.”

I asked whether this meant Siberia was predominantly a land of smallholders.

“Not small, the farms were very big. The government let people claim as much land as they wanted.”

But they were independent farmers, I clarified, not a plantation-style aristocracy. There was for example very little serfdom in Siberia?

“That is correct. You could have as much land as you wanted, but only as much as you could cultivate yourself.” Switching to English, she said, holding up her fingers, “Three years.” In Russian again, “The journey took three years. They came by wagon.”

The journalist spoke feelingly of these pioneers, but as I listened to her I knew that this frontier-society line was not the whole story. The Englishman Henry Landsell crossed Siberia in the 1870s, well into the heyday of voluntary migration, and in the book of his travels he can’t stop tripping over convicts and ex-convicts. In the chapter where he must flee his hotel in Irkutsk in advance of a spreading fire next door, the well-dressed passerby from whom he begs an afternoon’s sanctuary turns out to be a criminal exile made good. Anna Bek, a long-lived doctor from Nerchinsk whose 1948 memoir was recently published in translation by a small American press, admits in her first chapter that both branches of her family were exile-descended, including from one of Pugachev’s lieutenants. When she needed to learn Latin and Greek for her medical school entrance exams, her father hired a “political” as her tutor.

More than a million people were exiled to Siberia in the nineteenth century, and they did not just disappear. In tsarist times no attempt was made to hide them, for the government was not ashamed of its unusual penal system—had exile not originated as an alternative to the death penalty, and did this not make it fundamentally a liberal institution? The great hubs of convict labor were all located along the main travel routes, and (in decided contrast to Soviet practice) any foreigner with a passport was welcome to inspect the conditions at the ironworks of Petrovsky or the silver mines of Nerchinsk. The only people really uncomfortable with Siberia’s penal legacy were the reactionary officials in the capital who feared the emergence of a new type of Russian there, one who valued his independence and his rights. Peter Stolypin, Nicholas II’s minister of the interior, warned his tsar that Siberia was “a vast, rudely democratic country which will soon throttle European Russia.”

This generally relaxed attitude went out with the revolution. Under the Soviets, the very existence of the old exile system was downplayed, because however keen they were to bash the Romanovs, they did not want to draw attention to their own activities in that sphere. Instead they attacked the tsars for neglecting Siberia’s economic development. “Before the Bolshevik Revolution, capitalists—both native and foreign—were only hunters here,” declared Pravda in 1936. “They took only what was strewn around.” Siberia never lost its reputation as a land of independent risk-takers and abundant hospitality, but there was no mention of the history that went into making them that way.

So if the Siberians I met seemed to want to imagine that the exile system began and ended with the Decembrists, who can blame them? It wasn’t so long ago that Australians talked as if Britain had transported no one but Irish rebels and the Tolpuddle Martyrs. I emigrated to a Sydney where convict ancestry is chic, but it was not always so, and considering Siberia’s twentieth century it is not surprising that it should lag behind in coming to terms with its legacy as a place of exile. On the other hand, their reluctance to discuss the matter might indicate not anxiety but a healthy having moved on. The Siberians had not reckoned with their past in a way that turned up under my questioning, but that hardly proves no reckoning has taken place.

There is a rare fish that lives only in Lake Baikal, golomyanka, the oil fish. It is a classic deep-water freak, like the anglerfish or the barreleye. Nearly half of its body mass is pure fat—placed in a frying pan, it simply deliquesces—and it has no scales. It is therefore perfectly transparent, its internal organs visible to the naked eye under a gelatinous layer of skin and grease. But most fish are not like that, and neither are most people. The attraction of Siberia for three centuries of settlers, free and otherwise, had been the chance to start fresh in a new land where no one would ask too many questions about a person’s past, his family name, what schools he had attended, what his father had done for a living. My own impression was that Siberians were a different sort of fish from Muscovites, but it was absurd of me to expect that they would parade their inner workings like a golomyanka, flaunting the story of how they came to be that way—not when shaking off the past is the oldest Siberian tradition of all.",1,https://herandrews.com/2015/06/01/trans-siberian-honeymoon/
52,Andrews,Helen,firstthings,"After a lifetime of impeccably correct opinions, Ian Buruma found himself on the wrong side of the liberal consensus in September 2018, when he was forced to resign as editor of the New York Review of Books for having commissioned a piece called “Reflections from a Hashtag” from the disgraced Canadian broadcaster Jian Ghomeshi. One does not get to be editor of the NYRB without having filament-like sensitivity to the boundaries of acceptable opinion. Buruma’s virtuosic handling in 2007 of the controversy over his New York Times Magazine profile of Tariq Ramadan, in which he wrote indulgently of his subject’s radical Islamic views—and scathingly of Ayaan Hirsi Ali’s secularist opposition to them—was a model of politically correct equipoise. If Buruma was caught flat-footed this time, it must be the times that have changed.



Unlike Leon Wieseltier, Lorin Stein, ­Garrison Keillor, John Hockenberry, Ryan Lizza, or any of the other editors and journalists who have lost their jobs in the last twelve months due to the movement known as #MeToo, Buruma was not accused of any sexual misconduct. His crime was to give space in his magazine to a man who had been accused (but not, in any of four court cases, convicted) of sexual harassment and non-consensual roughness during sex. Buruma told Slate in an interview five days before his resignation, “I think nobody has quite figured out what should happen in cases like his, where you have been legally acquitted but you are still judged as undesirable in public opinion, and how far that should go, how long that should last.”

Too true, as Buruma found out to his cost. No one has yet figured out what rules should govern the new frontiers of public shaming that the Internet has opened. New rules are obviously required. Shame is now both global and permanent, to a degree ­unprecedented in human history. No more moving to the next town to escape your bad name. However far you go and however long you wait, your disgrace is only ever a Google search away. Getting a humiliating story into the papers used to require convincing an editor to run it, which meant passing their standards of newsworthiness and corroborating evidence. Those gatekeepers are now gone. Most attempts so far to devise new rules have taken ideology as their starting point: Shaming is okay as long as it’s directed at men by women, the powerless against the powerful. But that doesn’t address what to do afterward, if someone is found to have been wrongfully shamed, or when someone rightfully shamed wants to put his life back together.

In the essay that got Buruma fired, Ghomeshi claims to have been a pioneer in online shaming. “There are lots of guys more hated than me now. But I was the guy everyone hated first.” Actually, a better candidate for original victim is Justine Sacco, the PR executive who tweeted to her 170 Twitter followers before getting on a plane to Cape Town, “Going to Africa. Hope I don’t get AIDS. Just kidding. I’m white!” It was during the Christmas holidays when news is always slow, so a Gawker post about the tweet quickly went viral. People around the world were soon enjoying the suspense of knowing Sacco was on a plane with no Internet access and no way to know that she had become an object of global ridicule. That was in December 2013, almost a year before the Ghomeshi story broke.

And before that, in the Precambrian era of online shaming, there was me.

In October 2010, I appeared on a panel to promote a book of essays by young conservatives, Proud to Be Right: Voices of the Next Conservative Generation. The moderator was Jonah Goldberg. One of the other panelists was my ex-boyfriend Todd Seavey. During the Q&A, Todd launched into a rant about my personal failings. He accused me of opposing Obamacare on the grounds that it would diminish human suffering, which allegedly I preferred to increase; of wanting to repeal laws against fistfights for the same reason; of being a sadistic and scheming heartbreaker in my personal life; and of generally living according to a “disturbing” and “brutal” set of values. For three minutes and forty-five seconds, which, unfortunately for me, were captured on film for broadcast two weeks later on C-SPAN2, he made an impassioned case that I was a sociopath.



Todd is not a psychologist, but a psychologist with no evidence to go on except my treatment of Todd might well have arrived at the same conclusion. I treated him awfully. I can only plead in mitigation that I was twenty-two. Todd is from Connecticut and has that charming New England stolidity, and I behaved as if his patience, which seemed so infinite when we were dating, really had no limits. The bit about opposing Obamacare because I favored human suffering was outlandish, and other parts of his rant were not quite how I remembered things, but everything he said, he really believed, and he had arrived at those beliefs by a hard road.

I braced myself for the broadcast. Maybe no one would notice? Within minutes, the offending clip had been posted on YouTube, where it got half a million hits in the first forty-eight hours. It made the evening news on Washington’s Fox affiliate. Greg Gutfeld did a segment about it on RedEye. It was written up in Gawker, the Washington Post, Talking Points Memo, and a hundred lesser sites, and then written up again when Todd expanded his remarks about me into a ­series of blog posts on his personal website. My inbox exploded with media inquiries, none of which I answered, except to give a short statement to Mary Katharine Ham at the Daily Caller:

I wish I could say it was all a plan hatched by our new media consultant, who told us we had to “think outside the box” to make our C-SPAN panel “go viral,” but no, it is exactly what it looks like.



As a matter of policy, I don’t comment on my personal life in public, but I will clarify that his tirade thoroughly mischaracterizes my political views. For instance, I do not believe that laws against assault should be repealed—nor do I think there should be an exception in cases when one’s ex-boyfriend behaves unacceptably on national television, though I admit that’s a tougher question. Nor do I oppose Obamacare for the contorted reason he states—I oppose it for the usual reasons.

To the personal friends who emailed commiserations, I replied with an old Aaron Sorkin line about bad publicity: “It’s like seasickness. You think you’re gonna die, and everyone else just thinks it’s funny.”

That, it turned out, was overly optimistic. Everyone at work was supportive (“if you want us to form the committee to horsewhip todd seavey, just say the word,” one colleague emailed, bless him), but no amount of support could counteract the paranoia that settled in over the next weeks and months. My colleagues probably didn’t believe the woman they worked alongside was secretly a comic-book ­villain—but surely the suspicion had been planted? I never knew whether someone on the subway was giving me a second glance because he knew me, or because he recognized me from the video. Fellow journalists reported back to me from conferences where Todd expatiated on my depravity at length—in one case, before an audience that included my boss. An old friend called to say he had posted a supportive comment about me at the New Republic and shortly after received an email from Todd, who had guessed his identity from his screen name, explaining all the reasons I did not deserve to be defended. I wondered how many such incidents I never heard about.

I tried to process the experience intellectually. I read Lord Jim and The House of Mirth. No grand lesson presented itself, which, in a way, was lucky. It meant there was no ideological interpretation I could superimpose on my experience, which would have slowed my progress toward acceptance by allowing me to indulge in resentment and indignation. I couldn’t tell myself it had happened because I was a woman. Had the genders been reversed, I probably would have received less sympathy than I did. I could not blame society, or C-SPAN, or ­Jonah ­Goldberg. A year and a half later, when I was looking for a new job, I could not even blame the prospective employers who demonstrated a marked reluctance to bring me in for interviews. If I had to choose between a candidate whom no one had ever called a sociopath on national television, and one who probably wasn’t a psycho but might be, I would play it safe, too, even if the probability was only a fraction of a percent.

In 2012, I decided I would rather be Lord Jim than Lily Bart, so I accepted an offer from my boyfriend (now husband) to move with him to Australia—the best decision I ever made. On my last night in New York, in a burst of either sentimentality or bravado, I called Todd. We met in Midtown for a drink, and I found, to my surprise, that there was nothing I particularly wanted to say to him. If I was looking for some kind of closure, I wasn’t ready for it yet. In the end I had only one question for him: When we were chatting in the courtyard before the panel, was it some kind of deliberate foreshadowing when he mentioned how much he always liked Pink Floyd’s The Wall and started singing a song from the album that goes, “Since, my friend, you have revealed your deepest fear, I sentence you to be exposed before your peers”? He said it was just a coincidence.

Moving to the other side of the world did not diminish the video’s place in my life as much as I thought it would. It was still the first result when you Googled my name, which presumably is one reason I couldn’t find a job for the first eighteen months. Eventually, I found a position at a think tank. When I released my first report, an Australian MP tweeted a link to the video and asked why anyone should care about this nutcase’s opinions on regulation. Even after I got married and took my husband’s last name, the video still popped up on social media when I did a TV appearance or had an op-ed in the paper. In 2017, when I moved back to Washington, D.C., and started meeting some of the younger writers in town, it took them less than a week to find the clip and ask me about it. Most of them had been in high school when it happened.

In a funny coincidence, the day I began writing this essay, my husband was attending a conference of free-market activists when his lunch table started talking about bad breakups in the conservative movement. One man pulled out his iPhone and said, “If you want to talk about bad conservative breakups, you have to see this.” He put the phone away when Tim told him that the woman in the video was his wife. That was eight years and twenty-one days since the broadcast first aired.

There is a celebrity fashion blog called Go Fug Yourself that specializes—or specialized back in 2011, the one and only time I visited the site—in unflattering paparazzi shots and red carpet disasters. The odd thing about Go Fug Yourself, I discovered, was that all its nastiest posts featured the same tic. After unloading whatever brutal snark she had for Jennifer Lawrence or whomever, the writer would always include the same disclaimer: A celebrity has one job , and that’s to look glamorous, so if you can’t manage the one thing you owe us in exchange for all the money and fame, then find another line of work, and until then lay off the cheeseburgers and hire a decent stylist. This dime-store Joan Rivers can’t think she’s fooling anyone, I thought as I scrolled through the archives to see if every post really included this lame moral alibi. Her motivation has nothing to do with celebrities falling short of their duty to the public. She’s making fun of ugliness for the same reason anyone does: It stimulates our lizard brains.



People who read the Atlantic are smarter than the readers of Go Fug Yourself, but sometimes smarter people don’t make better decisions; they just come up with better excuses. Kevin Williamson was fired by the Atlantic in April 2018 over an unearthed audio recording in which he said that abortion was a form of murder and should carry the same punishment, up to and including the death penalty. The aspect of the resulting Twitter storm that surprised me was not the way his statement was warped out of context into a defense of lynch justice for pregnant teenagers but the purported concern for his female coworkers. “How can you say that you want a workplace that values women when you hire someone who wants 25% of those women dead?” asked feminist Jessica Valenti. When Williamson’s firing was announced, in a memo that made delicate reference to “the values of our workplace,” Valenti responded, “I am very relieved for the women who work at the magazine.”

At the risk of insulting the reader: No one actually believed Williamson was a threat to his female colleagues. It was only a pretext for what was really an exercise in raw power. People made the same kind of excuses when it was my turn in the dunk tank. Again and again, I read commenters insisting that what might at first glance appear to be prurient gossip was, in fact, fair political commentary, because I was a family-values scold and thus open to charges of hypocrisy, or because I was a hard-core Randian who needed a lesson in the dog-eat-dog heartlessness advocated by my idol. As far as I can tell, these characterizations were extrapolated from the fact that I worked at National Review. Certainly, they had no basis in anything I’d written (an Objectivist, really?).

The more online shame cycles you observe, the more obvious the pattern becomes: Everyone comes up with a principled-sounding pretext that serves as a barrier against admitting to themselves that, in fact, all they have really done is joined a mob. Once that barrier is erected, all rules of decency go out the window, but the pretext is almost always a lie. ­Matthew Yglesias once claimed that the reason he mocked David Brooks for his divorce was because Brooks had written columns about the social value of marriage, but I do not believe him. He did it because it’s fun to humiliate your political opponents. Moira Donegan claims that she created the Shitty Media Men List—a clearinghouse of anonymous accusations optimally parked for maximum dissemination in the Google Spreadsheet cloud—for altruistic reasons and with no thought of its being used to hurt anyone, but I do not believe her. If it was about protecting women in media from harassment, then why no attempt to sort the true accusations from the false? Why the coy protestations that “I thought that the document would not be made public,” when of course she knew that it would be spread far and wide, or she wouldn’t have bothered creating it?



Donegan’s defenders do not behave like people interested in finding the truth. They stirred up a Twitter mob against Katie Roiphe before her Harper’s piece about the Shitty Media Men List was even published. Claims to be motivated by concern about possible backlash against Donegan, if Roiphe revealed her as the creator of the list, were more than a little disingenuous. Since being outed, Donegan has gotten a book deal with Simon & Schuster and a regular column in the Guardian, which is precisely what anyone could have predicted. When John Hockenberry, also in Harper’s, wrote about his experience being #MeToo’d out of his job at NPR, admitting some charges and explaining why he thought others were bogus, his detractors did not bother refuting his case. They simply ridiculed him. And no one has offered him a book deal.

In Trust Me, I’m Lying: Confessions of a Media Manipulator, Ryan Holiday’s memoir of his years as a PR consultant, he describes a roundtable meeting at the Huffington Post where the editors discussed how a certain big company should have handled its recent PR crisis. The editors offered the usual bromides: “Transparency is critical.” “Be proactive.” “Get out in front of it.” Holiday replied, “None of you know what you’re talking about.” The old rules don’t apply in the free-for-all world of online journalism, and they especially don’t work when the figure at the center of the controversy is one lonely individual. If a client came to him because he was being called a racist or sexist on Twitter, Holiday says (pardon the vulgarity), “I would tell him to bend over and take it. And then I’d apologize. I’d tell him the whole system is broken and evil, and I’m sorry it’s attacking him. But there’s nothing that can be done.”

Any attempt to defend yourself or clarify your original remarks is “the equivalent of a squeaky cry of, ‘Why is everyone making fun of me?!’ on the playground,” Holiday says. “Whether it happens in front of snarky blogs or a real-life bully, the result is the same: Everyone makes fun of you even more.” The idea that online shaming is a form of debate—or in any way oriented toward finding the truth—is a delusion. Dialogue is not the point. The day Brett ­Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, the New Yorker—not Gawker, but the New Yorker—ran thirty-two Kavanaugh headlines in twenty-four hours, many of them on the subject of the nominee’s supposed whininess: “The Tears of Brett Kavanaugh”; “An Angry, Tearful Opening”; “Brett Kavanaugh’s ­Damaging, Revealing Partisan Bitterness”; “A Grotesque Display of Patriarchal Resentment.” The man had been accused of being a brutal rapist, and the most prestigious magazine in America ridiculed him for responding to the allegation as any innocent man would have. No, dialogue is not the point.

When I was debating whether or not to write this essay, which, after all, revisits an unpleasant incident that has long been at least semi-­dormant, if not quite forgotten, I saw a headline in the New York Times: “His Body Was Behind the Wheel a Week Before It Was Discovered.” The man, Geoffrey Corbis, had committed suicide in a parked car in the East Village. Only his name wasn’t really Geoffrey Corbis, the Times explained. He had been born Geoffrey Weglarz. He changed it after an incident in 2013 at a ­McDonald’s near his home in Connecticut, when he threw a sandwich at a pregnant server who had given him the wrong order. Newspaper coverage of this funny local fracas did not mention Weglarz’s recent divorce or long-term unemployment after leaving his job as a computer programmer at Dell. He couldn’t find work with the McDonald’s story at the top of his Google results, hence the attempt at a fresh start as Geoffrey Corbis.



It happens more often than you would think. At least half a dozen cases mentioned in Laws of ­Image: Privacy and Publicity in America, ­Samantha Barbas’s 2015 history of shame and libel, end with suicides. Jon Ronson’s So You’ve Been Publicly Shamed describes an English chef, living in France, who killed himself after his wife-swapping hobby was revealed by the News of the World. It also tells of a rural Welsh preacher who found himself the subject of a photo spread in the same publication for hosting an orgy in his caravan—after which he, too, killed himself. Most victims of public shaming aren’t nationally famous editors like Ian Buruma. They are ordinary folks like “ID Adam,” who lost his job at a box assembly company in Winston-Salem after reports that he racially profiled a black woman at a community pool. It turned out that he, as the pool chair on duty, had asked to see her ID, because, when signing in, she had given an address on a street in the neighborhood where no houses had yet been built. It took him days to get his side of the story into the papers, and it didn’t make him any less fired.

An essay about public shaming should have advice for those people, I thought. When I couldn’t think of any, I called Todd. He had, after all, suffered quite as much from the C-SPAN2 fallout as I had. He left his job at Fox—not right away, but after three months, when he refused to sign a statement from HR saying that such TV appearances were a violation of their “outside media” policy, even though they had never expressed a problem with his extracurricular projects before. Four years later, he returned to the NewsCorp building to film a segment on the Kennedy show, only to be stopped in the lobby by security and told he was on a no-admit list. He makes a living as a ghostwriter now, and his book Libertarianism for Beginners was published to positive reviews in 2016. When I asked if he would do it over again if he had the choice, he said he is now a believer in handling things privately. “In the future, if I get married, if my wife stabs me, you won’t hear me shouting in public about it.”

“Things really can get so much bigger than you and your own efforts that you just kind of have to ride the wave,” Todd said. “I was obscure enough before that any public attention I got was the result of me trying really hard.” He told me he never expected the clip to go as viral as it did, “far beyond my ability to control or even monitor,” which sounded implausible—until I remembered just how unfamiliar these online shame cycles were in the years before Justine Sacco’s tweet. Todd thought he would say his piece—which, in his mind, was not just that I was a bad girlfriend, but that I had a “cruelty-based worldview” that future editors and employers should be warned against unwittingly promoting by giving me work—and that would be that.

Todd’s advice for our fellow-shamed was no better than mine. “When a tsunami is heading for your house, at a certain point you have to say, ‘I’m just gonna stand here and hold this piece of plywood and see what’s left standing when it’s all over.’” Arguing back is no use. “If you’re tweeting, you’re losing.” Even in the immediate aftermath of the C-SPAN2 incident, when Todd, on his blog, attempted to make his case at length against my evil beliefs, he saw his arguments get lost in the maelstrom—equally ignored by both supporters and detractors. If we had a breakthrough in our conversation, that was it: There is no content to a shame storm. It is mindless by its very nature. It is indifferent to truth, even in cases where the truth could possibly be determined. Therefore, like the Ring, it cannot be used for good.

The solution, then, is not to try to make shame storms well targeted, but to make it so they happen as infrequently as possible. Editors should refuse to run stories that have no value except humiliation, and readers should refuse to click on them. It is, after all, the moral equivalent of contributing your rock to a public stoning. We should all develop a robust sense of what is and is not any of our business. Shame can be useful—and even necessary—but it is toxic unless a relationship exists between two people first. A Twitter mob is no more a basis for salutary shaming than an actual mob is for reasoned discussion. That would be true even if the shaming’s relics were not preserved forever by Google, making any kind of rehabilitation impossible.

If Stephen Elliott has his way, would-be shamers will have to consult more than just their consciences. He is suing Moira Donegan for defamation over her media men list, in which his entry reads: “Rape accusations, sexual harassment, coercion, unsolicited invitations to his apartment, a dude who snuck into Binders???” (Binders is a Facebook group for women writers.) What it means to be accused of “rape accusations” will doubtless be clarified at trial. It sounds like the person who wrote this was speaking from rumor herself, which proves how cavalierly career-ending allegations of sexual assault are now thrown around. I have no legal opinion on whether Elliott’s lawsuit will be for #MeToo what Peter Thiel and Hulk Hogan’s heroic lawsuit was for Gawker, but, unless we all begin to respond more responsibly to public shaming, we can expect to see more attempts to (as President Trump put it) “open up our libel laws.”

As for the people who find themselves at the center of an online shaming, I can only report how I made peace with mine. Ironically, the disagreement that gave Todd the idea that I had a “cruelty-based worldview” was over my belief that suffering is sometimes necessary for personal growth, and an essential part of God’s plan for our salvation—a belief that, as a strict utilitarian, Todd completely rejects. We had a dozen fights about it. The irony, of course, is that there is no belief my brush with online shaming confirmed more. I had heard the maxim that there is no humility without humiliation—how true it proved. My first reaction to the video was to feel aggrieved, thinking that I did not deserve what was happening to me, but on the Day of Judgment all my sins will be shouted from the housetops, and Todd’s rant will sound like a retirement luncheon toast in comparison. Of course I deserved it, and worse; most of us poor sinners do.



Of all history’s martyrs to shame, the one whose example consoled me most was Oscar Wilde. He is remembered today as a gay rights pioneer, but, in the letters he wrote after his release from prison, he never rails against the injustice of the law that put him away. He did not think it was a good law, he simply believed that the justice or injustice of the charge against him was irrelevant. What mattered was that he had been rescued from his own pride and selfishness by his experience, when he could not have been saved by any gentler medicine. This lesson, which produced “The Ballad of Reading Gaol” (“I know not whether Laws be right, / Or whether Laws be wrong”), he put into plain prose in a letter written during his exile in July 1897. Sporus was the slave boy that emperor Nero freed and “married”:

To me, suffering seems now a sacramental thing, that makes those whom it touches holy. I think I am in many respects a much better fellow than I was, and I now make no more exorbitant claims on life: I accept everything. I am sure it is all right. I was living a life unworthy of an artist, and though I do not hold with the British view of morals that sets Messalina above Sporus, I see that any materialism in life coarsens the soul, and that the hunger of the body and the appetites of the flesh desecrate always, and often destroy. . . . I learnt many things in prison that were terrible to learn, but I learnt some good lessons that I needed.

The man to whom this letter was addressed was Carlos Blacker, who himself had fled England for France in 1890, when he was accused of being a card cheat. The charge against Blacker happened to be false, just as the charge against Wilde happened to be true, but that made no difference in the two men’s experiences. The truth that Wilde came to understand, which he shared with his fellow exile, was that they should accept their chastening in a spirit of gratitude. Nothing had been taken from them that would not be restored a hundredfold if they allowed their ­experience to do its redemptive work.

53,Andrews,Helen,claremont,"he Conservative Party in Great Britain has only called itself the Conservative Party since 1830. The prime minister at the time was the Duke of Wellington, but no one thought of him as the father of the party. The political body to which the new name referred was the creation of the prime minister who held office for the exceptionally long period of fifteen years (1812–1827) leading up to the party’s solidification under Wellington and Robert Peel. That man was Lord Liverpool, whose biography William Anthony Hay has done us the great service of writing.

The quarter century of Liverpool’s career was a time of transition for Britain. Georgian laxity was giving way to Victorian rectitude. Powdered wigs were falling out of fashion, until no one wore them except Lord Castlereagh, whom everyone mocked for his old-fashioned affectation. Parliament itself was undergoing the shift from an eighteenth-century system based on patronage to a modern one based on party. Instead of a multitude of factions based around particular individuals (Pittites, Foxites, Grenvillites, Addingtonians), Parliament after Liverpool would be organized into two parties, government and opposition, each united by a common policy platform and not, as the old factions had been, by bribes.

Liverpool was born Robert Jenkinson, the only son of a widowed father, his mother having tragically died a month after his birth. He was therefore a compliant child, anxious to please the father for whom he was all in all. It was his misfortune that his father should have been not only doting but a bore, the sort of man whose recreation, in the time he could spare from his own political career, was writing a celebrated numismatics textbook. The son, too, became a bit of a prig, even as a young man. He failed to spend all of his £200 allowance his first year at Oxford, which Hay rightly calls “an achievement for an undergraduate in any age.”

The reward for his diligent good behavior was to be elected to parliament at the age of 20 and appointed Foreign Secretary at age 30. To be fair, few others wanted the job. The task awaiting the Foreign Secretary in 1801 was the negotiation of the Treaty of Amiens, that peace “which all men are glad of but no man can be proud of.” It was a Whig, Richard Brinsley Sheridan, who originated that phrase, so one can imagine how the Tories felt about the treaty. Under a barrage of criticism for having signed a truce with a menace like Napoleon, Liverpool gave “much the ablest defense of the treaty which was made in either House of Parliament,” according to the Annual Register of that year—but he was still fired from the foreign ministry when Pitt returned to office in 1804.

He had better luck at the War Office, where his achievement was getting Wellington to trust him. The general was a prickly customer, and the Peninsular War brought out his pessimistic side. He knew that many politicians in London considered the war a sideshow, hampered by feckless Spanish allies and the vagueness of Britain’s war objectives. In 1809, when Liverpool took over the War Office from Castlereagh (the only politician Wellington trusted), his field commander regarded him with suspicion. It is doubtful whether victory could have been achieved if Liverpool had not successfully coaxed Wellington into feeling confident that London would back him up—or without the 25,000 reinforcements that Liverpool, thanks to shrewd manpower reforms, was able to send him.

In 1812, Spencer Perceval was shot through the heart in the lobby of the House of Commons, becoming the only British prime minister ever to be assassinated. Liverpool was chosen as his successor not out of any overwhelming respect for his abilities but because he was the man everyone could agree on. He was well-liked, with few enemies. He was such a pacific personality that he was able to persuade Castlereagh and George Canning, who had famously fought a duel with each other in 1809, to serve in the same Cabinet, allowing his government to enjoy the advantage of Canning’s unparalleled oratory in the House of Commons and Castlereagh’s equally impressive diplomatic skills at the Congress of Vienna.

There was, however, a dark side to Liverpool’s amiability. He was deeply, almost pathologically conflict-averse. “I am quite sure if one was to drop down in a fit or be shot through the head while in his room,” Canning wrote in a private letter, “he would (if he could, unobserved) sneak out of the room and get into his carriage, ringing perhaps for Willimot [his private secretary] to take care of one.” At moments of crisis, he had a bad habit of becoming agitated to the point of tears, even to the point of fits. Hay hints that he might have been mildly autistic, “often misreading social cues,” “taking things literally,” and “fail[ing] to pick up on non-verbal communication.”

Still, he kept his nerve when it counted, for example during the notorious “Peterloo” massacre when untrained cavalry officers charged a crowd of radical protesters in St. Peter’s Fields in Manchester, killing 15. (A film about the incident, Peterloo, from director Mike Leigh, will be released by Amazon Studios next year.) Popular outcry demanded that Liverpool discipline the officers responsible, but he refused. He had seen mob violence first-hand in France in 1789, personally witnessing the storming of the Bastille at age 19, and the experience made him sensitive to the threat of revolution. The brighter side of this sensitivity was that it strengthened his commitment to reforms to ease the lot of the poor. Taxes fell by fully a quarter in the seven years after the war ended, and free trade reforms brought greater prosperity, to the benefit of all classes.

In Benjamin Disraeli’s novel Coningsby, the title character and his grandfather debate when the Conservative Party abandoned “true Toryism.” Was it with the Tamworth Manifesto of 1834, the Reform Bill, or at some other time? “We must mount higher: we must go back to ’28 for the real mischief,” his grandfather says. After Liverpool’s debilitating stroke in 1827, the party immediately entered a period of internal crisis, with half of the Cabinet refusing to serve under his successor Canning. From the perspective of 1844 when Disraeli was writing, on the eve of the party’s split over the Corn Laws, Liverpool’s long reign marked the last period of happy unity. Liverpool might not have been the spirit of the age on horseback, as Napoleon was called by Hegel, but he was the spirit of the Conservative Party at the birth of its current incarnation. With Hay’s fine book, he has the modern biography he deserves.",1,https://www.claremont.org/crb/basicpage/the-spirit-of-the-age/#.XAf7047sIho.twitter
54,Andrews,Helen,firstthings,"There is a consensus that Reihan Salam is good at what he does, but what is that exactly? Take the blog that he writes for National Review , the Agenda . By what standard could we say that the Agenda is a good blog? You can’t go by accuracy, because Reihan assiduously avoids taking a firm stand on much of anything, so accuracy is inapplicable. In the future, your city bus will be “the belly of a mythical beast, transporting [you] to a new adventure”? That’s not a prediction, that’s a baked guy’s summary of My Neighbor Totoro .

When his claims aren’t tripped-out fantasies, they’re almost always buried under several encrustations of “One might think A” and “I’m inclined to be skeptical of B” and “On the other hand C, but on the other other hand D, and there are 22 letters of the alphabet to go so get comfortable.” Then there’s his habit of just asking questions , and whether or not there are stupid questions, there certainly are no falsifiable ones, lucky for him. Basically, Reihan’s three favorite modes are outlandish futurism, guarded musing-out-loud, and noncommittal question-posing, none of which can really be called correct or incorrect.

You can’t say Reihan offers sound analysis, because nine times out of ten he offers no analysis at all beyond calling a topic “interesting”—or his favorite word, “fascinating”—and saying you should read more about it. Saying “Take up and read” over and over changed a smart man’s mind once , but that was a long time ago and divine intervention did most of the leg work. Reihan, with his many interests and scant actual opinions, is like a child, good at expressing curiosity but bad at inspiring it in others.

This doesn’t mean that Reihan Salam is bad, per se, just that his work can’t be judged by the usual standards. The only standard for him, then, the thing that keeps the masses coming back for more, is Reihan-ness . Reihan-ness is measured on the Reihan Salam Scale, a snotty little metric of my own devising. To show you how it works, lets see how Sunday’s batch of posts tallies up.

THE REIHAN SCALE OF REIHAN-NESS

The Agenda, July 15, 2012

I. How many superfluous expressions of flattery or chumminess does he use?



“an extremely important article”; “particularly helpful”; “extremely important 2010 book”; “I was delighted to read his thoughtful reflections”; “it was fascinating to see”; “his fascinating book”; “a review of the book that is well worth reading”; “a fascinating post”; “Collins has written awesome posts” “particularly rich and informative”; “an intelligent take”; “a number of interesting conclusions”: 12

II. How many weasel-word hedge phrases?



“While many argue that”; “to be sure, legalization could ”; “that should certainly be taken into account when we weigh the pros and cons”; “it happens that these arguments are often pretty sound”; “there is definitely something to Conn Carroll’s argument . . . yet it is also true that”; “the better long-term strategy, I would argue, would be to somehow”; “one obvious rejoinder would be”; “I imagine Conn and I would agree”; “yet it is worth keeping in mind”: 9

III. Take the last sentence of each post and give it a score between 1 and 10 according to how uncontroversial and pointless it is.



“Though Wax’s book is focused on how to think about the historical disadvantage of black Americans, it has broader implications for how we think about anti-poverty policy, family structure, and the difference between ‘brick walls’ and ‘hard struggles’”: 3 “Kirn’s essay has my highest recommendation”: 7 “I should note that Collins has written awesome posts on a number of subjects, including a particularly rich and informative post on bullying”: 7 “It happens that these arguments are often pretty sound, but it is nevertheless helpful to have a sense of the structure and provenance of the arguments we make”: 6 “I imagine that Conn and I would agree that the state probably wouldn’t work brilliantly in the absence of these requirements, yet it is worth keeping in mind”: 8 “I love humanity”: 10

IV. How many posts begin “[X] has written a [fascinating/thought-provoking] [article/post/paper]”?



Oddly enough, only 1 (“Jason DeParle has written an extremely important article”).

V. How many titles have the structure “[Name] on [Topic]” or begin with the words “Brief Thoughts on” or “Quick Note on”?



5

So that day’s score is 68, which gives a per post average of 11.3. Not bad.

The Reihan Scale is imperfect, of course. It doesn’t give points for characteristic absurdities like income inequality is okay if it yields the optimal number of trapeze artists or poor people will show up to work on time if their iPhones tell them that work is like a video game . But, as Reihan himself might say, Helen Rittelmeyer has written a fascinating post and we should all watch her future trollings on this important topic with close attention.",1,https://www.firstthings.com/blogs/firstthoughts/2012/07/evaluating-reihan-salam-on-the-reihan-scale-of-reihan-ness
55,Andrews,Helen,firstthings,"There was a period, shortly before the Bolshevik Revolution, when the history of the Russian temperance movement became thoroughly intertwined with the history of Russian social reform in general. “The history of the Russian temperance movement” may sound like a world’s-shortest-book joke, but in fact it is the subject of the very readable book Alcoholic Empire: Vodka & Politics in Late Imperial Russia by Brown University professor Patricia Herlihy. Her thesis is that there’s a very simple reason why so many reformers allied themselves with the temperance movement: The campaign against alcoholism provided a convenient cover for other forms of political agitation, especially for causes that would have attracted the attention of the authorities if espoused on their own terms.

Campaigners for women’s suffrage, for example, could argue that women needed the vote because they were being victimized by their husbands’ excessive drinking and deserved some political power in order to fight back. Socialists could begin their soapbox speeches by saying that workers drank too much because they were oppressed and then have a pretext to spend the rest of the speech on the evils of capitalism, which of course was what they wanted to talk about in the first place. In cosmopolitan St. Petersburg, museums, libraries, and theaters obtained public funding by claiming that the root causes of alcoholism were boredom and illiteracy. In Moscow, employment agencies, soup kitchens, and hospitals for the indigent used the same tactic, claiming the root cause was poverty. Everyone in Russia from Nicholas II on down agreed that alcoholism was a serious national problem. That was why, as Herlihy puts it, “much could be said under cover of battling drunkenness,” including much that could not have been said otherwise.

I mention all this because something roughly analogous now seems to be true of American culture. Addiction recovery programs in general, and AA in particular, have become subjects of enormous interest even to people who have never walked the twelve steps. (In case it matters: I haven’t.) The religious novel is in eclipse, but the recovery memoir has never been more popular. Recovering addicts show up in high-brow shows like Enlightened, middle-brow shows like The West Wing, and low-brow shows like Prison Break, almost always portrayed sympathetically. When the writers of HBO’s Girls needed, for the purposes of their season 1 plot arc, to get across in a single revelation that the character Adam was not a thick-skulled hound dog but a decent guy with a complex inner life, all they had to do was reveal that he was in AA. Buzz Bissinger, in that weird article he wrote for GQ last week where he admits to spending $587,412.97 on clothes in the last two years, didn’t say “I use designer clothes to fill the emotional hole left by the collapse of my family” or “The sins I struggle with most are greed & vanity.” He said that he has a shopping addiction and that he’s going to meetings.

The language of recovery seems especially popular with those segments of the population where religion is weakest. Aaron Sorkin, who usually comes across like someone who thinks the plural of “Christian” is “lynch mob,” has been very open in his TV writing and his public statements about how much he esteems twelve-step programs. The people who call David Foster Wallace the voice of his generation are the same ones who make snide remarks about the Republican Party’s theocratic agenda. The irony is that the aspects of AA that seem to resonate with them are the things they hate about organized religion: the admission of powerlessness, the submission to authority, skepticism about the value of thinking for yourself, the rote repetition of phrases that to an outsider seem vapid, sentimental, or silly.

Sacrifice may be the clearest example of this hypocrisy. These days, if a man says he’s going to give up some activity because he’s worried it’s putting his salvation at risk, people will tell him to follow his bliss and stop being so uptight. (Perhaps you encountered comments like this during Lent.) Take the example of a woman who wonders whether she should go to the gym less frequently, for fear of indulging her tendency to vanity. Any east coast advice columnist would tell her that, if going to the gym every day makes her happy, she should keep doing it, and that she has a right to be proud of her appearance. But if she were to call her gym-going an addiction, the advice columnist’s answer would change. The connection doesn’t even have to be that direct. Once it becomes known that someone is in AA, then all kinds of sacrifices apart from not drinking become admirable rather than foolish or inexplicable. A man who drops his old good-time buddies when he finds God is sanctimonious; a man who drops them when he joins AA is just doing what it takes to stay sober.

In some ways, this widespread fascination with recovery is encouraging. If the young hip kids of today are willing to embrace David Foster Wallace’s famous Betty Crocker cake mix analogy for AA (“It didn’t matter one f—ckola whether Gately like believed a cake would result, or whether he understood the like f—ing baking-chemistry of how a cake would result: if he just followed the m—f—ing directions . . . a cake would result”), then they’re only a small step away from grasping Credo ut intelligam, I believe so that I might understand. If they feel the need to smuggle the language of religion into their moral universes under the cover of the twelve steps, then the absence of religion from their lives must, at some level, be bothering them acutely. It’s annoying that so many people are unable to talk about obedience, mortification, or the quiet heroism of everyday life except in the context of recovery from addiction, but at least these concepts still make sense to them.

The danger is that the gains made by recovery language will be seized by the other faction with an interest in framing everything as an addiction—psychologists and public-health professionals. Calling gluttony an addiction may help some dechurched people deal with their sins in a language that feels comfortable, but it also opens the door to people like Mayor Bloomberg who argue that New York City needs to ban fatty foods because people just can’t help themselves. It opens the door to psychologists who apply the word “addiction” (or “disorder”) to everything that doesn’t fit their prejudices, or who say that it’s irresponsible for someone with a problem to seek help from their priest or their sponsor instead of a professional.

Luckily, twelve-steppers and the medical establishment generally hate each other. The science-minded call the twelve steps irrational and untested, and recovery advocates respond that you can’t test an anonymous program, and that, in any case, there’s plenty of evidence that the program works if you work it. When that battle heats up—as I expect it will in the next decade, with, e.g., calls for rehab centers to be more strictly regulated and licensed—those of us who belong to a church (Sinners Anonymous?) shouldn’t stay neutral. Just as it was in imperial Russia, the battle against alcoholism is about a lot more than drink.

56,Andrews,Helen,firstthings,"The Controversy of Valladolid of 1550 was one of the great dramatic set pieces of the Spanish Conquest. For six days straight, two men debated the morality of Spain’s treatment of the Indians in the New World. On one side was Bartolomé de las Casas, age sixty-five, then at the climax of a lifetime of humanitarian advocacy on behalf of the Indians. On the other was Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda, former history tutor to the heir to the throne and a staunch defender of the conquistadors. Judging their arguments was a panel of Spain’s most distinguished minds, and behind them loomed the figure of Charles V, ruler of the greatest empire the world had ever seen. The emperor had put a moratorium on all new expeditions in America while the morality of the conquest was being settled. Whether that moratorium would be lifted, and under what terms, was to be decided by this titanic battle.

Amazingly, the outcome of the debate is unknown. If the judges of the junta wrote opinions, those documents have been lost to history, and we possess no record of any verdict from the Council of the Indies. Obviously Spain did not relinquish her possessions in the New World. On the other hand, she did not abandon her efforts at legislative protection of the natives, either. It was too late to save the Tainos and the Caribbean’s other peaceful tribes, but Las Casas can claim credit for the fact that Mexico never became a slave society, thanks to policy decisions made by the imperial court during his period of greatest influence.

Five centuries later, the moral victory has clearly gone to Las Casas. His Brief Relation of the Destruction of the Indies remains a standard work on the Conquest, notwithstanding the transparent implausibility of its long-debunked death counts. The so-called “Black Legend”—the idea that Spanish imperialism was categorically more brutal than any other country’s—derives in large part from the Brief Relation, which was immediately translated into every European language and enthusiastically embraced by Spain’s Protestant rivals, especially after Flemish engraver and virulent anti-Catholic Theodor de Bry introduced his gory illustrations in 1590.

Readers whose knowledge of Spanish history does not come from picture books have been more skeptical of the fiery Dominican. Ramón Menéndez Pidal, the most eminent Hispanist of his generation, concluded in 1963 that “the only way to understand [Las Casas] is to assume that he is mentally ill.” Las Casas has been called a paranoiac, a fanatic, a chronic exaggerator, and an impossible man to work with. His defenders, of course, say that intractability is only to be expected from prophets.

Like the Valladolid debate, this historiographical dispute has produced no conclusive verdict. That may be a blessing. In the absence of a final judgment, we are free to form our own conclusions.

It is tempting to think of Las Casas as a voice crying in the wilderness, but in fact his campaign of denunciation brought him worldly success and the favor of the establishment. In 1516, when he was only 31 and they were two of the most powerful men at court, he succeeded in having Bishop Rodríguez de Fonseca and Lope Conchillos fired from their positions as ministers in charge of the Indies. When Charles V sent three monks from the Order of St. Jerome to investigate conditions in the Caribbean, he let Las Casas choose and accompany them under the title “Protector of the Indians.” The Hieronymites were the first of many colleagues to turn on Las Casas. Their report to the crown concluded that, if Las Casas were heeded and the Indians left at liberty, they would never advance beyond pre-agricultural barbarism, much less adopt Christianity.

By that time, Las Casas had already moved on to his next project, nothing short of the peaceful colonization of the entire northern coast of South America. Ultimately his royal grant fell short of the entire coast, but it still included almost all of present-day Venezuela and most of Colombia. Las Casas obtained such a lavish charter by promising to give the king ten thousand new taxpaying subjects within two years. These would include peasant settlers brought out from Spain as well as Indians newly organized into towns. Bishop Fonseca (back in the king’s good graces) warned Las Casas that others had tried peasant settlement schemes and “couldn’t find twenty workers to go.” Las Casas swore he would find thousands. In the end he found fewer than a hundred, not one of whom ever made it to South America.

The expedition was a disaster. The settlers abandoned Las Casas in Puerto Rico at the first sign of delay. The two missionary outposts that were supposed to serve as beachheads were destroyed by Indian attacks, one in the weeks before Las Casas arrived, the other a few months after he and his remaining men established themselves. Las Casas had sensed impending trouble there in the coastal village of Cumaná, but rather than stay and put his pacific principles into practice, he ran off to Hispaniola to file bureaucratic complaints against the local traders and soldiers whom he blamed for the rising tensions. The men he left behind at Cumaná were killed.

(Some idea of what a more decisive man might have accomplished can be gathered from an apt coincidence: In the very months when Las Casas was making a hash of his Venezuelan expedition—the summer of 1520 through the fall of 1521—Hernán Cortés went from the lowest point in his conquest of Mexico, the abject rout of the Noche Triste when his forces were slaughtered by the thousands as they fled Tenochtitlan, to the capture of Cuauhtémoc and undisputed mastery of the Aztec empire.)

In his account of the incident written decades later, Las Casas absolved himself of responsibility for the deaths of his men at Cumaná. It was the fault of those traders and soldiers who had refused to recognize his authority. That was the way his guilt worked. From the moment of his moral crisis in 1514, when he gave up his encomienda in Cuba and turned to a life of activism, Las Casas had felt the moral stain of each Spanish atrocity as if he were personally implicated. He was the original humanitarian personality, the first sign of the shift from pre-modern to modern ideas of moral heroism, from Christian saints to human rights activists. It is ironic that he should have so easily shrugged off the deaths for which he really was individually responsible—ironic, and yet entirely in keeping with his twentieth-century successors on the revolutionary left.

If there was an underdog at Valladolid, it was Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda. No one ever put him in charge of thousands of square miles of tropical real estate. He was a scholar whose highest previous post had been official Greek translator at the papal court of Clement VII. To the university professors on the judges’ panel at Valladolid, Sepúlveda was a man out of his depth. They were scholastics of the old school, trained in the methods of Aquinas, to whom Sepúlveda was an upstart rhetorician who had the nerve to opine on moral questions without the proper theological grounding. Sepúlveda’s book in defense of the conquistadors was never published in Spain during his lifetime, thanks to lobbying by Las Casas to have it censored by the royal licensing office.

It seems strange to think of the pro-conquest side as being at a disadvantage, but modern readers should remember that the debate at Valladolid was not just about conquest, for or against. Charles V’s priority was limiting the power of American landowners in order to prevent the emergence of an aristocracy that would threaten his power. That, and not humanitarianism, was the reason for his hostility to the feudal encomienda system of compulsory labor. The clergy wanted to see the natives protected from abuse—as did the king and for that matter Sepúlveda—but it was not clear how this should be accomplished. Passing humane laws had not worked; local officials simply ignored them. Colonists protested that if forced labor were abolished, there would be no one to work the fields and the conquistadors would starve. Spain itself was full of noble estates in which peasants provided food for their lords in exchange for military protection and capital. It was the bargain that had made possible the Reconquista.

Sepúlveda’s goal was to come up with a long-term solution that would balance humanitarian concerns with the colony’s need for a labor supply. Bringing out peasant settlers from Spain would not fill the gap, as Las Casas learned the hard way. Sepúlveda thought the answer was to create a fully functioning New World aristocracy, replacing the criminals and lowlifes who had followed Columbus with men of better morals. The most enlightened laws in the world would founder if implemented by ruffians. Also, distance posed an unavoidable problem. The king needed men in America whom he could trust to make decisions on the spot when circumstances required immediate action, as they often did in a frontier situation. Attracting a better class of hidalgo might require some sweeteners the king was reluctant to grant, like making encomiendas heritable, but it was the best way to guarantee the human rights of the natives.

Spaniards also have human rights, as Sepúlveda reminded his audience at Valladolid. Christian missionaries have a right to preach the gospel peacefully without getting massacred. International law had recognized this as a basic corollary of universal principles of hospitality since the time of the Romans. With an advanced civilization like the Aztecs, one might negotiate a treaty concerning the rights of missionaries, but with pre-literate tribes in a place like Guatemala, how could such rights be guaranteed? In order to create the conditions of peace and order that would make peaceful propagation of the gospel possible, such peoples would simply have to be ruled, as the Roman empire had ruled Hispania, until the Indians “have become more civilized and, through our governance, probity in their mores and the Christian religion have taken firm roots,” at which point they could “be given treatment of greater liberty.”

As for the labor problem, Sepúlveda, like most imperial theorists, recommended preserving existing institutions as far as possible. The Aztecs had developed an advanced tribute system in order to support the urban metropolis of Tenochtitlan, which relied for its food on surrounding farmland worked by peasant vassals. Successful Aztec military commanders were awarded lands in conquered territories, much as in Spain. Some Mexican peasants were slaves, others were free commoners who were nonetheless subject to forced labor on public works—building roads and bridges, etc.—in addition to their annual tribute. After the conquest, the Spanish not only preserved many of the old Aztec territorial divisions but often kept the same officers in place, turning former tlatoque and calpixque into district chiefs and tax collectors.

Las Casas did not know a calpixqui from a coatimundi. He knew little about pre-conquest cultures. There is no evidence he spoke any Indian language. At Valladolid, he spoke generically of “the Indians,” making no distinctions between the Aztecs, whose capital was larger than any European city at the time save Constantinople, and the Tainos, whose idea of advanced technology was a spear with a fish tooth on the end. Avoiding specifics, Las Casas merely offered the judges his repeated assertion that the Indians before the conquest “equaled many nations of this world that are renowned and considered civilized … and to none were they inferior.” Among the nations they supposedly equaled were the Greeks and Romans of the ancient world and the English and French of Las Casas’s day—that is, Tudor England and Renaissance France.

Las Casas frequently referred to his firsthand experience of the New World as the basis for his authority, but this experience was far less extensive than he led people to believe. The only part of the Indies he knew well was the Caribbean, and he simply assumed that what he had seen there must be true of conquest elsewhere. His disastrous Cumaná venture lasted only a few months, his posting as Bishop of Chiapa, a little over a year. “He says that he has been in these parts thirty-odd years, but thirty of them he spent in Hispaniola and Cuba, where the Indians were soon finished, and where he did his share in finishing them,” wrote a group of Guatemalan colonists in an angry letter to the crown in 1543. “He is not competent to give testimony about the Indies, which are New Spain … which he saw only from the roads over which he passed.” This was in contrast to the hundreds of devoted Franciscan and Dominican missionaries who lived among their Indian flocks for decades at a time.

For someone who knew so little, Las Casas was astonishingly resistant to correction. A central point of conflict between him and the Hieronymite monks of the Hispaniola commission was that they insisted on actually talking to the colonists about their experiences. They discovered that enlightened officials had experimented with bringing the Indians to civilization by noncoercive means, giving them farm tools and instruction and asking nothing in return except payment of basic taxes, but that these efforts had been total failures, with the Indians neglecting their farms and reverting to their former tribal lifestyle. The Hieronymites’ open-mindedness galled Las Casas to no end. For the crime of not taking his word for everything, he accused them of being in the pay of the encomenderos.

There was hardly an intellectual low to which Las Casas would not stoop, even actively defending human sacrifice, which he (falsely) claimed was a rare and incidental part of Indian culture. Did not the story of Isaac prove that human sacrifice was a noble impulse pleasing to God? How then could Christians condemn it as proof of barbarism? He insisted that all Indians were peaceful, and when conquistadors whose experience vastly exceeded his own pointed out that there was a difference between pacific Arawaks and warlike Caribs, he simply reiterated his categorical belief that pacifism would meet all eventualities: “No nation exists, no matter how rude, uncultivated, barbarous, gross, or almost brutal its people may be, which may not be persuaded and brought to a good order and way of life and made domestic, mild, and tractable, provided the method that is proper and natural to men is used; that is, love and gentleness and kindness.”

Rather than answer Sepúlveda’s arguments, Las Casas preferred ad hominem attacks, accusing his opponent of spouting “venomous poison” and “scandalous and deadly teachings.” He claimed Sepúlveda was ignorant and did not know his Aristotle, which was patently absurd. No man in Europe knew Aristotle better. Sepúlveda’s Latin translation of the Politics was the standard throughout the continent. Reading Las Casas’s statement of his case at Valladolid, one would assume that his opponent believed the Indians should be despoiled and enslaved, but Sepúlveda repeatedly denied believing any such thing. “To present my doctrine in those terms is offensive and shows the ill will of those from whom your argument is taken,” he wrote in an apologia aimed at Las Casas sympathizers.

They lie when they state that I undertake to protect injustices and impious robberies. … To make my position clear, I must repeat that I do not argue in favor of despoiling the barbarians or reducing them to slavery (servitus). I advocate instead that they be subjected to our rule to prevent them from impeding the propagation of the faith, persecuting preachers, and insulting God with their idols and other things; and this is for the benefit of the barbarians themselves.

Sepúlveda grew furious at Las Casas’s constant misrepresentations. “Everything which he attributes to me is false, as is well known by those who have read my book, and he knows better than anybody.” He would be dismayed to learn that Las Casas’s version of the story has become the accepted one—indeed, it has grown in the telling.

Today one often hears that Las Casas was the man who argued for the humanity of the Indians, which is ridiculous. No one doubted the Indians were human. The twentieth-century Spanish scholar Lino Gómez Canedo searched the historical record for anyone “who sustained the idea that the Indians were not human beings, but animals or something intermediate between men and beasts,” and found no one. The fact that Spain colonized the Aztecs was no proof that they thought the Mexicans inferior. Spain’s other colonies at the time included much of the Italian peninsula, and everyone, including the Spaniards themselves, agreed that the Italians were the more culturally advanced party in that relationship.

Sepúlveda’s arguments have sometimes been dismissed as the biased testimony of an ideologically suspect character. He was, after all, the Renaissance equivalent of a conservative activist. He first came to royal attention with an angry treatise he wrote after visiting his old university in Bologna and seeing a student anti-war protest (really). The young pacifists claimed that all war, even defensive war, was a violation of Christian principles, which shocked Sepúlveda coming as it did only months after the Turks raised their siege of Vienna. But among Las Casas’s many enemies were other men who had better claim to moral authority than the author of On the Conformity of Military Discipline to the Christian Religion.

Domingo de Betanzos was not just any Dominican friar. He was the man who had persuaded Las Casas to join that order when the dejected secular priest had washed up at his monastery in the wake of the Cumaná disaster. As a young missionary, Betanzos walked a thousand miles from Mexico to Guatemala on foot, and back again, in order to preach the gospel to the Indians. He nonetheless opposed Las Casas, writing open letters condemning his intemperate activism. He was also against ordaining Indians as priests, at least for the foreseeable future, because “their language is not sufficient and copious enough to be able to express our faith without great improprieties, which can easily result in great errors.” Nahuatl and Quechua, for example, had no word corresponding to God in general (as opposed to terms for particular gods), no equivalent to Deus or Allah. Betanzos, like most Spaniards of his day, had a better-safe-than-sorry policy when it came to heresy.

Naturally Las Casas condemned Betanzos’s caution as a denial of the Indians’ humanity, but that is not all he did. According to documents that surfaced in a Bolivian monastery only last century, it appears that Las Casas revenged himself on his former mentor by forging a deathbed retraction on his behalf. The facts are these: In 1549 a dying Betanzos retired to the San Pablo monastery in Valladolid, which happened to be adjacent to where Las Casas was holed up preparing for his great debate. Hours before Betanzos died, he put a shaky signature at the bottom of a confession renouncing his previous statements on Indian incapacity. The priests listed as witnesses were all Las Casas protégés. This sudden reversal was suspicious enough that the Council of the Indies sent a notary to investigate the circumstances—who transcribed the confession, who made the extensive edits and emendations—but the notary reported back that the document had to be accepted as genuine, since the witnesses were all prepared to swear that Betanzos knew what he was signing. Modern historians have not been so credulous, and several have explicitly fingered Las Casas as the mastermind behind the retraction.

The most saintly of Las Casas’s opponents was the Franciscan friar Toribio de Benavente, known by his Indian name Motolinía, “the poor one.” Unlike Las Casas, Motolinía learned his parishioners’ language and even wrote a catechism in it. “Whatever was given him he gave to the Indians,” wrote Bernal Diaz, “and sometimes he was left without food. He wore very torn clothing and went barefoot, and the Indians loved him much, because he was a holy person.”

This holy friar hated Las Casas with a passion. “I have known Las Casas since fifteen years before he came to this country,” Motolinía wrote to Charles V in 1555. “He thinks that everyone is wrong and he alone is right . . . He is ill-mannered, insulting, harmful, and restless.” At a time when the use of Indians as carriers was widely condemned (the practice was periodically banned, though enforcement was difficult), Las Casas traveled with twenty or thirty, “and the greatest part of what they were carrying was accusations against the Spaniards and other rubbish.” Motolinía also noticed that Las Casas spent most of his time on his drive-by visits to the missionary field collecting atrocity stories and very little time administering sacraments or preaching the Word.

In Motolinía’s memoir, which is livelier and less repetitive than Las Casas’s, he describes a magnificent pageant put on by the city of Tlaxcala to celebrate the feast of Corpus Christi in 1539. The play was The Conquest of Jerusalem, with fireworks simulating artillery and mud cannonballs “filled with moistened red earth, so that the one who was struck seemed badly wounded and covered with blood.” The battle ended with the Sultan converting to Christianity along with his soldiers, played by Indian catechumens who were actually baptized during the performance. The most remarkable thing about the pageant was that the Sultan was played by an Indian dressed up as Hernán Cortés. The subtleties are mesmerizing: A Christian army, played by Indian warriors, is shown conquering a heathen horde led by a Spanish conquistador, whose defeat is actually good for him insofar as it brings him to Christ? Scholars are still puzzling over what precise political implications the Tlaxcalans intended by their strange choice, but the fact that Motolinía let them get away with it suggests that his attitude to the Conquest was not arrogant triumphalism but a loving ambivalence.

For all our Anglophone sneering about the Black Legend, there are 1.7 million Nahuatl speakers on this continent today and only 150,000 speakers of Navajo. Our empire exterminated its indigenous peoples far more thoroughly than the Spanish ever did. In two and a half centuries of U.S. Indian policy, we never did crack the mystery of how to preserve native cultures in proximity to white civilization. Since we have failed to come up with a better solution, even after forty years of postmodern sensitivity to indigenous rights along the philosophical lines suggested by Las Casas, maybe we should take a lead from Motolinía instead. It could be that in a saga as complex and wrenching as the meeting of the Old World and the New, loving ambivalence is the best we could hope for.

The Controversy of Valladolid of 1550 was one of the great dramatic set pieces of the Spanish Conquest. For six days straight, two men debated the morality of Spain’s treatment of the Indians in the New World. On one side was Bartolomé de las Casas, age sixty-five, then at the climax of a lifetime of humanitarian advocacy on behalf of the Indians. On the other was Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda, former history tutor to the heir to the throne and a staunch defender of the conquistadors. Judging their arguments was a panel of Spain’s most distinguished minds, and behind them loomed the figure of Charles V, ruler of the greatest empire the world had ever seen. The emperor had put a moratorium on all new expeditions in America while the morality of the conquest was being settled. Whether that moratorium would be lifted, and under what terms, was to be decided by this titanic battle.

Amazingly, the outcome of the debate is unknown. If the judges of the junta wrote opinions, those documents have been lost to history, and we possess no record of any verdict from the Council of the Indies. Obviously Spain did not relinquish her possessions in the New World. On the other hand, she did not abandon her efforts at legislative protection of the natives, either. It was too late to save the Tainos and the Caribbean’s other peaceful tribes, but Las Casas can claim credit for the fact that Mexico never became a slave society, thanks to policy decisions made by the imperial court during his period of greatest influence.

Five centuries later, the moral victory has clearly gone to Las Casas. His Brief Relation of the Destruction of the Indies remains a standard work on the Conquest, notwithstanding the transparent implausibility of its long-debunked death counts. The so-called “Black Legend”—the idea that Spanish imperialism was categorically more brutal than any other country’s—derives in large part from the Brief Relation, which was immediately translated into every European language and enthusiastically embraced by Spain’s Protestant rivals, especially after Flemish engraver and virulent anti-Catholic Theodor de Bry introduced his gory illustrations in 1590.

Readers whose knowledge of Spanish history does not come from picture books have been more skeptical of the fiery Dominican. Ramón Menéndez Pidal, the most eminent Hispanist of his generation, concluded in 1963 that “the only way to understand [Las Casas] is to assume that he is mentally ill.” Las Casas has been called a paranoiac, a fanatic, a chronic exaggerator, and an impossible man to work with. His defenders, of course, say that intractability is only to be expected from prophets.

Like the Valladolid debate, this historiographical dispute has produced no conclusive verdict. That may be a blessing. In the absence of a final judgment, we are free to form our own conclusions.

* * * * *

It is tempting to think of Las Casas as a voice crying in the wilderness, but in fact his campaign of denunciation brought him worldly success and the favor of the establishment. In 1516, when he was only 31 and they were two of the most powerful men at court, he succeeded in having Bishop Rodríguez de Fonseca and Lope Conchillos fired from their positions as ministers in charge of the Indies. When Charles V sent three monks from the Order of St. Jerome to investigate conditions in the Caribbean, he let Las Casas choose and accompany them under the title “Protector of the Indians.” The Hieronymites were the first of many colleagues to turn on Las Casas. Their report to the crown concluded that, if Las Casas were heeded and the Indians left at liberty, they would never advance beyond pre-agricultural barbarism, much less adopt Christianity.

By that time, Las Casas had already moved on to his next project, nothing short of the peaceful colonization of the entire northern coast of South America. Ultimately his royal grant fell short of the entire coast, but it still included almost all of present-day Venezuela and most of Colombia. Las Casas obtained such a lavish charter by promising to give the king ten thousand new taxpaying subjects within two years. These would include peasant settlers brought out from Spain as well as Indians newly organized into towns. Bishop Fonseca (back in the king’s good graces) warned Las Casas that others had tried peasant settlement schemes and “couldn’t find twenty workers to go.” Las Casas swore he would find thousands. In the end he found fewer than a hundred, not one of whom ever made it to South America.

The expedition was a disaster. The settlers abandoned Las Casas in Puerto Rico at the first sign of delay. The two missionary outposts that were supposed to serve as beachheads were destroyed by Indian attacks, one in the weeks before Las Casas arrived, the other a few months after he and his remaining men established themselves. Las Casas had sensed impending trouble there in the coastal village of Cumaná, but rather than stay and put his pacific principles into practice, he ran off to Hispaniola to file bureaucratic complaints against the local traders and soldiers whom he blamed for the rising tensions. The men he left behind at Cumaná were killed.

(Some idea of what a more decisive man might have accomplished can be gathered from an apt coincidence: In the very months when Las Casas was making a hash of his Venezuelan expedition—the summer of 1520 through the fall of 1521—Hernán Cortés went from the lowest point in his conquest of Mexico, the abject rout of the Noche Triste when his forces were slaughtered by the thousands as they fled Tenochtitlan, to the capture of Cuauhtémoc and undisputed mastery of the Aztec empire.)

In his account of the incident written decades later, Las Casas absolved himself of responsibility for the deaths of his men at Cumaná. It was the fault of those traders and soldiers who had refused to recognize his authority. That was the way his guilt worked. From the moment of his moral crisis in 1514, when he gave up his encomienda in Cuba and turned to a life of activism, Las Casas had felt the moral stain of each Spanish atrocity as if he were personally implicated. He was the original humanitarian personality, the first sign of the shift from pre-modern to modern ideas of moral heroism, from Christian saints to human rights activists. It is ironic that he should have so easily shrugged off the deaths for which he really was individually responsible—ironic, and yet entirely in keeping with his twentieth-century successors on the revolutionary left.

* * * * *

If there was an underdog at Valladolid, it was Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda. No one ever put him in charge of thousands of square miles of tropical real estate. He was a scholar whose highest previous post had been official Greek translator at the papal court of Clement VII. To the university professors on the judges’ panel at Valladolid, Sepúlveda was a man out of his depth. They were scholastics of the old school, trained in the methods of Aquinas, to whom Sepúlveda was an upstart rhetorician who had the nerve to opine on moral questions without the proper theological grounding. Sepúlveda’s book in defense of the conquistadors was never published in Spain during his lifetime, thanks to lobbying by Las Casas to have it censored by the royal licensing office.

It seems strange to think of the pro-conquest side as being at a disadvantage, but modern readers should remember that the debate at Valladolid was not just about conquest, for or against. Charles V’s priority was limiting the power of American landowners in order to prevent the emergence of an aristocracy that would threaten his power. That, and not humanitarianism, was the reason for his hostility to the feudal encomienda system of compulsory labor. The clergy wanted to see the natives protected from abuse—as did the king and for that matter Sepúlveda—but it was not clear how this should be accomplished. Passing humane laws had not worked; local officials simply ignored them. Colonists protested that if forced labor were abolished, there would be no one to work the fields and the conquistadors would starve. Spain itself was full of noble estates in which peasants provided food for their lords in exchange for military protection and capital. It was the bargain that had made possible the Reconquista.

Sepúlveda’s goal was to come up with a long-term solution that would balance humanitarian concerns with the colony’s need for a labor supply. Bringing out peasant settlers from Spain would not fill the gap, as Las Casas learned the hard way. Sepúlveda thought the answer was to create a fully functioning New World aristocracy, replacing the criminals and lowlifes who had followed Columbus with men of better morals. The most enlightened laws in the world would founder if implemented by ruffians. Also, distance posed an unavoidable problem. The king needed men in America whom he could trust to make decisions on the spot when circumstances required immediate action, as they often did in a frontier situation. Attracting a better class of hidalgo might require some sweeteners the king was reluctant to grant, like making encomiendas heritable, but it was the best way to guarantee the human rights of the natives.

Spaniards also have human rights, as Sepúlveda reminded his audience at Valladolid. Christian missionaries have a right to preach the gospel peacefully without getting massacred. International law had recognized this as a basic corollary of universal principles of hospitality since the time of the Romans. With an advanced civilization like the Aztecs, one might negotiate a treaty concerning the rights of missionaries, but with pre-literate tribes in a place like Guatemala, how could such rights be guaranteed? In order to create the conditions of peace and order that would make peaceful propagation of the gospel possible, such peoples would simply have to be ruled, as the Roman empire had ruled Hispania, until the Indians “have become more civilized and, through our governance, probity in their mores and the Christian religion have taken firm roots,” at which point they could “be given treatment of greater liberty.”

As for the labor problem, Sepúlveda, like most imperial theorists, recommended preserving existing institutions as far as possible. The Aztecs had developed an advanced tribute system in order to support the urban metropolis of Tenochtitlan, which relied for its food on surrounding farmland worked by peasant vassals. Successful Aztec military commanders were awarded lands in conquered territories, much as in Spain. Some Mexican peasants were slaves, others were free commoners who were nonetheless subject to forced labor on public works—building roads and bridges, etc.—in addition to their annual tribute. After the conquest, the Spanish not only preserved many of the old Aztec territorial divisions but often kept the same officers in place, turning former tlatoque and calpixque into district chiefs and tax collectors.

Boris Johnson visited a Subway branch in Uxbridge and got behind the counter to rustle up a sandwich – but he really didn’t seem to find it easy.





After fumbling about getting some plastic gloves on, he gazed confusingly at one of the seeded types of bread and asked: “What sort of bread is it? Is it a bap?”.

His confusion clearly continued as he followed up with: “Do you get the tomatoes ready sliced?”

Boris didn’t actually eat the sandwich himself, explaining on arrival “I’ve just had a huge load of fish and chips”.

But he did take an interest in Subway’s growth in sales, contemplating: “What does that tell us about the world? Why is it growing so fast? Is it that nobody has an office canteen any more?”

When asked if Boris would make a good sandwich artist, Greg Madigan, area development manager for Subway in the UK, said: “With a bit more work, maybe.”

He added: “It was a full sandwich.”

To be honest, we probably wouldn’t complain if we got a sandwich with THAT much filling. Talk about getting your money’s worth…

by james poulos

st martin’s, 304 pages, $26.99

Alexis de Tocqueville was sensitive about his height, a mere 5 feet 4 inches, but it would have made him feel a giant to see some of the midgets who have followed after him. No amount of hair spray will ever make Bernard-Henri Lévy stand as tall as the man in whose footsteps he claimed to be traveling in American Vertigo (2006). Jean Baudrillard, Stephen Fry, and Karl Ove Knausgaard all retraced Democracy in America’s journey, and not one of them could summon their precursor’s sympathy for those money-grubbing, obese Yankees. On the other side of the spectrum, one Australian imitator whom I will not name promoted his self-styled Tocqueville reboot on a website that, when you opened it, auto-played Tina Turner singing “Simply the Best” over a background alternating his book jacket and billowing American flags. I wish I could tell you that the book was self-published.

James Poulos is not a foreigner, but he is nevertheless good casting for the part of a modern-day Tocqueville, as an alien from outer space. Or so he seems in photographs of him in his alternate persona as a rock star, sporting fur coats, tattoos, and varying degrees of eyeliner. But that is only one side of our author. In addition to serving as front man for the glam band Night Years, Poulos has studied for a Ph.D. in political theory at Georgetown University, covered the 2012 presidential campaign for Vice magazine, and briefly, with the greatest reluctance, worked as a lawyer. He has written for the wonky National Affairs and the dishy Daily Beast. There is no young writer on the right with a résumé quite like his. Naturally, unlike everyone else in political punditry, Poulos lives in Los Angeles.

His unusual background furnishes The Art of Being Free with some memorable freeze-frames of life in our mad century. Meeting over M&Ms and Tootsie-Roll Pops with Kylie and Kendall Jenner to pitch them a young adult novel based on their lives. Seeing a long-labored-over novel with a terrorism subplot rendered instantly unpublishable by September 11. Realizing that his apartment building is the same one that Edward Norton blows up in Fight Club. Sitting in a Landmark Forum (successor program to Werner Erhard’s est seminars) knowing that all the self-help in the world will not save his marriage.

Pinning down the thesis that Poulos extracts from all this is more difficult. His starting point is a distinctively American “craziness” that he never quite explains but assumes readers will recognize. Its symptoms are a tendency to melodrama, an anxiety about being interchangeable with everyone else, and a tortured need to treat one’s own authenticity as a secret waiting to be discovered. Tocqueville, he claims, “understood better than anyone how the dramatic craziness of life was a constitutive, baked-in part of Americans.” The Frenchman’s lessons, as summarized by Poulos, are sometimes woolly—the difference between “performing our autonomy” (bad) and “experiencing our freedom” (good) is not intuitively clear to me—but nevertheless are provocative in the way that abstractions can be.

The precedent for blending a scholarly reading of Tocqueville with personal narrative was set by Poulos’s graduate school mentor, Joshua Mitchell, in his Tocqueville in Arabia: Dilemmas in a Democratic Age (2013). Like his advisee, Professor Mitchell grew weary of the squabbles of academia and lit off for more relevant pastures, in his case by moving to Qatar and Iraq in order to help organize American-style universities there. Mitchell’s tale is worth pausing over in order to head off from the very beginning one of the great hazards of talking about Tocqueville: so generalizing his ideas that they collapse into commonplaces no one could possibly disagree with. (Volunteerism is good!) To get a grip on what Tocqueville said, it is useful to find someone who does disagree with him. Mitchell had to go halfway around the world to encounter such people, but he found them.

Mitchell’s Arab students hated Tocqueville. When he taught classes in Buenos Aires and Lisbon, his students there hated Tocqueville, too. This came as a shock to Mitchell, not just as a devotee but because he thought Democracy in America would be the perfect book for their national predicaments. Tocqueville’s basic theme, if you had to put it in a sentence, is the transition from an aristocratic age to a democratic one, which he thought (correctly) would be the dominating theme of nineteenth-century politics. With postcolonial and newly globalized countries facing fundamentally the same transition two centuries later, Mitchell assumed they would want to hear about the solutions pioneered by the first country to face its uncertainties and disorientations.

Instead, his students dismiss it as “a book about and for Americans, those exceptional and curious people.” Mitchell blames this on their lingering commitment to aristocratic values, which is hardly fair. His Latin students, for instance, have their own political tradition designed to cope with atomization, class upheaval, and all the other horsemen of modernity: a Thomistic theory of the organic state that emphasizes group rights over individual rights, cooperation over competition, top-down rather than bottom-up decision-making. Corporatism is an alternative to Tocquevillean association, not a stage in its development. It is no coincidence that the American political scientist who has written most extensively on Ibero-Latin corporatism, Howard Wiarda, also wrote an exasperated book aimed at would-be exporters of American-style democracy called Civil Society, which would better have been called Against Civil Society as Tocqueville Understood It.

Poulos’s home territory of California is almost as foreign to nineteenth-century America as Mesopotamia. Tocqueville thought the North and the South were as different as two countries—if only he could have driven down Wilshire Boulevard! “We are all in the gutter, but some of us ogle the stars,” Poulos writes of the L.A. mentality, adapting a line of Oscar Wilde’s in order to express a most un-Tocquevillean attitude to our modern aristocracy. Poulos recalls sitting in a theater watching Terrence Malick’s Knight of Cups and thinking that its screenwriter protagonist is exactly the person that Batman, that other Christian Bale character, would have become if he had moved to L.A. Quite a transmutation, that. Imagining Tocquevillean man transferred to modern California is nearly as challenging.

But even if we could, it wouldn’t matter. Tocqueville still has much to teach us, Poulos says. However true that may be at an individual level, it does not change the fact that the America described by Tocqueville is well and truly dead.

The term “civil society” has become so imprecise that politicians, pundits, and academics who should know better now use it to refer to a spirit that exists in every society, varying only in its institutional forms and relative strength. It is true that the virtues underlying civil society—altruism, trustworthiness, charity—exist in all places at all times. But the term itself is more specific. As we saw in the Latin American example above, some political traditions reject the idea as too anarchic and individualistic. Moreover, as nation-builders and development NGOs have discovered, one cannot simply create the space for civil society in a foreign country and trust that it will emerge.

The same imprecision has long made it difficult to assess the health of American civil society, as was evident in the backlash against Robert Putnam’s Bowling Alone. The Rotary Club may have fewer members, his critics said, but the Sierra Club’s numbers are up. We may go to church less, but we brunch more. So what if young people are less active in local politics? They display their opposition to all forms of bigotry by sharing woke memes on Facebook! Optimists have consoled themselves with the idea that civil society had not weakened, only changed vessels. Two decades after Putnam first published his findings, declining social capital has become harder to deny. A third of Americans have never met their neighbors, more than a quarter live alone, marriage rates are still down, opioid overdoses have quadrupled, one in six working-age men is out of the workforce, and a quarter of those men use three hours per day of their abundant free time to play video games.

What killed civil society? Prosaic factors such as technology played their role, as did the shift of women into the workforce. Almost everything that once made American communities cohesive, from child-minding to neighborly casseroles to driving Widow Jones to the grocery store, was powered by the labor of stay-at-home wives, for which they were not paid but for which they will surely be blessed hereafter. Other changes have occurred at that spiritual register to which Tocqueville was so attuned, striking at not just the logistics but the very spirit of civil society.

The first of these is meritocracy. Tocqueville marveled at the power of the country’s commercial ethos to shape Americans’ souls in unexpected ways. It fostered self-reliance and at the same time sociability. When excessive individualism tempted Americans to withdraw into their own small family circles, business sent them back out into the world to mingle and form ties with their fellow men. Meritocracy has much in common with a commercial society—instability, scope for ambition, habits of self-discipline—but it makes us look inward, not outward. It tells us that success lies in constantly refining and supplementing our own talents. Gone is the risk-taking that so impressed Tocqueville, who observed that Americans were “remarkably indulgent toward businessmen who go bankrupt,” so much did they honor audacity. Instead, we all follow the paths laid out for us, from university to internship and into our careers, each in our own individual groove.

Another is immigration, a threat that Tocqueville himself foresaw. On his original journey, he observed that, although English and French settlers had lived alongside each other in Michigan for almost a century, “they have nothing in common. They are English and French just as they appear on the banks of the Seine and the Thames.” Years later, when he was informed that hundreds of thousands of Germans were being received into the United States, Tocqueville warned that “soon you will no longer be yourselves.” The Canadian frontier had taught him that national differences do not fade quickly, and Germans, while industrious and personally admirable, had little experience with free institutions in their politics. This is to say nothing of the declining social trust that Robert Putnam has identified as a side effect of increasing diversity, the “turtle” effect that makes citizens “hunker down,” an unforeseen consequence that Tocqueville would have grasped immediately.

Poulos’s subtitle promises that Tocqueville can “save us from ourselves.” The self-help seeker wishing to know the gravamen of his advice might think of it as a choice between the two meanings of the phrase “Deal with it.” Americans rely too much on “dealing” in the sense of haggling, Poulos argues, noting that it is the mentality of Patrick Bateman in American Psycho (those Christian Bale characters again). We should stop bargaining and start accepting, the better to embrace our inescapable freedom. I do not want to suggest that this advice is too personal to meet the needs of our national problems. I dare say a large-scale spiritual renovation would go further toward solving them than most people think. Certainly Poulos’s reading is preferable to yet another book citing Tocqueville in support of the same quaint clichés. But if we are going to resurrect a nineteenth-century author to speak to our time, our first choice should not be one who celebrated America for qualities that it has ceased to possess.

Helen Andrews writes from Sydney, Australia.",1,https://www.firstthings.com/article/2017/01/tocqueville-in-the-gutter
60,Andrews,Helen,firstthings,"The central paradox of censorship, according to the historian Paul S. Boyer, is that however sane and fair-minded your set of standards might be, the people who end up doing the censoring will always be the last ones you’d trust with the responsibility. Considered in the abstract, Boyer’s rule makes sense. It is widely suspected that anyone attracted to a career in censorship must be some kind of pervert. Those whose sensitivity and good judgment would equip them to enforce such a code are, according to Boyer, “precisely the ones most unwilling to be identified with censorship.” Certainly such talented people would have open to them more interesting careers than the publishing equivalent of sewage treatment.

Unfortunately for those who think Boyer’s paradox is probably true, when we try to test it against recent history to see if the censors of the past two centuries have really been as second-rate as he claims, we run into another paradox: A modern author who chooses to write a history of censorship will usually turn out to be the last person you’d trust to tell the story fairly.

Books on the subject are almost invariably written by the sort of historian or journalist for whom the Scopes Monkey Trial never ended, who suspects every PTA member of wanting to be a Comstock and every Comstock of wanting to be a Torquemada. The titles give some indication of this tendency: Liberty Denied: The Current Rise of Censorship in America; Censorship: A Threat to Reading, Learning, and Thinking; or Girls Lean Back Everywhere: The Law of Obscenity and the Assault on Genius. Boyer himself is a lonely exception, with the even-handed Purity in Print (perhaps his upbringing in a Mennonite-like sect made him magnanimous toward outdated ideas).

As a result, the average person’s idea of the history of censorship in America is an almost parodically Whiggish fable in which it gradually dawns upon the nation what everyone should have known from the start, that no one should ever tell anyone what to read. This narrative omits to mention that until the mid-1920s, even civil libertarians accepted the basic legitimacy of censorship. “It is safe to assume that a liberal state would maintain a censorship . . . for the curbing of degrading influences,” a New Republic editorial reassured readers in 1923. As late as 1929, Boston progressive pillar Richard Cabot Clarke cautioned his friend Roger Baldwin against lending his famous organization’s aid to smut-peddlers as well as pacifists and political radicals, warning, “I should resign from the Civil Liberties Union if the proposed extension of its activities is carried out.”

Nor do we hear much about the early free-speech activists who later came to regret their part in the debauch of the public sphere. Donald Friede, who was prosecuted in 1928 for publishing Radclyffe Hall’s The Well of Loneliness but cleared of all charges in a landmark appeal, eventually arrived at a very different perspective. “When I see some of the books published today, I cannot help but wonder if our fight against censorship in the twenties was really wise. . . . Fanny Hill in paper! And Naked Lunch in any form! . . . But I suppose there are some people still willing to play the piano in the literary brothel. Certainly the pay is good.”



But by 1964, when Friede wrote the above, the public consensus had passed him by. Even within a year of his prosecution, censorship had lost all respect in the popular mind, partly as a result of its close connection to Prohibition (or “the censorship of beverages,” as The Christian Century called it). It all seemed to happen overnight. One moment, President Eliot of Harvard was praising the local Watch and Ward Society as “a thoroughly scientific charity” for aiming at “drying up the sources of immorality” rather than treating social evils after the fact. The next, a Boston D.A. was confidently declaring in court that “it is inconceivable, with all the misery that exists in every city, that contributors, instead of bestowing funds on the poor and unfortunate, consider it their duty to contribute to a private organization that hires paid snoopers to watch over the morals of the general public.”



In December 1929, a Massachusetts legislator introduced a cruel joke of a bill that would have required any would-be censor to pass “the standard Binet intelligence test for mentality of eighteen years” and to “submit to the state Department of Public Health satisfactory evidence of normal sex experience.” By that time, the likes of President Eliot no longer wished to be associated with such an unfashionable cause, so it fell to groups with less social cachet, like Catholics, to carry on the fight. “The Puritans forged the sword, and the Irish are wielding it,” as one journalist put it. Eventually the reversal of the late ’20s came to its natural conclusion in the First Amendment expansions of the ’60s, after which government censorship ceased to be much of a legal or political possibility.

The compulsion to accompany the minutest dissent from free speech absolutism with the disclaimer that of course one does not favor book-banning seems to me one of the more irritating side effects of this rout. It is as if there were not an obvious difference between keeping Fifty Shades of Grey out of grade school libraries and confiscating all extant copies for a bonfire on the National Mall. Nevertheless, I should clarify that I am not in favor of bringing back state censorship. On balance, it is a good thing that Americans today say that the government should not censor. The problem is that no one today says just that.

In order to defend the perfectly reasonable claim that state censorship does more harm than good, we have for some reason found it necessary to promote the ridiculous claim that no restrictions on reading or viewing should ever be imposed by any authority of any kind. Furthermore, we have decided that if an unrestricted flow of ideas is the best way to arrive at truth at the level of a nation, the same free-for-all must also be best at the level of the individual. Whether you look at the #BannedBooksWeek hashtag or Buzzfeed or the Reading Rainbow website, you hardly ever see a sensible anti-censorship opinion offered without several crackpot corollaries attached. The most common of these are:

That no book ever corrupted anybody. Strangely, this fallacy is most popular among those who praise the power of reading to broaden horizons and influence minds, as if that power could only ever be used for good. At a recent PEN panel on “Sex and Violence in Children’s Literature,” according to one attendee “pretty much all the panelists agreed that denying children the freedom to fully inhabit this world, to examine their responses and react accordingly, can stunt them.” This is about like saying that all facts are salutary regardless of context, that no one ever suffered from getting knowledge too soon, that information can only persuade, never seduce.

That the effect of a corrupting book can easily be neutralized through counterargument. This is obviously false in the case of something like obscenity or pornography, where the damage is done not by persuasion but by coarsening. In the case of more elevated fare—say, some of the books on the old Index Librorum Prohibitorum—it amounts to saying that I, the modern reader, am far too smart to be outwitted by Hobbes, Gibbon, Comte, or Voltaire. There are geniuses who would not claim as much, and saints.

That, whatever its effects on a given individual, no book has ever harmed an entire society. The only thing about the French Revolution on which Voltaire and Joseph de Maistre agreed was that “books did it all.” The Salem witch craze started because “wretched Books had stolen into the Land, wherein Fools were instructed how to become able Fortune-Tellers,” and these books fell into the hands of the suggestible girls who were soon accusing their neighbors of bewitching them. If Harriet Beecher Stowe can make a war, then E. L. James can degrade a nation.

That the difficulty of enforcement makes condemning books not worth the bother. There is something to be said for withholding institutional approval of a title by refusing to assist in its distribution, even if the title is easy to obtain by other means. More importantly, this fallacy discounts the possibility that voluntary limitations on reading material might be worth something. In the United States, at least, the Catholic Index never put anyone in jail, yet it managed to matter.

Why is it important to call out these fallacies? For one thing, they encourage us in the bad habit of self-congratulation at the expense of people long dead, people who deserve better than to be made easy objects for our feelings of superiority. Was he really so contemptible, the General Manager of Editions for the Armed Services who had George Santayana’s Persons and Places removed from army libraries in 1944 on the grounds that “Mr. Santayana’s views, though brilliant, are dubious as to democracy”? I rather think he was a good man with an amusing wartime dilemma and not much time to resolve it in.



The perfect public sphere in which ideas compete freely until the truth emerges may be real or it may be mythical, but certainly that is not how it works in the individual human brain. I for one do not trust that my mind will arrive at the correct conclusion if I only jam it full of as many ideas as I can manage. Bad books are like bad company—they don’t make error inevitable, but they make it difficult to guard against. When the Index was abrogated in 1966, the assumption was that in the absence of a list of specific forbidden books, individuals would use the same basic rules to make their own judgments about what was prudent for them to read. How many of us can say we have been conscientious in that duty?

61,Andrews,Helen,usa,"“There’s no point in writing about someone unless they are flawed,” Aaron Sorkin said when he was asked about depicting Steve Jobs as a “flawed genius” in his script for the 2015 biopic. Apparently no one told Sorkin that this rule does not apply to beloved heroes of childhood classics.

The estate of Harper Lee is suing Sorkin and his producer Scott Rudin over their stage adaptation of To Kill a Mockingbird, which they say depicts Atticus Finch as a racist. The complaint cites an interview Sorkin gave in September where he stated, “As far as Atticus and his virtue goes, this is a different take. . . He becomes Atticus Finch by the end of the play, and while he’s going along, he has a kind of running argument with Calpurnia, the housekeeper, which is a much bigger role in the play I just wrote.”

“He is in denial about his neighbors and his friends and the world around him, that it is as racist as it is, that a Maycomb County jury could possibly put Tom Robinson in jail when it’s so obvious what happened here. He becomes an apologist for these people.”

It sounds like the Lee estate is upset that the play gives Atticus Finch a character arc. But any stage adaptation was bound to do that. A novel might be able to dispense with that kind of dramatic trajectory, but not a play. They ought to drop their lawsuit and let the playwright get on with his work.

Every Sorkin adaptation takes liberties with its main character. The Steve Jobs of Danny Boyle’s Steve Jobs was nothing like the Apple founder. The Mark Zuckerberg of The Social Network had all kinds of weird status anxieties that the real Zuckerberg never gave a second thought. The main character of his HBO show The Newsroom, ostensibly a Republican TV anchor, resembled no Republican that has ever existed.

In exchange for tolerating these liberties, you get to see your story told in the words of Aaron Sorkin, who still writes better dialogue than anyone else alive. If the Lee estate wanted a by-the-numbers transliteration, they could have picked any other playwright.

Anyway, they should relax. Sorkin and Rudin can’t be going too dark with their Atticus Finch if they’ve cast Jeff Daniels to play him.

If the Lee estate isn’t careful, they may meet the fate that befalls those who try taking Aaron Sorkin to court: he will write them into his next show. When two screenwriters sued Sorkin for allegedly having stolen their work for the film The American President, he retaliated by writing an unflattering subplot about them into Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip. (A show no one watched, and which got canceled after a single season. . . Maybe the Lee estate can be forgiven for having missed it.)

“Never pick a fight with someone who buys ink by the barrel,” runs the old adage. There are two reasons not to pick a fight with Aaron Sorkin. The first is that, as a Hollywood screenwriter, he has access to the biggest megaphone in the world. The second is that he really is a genius. The less he is harried in the run-up to the play’s Broadway debut in November, the better work he is bound to do.",1,https://usa.spectator.co.uk/2018/03/leave-aaron-sorkin-alone/
62,Andrews,Helen,usa,"National Geographic’s National Geographic used to be a racist magazine, and to make up for it, they are devoting an entire issue to the subject of race. That is the logic outlined by editor-in-chief Susan Goldberg in her editorial introduction to the magazine’s April issue, which ran online this week under the blunt headline ‘For Decades, Our Coverage Was Racist’.

To make sure not to miss any past sins, Goldberg brought in an outside expert to scour the National Geographic archives: professor John Edwin Mason of the University of Virginia, whose expertise is in photography and African history. Goldberg urged him to be unsparing, even though ‘it hurts to share the appalling stories from the magazine’s past’.

I bet it does. I can only hope the pain is alleviated by the publicity coup the magazine has earned for itself with this gimmick.

In their keenness to revel in performative remorse, Goldberg and Mason misrepresent old articles to make them seem more racist than they were. One of the examples Goldberg cites is a 1962 piece about South Africa, which (she says) ignores the problems of apartheid, an unjustifiable omission for an article written ‘two and a half years after the massacre of 69 black South Africans by police at Sharpeville’.

(This is a strange way to talk about its timing, as if nothing else noteworthy had happened in South Africa in the intervening period—like, say, the referendum on leaving the Commonwealth, or an assassin shooting the prime minister in the face.)

Far from ignoring apartheid, the article leads off with an unflattering story about its absurdities, as the author starts to go through a door marked ‘Non-Europeans’ and has to be told that Americans are ‘Europeans’ in apartheid terms. It goes on to mention other injustices of the regime, like the fact that the Indians in Durban, the city that gave us Gandhi, were not allowed to vote. According to Professor Mason, the story ‘barely mentions any problems’. A bold-faced heading in the article literally reads ‘Apartheid Leads to Problems’.

Goldberg is certainly right that the magazine’s reasons for running so many pictures of bare-breasted Polynesian maidens might not have been strictly anthropological. But would it really have been less insensitive to run around asking them to put clothes on?

If it was wrong for their photographers to make beautiful people look beautiful, what about making beautiful people look ugly? One of the leading articles in the ‘Race’ issue is a look at the white-trash deplorables of Hazleton, Pennsylvania. No bosomy maidens here, nor indeed anyone looking even moderately attractive. It is all beer bellies, wrinkles, and scowls. A redheaded young woman with lovely features is pictured wearing a dingy old sweatshirt, which I am sure is not the nicest outfit she owns and may well be the worst. Could the photographer not have come back on a date night?

It is impossible to be around for 130 years and not have said some regrettable things. I’ve been around for only 32 years and my regrets could fill a dedicated issue of a monthly magazine, possibly a quarterly. The reason I don’t assemble such a document is that it would be transparently self-serving. For all its noisy contrition, that is just what this publicity stunt from National Geographic is.",1,https://usa.spectator.co.uk/2018/03/national-geographics-race-issue-isnt-remorse-it-is-a-publicity-stunt/
63,Andrews,Helen,usa,"We were so close to getting rid of Jann Wenner. When his 51 per cent stake in Rolling Stone was put up for sale last year, it felt safe to assume that the new owners would gently ease out the man whose disastrous recent leadership brought the publication to the point where it needed to be sold. No one on the editorial staff ever did lose their job over the debacle of Sabrina Rubin Erdely’s false UVA story in 2014. It seemed only fair that Wenner should lose his.

But reporting from Vanity Fair has confirmed that the Penske Media Corporation, the magazine’s new owners, are keeping Wenner on. Not with some kind of emeritus sinecure, either, but with the title of editorial director.

We should have known it would be this way with a Baby Boomer. A generation obsessed with preserving youth at all costs naturally has no idea how to make a graceful exit.

When Maurice Kinn bought the Accordion Times and Musical Express in 1952 and relaunched it as NME (speaking of graceful exits), do you think the old guard kept hanging around, nagging Julie Burchill to write about Primo Scala and His Accordion Band?

That’s what Wenner will be as he rattles around the Rolling Stone office, trying to persuade his staff that Bruce Springsteen and Bono are still the most important rock stars in the world. This is the man who allowed his magazine’s position in the zeitgeist to be outflanked by SPIN in the early 1990s and hasn’t recaptured its relevance since.

If the Rolling Stone ethos had ever really been about youth, Wenner would no doubt feel an obligation to step aside and let a younger generation take control of the magazine’s direction. But of course it wasn’t. It was only ever about the vices of youth—egotism, self-indulgence, unearned idealism—and the Baby Boomers’ reluctance ever to grow out of them.

Wenner’s biographer, Joe Hagan, thinks his subject might be able to make a success of the new regime if he can adapt to changing times. “Can you hit the reset and make Rolling Stone into a thing that feels vital again, for people who have never listened to the Eagles, or don’t even know who they are?” he said.

Here we pass over from business into questions of morality, for if there exist readers out there who don’t know who the Eagles are, the only decent thing to do is to preserve them in their blissful ignorance. Hard as it may be to believe, people under the age of 50 who have somehow avoided becoming exhaustively versed in Boomer culture are better off for it.

Alas, as we ought to have learned by now, the Boomers want everyone to be as obsessed with them as they are with themselves. From his labors to that end, Jann Wenner will never voluntarily rest.",1,https://usa.spectator.co.uk/2018/03/you-cant-stop-the-zombie-baby-boomers-at-rolling-stone/
64,Andrews,Helen,usa,"Ah, this will be about empire. So I thought when I saw that the small city of Arcata, California, has voted to remove the statue on their town plaza of President William McKinley.

The United States had never possessed overseas colonies before McKinley. Every territory we acquired, we eventually brought into the republic with full statehood. That all changed in 1898 with the Spanish-American War, at the end of which America found herself in possession of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines—islands about which McKinley admitted “I could not locate within 2,000 miles.” He also annexed Hawaii and established a protectorate over Cuba.

The tipping point between republic and empire is a momentous one in the life of a nation, and for America the tipping point came with McKinley.

To my astonishment, the California statue-topplers hardly mention any of this in their petitions. Instead their grievances are of the most generic sort, the usual lines about Native American genocide and white supremacy. The statue sits on “Wiyot land,” one protester said. Another performed a traditional song of the Pomo tribe at a protest on the city plaza the day of the council vote, after which the protesters marched to city hall where they shouted down the lone citizen who turned up to speak in McKinley’s defense.

Another Arcata landmark has already been removed on the city council’s orders. Yesterday [Wednesday] workers tore down a plaque marking the Jacoby Storehouse, a few blocks from the McKinley statue. Its offense was to bear the sentence “From 1858 through 1864 it served periodically as a refuge in time of Indian troubles.”

The phrase “Indian troubles,” in particular, was deemed to be racist. “I think the plaque is clearly totally racist and the words ‘Indian troubles’ is really just code for genocide,” said councilman Michael Winkler.

Leaving aside whether the councilman can possibly think of a phrase more neutral than “Indian troubles,” consider the dates on the plaque: 1858 to 1864. President McKinley was elected in 1896. Whatever rampage of genocidal violence attended the settlement of the Pacific Northwest, in Councilman Winkler’s version of history, it was over by the time McKinley was inaugurated.

So what does McKinley have to do with Native American dispossession? One of the protesters seems to have told a local reporter than McKinley “was responsible for the passage of the Dawes Act.” The reporter would not have repeated this falsehood if he had checked his dates. (The Dawes Act was passed in 1887.)

The truth is that McKinley contributed very little to federal Indian policy. It would be one thing to tear down his statue because he was the man who turned America from a republic into an empire, but over continental expansion, which was long over by the time he ran for president? The only thing worse than iconoclasm is iconoclasm for the wrong reasons.

The protesters might as well have come into this agitation with their grievances already scripted, with no regard for which nineteenth-century white male happened to be cast in bronze on their town plaza. I rather suspect they did.",1,https://usa.spectator.co.uk/2018/03/the-statue-topplers-dont-care-who-they-tear-down/
65,Andrews,Helen,blogs,"Parson Weems, the popular author of the early American republic who first invented the apocryphal story of George Washington and the cherry tree, achieved his greatest commercial success as a pamphleteer with Hymen’s Recruiting-Sergeant; Or the New Matrimonial Tattoo for Old Bachelors (1799).

In this booklet, the amiable old clergyman suggested that young people ought to get married not only for financial security and in order to bring up young Americans but “for pleasure.” His racy pamphlet went into thirteen editions, and copies were still being sold fifty years later.

The new report from W. Bradford Wilcox and Nicholas Wolfinger of the Institute for Family Studies has a much less catchy title: Men and Marriage: Debunking the Ball & Chain Myth. But the problem is the same: Not enough young people are getting married.

More dire than that, young Americans are having less sex. As Wilcox pointed out in Politico Magazine, sexual frequency among adult Americans is down 14 percent compared to the late 1990s. Among 18- to 30-year-olds, the number reporting no sex at all in the preceding year has zoomed up from 12 percent to 18 percent.

What could explain this? Most Americans begin having sex with their current partners within two or three weeks of starting the relationship, according to Mark Regnerus. A fortnight is not very long to hang in there, even for a very impatient person. The bottleneck must come earlier in the process.

Might the problem be that young people no longer have any idea how to talk to each other?

Wilcox cites the astonishing statistic that more than a third of people under 30 consider it sexual harassment for a man to comment on a woman’s attractiveness. You are not allowed to try to talk to a woman if she’s wearing headphones, according to Buzzfeed.

Saying anything to any woman in a public place is “almost always a bad idea,” according to another Millennial. What does he recommend instead? Apps like Tinder and OKCupid, because there at least you know the woman is interested in being chatted up.

Talking to strangers is depraved; conveyor-belt sex apps are just plain courteous. However this may be as ethics, it is bizarre as etiquette.

“In the past 10 years, the share of high school seniors who reported ever going out on dates fell from about 70 percent to approximately 55 percent,” according to Wilcox.

No wonder those numbers are down, if initiating a conversation with a stranger is now a minefield of potential offense, on top of the usual minefield of potential humiliation.

Half a century after the Sexual Revolution, we’ve generally got the big things right—women deserve respect, monogamy is an ideal worth aiming for, “swinging” was a regrettable Seventies aberration. It’s the little things that are jamming us up.

It would make such a big difference to those 18- to 30-year-olds who are dragging down America’s sexual frequency stats if they could rely on ordinary rules of etiquette again. For example, that it is not a crime to talk to strangers in public places.

Being single will still be agony, of course—all those cycles of risk and rejection. But there is a way out. As Wilcox notes, this particular exit from singledom leads to having sex more frequently and to higher reported levels of satisfaction with one’s sex life.

66,Andrews,Helen,firstthings,"Miłosz: A Biography

by andrzej franaszek

The impression left in the mind of an American reader, after he finishes Andrzej Franaszek’s exhaustive new biography of Czesław Miłosz, is the absurdity that this man was ever considered a political sage. A great poet, yes. A generous translator of other Polish poets, absolutely. His tireless efforts to make American poetry less provincial by lending his famous name to anthologies of world poetry, not just European but Asian and Latin American, remain underappreciated to this day. But his reputation as a Cold War dissident was accidental and was neither deserved nor welcomed by the poet himself.

Miłosz made only one venture into the world of politics, and that under the oddest of circumstances. The Captive Mind (1953) was written during an in-between period for Miłosz, after he defected from Poland but before the American government had decided to grant him a visa. Denunciations of Miłosz by earlier Polish émigrés had flooded the State Department, leaving the Americans reluctant to help such an unpopular man who, after all, had worked for Poland’s Communist government until the day before yesterday. The Captive Mind therefore had something of the character of an audition.

Jerzy Giedroyc, the well-connected publisher who presided over the Polish émigré community in postwar Paris, confessed years later that he considered The Captive Mind “a false book.” All that stuff about Murti-Bing pills and Ketman overcomplicated what was really a simple matter. Writers collaborated with the Communist regime out of “the usual fear and opportunism.” He nevertheless accepted Miłosz’s manuscript for publication because he thought it would be politically useful. It would give future defectors an alibi, casting their decision to collaborate as a tragic spiritual confusion instead of simple cowardice. It would also endear Miłosz to the Americans.

It worked. Miłosz came to the United States in 1960, just in time to observe a decade of campus unrest from his front-row seat in the Slavic studies department at the University of California, Berkeley. Mario Savio and the Berkeley Free Speech Movement hurled epithets like “Nazi” and “Eichmann” at every authority figure who resisted them, from university president Clark Kerr to campus police. Rather than call out their ridiculous comparison, Miłosz honored a student strike by canceling two days of lectures, the only professor in his department to do so. As he explained in a letter to a friend in 1966:

I support what is, in essence, opposition to crimes of homicide. . . . The horrors of Vietnam can only be interpreted by reading reports from American pilots (who are unaware that what they write about is, in European eyes, an atrocity that almost puts Hitlerism in the shade).

He considered their fascination with narcotics stupid and their sympathy for the Soviet bloc uninformed, but ultimately Miłosz’s criticism of the student radicals was that of a sympathetic ally. He agreed with them that American culture was materialistic and shallow. “The spiritual poverty of millions of the inhabitants of this country is horrifying,” he had written on his first visit to New York in 1947, when he was still working for the People’s Republic of Poland as a cultural attaché. This firmly held opinion prevented him from ever becoming an enthusiastic crusader for the free world.

The Captive Mind took on a life of its own, joining Darkness at Noon and 1984 on the shelf of twentieth-century anti-totalitarian classics, but Miłosz was never comfortable with his role as a cheerleader for the capitalist West. Susan Sontag lamented that she had first become aware of Miłosz not because of his poetry, but because “very reactionary right-wing groups” were using his book to provoke “anticommunist hysteria.”

Reluctance to get involved in Cold War politics almost prevented Miłosz from embarking on the best work of prose he was ever associated with, a book superior to The Captive Mind in every sense, political and literary. It is a genre popular in Eastern Europe but unknown elsewhere: the “spoken book,” a manuscript-length transcript of conversations between a literary eminence and a younger interviewer, usually a protégé. The eminence in this case was Aleksander Wat, a Polish poet ten years older than Miłosz who joined him on the faculty at Berkeley from 1964 to 1965. The edited interviews run to 450 pages and were published in 1977 under the title My Century. (New York Review Books Classics brought it back into print in 2003.)

Miłosz almost refused to participate in the project because, “to be frank, I was . . . apprehensive that this book would turn out to be yet another confession of a disillusioned ex-Communist.” It is fortunate that he changed his mind, because his sensitive questioning helped Wat to articulate a more convincing theory of communism than the psychological ones Miłosz put forward in The Captive Mind: that Bolshevism is literally demonic.

Wat suffered from debilitating headaches that doctors told him were psychosomatic. His own explanation was different. “My coming to the idea of communism, my intimacy with that idea, was really a demonic bond whose fruits are being felt only now, in my illness,” he tells Miłosz. “Doctors can’t cure me, but a good exorcist probably could.” Miłosz, who despite a skeptical streak remained a Catholic, says nothing to dispute Wat’s self-diagnosis.

The climax of My Century is Wat’s description of his conversion to Christianity (his parents were observant Jews), the result of a mystical vision of “the devil in history” in a Soviet prison in Saratov.

I saw a devil with hooves, the devil from the opera. I really did see him—it must have been a hallucination from hunger, but not only did I see him, but I could almost smell the brimstone. My mind was working at terribly high revolutions. It was the devil in history. And I felt something else, that the majesty of God was spread over history, over all this, a God distant but real. . . . It was so actual, so sensual, as if the devil was in my cell, the ceiling of the cell was lifted away, and God was above it all.

Miłosz, unlike Wat, was not a convert, which may be why he valued his Catholic faith less for its explanatory power than for the comfort it gave him. He acknowledged that, in the darkest days after his defection, “had it not been for the piety of a child brought up in the Catholic faith and able to pray in adulthood, I would not have coped.” Catholicism also gave his poetry a wonderful lushness, a rich embodiment of the beauty of creation in all its fleshly glory. If he had let his faith into his intellectual life the way he did into his emotional life and his art, it might have made him the acute diagnostician of Communist collaboration that his Western admirers wanted him to be.

For all his terrible misdeeds, Robert Mugabe was a symptom of his country’s more intractable problems.

Editor’s Note: The following piece appears in the December 18, 2017 issue of National Review.

One of the more poignant moments in the story of African decolonization was the small riot staged in Havana by a group of Congolese teenagers who had been sent to Cuba to study medicine at the Castro government’s expense. They had been selected by the authorities in Brazzaville more for their political connections than their academic records, with the result that very few among the hundreds of prospective doctors and nurses who landed in Cuba in 1966 had any knowledge of basic science; some could barely read and write. Nevertheless, they expected to be turned into doctors with a minimum of delay, for there were fewer than ten civilian doctors in the whole of Congo-Brazzaville at the time and most of them were foreigners. Whatever it was that the Cubans told the Congolese to explain why their med-school studies could not possibly begin immediately, it did not go over well.

But what could the Cubans have said? How do you explain to a suspicious Congolese who thinks he is ready for medical school that he is not even ready for university? He thinks you are trying to cheat him or disrespect him, and he doesn’t much care that as a Communist anti-imperialist you are on his side. You might try catching him out with some basic questions such as “Can you tell me what blood does?” or “Read aloud from this textbook,” but he may well fail to see the relevance. The Congolese students had probably never seen a doctor perform anything more complicated than an injection or an amputation, and it is hardly self-evident that it should take much time or much reading to learn doctoring of that sort. To them it must have seemed that the Cubans were setting needless obstacles in their path, most likely for self-interested reasons.

There is an analogy to be drawn between these Cubans and the country of Zimbabwe, previously Rhodesia, where for 15 years Prime Minister Ian Smith fought to prevent his country from electing someone like Robert Mugabe. Smith, too, had to explain to suspicious Africans why they were not prepared for something they believed to be no more than their due. But to make the analogy truly apt, the stakes in Cuba would need to have been higher. Never mind certifying their medical credentials. The question for the Cubans would need to have been: Would you let this Congolese doctor perform your appendectomy?

Now that Mugabe has lost power, there is a temptation to make the celebration a big-tent affair. As with Stalin, disillusionment with Mugabe set in piecemeal over several decades. Some turned against him with the genocide of the Matabele in the early 1980s, others not until the land invasions at the turn of the century. No doubt for some his homophobia was the deal-breaker. On this occasion, though, there is an understandable urge to set aside these differences, these expectations dashed or all too terribly fulfilled, and raise our glasses in a common toast: Thank God the bastard’s gone at last.

As appealing as such a moment would be, there is something dishonest about allowing mournful appraisals of Mugabe’s record to emit unchallenged from the very people, or types of people, who installed him in power in the first place. Partly it is the evasion of responsibility. Partly it is the more-in-sorrow-than-in-anger tone, when anger would be so much more appropriate. But more than anything else, these obituaries are hard to stomach because the story of Rhodesia is full of so many turning points when the Mugabe disaster could have been averted that it seems deliberately evasive to moan about that disaster without nailing your colors to at least one of them.

Reflecting in the late 1970s on the prospect of a Mugabe election victory, the conservative historian Robert Blake commented placidly, “The right to misgovern oneself is as valid as any other political right, and it is exercised more often than most.” After 35 years of ethnic cleansing, political murder, intimidation by rape, economic suicide, and massive depopulation from famine, emigration, and AIDS, this fatalism has not worn well. Those who would join in moral condemnation of Mugabe now that he is gone should have to come up with a better answer to how things could have gone so wrong than to shrug with Lord Blake that democracy wants what it wants, tant pis. Even divine-right monarchies had their tactful regencies and pragmatic sanctions. Modern democrats should be able to display at least as much imaginative flexibility as people who believed their rulers were ordained by God — if not in time to do any good, then at least in retrospect.

The most inviting answer to the question of what should have been done differently, which beckons like an oasis in the desert, is to blame the colonial regime. If only Rhodesia had been governed better, its oppressed native population would not have presented such an easy foothold to Marxist guerrillas. Alas, this particular oasis is a mirage — not because conditions for Africans were so splendid under Ian Smith and his predecessors, but because no amount of peace, prosperity, and good government has ever been a prophylactic against violent nationalism when other factors have made it an advantageous ideology to embrace. If nationalism were a function of oppression, there would have been a Mau Mau revolt in Hungary under the Soviets and rather less of one there under the Hapsburgs. Nationalism, like a contagious disease, does not discriminate.

It was, for precisely this reason, a waste of breath for Rhodesians to defend their regime on the facts — and, to be fair to them, they had no shortage of facts on their side. Secondary-school attendance among black Africans was higher in Rhodesia than anywhere else on the continent in 1960. Spending on African education tripled in the seven years before Rhodesia’s Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) in 1965. A quarter of the students at the integrated national university were black. Apart from its anomalous neighbor to the south, Rhodesia was the only sub-Saharan country where manufacturing accounted for more than 10 percent of GDP — one reason that, in the 1950s, real wages for black Rhodesians rose 40 percent in just five years. A booming economy meant that fewer blacks were willing to resort to the poorly paid domestic work that had long been a social flashpoint (and, it must be said, a magnet for politically reactionary white immigrants eager to live the grand colonial lifestyle on the cheap). Prosperity also produced such fashionable black suburbs as Marimba Park and Pelandaba, which observers admitted “compar[ed] very favorably with the best that can be found in England anywhere.”

Those who set material prosperity at naught compared with dignity and justice found Rhodesia equally ready with answers. The franchise was, and had always been, colorblind: Fifty Africans qualified for Rhodesia’s first election in 1923; 500 in 1953; and 65,000 under the two-tiered system in 1962, including 5,500 on the “A” roll (the more exclusive in Rhodesia’s two-tiered voting system based on property, income, and education). Racial discrimination in wage negotiations was abolished in 1959. Post offices and public swimming pools were integrated around the same time, and by the early 1960s white liberals in Salisbury were privately complaining that movie theaters and restaurants were abandoning the color bar faster than they could plan their sit-ins.

When Englishmen first arrived in Mashonaland in the 1880s, the civilization they encountered there had not developed currency, written language, irrigation, beasts of burden, the plough, or the wheel. Comparing that condition with what had been achieved by the time of independence, one is impressed not so much by how many modern improvements the Rhodesians had brought — anyone could have done that just by showing up — but by how successfully they had navigated some fairly momentous transitions. They had turned a subsistence economy into a market economy, where Africans were willing to work for wages, without passing through an intermediate stage of forced labor as most other civilizations had, Europe included. They had staged an industrial revolution without creating the overcrowded slums and Gin Lanes that had attended urbanization in their own country. They had replaced the caprice of a cruel Matabele despot, for whom the murder of entire families was a tool of policy, with the rule of law. All of this in 80 years — within the lifetime of one man.

Could it have been done better? Undoubtedly, but Western liberals always overestimate how easy it would have been to improve on the colonial standard of governance. The United Nations discovered this when it high-handedly expelled the Belgian teachers who had stayed on in the Congo after independence, for the teachers it found to replace them were both too few and far less adequate to the task than they expected — as in the case of the poor Haitian teacher who proudly told his hosts in Kasai that he was a full-blooded Luba by descent, at which point they, being Lulua, chased their hereditary enemy all the way back to the U.N. mission. The Africans of Rhodesia had shunned white doctors for years and then, almost overnight, began to swamp them. Obviously, more hospitals should have been built, but when? When they would have stood empty for God knows how many years at God knows what cost? Philip Mason, an old colonial hand, noted the same irony in the interwar years when demand was heard for more schools to be built in West Africa. It was odd, he wrote, to see “Nigerians from the North reproach the British with withholding the schools which their grandfathers had stipulated should not be introduced.”

When Terence Ranger, later the dean of southern-African historians, first arrived in Rhodesia to take up a position at the university in Salisbury, one of the first things he did was try to join up with the local African nationalists. “The problem was to find an African organization preparing to fight,” he wrote in his memoir. “In mid-1957, there was no militant or radical African organization.” There was a group in Harare calling itself the City Youth League, which in August 1956 staged a bus boycott to protest an increase in fares, and they were militant enough to punish a group of women who refused to participate, by assaulting and raping them. Less violently but not always less radically, the African press had undertaken various political and moral crusades since the founding of the Native Mirror in 1931, beginning with a campaign against Bulawayo merchants who marketed luxury goods to blacks. “How much did you spend last year on rubbish?” the editors scolded in 1934. “On things that were of no use? On concertinas? Gramophones? Cheap boots that were too small? Hats that didn’t fit?” This too-many-gramophones line was not pursued by later nationalists.

But certainly no one was thinking in terms of violent revolution. A few years earlier, Thompson Samkange had assured the annual convention of the Bantu National Congress that “no sensible African would wish that the Africans take over the Government of this Colony from Europeans, even after a hundred years or even a thousand.” (Not in a thousand years — fateful choice of words. Ian Smith would later use the same phrase, and be tagged with it forever after as proof of his intransigence.) Yet within a decade of Ranger’s arrival, the bush war had begun, and a decade after that, white rule was practically at an end. What had made the difference?

Several factors, not least of which were Ranger and his friends. It is fashionable now to say that the nationalists were radicalized by the prolongation of white resistance, that if the minority regime had only surrendered earlier, power would have gone to the moderate instead of the violent. Peter Godwin said exactly this in his otherwise sympathetic Guardian obituary for Ian Smith. When we examine the words and deeds of white liberals at the time, however, it becomes clear that they were slavering to hoist barricades from the word “go.”

“All hope of a constitutionalist, gradualist career for [the Southern Rhodesia African National] Congress is over. It might be worth Congress’s while to start formulating policy on long-term and revolutionary lines” — so wrote John Reed, a university colleague of Ranger’s, in January 1958. He had been in the country for less than a year. He later fled the country after authorities discovered he had been smuggling grenades in from Lusaka “so that effective protest against the declaration of UDI could be made,” as Ranger delicately puts it. The liberals of the Capricorn Africa Society were likewise hasty in declaring constitutional options exhausted in 1960 and — no doubt with the greatest personal reluctance — throwing their support behind glamorous violent radicals. When revolutionaries such as Joshua Nkomo flew to London, they were received by statesmen; when tribal chiefs of far greater local standing did the same, the British government barely acknowledged them. Events did not choose the terrorists; powerful white people did.

Among the external factors contributing to the rise of violent nationalism, there was first of all the death of Stalin, a boon in most respects but not to the Third World. It had been Stalin’s policy not to give money, arms, or training to anti-colonial rebellions, but Khrushchev shrewdly reversed this policy, with the Czech arms sale to Egypt in 1955 sounding the starting bell. Throughout the Sixties, AK-47s, RPG-2s, and East German uniforms found their way to revolutionaries all over Africa. This may be what made the difference between the interwar period, when Wilsonian talk of self-determination raised anti-colonial hopes in Asia and Africa, and the post-war period, when those hopes were finally satisfied: The earlier generation had fewer guns.

Second, there was the wave of African countries that gained their independence after 1957. However, one should not exaggerate the importance of the so-called Winds of Change. True, the new African states provided money for the guerrilla campaign. It was by threatening to cut off his funds that Ghanaian president Kwame Nkrumah forced Nkomo to boycott the pivotal 1962 elections, even after Nkomo had publicly endorsed the new constitution as a fair concession to African political aspirations. But it would be highly anachronistic to credit the flurry of new nations with creating a momentum behind decolonization that could not have been resisted. It is too easy to imagine a counterfactual where the dismal record of the newly independent nations sets the cause of anti-imperialism back a generation. The total implosion of the Ghanaian economy, Nkrumah’s cult of personality, villagization in Tanzania, the Biafra war, Idi Amin, not to mention Algeria and the Congo — we could not possibly grant independence to any similarly situated colony after such lessons as these, the British could have said, if they had wanted to.

The history books might well have taken just this line, had it not been for a third development: America’s endorsement of the anti-imperial crusade. Suez sent a strong enough signal, but in 1957 a certain Massachusetts senator gave a speech in favor of the Algerian rebels that had even Adlai Stevenson begging for a little less idealism. From the moment JFK was sworn in, every guerrilla group south of the Sahara figured it was in with a chance, as indeed they all were. Soviet arms may have helped prolong the bush war until the diplomats could finish the job, and government sinecures from the frontline states — e.g., Herbert Chitepo, Tanzanian director of public prosecutions — may have helped the nationalist leaders keep body and soul together, but in the post-Suez world, the decisions that ultimately determined Rhodesia’s fate were made in Washington, D.C.

What should have been done differently, then? Many have fixated on Reverend Abel Muzorewa, the moderate nationalist who served as prime minister of Zimbabwe-Rhodesia in 1979 and who, it is generally agreed, was egregiously betrayed when Jimmy Carter refused to recognize his government or lift sanctions even though his election was entirely democratic. But the Muzorewa government was weak, and a weak government would have ended up falling to Mugabe, or a Mugabe equivalent, sooner or later. Lord Carrington, the British foreign secretary, believed that handing power to Mugabe was the only way to stop the fighting — strangely, he considered this a reason Mugabe should be elected — and the fact that he was probably right under the circumstances is the last word on the Muzorewa option.

Any moderate solution, to have worked, would have required an America not wedded to the claim that one-man-one-vote, instituted immediately, is the only legitimate form of democracy. To posit such an America is not quite as absurd as simply to posit a Mugabe who doesn’t deploy North Korean–trained death squads. In 1956, when the career diplomat George Allen was asked by a French counterpart about the likely American attitude toward the Algerian pieds-noirs, he speculated that his country’s frontier history “would evoke sympathy for a white community settled for many generations in a non-European country, exposed to the attacks of the natives, who organize themselves for the defense of their hearths and homes.” The frontier comparison certainly made more sense than fitting ZANU and ZAPU for powdered wigs.

Any idea that liberal reform on the part of the Rhodesian state could have saved it is a non-starter, because the anti-imperialists were implacable and — I do not know a gentle way to put this — they were quite happy to lie. I do not mean just the professional liars of the Soviet propaganda shop, or the pundits who lazily referred to the Rhodesian system as “apartheid,” or the guerrillas who told Shona villagers that ZANU had successfully dynamited the Kariba Dam, or the foreign journalist who scattered candy around a garbage bin and captioned the resulting photo “Starving children searching for food in Salisbury.” Ralph Bunche had a doctorate from Harvard, a Nobel Peace Prize, and a co-author credit on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and when it came to imperialism, he lied.

“Colonial authorities like the noted Englishman, Lord Lugard, doubt that the African race, whether in Africa or America, can develop capability for self-government.” When I first read that in Bunche’s 1936 pamphlet “A World View of Race,” I felt a lurking suspicion that I had read a sentence of Lord Lugard’s beginning with the very words “The method of their progress toward self-government lies . . . ” I had. His next words are “along the same path as that of Europeans.” Even making allowances for CTRL-F’s not having been invented yet, Bunche’s remark is plain slander. With Harvard Ph.D.s pulling stunts like this, it is hard to summon much indignation at a garden-variety diplomatic lie like the U.N. claim, by which sanctions were justified, that Rhodesia had committed an act of aggression by maintaining its status quo.

It is therefore difficult to say what steps might have prevented Mugabe from coming to power. The most promising juncture was probably Britain’s Pearce Commission inquiry of 1972, which might have asked the democratic equivalents of the basic medical questions that should have been directed to the Congolese students with whom we began. Americans assume that the answers to questions such as “May I sell my vote for cash?” are self-evident, but the colonizing powers never did succeed in convincing ordinary Africans that obtaining a bureaucrat’s services through gifts is a form of corruption. Is the case against vote-buying more obvious? Why is voter intimidation enough to invalidate an election and not just the continuation of democracy by other means? Zambian president Kenneth Kaunda used to run around claiming that Arthur Creech-Jones, the Labour colonial secretary, wanted to give Africans their freedom, but Churchill had locked Creech-Jones in prison. A country with an overwhelming electoral majority willing to believe such things about the way democratic leaders treat the opposition is a country that is not ready for democracy.

Next, they might have taken a page from U.S. Border Control’s refugee protocol and given Ian Smith a “credible-fear interview” — i.e., what exactly are you worried will happen to you, and on what grounds? Here we have a test that the Rhodesian leaders could have passed where George Wallace, say, could not. Smith’s fears were not based on century-old horror stories about Reconstruction. If he believed that white minorities would be run out by the new regime in spite of all prior reassurances to the contrary, it was because that’s exactly what had happened in Algeria. If he worried that the country’s economy would be knocked back to subsistence, with famine following, it was because post-colonial Africa (with the exception of oil-boom Nigeria) had seen negative per capita economic growth in the 1970s. By the time of UDI, the world already had before it the examples of Ghana (Afro-fascism), Tanzania (police state), and the Congo (civil war). Instead of asking why Smith thought Zimbabwe would go the same way, we should ask why anyone thought it would be the exception.

Smith’s preferred course would have been for the country to continue along evolutionary lines. The Rhodesian constitution was designed so that black and white political power would converge as more and more Africans met the income and education qualifications, and eventually the desideratum of one-man-one-vote would be achieved. Britain itself had taken centuries to arrive at a universal franchise. The last property qualifications were abolished only in the 1920s. If the evolution had not been so gradual, Britain might well have had to endure dictatorship and revolution as the French did, and they might now be on constitution number 17 instead of the same one they’ve had since 1688.

Gradual evolution toward full democracy was the best that could have been hoped for under such difficult circumstances, and maybe the best that could have been hoped for, period.

Gradual evolution toward full democracy was the best that could have been hoped for under such difficult circumstances, and maybe the best that could have been hoped for, period. To find an alternative, one would have to follow the timeline all the way back to the beginning and imagine a world where the British never came to southern Africa at all — which is no alternative, really, since if the British had not ventured there another European power would have. From the moment the British and King Lobengula met, a colonial relationship was inevitable. Any relationship between two civilizations of such disparate attainments will be colonial, almost by definition. The best option, from that point, is for the relationship to be made as benign as possible, which is what Smith was asking permission to try to do.

Alas, none of his gambits could possibly have made the slightest difference, because the only players with any power in the crisis did not give a fig about Rhodesia, at least not compared with their own interests. The metropole will always sell out the colonies. This has been the rule since Rome. In the fifth century, the citizens of Clermont begged Rome to protect them from the barbarians or at least permit them to mount their own last-ditch defense, but the capital ordered them to surrender as part of a bargain with the Visigoths to protect the more important cities of Arles and Marseilles.

For Edward Heath, the more important city was Brussels. A strong line on Rhodesia was the price of Liberal support for his Common Market push in 1973; thus was the outcome of the Pearce Commission determined. Later PMs were driven by a need to make the UDI experiment fail in order to keep Belfast from getting any bright ideas. American politicians from LBJ onward used Rhodesia-bashing as an inexpensive way to win black votes. South Africa’s policy was decided according to whether Prime Minister John Vorster’s priority that month was wooing Henry Kissinger or fending off a third-party challenge from the right. There are two things no politician will give up before he has to: an issue and a bargaining chip. Rhodesia was both.

As for Arles and Marseilles: When the Visigoths got around to them, they were not saved.

Ian Smith was only “a farm boy from Selukwe” (in the contemptuous phrase of his predecessor Garfield Todd) and thus not quite as saturated in Roman history as the Englishmen across the negotiating table. But he could hardly have been ignorant of the basic outline of the parallel, staple that it was of English and French imperial rhetoric. “Like you, our ancestors resisted courageously a foreign invasion,” Napoleon III told a crowd of Arabs in Algiers in 1865, “and yet the vanquished Gauls assimilated with the Roman victors and from this was born, in time, the French nationality.” Lord Lugard, the man who apparently did not believe in African progress toward self-government, wrote that “as Roman imperialism laid the foundations of modern civilization and led the wild barbarians of these islands along the path of progress, so in Africa today we are repaying the debt.” The mission civilisatrice was not a doctrine; it was a precedent. (And one that Africans grasped perfectly: “When the English were subject to the Romans, if the Romans had segregated them, they would not be what they are today” was the argument of one Joseph Hlubi at a hearing on Transvaal land policy in 1918.)

The framers of the comparison spoke better than they knew, for Zimbabwe’s fate today is that of Britain after the withdrawal of the Romans. With the fall of that earlier empire, coinage disappeared and barter returned. Wheeled pottery was not seen again for 300 years. British roofs devolved from tile to thatch — perishable, flammable, insect-infested — and their floors reverted to plain earth. The very cattle shrank with the return of primitive methods of husbandry. Now that Mugabe is gone, we may be lucky and get for his successor a Zimbabwean King Arthur. But it is sobering to reflect, especially with China hovering in the wings, that the ruler for whom Britain had to wait before history could begin again was William the Conqueror.",1,http://www.nationalreview.com/article/454674/robert-mugabe-zimbabwe-descent-crisis

Nevertheless, they expected to be turned into doctors with a minimum of delay, for there were fewer than ten civilian doctors in the whole of Congo-Brazzaville at the time and most of them were foreigners. Whatever it was that the Cubans told the Congolese to explain why their med school studies could not possibly begin immediately, it did not go over well.

But what could the Cubans have said? How do you explain to a suspicious Congolese who thinks he is ready for medical school that he is not even ready for university? He thinks you are trying to cheat him or disrespect him, and he doesn’t much care that as a Communist anti-imperialist you are on his side. You might try catching him out with some basic questions like “Can you tell me what blood does?” or “Read aloud from this textbook,” but he may well fail to see the relevance. The Congolese students had probably never seen a doctor perform anything more complicated than an injection or an amputation, and it is hardly self-evident that it should take much time or much reading to learn doctoring of that sort. To them it must have seemed that the Cubans were setting needless obstacles in their path, most likely for self-interested reasons.

There is an analogy to be drawn between these Cubans and the country of Zimbabwe, previously Rhodesia, where for fifteen years Prime Minister Ian Smith fought to prevent his country from electing someone like Robert Mugabe. Smith, too, had to explain to suspicious Africans why they were not prepared for something they believed to be no more than their due. But to make the analogy truly apt, the stakes in Cuba would need to have been higher. Never mind certifying their medical credentials. The question for the Cubans would need to have been: Would you let this Congolese doctor perform your appendectomy?

Now that Mugabe has lost power, there is a temptation to make the celebration a big-tent affair. As with Stalin, disillusionment with Mugabe set in piecemeal over several decades. Some turned against him with the genocide of the Matabele in the early 1980s, others not until the land invasions at the turn of the century. No doubt for some his homophobia was the deal-breaker. On this occasion, though, there is an understandable urge to set aside these differences, these expectations dashed or all too terribly fulfilled, and raise our glasses in a common toast: Thank God the bastard’s gone at last.

As appealing as such a moment would be, there is something dishonest about allowing mournful appraisals of Mugabe’s record to emit unchallenged from the very people, or types of people, who installed him in power in the first place. Partly it is the evasion of responsibility. Partly it is the more-in-sorrow-than-in-anger tone, when anger would be so much more appropriate. But more than anything else, these obituaries are hard to stomach because the story of Rhodesia is full of so many turning points when the Mugabe disaster could have been averted that it seems deliberately evasive to moan about that disaster without nailing your colors to at least one of them.

Reflecting in the late 1970s on the prospect of a Mugabe election victory, the conservative historian Robert Blake commented placidly, “The right to misgovern oneself is as valid as any other political right, and it is exercised more often than most.” After 35 years of ethnic cleansing, political murder, intimidation by rape, economic suicide, and massive depopulation from famine, emigration, and AIDS, this fatalism has not worn well. Those who would join in moral condemnation of Mugabe now that he is gone should have to come up with a better answer to how things could have gone so wrong than to shrug with Lord Blake that democracy wants what it wants, tant pis. Even divine-right monarchies had their tactful regencies and pragmatic sanctions. Modern democrats should be able to display at least as much imaginative flexibility as people who believed their rulers were ordained by God — if not in time to do any good, then at least in retrospect.

The most inviting answer to the question of what should have been done differently, which beckons like an oasis in the desert, is to blame the colonial regime. If only Rhodesia had been governed better, its oppressed native population would not have presented such an easy foothold to Marxist guerrillas. Alas, this particular oasis is a mirage — not because conditions for Africans were so splendid under Ian Smith and his predecessors, but because no amount of peace, prosperity, and good government has ever been a prophylactic against violent nationalism when other factors have made it an advantageous ideology to embrace. If nationalism were a function of oppression, there would have been a Mau Mau revolt in Hungary under the Soviets and rather less of one there under the Hapsburgs. Nationalism, like a contagious disease, does not discriminate.

It was, for precisely this reason, a waste of breath for Rhodesians to defend their regime on the facts — and, to be fair to them, they had no shortage of facts on their side. Secondary-school attendance among black Africans was higher in Rhodesia than anywhere else on the continent in 1960. Spending on African education tripled in the seven years before Rhodesia’s Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) in 1965. A quarter of the students at the integrated national university were black. Apart from its anomalous neighbor to the south, Rhodesia was the only sub-Saharan country where manufacturing accounted for more than 10 percent of GDP — one reason why, in the 1950s, real wages for black Rhodesians rose 40 percent in just five years. A booming economy meant that fewer blacks were willing to resort to the poorly paid domestic work that had long been a social flashpoint (and, it must be said, a magnet for politically reactionary white immigrants eager to live the grand colonial lifestyle on the cheap). Prosperity also produced such fashionable black suburbs as Marimba Park and Pelandaba, which observers admitted “compare very favourably with the best that can be found in England anywhere.”

Those who set material prosperity at naught compared with dignity and justice found Rhodesia equally ready with answers. The franchise was, and had always been, colorblind: Fifty Africans qualified for Rhodesia’s first election in 1923; 500 in 1953; and 65,000 under the two-tiered system in 1962, including 5,500 on the “A” roll (the more exclusive in Rhodesia’s two-tiered voting system based on property, income, and education). Racial discrimination in wage negotiations was abolished in 1959. Post offices and public swimming pools were integrated around the same time, and by the early 1960s white liberals in Salisbury were privately complaining that movie theaters and restaurants were abandoning the color bar faster than they could plan their sit-ins.

When Englishmen first arrived in Mashonaland in the 1880s, the civilization they encountered there had not developed currency, written language, irrigation, beasts of burden, the plough, or the wheel. Comparing that condition with what had been achieved by the time of independence, one is impressed not so much by how many modern improvements the Rhodesians had brought — anyone could have done that just by showing up — but by how successfully they had navigated some fairly momentous transitions. They had turned a subsistence economy into a market economy, where Africans were willing to work for wages, without passing through an intermediate stage of forced labor as most other civilizations had, Europe included. They had staged an industrial revolution without creating the overcrowded slums and Gin Lanes that had attended urbanization in their own country. They had replaced the caprice of a cruel Matabele despot, for whom the murder of entire families was a tool of policy, with the rule of law. All of this in 80 years — within the lifetime of one man.

Could it have been done better? Undoubtedly, but Western liberals always overestimate how easy it would have been to improve on the colonial standard of governance. The United Nations discovered this when it high-handedly expelled the Belgian teachers who had stayed on in the Congo after independence, for the teachers it found to replace them were both too few and far less adequate to the task than they expected — as in the case of the poor Haitian teacher who proudly told his hosts in Kasai that he was a full-blooded Luba by descent, at which point they, being Lulua, chased their hereditary enemy all the way back to the U.N. mission. The Africans of Rhodesia had shunned white doctors for years and then, almost overnight, began to swamp them. Obviously more hospitals should have been built, but when? When they would have stood empty for God knows how many years at God knows what cost? Philip Mason, an old colonial hand, noted the same irony in the interwar years when demand was heard for more schools to be built in West Africa. It was odd, he wrote, to see “Nigerians from the North reproach the British with withholding the schools which their grandfathers had stipulated should not be introduced.”

* * * * *

When Terence Ranger, later the dean of southern African historians, first arrived in Rhodesia to take up a position at the university in Salisbury, one of the first things he did was try to join up with the local African nationalists. “The problem was to find an African organization preparing to fight,” he wrote in his memoir. “In mid-1957, there was no militant or radical African organization.” There was a group in Harare calling itself the City Youth League, which in August 1956 staged a bus boycott to protest an increase in fares, and they were militant enough to punish a group of women who refused to participate with assault and rape. Less violently but not always less radically, the African press had undertaken various political and moral crusades since the founding of the Native Mirror in 1931, beginning with a campaign against Bulawayo merchants who marketed luxury goods to blacks. “How much did you spend last year on rubbish?” the editors scolded in 1934. “On things that were of no use? On concertinas? Gramophones? Cheap boots that were too small? Hats that didn’t fit?” This too-many-gramophones line was not pursued by later nationalists.

But certainly no one was thinking in terms of violent revolution. A few years earlier, Thompson Samkange had assured the annual convention of the Bantu National Congress that “no sensible African would wish that the Africans take over the Government of this Colony from Europeans, even after a hundred years or even a thousand.” (Not in a thousand years — fateful choice of words. Ian Smith would later use the same phrase, and be tagged with it forever after as proof of his intransigence.) Yet within a decade of Ranger’s arrival, the bush war had begun, and a decade after that, white rule was practically at an end. What had made the difference?

Several factors, not least of which was Dr. Ranger and his friends. It is fashionable now to say that the nationalists were radicalized by the prolongation of white resistance, that if the minority regime had only surrendered earlier, power would have gone to the moderate instead of the violent. Peter Godwin said exactly this in his otherwise sympathetic Guardian obituary for Ian Smith. When we examine the words and deeds of white liberals at the time, however, it becomes clear that they were slavering to hoist barricades from the word “go.”

“All hope of a constitutionalist, gradualist career for [the Southern Rhodesia African National] Congress is over. It might be worth Congress’s while to start formulating policy on long-term and revolutionary lines” — so wrote John Reed, a university colleague of Ranger’s, in January 1958. He had been in the country for less than a year. He later fled the country after authorities discovered he had been smuggling grenades in from Lusaka “so that effective protest against the declaration of UDI could be made,” as Ranger delicately puts it. The liberals of the Capricorn Africa Society were likewise hasty in declaring constitutional options exhausted in 1960 and — no doubt with the greatest personal reluctance — throwing their support behind glamorous violent radicals. When revolutionaries such as Joshua Nkomo flew to London, they were received by statesmen; when tribal chiefs of far greater local standing did the same, the British government barely acknowledged them. Events did not choose the terrorists; powerful white people did.

Among the external factors contributing to the rise of violent nationalism, there was first of all the death of Stalin, a boon in most respects but not to the Third World. It had been Stalin’s policy not to give money, arms, or training to anti-colonial rebellions, but Khrushchev shrewdly reversed this policy, with the Czech arms sale to Egypt in 1955 sounding the starting bell. Throughout the Sixties, AK-47s, RPG-2s, and East German uniforms found their way to revolutionaries all over Africa. This may be what made the difference between the interwar period, when Wilsonian talk of self-determination raised anti-colonial hopes in Asia and Africa, and the post-war period, when those hopes were finally satisfied: The earlier generation had fewer guns.

Second, there was the wave of African countries that gained their independence after 1957. However, one should not exaggerate the importance of the so-called Winds of Change. True, the new African states provided money for the guerrilla campaign. It was by threatening to cut off his funds that Ghanaian president Kwame Nkrumah forced Nkomo to boycott the pivotal 1962 elections, even after Nkomo had publicly endorsed the new constitution as a fair concession to African political aspirations. But it would be highly anachronistic to credit the flurry of new nations with creating a momentum behind decolonization that could not have been resisted. It is too easy to imagine a counterfactual where the dismal record of the newly independent nations sets the cause of anti-imperialism back a generation. The total implosion of the Ghanaian economy, Nkrumah’s cult of personality, villagization in Tanzania, the Biafra war, Idi Amin, not to mention Algeria and the Congo — we could not possibly grant independence to any similarly situated colony after such lessons as these, the British could have said, if they had wanted to.

The history books might well have taken just this line, had it not been for a third development: America’s endorsement of the anti-imperial crusade. Suez sent a strong enough signal, but in 1957 a certain Massachusetts senator gave a speech in favor of the Algerian rebels that had even Adlai Stevenson begging for a little less idealism. From the moment JFK was sworn in, every guerrilla group south of the Sahara figured it was in with a chance, as indeed they all were. Soviet arms may have helped prolong the bush war until the diplomats could finish the job, and government sinecures from the frontline states may have helped the nationalist leaders keep body and soul together (e.g., Herbert Chitepo, Tanzanian director of public prosecutions), but in the post-Suez world, the decisions that ultimately determined Rhodesia’s fate were made in Washington, D.C.

* * * * *

What should have been done differently, then? Many have fixated on Reverend Abel Muzorewa, the moderate nationalist who served as prime minister of Zimbabwe–Rhodesia in 1979 and who, it is generally agreed, was egregiously betrayed when Jimmy Carter refused to recognize his government or lift sanctions even though his election was entirely democratic. But the Muzorewa government was weak, and a weak government would have ended up falling to Mugabe, or a Mugabe equivalent, sooner or later. Lord Carrington, the British foreign secretary, believed that handing power to Mugabe was the only way to stop the fighting — strangely, he considered this a reason Mugabe should be elected — and the fact that he was probably right under the circumstances is the last word on the Muzorewa option.

Any moderate solution, to have worked, would have required an America not wedded to the claim that one-man-one-vote, instituted immediately, is the only legitimate form of democracy. To posit such an America is not quite as absurd as simply to posit a Mugabe who doesn’t deploy North Korean–trained death squads. In 1956, when the career diplomat George Allen was asked by a French counterpart about the likely American attitude toward the Algerian pieds-noirs, he speculated that his country’s frontier history “would evoke sympathy for a white community settled for many generations in a non-European country, exposed to the attacks of the natives, who organize themselves for the defense of their hearths and homes.” The frontier comparison certainly made more sense than fitting ZANU and ZAPU for powdered wigs.

Any idea that liberal reform on the part of the Rhodesian state could have saved it is a non-starter, because the anti-imperialists were implacable and — I do not know a gentle way to put this — they were quite happy to lie. I do not mean just the professional liars of the Soviet propaganda shop, or the pundits who lazily referred to the Rhodesian system as “apartheid,” or the guerrillas who told Shona villagers that ZANU had successfully dynamited the Kariba Dam, or the foreign journalist who scattered candy around a garbage bin and captioned the resulting photo “Starving children searching for food in Salisbury.” Ralph Bunche had a doctorate from Harvard, a Nobel Peace Prize, and a co-author credit on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and when it came to imperialism, he lied.

“Colonial authorities like the noted Englishman, Lord Lugard, doubt that the African race, whether in Africa or America, can develop capability for self-government.” When I first read that in Bunche’s 1936 pamphlet “A World View of Race,” I felt a lurking suspicion that I had read a sentence of Lord Lugard’s beginning with the very words “The method of their progress toward self-government lies . . .” I had. His next words are “along the same path as that of Europeans.” Even making allowances for CTRL-F’s not having been invented yet, Bunche’s remark is plain slander. With Harvard PhD’s pulling stunts like this, it is hard to summon much indignation at a garden-variety diplomatic lie like the U.N. claim, by which sanctions were justified, that Rhodesia had committed an act of aggression by maintaining its status quo.

* * * * *

It is therefore difficult to say what steps might have prevented Mugabe from coming to power. The most promising juncture was probably Britain’s Pearce Commission of 1972, which might have asked the democratic equivalents of the basic medical questions that should have been directed to the Congolese students with whom we began. Americans assume that the answers to questions such as “May I sell my vote for cash?” are self-evident, but the colonizing powers never did succeed in convincing ordinary Africans that obtaining a bureaucrat’s services through gifts is a form of corruption. Is the case against vote-buying more obvious? Why is voter intimidation enough to invalidate an election and not just the continuation of democracy by other means? Zambian president Kenneth Kaunda used to run around claiming that Labour colonial secretary Arthur Creech-Jones wanted to give Africans their freedom but Churchill had locked him in prison. A country with an overwhelming electoral majority willing to believe such things, especially about the way democratic leaders treat their opposition, is a country that is not ready for democracy.

Next, they might have taken a page from U.S. Border Control’s refugee protocol and given Ian Smith a “credible-fear interview” — i.e., what exactly are you worried will happen to you, and on what grounds? Here we have a test that the Rhodesian leaders could have passed where George Wallace, say, could not. Smith’s fears were not based on century-old horror stories about Reconstruction. If he believed that white minorities would be run out by the new regime in spite of all prior reassurances to the contrary, it was because that’s exactly what had happened in Algeria. If he worried that the country’s economy would be knocked back to subsistence, with famine following, it was because post-colonial Africa (with the exception of oil-boom Nigeria) had seen negative per capita economic growth in the 1970s. By the time of UDI, the world already had before it the examples of Ghana (Afro-fascism), Tanzania (police state), and the Congo (civil war). Instead of asking why Smith thought Zimbabwe would go the same way, we should ask why anyone thought it would be the exception.

Smith’s preferred course would have been for the country to continue to develop along evolutionary lines. The Rhodesian constitution was designed so that black and white political power would converge as more and more Africans met the income and education qualifications, and eventually the desideratum of one-man-one-vote would be achieved. Britain itself had taken centuries to arrive at a universal franchise. The last property qualifications were abolished only in the 1920s. If the evolution had not been so gradual, Britain might well have had to endure dictatorship and revolution as the French did, and they might now be on constitution number 17 instead of the same one they’ve had since 1688.

Gradual evolution toward full democracy was the best that could have been hoped for under such difficult circumstances, and maybe the best that could have been hoped for, period. To find an alternative, one would have to follow the timeline all the way back to the beginning and imagine a world where the British never came to southern Africa at all — which is no alternative, really, since if the British had not ventured there another European power would have. From the moment the British and King Lobengula met, a colonial relationship was inevitable. Any relationship between two civilizations of such disparate attainments will be colonial, almost by definition. The best option, from that point, is for the relationship to be made as benign as possible, which is what Smith was asking permission to try to do.

Alas, none of his gambits could possibly have made the slightest difference, because the only players with any power in the crisis did not give a fig about Rhodesia, at least not compared with their own interests. The metropole will always sell out the colonies. This has been the rule since Rome. In the fifth century, the citizens of Clermont begged Rome to protect them from the barbarians or at least permit them to mount their own last-ditch defense, but the capital ordered them to surrender as part of a bargain with the Visigoths to protect the more important cities of Arles and Marseilles.

For Edward Heath, the more important city was Brussels. A strong line on Rhodesia was the price of Liberal support for his Common Market push in 1973; thus was the outcome of the Pearce Commission determined. Later PMs were driven by a need to make the UDI experiment fail in order to keep Belfast from getting any bright ideas. American politicians from LBJ onward used Rhodesia-bashing as an inexpensive way to win black votes. South Africa’s policy was decided according to whether Prime Minister John Vorster’s priority that month was wooing Henry Kissinger or fending off a third-party challenge from the right. There are two things no politician will give up before he has to: an issue and a bargaining chip. Rhodesia was both.

As for Arles and Marseilles: When the Visigoths got around to them, they were not saved.

* * * * *

Ian Smith was only “a farm boy from Selukwe” (in the contemptuous phrase of his predecessor Garfield Todd) and thus not quite as saturated in Roman history as the Englishmen across the negotiating table. But he could hardly have been ignorant of the basic outline of the parallel, staple that it was of English and French imperial rhetoric. “Like you, our ancestors resisted courageously a foreign invasion,” Napoleon III told a crowd of Arabs in Algiers in 1865, “and yet the vanquished Gauls assimilated with the Roman victors and from this was born, in time, the French nationality.” Lord Lugard, the man who apparently did not believe in African progress toward self-government, wrote that “as Roman imperialism laid the foundations of modern civilization and led the wild barbarians of these islands along the path of progress, so in Africa today we are repaying the debt.” The mission civilisatrice was not a doctrine; it was a precedent. (And one that Africans grasped perfectly: “When the English were subject to the Romans, if the Romans had segregated them, they would not be what they are today” was the argument of one Joseph Hlubi at a hearing on Transvaal land policy in 1918.)

The framers of the comparison spoke better than they knew, for Zimbabwe’s fate today is that of Britain after the withdrawal of the Romans. With the fall of that earlier empire, coinage disappeared and barter returned. Wheeled pottery was not seen again for 300 years. British roofs devolved from tile to thatch — perishable, flammable, insect-infested — and their floors reverted to plain earth. The very cattle shrank with the return of primitive methods of husbandry. Now that Mugabe is gone, we may be lucky and get for his successor a Zimbabwean King Arthur. But it is sobering to reflect, especially with China hovering in the wings, that the ruler for whom Britain had to wait before history could begin again was William the Conqueror.",1,https://herandrews.com/2017/11/30/zimbabwes-trauma/

Thank you for signing up to our Sunday Post newsletter.

But the finance secretary is, by his own admission, offering little radical in the way of new ideas for Scotland’s economy.

Swinney has been in charge of Scotland’s purse strings for nine years now.

The job will take on a whole new dimension next year when Holyrood is handed the power to set Scottish taxes.

He said: “This is a different election because it’s set against the backdrop of the parliament becoming more powerful, being able to exercise broader responsibilities and crucially to go into really very substantial new areas of activity in relation to tax.”

The parties appear to be struggling to get to grips with the new reality. While Labour last week altered the detail of their policy on raising rates by a penny – a fine tune or a U-turn depending on point of view – the SNP have got into a muddle over the 50p band.

First Minister Nicola Sturgeon called raising the top rate of tax “daft” yet also said she’s not opposed to a 50p rate in principle.

Swinney explained: “We do not believe it would be correct to apply a 50p tax rate given the research we’ve set out that demonstrates the very real possibility that if you apply the 50p tax rate it may end up costing us as opposed to generating additional tax revenues. .”

The SNP claim that a 50p rate would cost Scotland as much as £30 million because those subject to it could move over the Border to avoid it.

However, higher earners will pay more as Swinney has chosen not to follow George Osborne in raising the bar at which the 40p tax rate kicks in.

He added: “I accept that higher-rate taxpayers will be required to pay more in taxation. That’s us making a choice. We think people on higher incomes can afford to contribute more to the public finances.”

At the other end of the scale, Swinney is committed to freezing the basic rate of income tax. He said: “That’s the right reassurance to give to people who are already finding it challenging to make ends meet. We’ll give them that assurance for the remainder of the parliamentary term.”

As well as being finance minister, Swinney is deputy First Minister and Nicola Sturgeon has made him her election supremo for this campaign, precisely because the economy is set to dominate.

Swinney was one of the SNP delegates at the Smith Commission that generated the Scotland Act and he led negotiations with Westminster on the fiscal framework, the deal struck on how Holyrood’s new powers will be paid for.

He said: “The fiscal framework discussions were an abject lesson in what it means to have a government that’s prepared to stand up for Scotland.

“We stood up for Scotland and we defeated the Tory Treasury in their attempts to reduce the budget for Scotland and that was the right thing.” to do.”

Looking ahead, he says productivity will be his focus and he highlights SNP plans to hit 100% internet connectivity.

He said: “If we deliver improvements in productivity we will improve economic opportunity for all the citizens of Scotland. The country will be a better-paid country. It will have a better quality of employment, it will have a more satisfying working environment and atmosphere.

“All of these factors will be a result of improving productivity in Scotland.”

He admits that the broad SNP message on the economy is steady as she goes, however.

“It’s about building on solid foundations,” he went on. “We’ve established as a government very clear directions of improvement.

“This election is about whether people are prepared to give us a further opportunity to continue that direction and continue to improve the lives of people in Scotland.”

Economic stability in last five years

The key political event of the last five years of SNP administration was the independence referendum.

If that had resulted in a Yes vote it would have been an economic event too.

For the Scottish Government’s own figures released last month showed that Scotland would have been left facing some very hard choices to balance the books.

The SNP’s reputation for prudence may well have been shot.

Instead, the Scottish economy has grown alongside that of the UK in recent years with a rise in productivity and significant increases in employment.

John Swinney is justly proud of shepherding the economy safely since 2007 through the banking crisis that gripped the globe.

The party rightly trumpet low youth unemployment – partly thanks to a drive to increase apprenticeships – and high female employment.

Similarly Swinney talks up passing tough anti-avoidance measures on tax while handing over millions of pounds in grants to Amazon, notorious for how little tax it stumps up in the UK.

The SNP were taken to task earlier this year for supporting Amazon while the internet giant doesn’t pay the living wage. Yet the Scottish Government insists anyone bidding for work from the company must pay the living wage.

The SNP would argue the Amazon grants create jobs.

They’ve applied the same pragmatic approach to more traditional industries.

The Scottish Government piled in when Ferguson’s shipyard went into administration, just as it did in the current steel crisis. In both instances it has successfully brought in buyers for the businesses and saved jobs.

The SNP like to boast they’ve always balanced the books. But the law states they must. That will change with new tax and borrowing powers coming next year meaning whoever is in charge of the Scottish purse strings will have a lot more work to do.

Bertrand Russell, who may be considered an authority on the subject, marveled at Keynes’s self-regard.

This is the sort of historical and psychological context that might usefully be provided in yet another book on the Keynes-Hayek debate. Alas, this is not what is offered by Thomas Hoerber’s little book, which has the feel of a think-tank white paper stretched beyond its natural limits. Rather than bring the debate of yesterday to bear on our own time, as the dust jacket promises, he merely retells yesterday’s debate in today’s clichés, in order to support his arguments for greater economic regulation by the state and, especially, the European Union.

Hoerber’s contention is that the fight between Hayek and Keynes has been mischaracterized as one between freedom and control, when really both sides were equally interested in freedom. Hayek’s mistake, he argues, was in failing to see that Keynes embraced economic planning precisely in order to preserve liberal democracy from the threat of revolution. This is an old tactic. Keynes used it himself in his popular journalism—heed my advice, or else capitalism will be discredited and who knows what will follow! Equating Hayek and Keynes on this basis makes as much sense as equating the NYPD and a Mafia protection racket: One offered a warning, the other a threat.

In reality, Keynes did not care a fig for freedom. He claimed to, but then so did the Soviets, on the logic that man under capitalism cannot be free if he is starving. Was Lenin therefore a devotee of freedom? Keynes’s contempt for the common people was boundless. In any conflict between their preferences and his own expert prescriptions, Keynes never hesitated to choose the latter. He predicted in the General Theory that the future would require—the understatement is justly famous—“ a somewhat comprehensive socialisation of investment.” If he sometimes referred to this end state as a free market, the appeal was rhetorical.

Hoerber repeatedly uses the same maneuver to defend his own cherished ideal, the EU. Libertarians have no love for this institution, he has noticed, but this is only because, like Hayek, they do not take a sufficiently wide view of freedom. The EU “was founded from the outset on liberal market values,” he insists. “Freedom in political terms, embodied in democracy, became the unshakeable foundation of the EU, an ideal Hayek defended passionately in The Road to Serfdom.” (Mind the dangling modifier.) Libertarians fail to recognize the EU as the true guardian of freedom only because they are blinded by their Hayekian misapprehension that fishery licenses are the first step on a slippery slope to the gulag.

If this is his argument, Hoerber cannot have read The Road to Serfdom very closely. In fact, I am sure he hasn’t, because he commits the howling anachronism of claiming that the book warns against the “nanny state.” This is a phrase beloved by modern Hayekians but not by Hayek. It first came into use more than two decades after The Road to Serfdom was published, and as far as I know Hayek never used it. More importantly, the penny-ante regulations the term refers to—smoking bans, soda taxes—are categorically not what Hayek was warning against.

The regulations Hayek warned against were those that socialism cannot help but impose because it requires them in order to function. The decision to fix prices or plan production does not lead to an unaccountable army of paid snoops and arbitrary bureaucrats, it necessarily implies them, because those are the only possible means of its enforcement. That is the whole thesis of the book: “Socialism can be put into practice only by methods of which most socialists disapprove.” Hoerber’s failure to grasp this point leads him into the strangest and weakest of his central arguments, that Hayek was “oversimplifying” to draw an equivalence among fascism, communism, and socialism.

“There can thus be no doubt as to the fundamental difference between communists and socialists in basic attitudes towards political values, such as democracy and economic policy,” Hoerber triumphantly concludes at the end of his chapter on Hayek’s theory of totalitarianism. The basis for this claim is that social democrats say nice things. But the best intentions will not prevent a Kautsky from becoming a commissar when the necessities of economic planning demand it—again, this is Hayek’s entire point. Hoerber thinks that you can tell the difference between nice and nasty socialists by their attitude to power: “If it becomes an end in itself, as for Lenin or Stalin, the danger of corruption is great.” And if not, not? This is startlingly naïve, even from a true believer in the European project.

Keynes was a man of surfaces. His knowledge, even of economics, was not deep, and he was not well read. His pamphlet “The End of Laissez-Faire,” which biographer Skidelsky calls his “most learned essay in political economy” and praises for “his range of references,” cites nothing Keynes would not have read as an undergraduate. When he won Cambridge’s Adam Smith Prize in 1909, he had, ironically, not even read The Wealth of Nations. He labored to cultivate his instincts, not his erudition, and Hayek was right when he reflected that Keynes’s “interests were very largely guided by aesthetic appeal.”

It is an unattractive quality in an intellectual, this substitution of instinct for learning, but at least Keynes’s instincts were generally good. He had a real sense for beauty, a real quality of command, real charm. Hoerber, too, operates at the surface of things. He too tries to prevail on his readers by means of attitude more than argument. But instead of speaking in the manner of a self-confident English aristocrat, he talks like a professor at a French school of management, which he is. He is guided not by instinct but by that far less reliable shortcut, cliché (“neoliberalism,” “sustainable growth,” “raptor capitalism”). Every currency in the world has suffered inflation since the days of Keynes and Hayek. Apparently the coin of expertise is no exception.

73,Andrews,Helen,weeklystandard,"Robert Skidelsky, whose biography of John Maynard Keynes is unlikely ever to be surpassed, judged that his subject “never needed a Jehovah, because he had never experienced despair.” Skidelsky was speaking of religion and morals, a department where Keynes was a typical Bloomsbury hedonist. In economics, to find a system with no deity, it is necessary to consult not Keynes but his archrival, Friedrich Hayek. There most certainly was a Jehovah in Keynes’s economic system; he saw him every morning when he shaved.

Americans sometimes fail to grasp the full extent of Keynes’s egotism, which underlay all his theories of government by economic experts, because we assume that all aristocrats are like that. They are not. The Cambridge Apostles were notorious for their arrogance throughout Edwardian England, from Westminster Palace to the pages of Punch, and his fellow Apostles considered Keynes exceptionally arrogant even by their standards. Bertrand Russell, who may be considered an authority on the subject, marveled at Keynes’s self-regard.

This is the sort of historical and psychological context that might usefully be provided in yet another book on the Keynes-Hayek debate. Alas, this is not what is offered by Thomas Hoerber’s little book, which has the feel of a think-tank white paper stretched beyond its natural limits. Rather than bring the debate of yesterday to bear on our own time, as the dust jacket promises, he merely retells yesterday’s debate in today’s clichés, in order to support his arguments for greater economic regulation by the state and, especially, the European Union.

Hoerber’s contention is that the fight between Hayek and Keynes has been mischaracterized as one between freedom and control, when really both sides were equally interested in freedom. Hayek’s mistake, he argues, was in failing to see that Keynes embraced economic planning precisely in order to preserve liberal democracy from the threat of revolution. This is an old tactic. Keynes used it himself in his popular journalism—heed my advice, or else capitalism will be discredited and who knows what will follow! Equating Hayek and Keynes on this basis makes as much sense as equating the NYPD and a Mafia protection racket: One offered a warning, the other a threat.

In reality, Keynes did not care a fig for freedom. He claimed to, but then so did the Soviets, on the logic that man under capitalism cannot be free if he is starving. Was Lenin therefore a devotee of freedom? Keynes’s contempt for the common people was boundless. In any conflict between their preferences and his own expert prescriptions, Keynes never hesitated to choose the latter. He predicted in the General Theory that the future would require—the understatement is justly famous—“ a somewhat comprehensive socialisation of investment.” If he sometimes referred to this end state as a free market, the appeal was rhetorical.

Hoerber repeatedly uses the same maneuver to defend his own cherished ideal, the EU. Libertarians have no love for this institution, he has noticed, but this is only because, like Hayek, they do not take a sufficiently wide view of freedom. The EU “was founded from the outset on liberal market values,” he insists. “Freedom in political terms, embodied in democracy, became the unshakeable foundation of the EU, an ideal Hayek defended passionately in The Road to Serfdom.” (Mind the dangling modifier.) Libertarians fail to recognize the EU as the true guardian of freedom only because they are blinded by their Hayekian misapprehension that fishery licenses are the first step on a slippery slope to the gulag.

If this is his argument, Hoerber cannot have read The Road to Serfdom very closely. In fact, I am sure he hasn’t, because he commits the howling anachronism of claiming that the book warns against the “nanny state.” This is a phrase beloved by modern Hayekians but not by Hayek. It first came into use more than two decades after The Road to Serfdom was published, and as far as I know Hayek never used it. More importantly, the penny-ante regulations the term refers to—smoking bans, soda taxes—are categorically not what Hayek was warning against.

The regulations Hayek warned against were those that socialism cannot help but impose because it requires them in order to function. The decision to fix prices or plan production does not lead to an unaccountable army of paid snoops and arbitrary bureaucrats, it necessarily implies them, because those are the only possible means of its enforcement.

The basis for this claim is that social democrats say nice things.

74,Andrews,Helen,washingtonpost,"Helen Andrews is a 2017 Robert Novak Journalism Fellow and has worked as an editor and a think tank researcher.

The younger brother of the poet Archibald MacLeish wrote a letter to his fiancee in 1917 complaining about how depressed and humiliated he felt at having been passed over by all of Yale's secret societies. He had not even been tapped by Skull and Bones, where, through Archie, he was a legacy. ""It almost kills me,"" he wrote. ""I want to get to France and forget the whole thing.""

It was a fateful choice of words. Kenneth MacLeish left school to join the Naval Reserve Flying Corps, deployed to France as a pilot and was shot down over Belgium on Oct. 14, 1918, less than a month before World War I ended. He was 24.

What is it about Yale's secret societies that makes otherwise sensible people so awestruck? Why did young men like Kenneth MacLeish feel it was a matter of life and death whether they were admitted to the clubs? Strictly speaking, the Yale senior societies are not fundamentally different from the exclusive social clubs found at every other Ivy League school. But no one ever based a horror movie franchise around the Princeton dining clubs.

If it is the secrecy of these groups that you find appealing, ""Skulls and Keys"" is the wrong book for you. David Alan Richards admits at the beginning that ""there will be no 'secrets' here that have not already, somehow and somewhere, been revealed at least once in print."" Richards is a Bonesman himself, so he could divulge hidden secrets if he wanted to, but apparently he decided that his book didn't need to be spiced up with juicy insider details.

[How Harvard, Princeton and Yale discovered women]



“Skull and Keys,” by David Alan Richards (Pegasus Books)

Alas, without the juicy details, ""Skulls and Keys"" amounts to little more than a succession of anecdotes, some more interesting than others. Conservative readers will be gratified to learn that William F. Buckley Jr. refused to join the Fence Club if it continued to blackball his friend Thomas Guinzberg for being Jewish. But even the original Bonesmen of the 1830s would probably agree that their dirty jokes (""How did Demosthenes have such numerous progeny when he carried his stones in his mouth?"") did not need to be entered into the historical record.

The bagginess of this 800-plus-page tome is made worse by the fact that Richards is not a natural storyteller. (He is a lawyer by profession.) The fight that led to women finally being let into Skull and Bones in 1991 makes a gripping saga: keys to the tomb confiscated, lawsuits threatened, top-secret memos leaked and printed in the Wall Street Journal. Richards fumbles what should be the climax of his book. He waits until nearly the end of the book to mention that one of the undergraduate ringleaders in favor of admitting women was future Obama economic adviser Austan Goolsbee.

Richards's microscopic view of his subject obscures the larger fact that Yale's secret societies have long been in decline. They no longer have the cultural cachet they enjoyed in the days of John O'Hara and Dink Stover. Undergraduates walk past the brownstone tomb on High Street with no more interest than they walk past Yorkside Pizza. Membership is still sought after by the ambitious for networking purposes, but the secret societies have lost their glamor.

Their decline coincided with the increasingly meritocratic policies of the 1960s. That much is clear. Less clear is what precisely about that seismic cultural shift proved fatal. Mere egalitarianism was never the problem, since left-wing political commitments rarely stopped anyone from accepting admission to a society, even when outsiders accused them of hypocrisy. In 1971 a student columnist noted with indignation that the students inducted that year included ""one black militant, a leading spokesman of last spring's Mayday activities, [and] one of the organizers of the charity drive for New Haven."" How, he asked, can some of the ""most outspoken defenders of the community last spring now be a member of a society that does nothing for the community?""

Old-timers would say things started going downhill when the clubs let women in. Resistance to going coed persisted surprisingly late. The first two times Skull and Bones considered admitting women, in 1971 and 1986, alumni committees voted against it unanimously. To give the fuddy-duddies their due, most secret societies throughout history, since the days of the first Freemasons, have been all male. Perhaps women are less easily impressed by silly costumes and creepy chanting.

Bart Giamatti, who served as president of Yale from 1978 to 1986, believed that the declining prestige of secret societies was an unavoidable consequence of diversity. ""What a freshman in 1914 had heard of societies from his preparatory school masters and a freshman in 1944 might hear from one of his numerous classmates whose relatives had attended Yale, a freshman in 1974, more likely than not from a public high school, with no previous Yale ties, would not hear at all,"" he wrote in 1978 in a history of his own secret society, Scroll and Key. ""That ingrained consciousness of societies, that shared sense of what they meant . . . disappeared like smoke in the late sixties.""

[Five myths about college admissions]

Even after those public-school upstarts learned what secret societies were, they still were unfamiliar with conventions that were second nature to legacies: whether you were allowed to lobby societies in advance (no), how seriously to take the code of secrecy (very), even something as simple as the procedure for Tap Night, the traditional evening of robes and rituals when all the societies induct their new members. Seniors had to spell everything out to the juniors in advance, which rather diminished the mystique.

Harvard recently announced that it was considering barring students from joining fraternities, sororities and exclusive single-gender groups known as ""final clubs."" Members of such clubs are already subject to penalties, including ineligibility for certain grants and fellowships. In July, the Committee on Unrecognized Single-Gender Social Organizations officially recommended a total ban.

Yale partisans may be tempted to take delight in the fact that their school has not taken such a humorless stand against a venerable form of undergraduate socializing. But the sad truth may be that, after a long slide into irrelevance, Yale secret societies are not important enough to be worth banning.",1,https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/a-look-inside-yales-secret-societies--and-why-they-may-no-longer-matter/2017/09/28/118c7eb2-8cca-11e7-84c0-02cc069f2c37_story.html

Between the World and Me

Ta-Nehisi Coates

Spiegel & Grau, 2015

176 pp., $24.00

When he set out to interview James Baldwin for his oral history of the civil rights movement, Who Speaks for the Negro? (1965), Robert Penn Warren knew that the challenge would be to get any straightforward answers out of him. “In general, in Baldwin’s utterances, written or spoken,” he explained, “there is a tendency to pull away from the specific issue which might provoke analysis, toward one more general … toward the absolute, the eschatological.” Forewarned is forearmed, but in this case it was not enough: Baldwin’s pivot maneuver was invincible. “For example, when I asked him about the obligation of the Negro, he countered by saying he wasn’t sure what a Negro is. What is a Negro?” With quiet amusement, Warren admitted, “That is, indeed, a more charged and fascinating question than the one I had asked.”

Ta-Nehisi Coates has the same ultra-macroscopic tendency as his hero, as can be seen in the highly recognizable style of conclusion with which he often ends his blog posts at The Atlantic: short, sweeping, indefinite, ponderous. Like Baldwin, Coates prefers to back up from the original question so far that, by the time he is finished, he is off in the exosphere:

Aren’t all nations problems? Aren’t all families? Aren’t all people? Likely the fight was always muddy and dizzying. Likely nothing was ever clean. We don’t always get to choose the means through which we acquire knowledge. Ignorance is not a weapon.

Those kickers come from posts about civic virtue, The Bell Curve, and Aaron Sorkin—the reader can guess which is which.

Coates’s new book, Between the World and Me, is full of the same sort of pronouncements: “The entire narrative of this country argues against the truth of who you are.” “You have to make your peace with the chaos.” “The pursuit of knowing was freedom to me.” But beneath the orotundities, there is a thesis, which, whatever else you want to say about it, is not at all vague. He believes that white Americans lead a charmed life, which he calls the Dream, which is sustained by the deliberate “plunder” (his self-proclaimed buzzword) of black Americans. The mechanics of this plunder are subtle:

I came to see the streets and the schools as arms of the same beast. One enjoyed the official power of the state while the other enjoyed its implicit sanction. But fear and violence were the weaponry of both. Fail in the streets and the crews would catch you slipping and take your body. Fail in the schools and you would be suspended and sent back to those same streets, where they would take your body. And I began to see these two arms in relation—those who failed in the schools justified their destruction in the streets. The society could say, “He should have stayed in school,” and then wash its hands of him.

“No one directly proclaimed that schools were designed to sanctify failure and destruction,” he admits. The word that comes next is “But.”

This, too, is pure Baldwin. “Black people were killing each other every Saturday night out on Lenox Avenue, when I was growing up,” Baldwin wrote in 1970,

and no one explained to them, or to me, that it was intended that they should; that they were penned where they were, like animals, in order that they should consider themselves no better than animals. Everything supported this sense of reality, nothing denied it; and so one was ready, when it came time to go to work, to be treated as a slave.

Since the end of Jim Crow, authors who have asserted that white America is not just misguided but actively wicked in its dealings with black America have tended to grow hazy when it comes to what benefit, exactly, white America derives from this villainy. Here we see why: Generally it is the least plausible link in an already tenuous logical chain. In Baldwin’s case, one can only say that if there was a conspiracy to make diligent worker bees of black urban males, it has not gone to plan. In the annals of cui bono, this ranks with the time the head of SNCC said we were in Vietnam “for the rice supplies.”

With Coates, the central weakness of his argument is that everything always comes back to the violence of “the streets.” School, to him, is just a meaningless hurdle designed to furnish a pretext for white indifference to that violence. The “daily everyday violence that folks live under” puts the April 2015 riots in Baltimore beyond condemnation. What “daily everyday” violence, and at whose hands? That the perpetrators are mostly young and black can be surmised from the list of little violence-avoiding choices that, Coates says, tyrannized his mental life as a child—what to wear, where to sit at lunch, what route to take to and from school, with what friends from what neighborhoods. Then there is this story he tells about his mother:

When your grandmother was sixteen years old a young man knocked on her door. The young man was your Nana Jo’s boyfriend. No one else was home. Ma allowed this young man to sit and wait until your Nana Jo returned. But your great-grandmother got there first. She asked the young man to leave. Then she beat your grandmother terrifically, one last time, so that she might remember how easily she could lose her body.

And here the weakness becomes plain, because the connection that Coates keeps trying to insinuate into existence between the black violence he has observed and the white menace he has postulated just snaps. White supremacy did not invent the rule that young women should generally keep male callers on the doorstep when they are home alone. The danger against which this rule is a precaution is not a racial one.

Once the reader pulls on this string, the whole web starts to unravel, because the connection between white supremacy and the other violence Coates describes is not very well substantiated either. If suburbia is to blame for young Ta-Nehisi getting beat up on his way home from school, it is only in the most abstract, cosmic sense. And at what metaphysical remove does it become fair to write, as Coates does, that the Baltimore street toughs of his youth “in their large rings and medallions, their big puffy coats and full-length fur-collared leathers … their armor against their world,” were “girding themselves against the ghosts of the bad old days when the Mississippi mob gathered round their grandfathers”? A damned rarefied one—the same one from which Baldwin blamed white people for the assassination of Malcolm X because “whoever did it was formed in the crucible of the American Republic.”

* * * * *

But abstract, cosmic blame is just what Coates refuses to be satisfied with. His case is grounded in policy, as he often reminds us. He is not speaking metaphorically when he says that America has grown rich by seizing black people’s wealth. His favorite example is redlining, which kept government-backed mortgages out of black neighborhoods in the decades between the New Deal and the Fair Housing Act of 1968. The main character of Coates’s famous “Case for Reparations” article is a 91-year-old Chicagoan named Clyde Ross, whose inability to get a federally insured home loan in the 1960s led him to buy a house “on contract,” an arrangement where one missed payment could leave a person with no equity and no house. Coates is eloquent on the toll this took on Ross, who worked second and third jobs to keep up his payments: “Money and time that Ross wanted to give to his children went instead to enrich white speculators.”

Since Coates is interested in housing policy and sad stories, I wonder what he thinks of the fate of Saul and Gertrude Pearlman, two of the tens of thousands of Jews who vacated the neighborhoods of Dorchester and Mattapan (or “Murdapan,” as it has come to be known) in the wake of the federal government’s decision to make it easier rather than harder for black buyers to get home loans—a policy reversal which Coates has not troubled to note, as far as I can see. Beginning in 1968, the city of Boston put a private consortium, the Boston Banks Urban Renewal Group, in charge of implementing this new federal policy, and B-BURG took to it with a zeal born of avarice and fear. In the wake of the King assassination riots, the business community were “shaking like quivering boys,” Mayor Kevin White later recalled.

Within five years of receiving their first batch of subsidized B-BURG homeowners—half of whom would soon lose their houses to foreclosure or abandonment, and some of whom never made a single payment on their loans—the formerly thriving neighborhoods of Dorchester and Mattapan went from having 40,000 Jews to fewer than 2,500.

In his book, Coates cavalierly attributes “white flight” to “self-generated fears that compelled the people who think they are white to flee the cities and into the Dream.” The fears that sent the Pearlmans running from their home on Kerwin Street were not self-generated, nor did they come from the scare tactics of real-estate blockbusters. They came from experiences like being trussed up for hours while intruders with hunting knives ransacked their home for nonexistent valuables, and from hearing their kindhearted black neighbour say, “You’re older, Jewish, and vulnerable. It’s over for you here.”

Were the Jews of Mattapan “plundered”? What about the victims, direct and indirect, of the Community Reinvestment Act, the debauch of credit standards in the housing market, the racial quotas imposed on the mortgage giants, and all of the other programs that it was hoped would close the black–white gap in housing wealth which, Coates may be surprised to learn, he is not the first person to notice? The federal government clearly took from the Pearlmans something of great value; whether it was of greater value than what was taken from Clyde Ross is impossible to say. Nevertheless, I would refrain from using Coates’s favorite word in this context, if only because I cherish hopes of maintaining some boundaries to its definition.

The danger in allowing “plunder” to become a nonsense term is foreshadowed by the fate of its cousin epithet “neo-colonialism.” Because “neo-colonial” has no stable definition—it could describe literally any interaction between the West and the Third World—African despots have used it to condemn anything they don’t like. With this magic word, it is possible to cancel entire investment projects, send aid shipments back, put inconvenient charity groups on planes home. The word’s flexibility also means that rulers can refrain from applying it to exploitative things that they do like, including some of the less savory Chinese operations on the continent. The word “neo-colonialism” thus becomes what every word becomes when it is subordinated to politics: an expression of raw arbitrary power.

Coates uses the word “plunder” for a grab-bag of tragedies, misfortunes, and annoyances: an eviction he witnesses in Chicago, presumably over chronic non-payment of bills; the “killing fields” of inner city gang violence; the “inescapable robbery of time” in “the moments we spend readying the mask, or readying ourselves to accept half as much”; and, somewhat off-topic, “the damming of seas for voltage, the extraction of coal, the transmuting of oil into food.” But these things are not plunder. Plunder is what Britain did to Ireland. It is what Thaddeus Stevens wanted to do to the prostrate South. (Would a Congressman Coates have opposed him?) Coates justifies his moth-antenna sensitivity to “plunder” on the logic that “there was no golden era when evildoers did their business and loudly proclaimed it as such.” But if you had asked an English parliamentarian to defend the Penal Laws, he would have freely admitted that the immiseration of the Irish was the whole point. The idea was to render them incapable of starting yet another savage civil war—not, in itself, an unworthy goal. Nor did Thad Stevens consider “confiscation” a slur. Plunder is a venerable and useful concept. In Coates’s hands, it is a stick to beat his enemies with.

* * * * *

It may be that Coates is not familiar with all of this history. There is quite a lot of history he doesn’t know, by his own admission. In December 2012, it notoriously came up in an interview that Coates had never heard of Saint Augustine—which would have been fine, except that earlier that very day he posted an item on his blog arguing that Christian holidays are no less “made-up” than Kwanzaa. People who have never heard of Augustine are not necessarily ignorant in an objective sense. They may not even be ignorant in the contextual sense that they should not be senior editors of national magazines. But people who have never heard of Augustine probably should not go around pronouncing on the made-up-ness of Christmas and Easter.

Then again, an autodidact’s knowledge is always irregular, and even his critics must allow that Coates’s willingness to admit what he doesn’t know is one of his most admirable qualities. Another is contagious enthusiasm, also an amateur’s virtue. But Coates has the flaws as well as the gifts of a born autodidact. His veneration of primary sources verges on the superstitious, and he sometimes wields old quotations the way fundamentalists wield Bible verses, as if the words themselves had incantatory power. In just two years Coates cited Mississippi’s secession ordinance seven times on his blog, always by way of proving that the Civil War was about slavery—which it was, but one paragraph from a fundamentally propagandistic document is not quite the debunking Coates made it out to be. Why assume that Confederates would pour out their innermost motivations, shorn of all politically motivated misdirection, into this particular document? Coates does not explain. For him it is enough that the words are “what actual Confederates were saying.”

There is one quotation from John C. Calhoun that Coates uses over and over again in the same fashion—in his book, in the “Reparations” article, in his blog series on the Civil War:

With us the two great divisions of society are not the rich and poor, but white and black; and all the former, the poor as well as the rich, belong to the upper class, and are respected and treated as equals.

Why has Coates fixated (if that is not too strong a word) on this quotation in particular, as if there were not a hundred other racist Calhoun quotes to choose from? Perhaps because it shows Calhoun trying to substitute race for class, and that is precisely Coates’s own game. Like the Fanonists of his father’s generation, who cast the Third World in the role of the proletariat, there is something distinctly Marxist about Ta-Nehisi Coates. You can hear it in his harping on “plunder” and exploitation, in his hard-nosed rejection of bourgeois sentimentality, in his conviction that all suffering is the product of some elite class’s self-serving design, and more recently in his aggressive atheism.

If you ever want to send a chill up your own spine, replace “black people” with “the working class” in one of Coates’s angrier effusions. “The Dream rests on the worker’s back, the bedding made from our bodies … The Dreamers accept this as the cost of doing business, accept the bodies of the working class as currency … The worker is naked before the elements of the world, and this nakedness is not an error but the correct and intended result of policy.” It is no coincidence, comrade! This is why the adulation Coates receives from the mainstream press is so disturbing: not because a fashionable pundit is being praised out of proportion to his talent—that happens all the time—but because it proves we have lost our collective antibodies to the most destructive ideology of the twentieth century. Have theAtlantic readers who find “plunder” such an interesting concept never heard the lyrics to “Solidarity Forever”? (“They have taken untold millions that they never toiled to earn …”) Do they not remember how that story ends?

This legacy casts an ominous shadow over the most remarked-upon anecdote in Between the World and Me, the story of the woman who pushed Coates’s son on an Upper West Side escalator:

You were almost five years old. The theater was crowded, and when we came out we rode a set of escalators down to the ground floor. As we came off, you were moving at the dawdling speed of a small child. A white woman pushed you and said, “Come on!” Many things now happened at once. There was the reaction of any parent when a stranger lays a hand on the body of his or her child. And there was my own insecurity in my ability to protect your black body. And more: There was my sense that this woman was pulling rank. I knew, for instance, that she would not have pushed a black child out on my part of Flatbush, because she would be afraid there and would sense, if not know, that there would be a penalty for such an action. But I was not out on my part of Flatbush.… I turned and spoke to this woman, and my words were hot with all of the moment and all of my history. She shrunk back, shocked.

“She would not have pushed a black child out on my part of Flatbush.” He does not say that she would not have pushed him if he’d been white, but that she would not have pushed him if they’d been in his neck of Brooklyn. Why? “Because she would be afraid.” Afraid of what? Of getting her head kicked in, presumably. Something about the way Coates contemplates this possibility suggests that, for all his protestations, he quite likes the idea that other people’s lives should be hemmed in by this kind of “penalty.” Maybe virtue without terror is impotent after all. “In America, it is traditional to destroy the black body—it is heritage,” Coates writes. I will stack America’s ideological heritage against his any day, in any measurement he chooses—but most especially in bodies destroyed.",1,https://herandrews.com/2015/08/09/the-things-ta-nehisi-doesnt-know/
76,Andrews,Helen,claremont,"Today the crisis of American government is expressed in an ungainly phrase that rarely appeared in conservative vocabulary in the 1950s and 1960s—the “administrative state,” by which is meant the independent “fourth branch of government” that fits nowhere within the scheme of the Constitution as understood by its authors. Conservatives were slow to perceive the full nature and origins of the administrative state. They saw Marxism and radicalism as wholly foreign in character, and the character of Progressive Era and New Deal bureaucracy as primarily economic and narrowly constitutional in nature. They missed the benign-sounding homegrown versions of deeply radical political philosophy behind the administrative state, and especially the key role of Woodrow Wilson and similar Progressive Era intellectuals. If Wilson was mentioned at all, it was usually with a shrug or mild approval of his conventional expressions of Christian faith.

The urgency of the Cold War dominated the attention of conservative intellectuals and activists alike, and with the predations of the New Deal fresh in mind, it was understandable that the conservatism of that time would set the New Deal as the horizon line for their attack on current American politics. Only slowly did it come into focus that the New Deal was not the key turning point toward liberalism, and that socialism is not the chief threat to constitutional government and individual liberty.

The “administrative state” is not a new or recent phrase; it has been around for several decades, but its nature and depth was only recently more fully appreciated. Once confined chiefly to scholars and policy wonks, the term is now in widespread popular use. The administrative state is not the same thing as bureaucracy, with its connotations of wastefulness, inefficiency, red-tape, and rule-bound rigidity, nor it is limited to the post-New Deal welfare and entitlement state. Its character is best described by Alexis de Tocqueville in his famous chapter on “What Sort of Despotism Democratic Nations Have to Fear.” After struggling over what to call it, he could do no better than “soft despotism.”

The administrative state represents a new and pervasive form of rule, and a perversion of constitutional self-government. It has deep theoretical roots that were overlooked for a long time, roots inimical to the Constitution, thereby providing a lesson in the importance of understanding the principles of the Constitution. A chief feature of the administrative state is its relentless centralization, but with a reciprocal effect: its mandates, regulations, distorting funding mechanisms, and elitist professionalism have corrupted our political culture all the way back down to local government. It is the chief reason why Americans increasingly have contempt for government.

Unlike the attacks on the Constitution from Charles Beard, J. Allen Smith, Vernon Parrington, and other Progressive historians of the early 20th century that portrayed the Constitution as an anti-democratic fraud, the most potent part of Progressivism, and its chief legacy for today, was its theoretical attack on the American Founding. Progressivism reduced to the proposition that the principles of the founding were wrong for the 20th century, and needed to be discarded. The swirling currents of Darwinism, Hegelian historicism, and scientific hubris all combined, in the summation of Harvey Mansfield, Jr., to make Wilson “the most powerful intellect in the movement” and “the first American president to criticize the Constitution.”

The Very Definition of Tyranny

What bothered Wilson the most was one of the central features of the logic of the Constitution as explained especially in The Federalist: the separation of powers. Wilson laid out his criticism of the separation of powers in his book Constitutional Government in the United States, in which he argued in favor of a “Darwinian” Constitution. Government, he argued, is not a machine, but a living, organic thing. And “No living thing can have its organs offset against each other as checks, and survive…. You cannot compound a successful government out of antagonisms.” Wilson thought the conditions of modern times demanded that government power be unified rather than fragmented and checked. His great confidence in the wisdom of science and benevolence of expert administrators led him to the view that the founders’ worries about concentrated power were obsolete. He exhibited the combination of love for power and unbounded paternalism that is the hallmark of the administrative state today. He wrote in Congressional Government that “I cannot imagine power as a thing negative and not positive,” and on another occasion that “If I saw my way to it as a practical politician, I should be willing to go farther and superintend every man’s use of his chance.” Quite a contrast from James Madison’s views expressed in The Federalist on the permanent reasons for suspicion of government power, as well as his specific understanding of the separation of powers: “The accumulation of all powers legislative, executive, and judiciary in the same hands, whether of one, a few or many, and whether hereditary, self appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.” Wilson explained once that the increased role of the national government could be accomplished “only by wresting the Constitution to strange and as yet unimagined uses…. As the life of the nation changes so must the interpretation of the document which contains it change, by a nice adjustment, determined, not by the original intention of those who drew the paper, but by the exigencies and the new aspects of life itself.” The legal academy was happy to oblige. Harvard’s Roscoe Pound, for example, remarked that “No one will assert at present that the separation of powers is part of the legal order of nature or that it is essential to liberty.”

The main reason Progressives like Wilson no longer shared the older liberal suspicion of government power was the new view that politics and administration could be neatly and cleanly separated, with administration entrusted to scientifically trained and disinterested experts, who by their very expertise should be insulated from political pressure. Frank Goodnow, a prominent political scientist of the Progressive Era and one of Wilson’s teachers, provides the best short summary of this view in his book Politics and Administration: A Study in Government:

The fact is, then, that there is a large part of administration which is unconnected with politics, which should therefore be relieved very largely, if not altogether, from the control of political bodies. It is unconnected with politics because it embraces fields of semi-scientific, quasi-judicial and quasi-business or commercial activity—work which has little if any influence on the expression of the true state will. For the most advantageous discharge of this branch of the function of administration there should be organized a force of government agents absolutely free from the influence of politics. Such a force should be free from the influence of politics because of the fact that their mission is the exercise of foresight and discretion, the pursuit of truth, the gathering of information, the maintenance of a strictly impartial attitude toward the individuals with whom they have dealings, and the provision of the most efficient possible administrative organization. The position assigned to such officers should be the same as that which has been by universal consent assigned to judges. Their work is no more political in character than is that of judges.

There is something almost charming as well as comic about this level of naïveté, except that so many people in the administrative apparatus of government still believe it.

Unconstitutional Government

Blasting apart the separation of powers is the single most important change that enabled the rise of the administrative state—much more important even than the income tax. In recent years a number of leading legal scholars, such as Richard Epstein and Philip Hamburger, have said openly what would once have been unthinkable and unsayable in serious company: the modern administrative state is unconstitutional. Writing in the Harvard Law Review in the early 1990s, Gary Lawson of Boston University School of Law put the proposition with admirable directness and concision: “The modern administrative state is not merely unconstitutional; it is anti-constitutional. The Constitution was designed specifically to prevent the emergence of the kinds of institutions that characterize the modern administrative state.” And he says “the destruction of this principle of separation of powers is perhaps the crowning jewel of the modern administrative revolution.”

Lawson offers this illuminating one-paragraph description of the administrative state in action:

Consider the typical enforcement activities of a typical federal agency—for example, of the Federal Trade Commission. The Commission promulgates substantive rules of conduct. The Commission then considers whether to authorize investigations into whether the Commission’s rules have been violated. If the Commission authorizes an investigation, the investigation is conducted by the Commission, which reports its findings to the Commission. If the Commission thinks that the Commission’s findings warrant an enforcement action, the Commission issues a complaint. The Commission’s complaint that a Commission rule has been violated is then prosecuted by the Commission and adjudicated by the Commission. This Commission adjudication can either take place before the full Commission or before a semi-autonomous Commission administrative law judge. If the Commission chooses to adjudicate before an administrative law judge rather than before the Commission and the decision is adverse to the Commission, the Commission can appeal to the Commission. If the Commission ultimately finds a violation, then, and only then, the affected private party can appeal to an Article III court. But the agency decision, even before the bona fide Article III tribunal, possesses a very strong presumption of correctness on matters both of fact and of law.

While legal scholars and policy wonks are devoting increased attention to the structure and methods of the administrative state, the idea that its suspect constitutional foundations will lead to any meaningful rollback has little or no purchase in contemporary jurisprudence. The main reason for this sorry state is that the roots of the problem go deeper than decades of bungled Supreme Court opinions, aggressive presidents, and a complacent or negligent Congress. The problem of the administrative state goes beyond a failure to internalize the insights of public choice theory, the restraints of economic cost-benefit analysis, or the erosion of the non-delegation doctrine. It is another example of what happens when first principles are forgotten or obscured. And the bitter irony of it is how conservatives unwittingly assisted this demolition job.

Follow the Leader

Wilson and most other leading Progressives hated the Declaration of Independence for its principle of individual rights rooted in “the laws of nature and nature’s God.” The central philosophical proposition of “Progressivism” is that History with a capital “H” or “Progress” with a capital “P” had replaced nature as the ground of political life. As implausible as it might seem today, the idea that science would unlock Newtonian “laws of motion” for history, thus making the course of the future as predictable as the acceleration of a falling object, was surprisingly widespread. And if history is scientifically predictable it is controllable. The world of chance and accident could be conquered. “Progress!” Wilson wrote; “No word comes more often or more naturally to the lips of modern man.”

The State, now with a capital “S” to go along with capital “H” History and capital “P” Progress, is the agent of purposeful change. Out of this progressive philosophy the modern understanding of “political leadership” was born—the necessity of what George H.W. Bush unwittingly but correctly mocked as “the vision thing.” “Leadership” was a term almost wholly absent from the vocabulary of the founders. Modern “leadership” is distinct from the older understanding of statesmanship. A progressive leader sees ahead, and thus forces the pace of change, whereas statesmanship is more anchored in the understanding of the limits of politics. In a remarkable 1890 essay entitled “Leaders of Men,” Wilson set out a bold and frequently shocking account of modern political leadership, such as this:

The competent leader of men cares little for the interior niceties of other people’s characters: he cares much—everything for the external uses to which they may be put. His will seeks the lines of least resistance; but the whole question with him is a question of the application of force. There are men to be moved: how shall he move them? He supplies the power; others supply only the materials upon which that power operates. The power will fail if it be misapplied; it will be misapplied if it be not suitable both in kind and method to the nature of the materials upon which it is spent; but that nature is, after all, only its means. It is the power which dictates, dominates: the materials yield. Men are as clay in the hands of the consummate leader.

There is much else of this ominous character throughout this long, confusing essay, including a studied disavowal that he is any kind of radical or socialist. At the heart of Progressivism is a confusion and contradiction that has always made Progressivism a vague and tricky creed to sort out. Progressivism saw itself as the moderate alternative to revolutionary socialism, but its economic inclinations certainly tended toward the kind of central authoritarian control of the economy that is nearly indistinguishable from socialism. It was not explicitly utopian, but its underlying philosophy ran in that direction. The Progressives were always imprecise about how much or how far human nature might be malleable.

But by far the greatest contradiction was the idea that Progressivism would be more populist and elitist at the same time. Practical democratic reforms such as the direct election of senators, initiative and referendum, and so forth, were intended to give more voice to the people, while the doctrine of scientific administration sought to seal off a larger and larger portion of government from the people. It represented the American domesticated version of the phrase attributed to Friedrich Engels and Saint-Simon that “the government of men will be replaced by the administration of things.” The Progressive attempt to resolve this contradiction involved supercharging the distinction between means and ends—popular politics would allow the public to speak about the ends of government, while the means would be left to the expert administrators. But as the ends of Progressive politics were severed from the old liberal understanding of protecting individual natural rights and were now open-ended, this distinction collapses instantly.

Between the ideology of Progress as understood by the visionary “leader” and the doctrine of scientific administration, a new understanding of the difference between the ruler and the ruled took hold—and it isn’t good news for the ruled. Despite his frequent obscurity and paeans to democracy and the “will of the people,” Wilson argues at one point in “Leaders of Men” that the “vision” of Progress is the new supreme force in politics: “Resistance is left to the minority, and such as will not be convinced are crushed.”

Recall how often it is today that progressives will criticize the minority who resist the latest progressive advance such as gay marriage or de-gendered bathrooms with the telltale phrase, “on the side of history.” It is the leading slogan of the soft despotism of our age, all the more confident and aggressive for its presumption that its goals need not be rationally justified through argument or persuasion.

Progressivism surely did not understand itself as tyrannical, and on the surface it eschewed utopian ideology, but its premises were metaphysically identical to utopian ideologies that invariably end up tyrannical in practice. There was sufficient ambiguity in Progressive thought to muddy up the picture, and even Wilson’s strongest critics disagree about how to understand his brand of Progressivism. Not all Progressives joined Wilson in attacking or rejecting the Declaration of Independence. (Historian Albert J. Beveridge, for example, frequently invoked the Declaration in its original meaning.) But overall the dominant Wilsonian variety of Progressivism amounted to a revolution, a re-founding of the country in which all of the old terms—liberty, equality, consent, rights, and freedom—were retained, but with wholly new meanings. (Wilson advocated for what he called “mature freedom,” which was very different from traditional understandings of liberty.)

More and More about Less and Less

The First World War and its sequels put an end to the easygoing assumption of inevitable or irreversible progress, but the residue of Progressive theory—most especially the idea of the scientifically-managed administrative state—was firmly in place, to be picked up and expanded by the New Deal after the brief interregnum of the “return to normalcy” in the 1920s. It didn’t take long during the New Deal to recognize that the idea of “neutral” or “disinterested” expert administrative government was a farce, that in practice independent bureaucratic entities would become the active agents for discrete interests and ideological impulses, the overwhelming majority being client groups of one party. That bureaucratic government is the partisan instrument of the Democratic Party is the most obvious yet least remarked upon trait of our time (though this lack of public identification can be taken as additional evidence of the incompetence of the Republican Party).

Economists tended to call this phenomenon “agency capture,” and while accurate, it goes nowhere near the heart of the matter. A central aspect of so-called “expert” administration beyond organizational self-interest and clientism is the deliberate gnosticism of its operation. Max Weber, the preeminent early theorist of bureaucratic government as well as a progenitor of modern social science, foresaw this in the 19th century. The tragedy of Weber was his inability to shake loose from his positivist fact-value distinction, despite signs that he recognized the inadequacy of a world without the ability to make rational, objective moral judgments and politics without great statesmen.

American Progressives had none of Weber’s honest doubts and anguish, chiefly because of their total absorption of historicism (and also because Weber’s works were mostly unknown in America at the time). And if Progress and History soon waned as a dominant, driving foundation for Progressive politics, the positivist distinction between facts and values, which corresponds to the distinction between administrative questions and political questions, endured. By mid-century the behaviorial revolution came to dominate political science just as much as the rest of social science, replacing History as the ground of mastery. Political philosophy was declared to be dead. Behaviorism was an even more explicitly deterministic outlook than Progress, but it shared with Progressive historicism the same convenient but self-contradictory trait that it preserves for the rulers alone freedom of choice and action. The “scientific” elites of the administrative state were still in business.

Although behaviorism provoked furious debates about methodology and the place of political philosophy in political science around mid-century, it soon waned too. It is embarrassing now to look back upon the cartoonish rigidity of the fact-value distinction and the confidence that science was on its way to unlocking causation in humans and human affairs, while openly placing questions of “value”—or the ends of politics—beyond the reach of human reason. One of Leo Strauss’s signal contributions was explaining how Weber’s fact-value distinction was in the end indistinguishable from nihilism, despite the futile attempt of Weber and his successors to preserve some sphere of objective reality for “values.”

The behaviorism of mid-century has been replaced by regression modeling, which is scarcely better, though more modest in its pretensions. Edward Banfield asked: “Would anyone maintain that in the Convention of 1787 the Founders would have reached a better result with the staff of model builders?” Walter Berns thought the detachment from taking moral questions and human excellence seriously made behavioral political science diabolical: “It would be ironic if the science that once made man free, were now to become the instrument of his enslavement.”

This wasn’t just a critique of narrow specialization, of “knowing more and more about less and less,” as Strauss put it. Lots of “mainstream” and left-leaning political scientists also decried the fact-value distinction, precisely because of the moral relativism it imposes like a straightjacket, and the self-limiting obscurity of increasingly technical specialization. In fact, it is hard to say whether the revolt against the fact-value distinction was stronger from the Right or the Left. On any college campus today there is no relativistic hesitation over the categorical moral wrongness of racism, sexism, patriarchy, “hetero-normativity,” genocide in Darfur, apartheid in South Africa, the historic treatment of indigenous peoples everywhere, and so forth.

None of the current categorical imperatives of the Left can be traced back to a ground of fundamental principle beyond a vague, unlimited egalitarianism, always requiring ever increasing political exertions to achieve. Instead, as noted previously, the moral ground is the “side of history.” In other words, what has happened is a revival of the earlier Progressive historicism of Woodrow Wilson, only with objectives borrowed chiefly from Marxism. The return of historicism along with the revival of the “progressive” label is not a coincidence.

Going Deeper

One might wonder whether we weren’t better off in the bad old days of behaviorism and the fact-value distinction. In the new horizon of today’s historicism not only is there no rational basis for values, but facts aren’t faring very well either. It is a hard call, as the progressive impulse of our time ends up being just as deterministic as behaviorism. The “side of history” may be a gauzy, low-grade form of determinism, but like all determinisms it is the ground of despotism and preserves for the rulers alone freedom of choice and action. Today’s progressives evince the same attitude as Wilson: “Resistance is left to the minority, and such as will not be convinced are crushed.”

The impulse goes much deeper than the censorious castigation of “hate speech” and the open attacks against freedom of speech that have been steadily gaining ground. It is not a coincidence that the frontier of leftist “critical thinking” questions language itself, holding that language is a subjective and arbitrary tool of power and control, rather than the tool of human reason and deliberation. This is an indirect way of saying that reason and objectivity are impossible, a view leftists tend to conceal or obscure if they can. (I have occasionally baited leftist “critical theorists” by asking, “If language is merely an arbitrary tool of power detached from any objective reality, is it not only right to wonder why are we having this conversation, but how are we having this conversation?”)

Debunking language itself is to attack the very root of human freedom, because it is through speech that we reason together and form opinions on what is just and unjust, good and bad, high and low. It is reason expressed through speech that sets humans apart from the lower animals. Denying the metaphysical nature of speech derives from denying the idea of human nature. (Or if there is a human nature, progressives are intent on changing it.) If language and speech itself can be detached from reason, there is no reason to believe in individual liberty.

The doctrine of power combined with the revived doctrine of History as Progress gives us the insatiable, unlimited administrative state we see today. The administrative state now is aimed less at correcting market failures than moral failures. This is why the federal bureaucracy without hesitation extends the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to tell North Carolina that it cannot have single-sex bathrooms, and why Title IX is extended well beyond legislative intent to institutionalize the radical feminist ideology of “rape culture” heedless of either facts or due process of law. This is not just limited to government bureaus. As James Burnham argued, the “managerial society” would come to permeate the world of “private” business as much as government. We can see this mentality in the case of Brendan Eich, hounded out as CEO of Mozilla for having once held the same position on gay marriage that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton held at the same time, or the number of corporations that announced they would cut back business activity in North Carolina over the bathroom bill. “Resistance is left to the minority, and such as will not be convinced are crushed.” And this project is self-perpetuating.

Today’s progressives do not think of themselves as tyrants any more than the Progressives of Wilson’s time, but the underlying doctrines are metaphysically identical to totalitarianism. The earlier Progressivism was modest and relatively restrained compared to its successors today. At least Progressives like Theodore Roosevelt and Wilson were setting after genuine social ills—child labor, workers’ compensation, substandard housing, public health and safety, economic monopoly power (even if badly misunderstood). If there was a tendency toward utopianism, it was tempered by the perception that socialism didn’t fit the American character. Today’s progressives are more fully utopian, though their utopianism is diffuse or obscured by deliberately obscure theory, and above all any conception of American exceptionalism is hated.

The point is: the problem of the administrative state is much more than a problem of economic illiteracy, decayed constitutionalism, or modernization, which is why the numerous gimmicks to restrain or reform it, such as cost-benefit analysis, affirmative congressional consent to new regulations, rolling back judicial deference, or other legal fixes will not do very much to change the direction of rule today. The problem is more serious than bad policy and bad law. If it is not stopped and reversed, it will result in the end of limited constitutional government.

Restoring the American Idea

As I suggested at the outset of this essay, the modern conservative movement was slow to recognize Progressivism in its fullness. It is clear in hindsight that everyone, especially conservatives, made a mistake 25 years ago in thinking that the collapse of the Soviet Union and the eclipse of Marxism meant that liberal democracy, individual rights, and open markets had achieved an enduring triumph—the famous “end of history” thesis. The late Harry V. Jaffa was one of the few voices at the time who dissented from the widespread triumphalism:

The defeat of communism in the USSR and its satellite empires by no means assures its defeat in the world. Indeed, the release of the West from its conflict with the East emancipates utopian communism at home from the suspicion of its affinity with an external enemy. The struggle for the preservation of Western civilization has entered a new—and perhaps far more deadly and dangerous—phase.

The combination of Progressivism’s embrace of historicist philosophy and positivist scientism is neither an exhaustive nor exclusive account of what ails America. Fred Siegel and other historians rightly point to literary and social currents of the time that simply despise middle-class American life and consciously seek its destruction for reasons unrelated to formal nihilism. It is also hard to disentangle from this story other imported and adapted ideologies, such as the Frankfurt School, French linguistics, deconstructionism, and so forth, which have done for American intellectual culture what the British invasion did for rock and roll. But it is hard to see the constitutional deformations succeeding to the extent they did over the last century, the crisis of the Great Depression notwithstanding, in the absence of the conscious Progressive assault on the American Founding. It makes clear that restoring the American republic to something resembling the nation the founders designed requires fighting back through Progressivism at the level of basic political philosophy.

That is a tall order, and not an easy case to make on the retail level. The ordinary or common sense understanding of change and “progress” provides today’s progressives with a superficial home field advantage rhetorically. On the other hand, public confidence in American government is at an all-time low, in part because the administrative state is incompetent at its increasingly ambitious ends, and as its increasingly arbitrary character becomes more evident.

There is also the intellectual exhaustion of the Left. Though the Left still has its celebrity intellectuals, the deliberate obscurity of their thought limits their broader public appeal. The least that can be said of the Progressives and their immediate successors is that they had a number of prominent public intellectuals. Sociologist Robert Nisbet observed: “Royce, James, Dewey, and Russell were household names. Who at this moment would have the slightest interest in what a living philosopher had to say on any subject, cosmological, moral, political, or social?”

Given that the Left today is explicitly obsessed with power, perhaps it no longer needs a pseudo-rational foundation, or feels a need for serious philosophical engagement. But this is among the reasons for the decline of the humanities in higher education, of the evident and growing boredom among the dwindling number of non-radicalized students who wander haplessly into classrooms in the humanities and social sciences, and sensibly come away with the impression that there is nothing important to learn. This provides hope that a return to the older way of studying political things would find a large and eager audience.",1,http://www.claremont.org/crb/article/the-threat-to-liberty/
77,Andrews,Helen,claremont,"The word “crisis” hardly captures the dismal situation in Indian Country. Consider just one statistic: the leading cause of death for Indian boys ages 10 to 14 is suicide. In fact, suicide among Native American youths is more than twice the U.S. average, and in Canada, five to seven times the national average. Last April, eleven members of the Attawapiskat First Nation attempted suicide on a single day. Nine were children.

What’s causing this despair? The answer typically offered is racism—which is correct, but not in the sense usually meant. In The New Trail of Tears, Naomi Schaefer Riley, a columnist and former Wall Street Journal editor, explains that Indian policy is a spider web of rules and bureaucracy, converging on one central point: the interests of governments—federal, state, and tribal—routinely trump individual Native Americans’ rights and wishes, ensnaring them in a collectivism subversive of every value necessary to a flourishing society.

Take property rights. Indian country contains some of the continent’s richest natural resource deposits and loveliest tourist destinations. Yet reservation land, generally, cannot be individually owned—it’s owned either by the whole tribe, or by the federal government “in trust” for the tribe. This means it cannot be mortgaged, so it cannot serve as collateral to start businesses or build infrastructure. Layers of federal bureaucracy require multiple permits before Indians can develop land, and tribal governments add their own restrictions on top of that. Thus, writes Riley, “Indian land has become all but useless to Indians themselves.”

The situation is aggravated by a legal system that blocks tribal prosecution of non-Indians for crimes on reservations, and immunizes tribal governments from lawsuits—both of which undermine the legal security necessary for businesses to operate. Unemployment on the Navajo Nation, which is more than twice the size of Massachusetts and home to 175,000 people, is 42%. The average per capita income is $7,269. On the San Carlos Apache reservation, it’s about half that.

* * *

The problems aren’t just legal. One of Riley’s key insights is that identity politics, leftist propaganda, and the welfare state have crippled the mores essential to growth. The notion that “true” Native culture means prelapsarian socialism and the priority of tribal group rights over individualism is worse than false—it’s a racist fantasy concocted by whites who were either seduced by Rousseauian visions of the noble savage or were eager to rationalize Indian removal. Riley quotes one Native leader: “the concept that we never had private property has been foisted upon us.” But that myth has taken such firm root in everything from Disney films to sociology departments that it’s almost unquestioned, even among Natives themselves.

Actually, pre-contact Indians had a robust understanding of private property and were notoriously individualistic. And the disastrous consequences of Western collectivist myths were early noted. The Pequot William Apess, bemoaning the state of New England reservations, complained that Indians “are made to believe they are minors and have not the abilities given them from God, to take care of themselves, [except for making and selling] a few little articles, such as baskets and brooms. Their land is in common stock, and they have nothing to make them enterprising.” He wrote that in 1833.

Things worsened in the century that followed. A series of laws beginning in the 1930s organized today’s tribal governments—forcing groups like the Navajo to choose chiefs when they’d never had any—and elevated government interests over individual rights. Alongside the federal “trust” system, these laws ensured that every necessity of reservation life—education, medicine, housing, employment, and even tribal membership—would come under bureaucratic control. “Indians,” writes Riley, “are the most overregulated race on the planet.” Yet thanks to Supreme Court neutering of the Indian Civil Rights Act, tribal officials aren’t limited by the constitutional rules that protect Americans against state governments, despite the fact that all American Indians are citizens of the United States.

* * *

Centralized planning on reservations stifles individual initiative, all but forbids construction, and offers still more government programs as virtually the only solution. It has, in the words of the Harvard Project on American Indian Economic Development, “maximized the politicization of investment and employment decisions.” That, in turn, maximizes the power of politicians at the expense of tribal citizens, whose only alternative is often the dole. The moral consequences are a crippling culture of anti-individualism and broken families.

Nothing about this is unique to Indians. “The cultural problems on Indian reservations,” Riley concludes, “are really the results of economic and political circumstances that have been foisted upon Indians. If you live in a place where there are no jobs and no access to capital, not working becomes the norm. Any entrepreneurial impulse you have is quickly squelched.” Any group subjected to this mess of infantilizing social science experiments would come out the same. J.D. Vance’s bestselling Hillbilly Elegy (2016) reveals a similar pattern at work among Appalachian whites, where poverty and addiction are prolonged by a mix of entitlement and despair. People come to see success as a lucky stroke, not the result of devoted effort.

Psychologists call this “learned helplessness.” If the malady is concentrated on reservations, that’s because patronizing government policies are so entrenched there—shielded by white romanticism and, on the Native side, an us-versus-them mentality that summarily dismisses criticism as racist. Dependency is not part of any Native American culture, Riley notes. But stifling government policies have now made it the norm.

* * *

Still, Riley’s book is not bleak. on the contrary, she profiles several heroic individuals who are today fighting the odds—and often fighting tribal governments—to improve the lives of Native Americans.

There’s Whispering Pines Chief Mike Lebourdais, who is pushing for legislation to roll back restrictions on native land ownership in Canada. Sadly, the obstacles seem enormous. “The biggest opposition, Lebourdais says, has come from other First Nations…. Aboriginal people in Canada ‘think property ownership is a white thing.’”

There’s Minnesota Chippewa lawyer Mark Fiddler, who defends the rights of children subject to the 1978 Indian Child Welfare Act. That Act imposes a separate set of rules for child welfare and adoption proceedings involving children of Native ancestry—and is often a powerful tool for ideologues who think abused or neglected Indian kids should never be adopted by people of other races. It even bars state courts from using the “best interests of the child” test that ordinarily governs cases involving children. In 2013, Fiddler successfully represented the adoptive couple in the headline-grabbing “Baby Veronica” case, in which a Cherokee father who abandoned his child in utero tried to veto the adoption arranged by the child’s non-Indian, unwed mother. “The theory behind [the Act] is that Indian children won’t be screwed up as long as they’re parented by Indians,” says Fiddler. But what matters to children isn’t race-matching; it’s loving, permanent homes.

And there’s Ben Chavis in California, a Lumbee who worked his way from poverty to earn three Ph.D.s, a fortune in real estate, and a successful tenure as principal of the American Indian Public Charter School (AIPCS) in Oakland. Thanks to his strict discipline and traditional teaching, AIPCS was rated the best high school in the United States, all of its students passing at least one Advanced Placement test. He now runs a school on a North Carolina farm. “Chavis sees American Indians as immigrants to the dominant American culture,” writes Riley. “They’re poor, just like immigrants, and starting from behind, so he’s proposing strategies that have helped immigrants succeed.”

* * *

Sadly, some Indians have what Riley calls “the opposite of an immigrant mentality.” Where immigrants typically hope their children will move up the economic ladder, some Indian parents and activists preach against the American Dream. This is partly an understandable reaction to unjust government policies that until recently outlawed Native religions, forced kids into boarding schools, and sought—in the infamous words of Richard Pratt, founder of the Carlisle Indian School—to “kill the Indian to save the man.” But insularity is a major obstacle to the improvement of life for Native people. Consider Blackfeet lawyer Gyasi Ross’s warning to Native students that “western education is assimilation,” and that “when Native people go away…from the rez for education, and then…just live in middle class splendor away from their homelands…that’s not positive.” Living a fulfilling life of one’s own, Ross thinks, means “buying fully into the assimilation lie.”

Jules, Fiddler, and Chavis prove that such race-first collectivism isn’t shared by all Native Americans, but it’s common enough to sap the ambition of countless youth and to breed hopeless alienation. And such dogma isn’t just reactionary, it’s fundamentally racist. It classifies Natives as the property of tribal communes—just as imperialists and white supremacists regarded them in past ages—rather than as equal individuals in charge of their own destinies. Whether offered by Jacksonians in the 1830s or race-obsessed activists in 2016, it’s the same old serpent that says the pursuit of happiness is for other people.

Nothing today can undo the Sand Creek Massacre or the Trail of Tears. But it is within our power to open the door of opportunity for our fellow citizens. Doing so requires that they cease to be regarded as a separate people. “[Y]ou ask yourselves, ‘What do they, the Indians, want?’” wrote William Apess. “[Y]ou have only to look at the unjust laws made for them, and say, ‘They want what I want,’ in order to make men of them, good and wholesome citizens.”",1,http://www.claremont.org/crb/article/losing-ground/#.WKTKqK3QJzU.twitter

ALL Lesley Graham wants is time.

Time to share with her husband Colin and daughters Charlotte and Rebekah.

Lesley knows she is dying. Cancer has spread from her breasts to her brain, liver and ribs. There is no cure.

But a drug called Kadcyla could give her the time she so desperately desires – extending her life for precious months, perhaps even years.

Cruelly, the drug is not available to Scottish patients because of its high cost.

Here, Lesley makes an impassioned plea to Health Secretary Shona Robison for the drug to be made available free for all on the NHS.

Dear Ms Robison,

I’m Lesley Graham. I’m 39 years old, happily married to Colin and mum to Charlotte, 14, and Rebekah, 11.

I have never before had to ask strangers for help but now I find I’m begging my own government to save my life and I’m not quite sure how this has come about.

Last year, I was diagnosed with breast cancer. I had a mastectomy, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and everyone thought it had gone forever.

It hadn’t and came back with a vengeance earlier this year – only now it has spread to my ribs, liver and brain. And it’s terminal. I’ve been told I have between four to six months left.

My absolute last hope is a drug called Kadcyla which could extend my life by six months or more.

My oncologist applied for this and was told it had been refused.

It’s available elsewhere on the NHS but not in Scotland. Again, it’s a postcode lottery, but to be honest it’s more than this and that’s why I’m writing to you.

I am Mrs Average. I’m not a high-flyer, I’m not rich and I’m not powerful and there are thousands of women just like me, all across Scotland.

My husband and I have always worked hard and paid our taxes.

Like the majority of Scots, we are decent people, investing in our lives and wanting nothing more than to be left alone to bring up our girls and build a future.

Survival rates for breast cancer are getting better all the time. Kylie Minogue, Dame Maggie Smith, Sheryl Crow and Angelina Jolie are an inspiration for many of us.

But would they still be here if they’d been ordinary women who had been refused a drug treatment because it may – or may not – have saved their lives?

I have no choice here. I am begging for the opportunity to have three treatments and then scanned for results. If it works it’s beyond riches.

If it doesn’t I’ll accept that but what I can’t accept is not being given that chance.

My friends immediately launched a fund-raising page online for me.

Because I used to work as a child minder I knew loads and loads of young mums just like myself.

In 27 days they raised £15,000 and there’s money still to come from a Race of Life they did for me.

This money was to make memories for us before it’s too late. I cannot waste a second of my precious time.

That money would pay for the first course of Kadcyla. It costs £15,000 a pop and I need three courses. So that’s £45,000. It’s not a fortune but to me it’s way out of my league. So why isn’t it within the Scottish NHS budget?

I was outraged to learn that in 2014 the Scottish Government paid out £17.8 million on methadone to pharmacists handing over nearly 500,000 prescriptions.

Dear God, am I missing something?

In the past two weeks, I’ve had to sit my two darling girls down and tell them I’m not going to get better.

I arranged my own funeral from the hymns to booking the crematorium.

I’ve arranged for a room to be available for me in a local hospice when the time comes. We’ll have visits beforehand so that my girls can get to know the staff. I want everything to be as easy as possible.

Colin and I made our wills and I’ve written letters for my girls and the grandchildren I’ll never know. I’ve bought Christmas presents, birthday presents, wedding presents and baby gifts for the newborns I will never hold nor hear them call me gran.

I want to show you a photo of my family. I want to say: “Look. This is what I’m walking away from.”

And I want you to tell me face-to-face that this is right.

That this is what the young mums of Scotland are worth. That a panel of nameless faces sitting in judgment of people’s lives can decide on who lives and who dies.

I’m not just Lesley. I’m a daughter, sister, wife, mother, niece, cousin, auntie and friend.

The Lesleys of this world don’t walk alone. And we leave a legacy of heartbreak, shock, broken families, disbelief, deep sorrow and tears.

Denying me the right to access this life-changing drug speaks volumes.

If I lived across the Border in England it would be readily available so what kind of Scotland is this? What sort of deal are you giving me?

I never ever anticipated – with all the money that’s raised in cancer appeals for research – that I would be treated so shabbily.

Shame on all of you.

Lesley Graham

Lesley’s husband Colin

Lesley’s devastated husband Colin has told of his heartache and disbelief that a price has been put on her life.

He said: “My beautiful wife, the most wonderful, loving, caring mum to my girls.

“A caring, funny most honest friend, sister, auntie, godmother, sister-in-law, granddaughter, niece, cousin and a wonderful daughter.

“This is Lesley . . . to think we will lose her is devastating.

“We had lots of plans now that the girls were getting older, of doing things ourselves and holidays we could take in the future and talked at length about where we could go.

“We had our firstborn the year we got married so never really had a long time to be a married couple together. I honestly don’t know anyone who could hold a light to her. I simply love every inch of her.”

He added: “I beg anyone who can help us please give our family the chance to keep her here with us as long as possible.

“I and all of our family and friends are in awe of Lesley because she will do all she can.

“Her vibrant nature, her honesty and her integrity, are so visible in the support she has had from friends old and new, colleagues she has worked with and our local community.

“I and our families are thankful to have Lesley and are thankful to everyone for any help and support we can have at this ethically questionable time, not only for the love of my life, but for any other person who is having a lifeline whipped away from them.

“To treat a Scottish-born, British citizen who has paid her taxes since she was 17 like this is a disgrace and I believe no one should be denied a treatment that could extend her life, even if it was an initial course of treatment to see how she reacted to it.”

All Lesley wants is more time

DEVASTATED Lesley Graham wrote her emotional letter to Shona Robison because the expensive drug is not approved for use in Scotland.

Kadcyla could extend her life by six months, buying her vital time with husband Colin, 47, and daughters Charlotte, 14, and Rebekah, 11.

But Lesley, 39, who was initially given the all-clear after extensive breast cancer treatment, has been told there are no plans to make it available to Scottish patients.

The independent body that assesses new drugs in Scotland, the Scottish Medicines Consortium, does not recommend its use.

Speaking from her home in Barrhead, East Renfrewshire, worried Lesley said her consultant was fighting for her to be given it.

At the moment, though, she says she feels utterly “rejected”.

“There’s no use saying the decision isn’t personal, because of course it is,” she said of her decision to write this searing, heart-felt letter.

“My life is on the line. I’ve been told I have around four to six months left. An extra six months would mean everything. If it doesn’t work I have nothing to lose, but I’m furious that I’m not even being given the chance.”

The former childminder is astonishingly considerate to others and sheds few tears for herself.

She said: “I have a wonderful family and really good friends who are a huge support. My husband Colin is in his own personal hell, but he doesn’t show it.

“He’s the same calm, lovely, kind man that I fell in love with.

“Next year we had planned to go to Las Vegas to renew our wedding vows on my 40th birthday.

“But I cry buckets when I think of my girls.

“I don’t want to leave them. Oh God – that breaks my heart.

“They know everything and they’re at such a vulnerable age – I can’t bear to think about it.

“My whole point is everyone deserves a chance, be it self-inflicted or not.”

For Dave Heeley, that’s exactly what happened to him.

Dave was born with Retinitis Pigmentosa, and was an extremely fit young athlete when the bombshell news arrived.

Today, at 58, he is admired by Prime Ministers and legends like Sir Ranulph Fiennes, has a wonderful family and adores West Bromwich Albion.

And, when he is not swimming seas, running and cycling up and down hills or doing motivational speaking, he tells other kids in his situation about what their future holds as a blind person.

“I don’t give them any bull,” says the man known as Blind Dave. “My grandad was blind when I learned about my own condition, but nobody mollycoddled you back then.

“He didn’t give me any advice. It was just accepted, that he was blind, and he got on with life.

“That attitude helped me tremendously, and that’s why when I talk to kids now, I just give them the truth.

“It’s going to be awful, I tell them! But it’s also going to be what you make of it. Regardless of what I tell them, they’re still going to have to go through very dark days.

“Kick a few doors, go in a room and scream and cry, and once it is out of your system, get on with life.

“It’s at that point you’ll say: ‘Know what? This is just the way it is. I am going blind and I just have to live my life.’ These are my beliefs, anyway.”

So was it sheer bloody-mindedness, that rather than spend his life moping, he has spent it careering around the globe?

“In the early years, I actually tried to disguise it as much as I could,” Dave admits.

“There were all sorts of things I would do.

“For instance, a mate once said to me: ‘I’ve been watching you. When you go to the loo, you walk to that stool, turn left, walk five paces.

“‘If I moved that stool, you’d be lost!’

“I had to admit it — I did have little ways of hiding it. It took a long time for me to face up to what was happening.

“To be honest, when I was very young, I had just thought I must be very clumsy.

“I was forever running into things, falling over things, but you have no gauge to say: ‘Your sight isn’t as good as it should be.’

“I wore glasses, and just thought I must be very short-sighted.

“This all really hit me at 18, when my career in the Army was gone, and I really thought: ‘Hmmm, am I really going blind like my grandad?’

“At 18, I couldn’t sign up, and then I realised what it all meant, what was ahead, and there were some dark years. Eventually, I was sitting there, worrying, and decided to just stop.

“I concentrated instead on what I could do, and got off my backside. I grabbed life and have enjoyed it ever since.

“One day, somebody was talking about running the London Marathon to raise money for a guide dog, and I said I would like to do it with them. Like a fool!

“I ran my first marathon in 2002, in London, and crossing that finishing line changed me once again, this time forever.

“It threw me into the most ridiculous life, of creating world records and all the rest of it!”

There’s nothing ridiculous about what Dave’s achieved, but plenty that is miraculous — including doing seven marathons on seven continents in seven days!

To the kids who hear him talk, he is the greatest example they could ever have.

“I can put myself down as a blind old codger, and say: ‘If I can do these things, think what you can achieve!’” says Dave.

“I hope that sinks in for kids when they feel sorry for themselves.

“Doing the Seven Marathons is always going to be my ‘Wow!’ challenge, because it was pleasure and pain, a lot of laughter and tears,” adds Dave.

“But actually, doing marathons each day, from John o’Groats to Land’s End, I do believe that was the one which taxed me more.

“We’d get in late at night, have four hours’ kip a day, and then back on foot or on bicycle saddle for 16-plus hours each day. That really took its toll on my body and mind. Fantastic!

“Cycling 700 miles over seven countries in seven days was another challenge, as was last year’s Marathon des Sables, a 168-mile one, known as the toughest footrace on Earth across the desert.”

But was those seven inter-continental marathons in a week in 2008 that really made his name, as he somehow got from Port Stanley in the Falklands to Santiago, Los Angeles, Sydney, Dubai and

Nairobi, finishing with the London Marathon.

It even got him an invite to Downing Street, where he chatted with David Cameron’s wife, Samantha, and was given a Point Of Light award.

“We also met a lady who had worked there for many years,” he reveals, “and she was actually the most interesting, with lots of great stories!

“But each of my challenges holds memories that will stay with me forever, though I admit to feeling a bit concerned about one I have coming up.

“I’m doing the Escape From Alcatraz this summer.

“You swim to San Francisco, then it’s all running and cycling.

“There are two thousand people taking part, with a seven-year-waiting list.

“You come off a boat and swim about a mile and a half across San Francisco Bay, and I am told the water is a bit naughty!

“Then it’s an 18-mile bike ride from the beach, mostly uphill, finishing with an eight-mile run.

“I’ve just done 72 lengths in the pool, so I am hopeful that I’ll be ready for the swimming.”

The new book by Blind Dave Heeley and Sophie Parkes, who collaborated with him, is out now, with a foreword by Sir Ranulph Fiennes.

Priced £16.99, it’s called From Light To Dark and is published by Pitch, and available on Amazon.

Dave Heeley is also an Ambassador for the Midlands Air Ambulance charity and an ambassador for the Albion Foundation.

THE result of yesterday’s referendum will have a major effect on Scotland’s future.

Scots voted 62% to 38% in favour of remaining a part of the EU, at odds with the majority of England and Wales.

The issue of Scotland being forced out against its will has raised the possibility of a second independence referendum in the next two years.

We asked people in Glasgow how they felt about the results and the future of Scotland’s position in the UK.

The anguished family of murdered Paige Doherty arrived at an emotional vigil held to honour the young girl’s life last night.

Hundreds braved cold, dank weather to gather in Clydebank’s Whitecrook Park to pay tribute to the 4ft 8in tall would be hairdresser.

The crowd, some of whom had been diligently lighting tea light candles, and playing Paige’s favourite songs – by Coldplay and Snow Patrol – fell silent as the 15-year-old’s mum, Pamela Munro, arrived at the park.

Clutching to other family members for support at times, the dignified 32-year-old passed slowly through the crowd.

One on-looker, Lou McFean, 22, of Clydebank, said it was a heart-breaking sight that she will never forget.

“Paige’s mum showed such courage to come after everything she’s been through in the past few days,” said the Clydebank mum-of-toddler Jade, two. “But she was surrounded by love. Everyone has nothing but the deepest sympathy for her and her family.”

Around 1,000 people gathered at the vigil. They observed a minute’s silence and fireworks and balloons were let off.

There were no Chinese lanterns, however, as police had warned they could disrupt flights coming in to land at Glasgow Airport.

Paige’s close pal Angel White, 15, found the vigil incredibly moving.

“The one star visible in the sky was a sign Paige was looking down from above,” she told The Sunday Post. “Paige meant so much to this community. I knew her since primary school, words can’t describe what this loss has done to us.”

Angel’s dad John White, chair of the local community council, praised the community spirit. “We’re close knit and this is a sign of that,” he said. “She was one of ours and I think that’s why so many people decided to show how much they loved her.”

Another close school chum, Danielle Cardinal, 16, said: “The turn out was amazing, we’ve done her proud.”

Property developer Tina Browne, from Houston, Renfrewshire, is paying for a pink Mercedes car to take Paige’s pals to the funeral.

“Paige’s death has shocked everyone from Clydebank and the rest of the country,” she said. “I’d do anything I can to help out.”

Earlier yesterday the distraught granddad of tragic Paige confronted her alleged killer outside court.

Heartbroken William Munro, 54, was joined by other protestors outside Dumbarton Sheriff Court yesterday morning.

The emotional group shouted as hand-cuffed accused John Leathem was taken into the hearing.

Then Mr Munro, the events of the last week clearly having taken their toll on him, was gently led away by a police officer.

Police had upped security around the hearing “to ensure the safety of all concerned”.

Around 20 police officers wearing high visibility jackets were on duty as a G4S security van carrying Leathem arrived at the court building.

It was flanked by two police motorcycles and tailed by vans and squad cars.

The dramatic and emotional scenes outside the court building were in stark contrast to the sombre proceedings inside where Leathem made his first court appearance.

Leathem, 31, appeared on a charge of murdering the pretty and popular 15-year-old.

Following the brief hearing Leathem was remanded in custody by Sheriff William Gallacher.

He made no plea or declaration to the murder charge against him. He is due to appear in court again in April 1.

Schoolgirl Paige disappeared last Saturday morning after a sleepover at best friend Lauren Mills’s home, also in Clydebank.

The schoolgirl’s body was found on Monday in a wooded area off Great Western Road in Clydebank following a massive police search.

In an earlier statement, Paige’s mum Pamela said: “We are absolutely devastated we have lost our beautiful girl.”

We revealed last year that Flora, 20, had quit her studies for a year as she’d landed a book deal.

But now she’s admitted all her commitments will delay her return to St Andrews University even longer.

“I definitely want to do uni at some point,” said Flora. “I think it will happen but I’m not convinced it will happen next year or even the year after.

“That made me quite sad at the time but there’s a lot on at the moment.”

That includes being unveiled as the face of Graham’s Dairy and full-on work on her book, which will be published at the start of next year.

She admits she initially panicked at the prospect of coming up with suitable bakes and meals. But a rummage through her trusty pile of notebooks and recollections of favourite dishes meant she could have added dozens more.

However, she has revealed the bizarre middle-of-the-night feasts involved.

“My only regret about the whole thing is all the food I ate for testing.

“It’s been hard to keep the pounds off, with making pork belly at 7am and roast dinners at two in the morning.”

Flora has shared four timely favourites for our Easter Day special. And she hopes they’ll lead to a bit of a diet switch.

“Easter can be quite hard because after you’ve eaten the hot cross buns you just scoff chocolate.

“But I like to bake at Easter and these are nice, spring-like recipes you can make on Easter day or over the holidays.”

Chocolate popcorn slice

You’ll need:

300g digestive biscuits

1 tbsp cocoa

100g butter

100g plain chocolate

200ml double cream

1 tsp golden syrup

200g plain chocolate, broken into pieces

75 pistachio nuts

100g popcorn kernels

200g white chocolate

Method:

Grease and line a deep baking tray (I used a square 9” one but you can use a rectangular equivalent).

For the base, blitz the biscuits with the cocoa in a food processor. Melt the butter and chocolate together. Add to the biscuits and blitz again until it has a sandy consistency. Tip into your prepared tin and press down firmly. Place in the fridge.

Heat the cream until just about to boil. Take off the heat then add the syrup. Allow to sit for five minutes before adding the chocolate. Do not stir.

Make the popcorn following packet instruction or using a popcorn maker, but do not add salt or sugar. Once the cream and chocolate has been sitting for at least five minutes you can stir.

By leaving it to sit you are preventing the chocolate from seizing which is a common issue when making ganache. The result should be a thick and glossy mixture.

Add the pistachios and half the popcorn and stir well. Pour on to the biscuits base and return to the fridge for an hour. Just before the ganache has fully set melt the white chocolate slowly in a bain marie (over hot water).

Add the remaining half of the popcorn and stir well making sure all of the popcorn is coated in chocolate. Pour on top of the ganache and spread level with a knife. Return to the fridge for a further hour at the very least. Once fully set, use a serrated knife to cut into bars or small squares.

Store in the fridge until you are ready to serve.

White chocolate Easter celebration cake

You’ll need:

250g softened butter

150g white chocolate

250g caster sugar

1 tsp vanilla essence or bean paste

4 eggs

250g self-raising flour

250g softened butter

400g icing sugar

150g white chocolate

whole milk

food colouring

fresh flowers and sugar coated

chocolate mini eggs to decorate

Method:

Preheat the oven to 180C. Grease and line a 20cm loose-bottomed cake tin. In a large saucepan heat the butter until just melted. Do not boil. Remove from heat then after a few moments add the white chocolate and allow to sit for a wee minute before stirring.

Once the chocolate melts add caster sugar and vanilla and mix well. Add eggs and flour and again mix well. Pour into your prepared tin and bake for 40-45 minutes or until a knife comes out of the centre completely clean. Allow to cool completely.

For the butter-cream, whip the butter in a free- standing mixer until very pale. Place the white in a bain marie (over hot water) to melt slowly. Add the icing sugar to the butter and mix again for about five minutes. You may need a splash of milk to loosen it slightly. Add the melted chocolate and mix once more.

If you are colouring the icing remove half of the icing from the mixer then colour the remaining half but adding a little food colouring and beating until even coloured.

This way the filling will remain white.

Once the cake is cooled cut into three (you can cut it in half if that’s easier) and spread the white butter-cream between the layers. Cover the top and sides with a thin layer of icing making sure it is fully covered, though you will still be able to see the sponge. This is called the crumb coat. Place the cake in the fridge and allow the icing to set solid.

Once ready, spread the coloured icing on top of the crumb coat until you have smooth edges and can no longer see the sponge.

Bunny biscuits

You’ll need:

175g softened butter

225g caster sugar

2 egg yolks

1 tsp vanilla essence

or bean paste

¼ tsp cream of tartar

400g plain flour

300g icing sugar

whole milk

food colouring

sugar coated

chocolate mini eggs

Method:

Preheat oven to 180C. In a bowl, cream the butter and sugar together until pale.

Add the yolks, vanilla, cream of tartar and stir well. Add the flour and mix until the dough resembles breadcrumbs.

Tip on to your work surface and lightly knead until it comes together in a dough. Dust the surface with a little flour then roll the dough out to the thickness of a £1 coin. Cut out using whatever cookie cutter you fancy. It could be bunny-shaped, chick-shaped or egg- shape. Transfer the biscuits on to a baking tray and bake for 12-15 minutes or until golden brown. Allow to cool for five minutes before transferring on to a cooling rack to ice. Re-roll the scraps and repeat the cutting-out process until all the dough is used up.

For the icing, mix the icing sugar with a little milk. Add bit by bit so you don’t make the icing too runny. Once you have fairly thick but still pipe-able icing divide into bowls and colour each bowl individually.

I like to match the colours with the mini chocolate eggs.

Transfer the icing into piping bags and decorate the cooled biscuits however you fancy. Add the mini eggs.

Allow the icing to set before serving.

Hot cross bun loaf

You’ll need:

250g strong white bread flour

250g plain flour

½ tsp salt

50g light brown sugar

7g yeast

2 tsp mixed spices (nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger all work well)

250g whole milk

50g butter

100g mixed fruit

zest of 1 orange

3 tbsp plain flour

whole milk

50g apricot jam, sieved

Method:

In the bowl of a free-standing mixer or food processor weigh out the flours, salt, sugar, yeast and spices. Heat the milk and butter together in a saucepan until the butter is just melted. Do not allow to boil. Add to the bowl and using the dough hook or kneading attachment, knead for five minutes or until elastic. Alternatively, do this by hand but you will need to knead for at least 10 minutes.

Place in a lightly-oiled bowl and cover. Allow to prove in a warm place until at least doubled in size (roughly an hour). Meanwhile, weigh the fruit into a bowl and cover with boiling water. Leave to sit. This rehydrates the fruit and adds essential moisture to the dough.

Once the dough is doubled in size drain the excess water from the fruit and pat dry.

Add to the dough alongside the orange zest. Knead for a few moments until well combined and all the air is knocked out. Divide into 12 lumps. Tuck the edges into the bottom and pinch to form a smooth ball. If using two smaller loaf tins place six balls in each. For a larger square tin you can fit all 12 in. Make sure there is room for them to rise though.

Allow to prove for a further hour. Preheat the oven to 200C. For the cross, mix the flour with some milk until you have a runny but pipe-able batter. Transfer into a piping bag and draw a cross on each bun.

Bake for 35-40 minutes. Five minutes before they are baked heat jam with a splash of boiling water. Bring to the boil. Remove buns from oven and brush tops with the hot jam immediately. Allow to cool completely before removing from the tin and slicing.

Our probe has revealed a litany of carcinogens are found in the substance that is sprinkled over plastic turf to make it bouncy.

The crumb rubber, which is made from recycled car tyres, has been linked to cancer clusters.

Our reporters collected samples of the substance and sent it to laboratory boffins at the Environment Scientifics Group.

It carries out official tests for police forces and other government organisations.

Its stringent tests on our samples revealed the presence of a number of chemical elements linked to poisoning, such as arsenic, lead and cadmium.

However, it was the prevalence of carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that will cause the most concern.

Prof Andrew Watterson, an environmental health expert from the University of Stirling, who looked at our findings, said: “This report confirms and reveals the presence of a number of carcinogens at various levels in the rubber crumb.

“If the chemicals and metals remain locked in to the crumb, then there will be no exposure.

“However, it seems to be fairly clear that there may be some potential risk from some of these substances to sports people.

“To what extent and with what effect the carcinogenic metals and semi-volatile organic compounds may be taken up through inhalation, skin absorption or ingestion and under what conditions then remains the big question.”

Research in 2014 by four US universities found polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) to be “highly mutagenic cancer causing compounds”.

The two biggest PAHs we discovered were Benzo (E) Pyrene and Chryseneat.

A 1993 study into Benzo (E) Pyrene said the substance promotes tumours forming on skin.

And as far back as 1978, experts found exposing mice to Chrysene led to a huge increase in tumours in the animals.

The Sunday Post has also been passed the stringent instructions workers putting in pitches are given when handling the substance, which includes the disclaimer to keep out of the reach of children.

Amateur goalkeeper Robbie Jones, from Cardiff, said there should be a ban on building new pitches until the safety of rubber crumb is properly investigated.

The 30-year-old, diagnosed with Hodgkin’s Lymphoma a year ago after playing on 3G pitches three times a week for 12 years, fears playing on the surfaces caused his illness.

“If there’s any evidence the stuff could be harmful there should not be any more built until it is investigated,” he said.

“School kids play on them all the time and I think their parents should think twice about that.”

Professor Watterson added: “The precautionary public health approach would be to adopt new technologies like artificial turf pitches only if they are proven low risk or safe and only if there are no healthier alternatives.”

We were the first in the UK to expose how the rubber crumb has been linked to hundreds of cancer cases in the US.

It is feared players, particularly goalkeepers, have developed deadly conditions after accidentally swallowing the pellets while diving.

The Sports and Play Construction Association, which represents the artificial pitch construction industry, could not be contacted.

However the industry has previously slammed health fears, citing countless independent studies which have deemed rubber crumb safe to play on.

Although there are natural alternatives, such as coconut husk, crumb rubber is used in around 90% of the UK’s artificial pitches due to its low cost.

Mr Shah, 40, died following an incident at the newsagent’s shop he owned in Shawlands, Glasgow, last week.

His death has prompted an outpouring of grief throughout the community.

Customers and neighbours flooded social media with tributes to “the nicest guy on the planet” and a “pillar of the community”.

Last night Mr Shah’s father Syedna Shah, 75, said: “He was a brilliant man and we are grateful for the community support.”

Syedna had earlier said the family raced to the hospital but Mr Shah was dead before they arrived.

Mr Shah was allegedly stabbed to death hours after wishing people a happy Easter. He posted a message on his Facebook profile just four hours before his death saying: “Good Friday and a very happy Easter, especially to my beloved Christian nation.”

Police Scotland has confirmed the murder is being treated as religiously motivated.

A GoFundMe page to raise funds for the shopkeeper’s family had last night raised more than £30,000, with more than 2,000 people donating.

Jen Bannerman, who started the page, said Mr Shah was more than a shopkeeper, he was also a friend who had touched hundreds of lives and she wanted to give people a way to express their fondness for him.

“It is less about the money and more about showing support.

“The outpouring of support shows what a wonderful person he was,” she said.

More than 500 people, including First Minister and local MP Nicola Sturgeon, attended a vigil for the shopkeeper near the newsagent on Friday night.

A second act of remembrance took place at the shop yesterday.

Police have arrested a 32-year-old man. He is due to appear at Glasgow Sheriff Court on Tuesday.

In fact Linda probably won’t recognise her son — even though she’s only 59.

Linda was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer’s at 54 and now, only five years later, doesn’t know who her children are.

But now the heartbroken 33-year-old is determined to pay a musical tribute to his mum with a moving new song.

The singer-songwriter has written a single for Mother’s Day called Dear Mama and proceeds from the touching ballad will go to Alzheimer’s Scotland.

The lyrics of the song talk about his despair over visiting Linda, who he calls Mama.

The last time John visited her in the nursing home, Linda pushed his attempt at a hug away because she believed he was a stranger.

“When I first went to see her she would give me a big warm hello and say: ‘It’s my boy,’ said John.

“She was happy to see me. Then eventually she wasn’t able to place who I was. That was difficult, but she still recognised me.

“The last time I went I tried to give her a hug and she pushed by me. She didn’t know who I was, I went home and cried.

“I’d feel terrible if I didn’t go to see Mama,” he said. “I don’t want to leave her alone.

“But when I go she doesn’t recognise me, and there’s not a lot of the woman I knew there anymore.

“I come back from the care home after the visit and just cry for a week.

“The lyrics of Dear Mama deal with that — there’s guilt there.”

Tragically, Linda was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s only a few months after her husband and John’s dad died following a battle with lung cancer.

“Looking back, the signs about my mum being ill were there before my dad was ill,” said John. “I was living and working in Oxford and I remember getting a phone call from my uncle.

“He said Mama had been forgetting things, but had just been laughing it off.

“When I was home and dad was in the hospice I found her at the door with her jacket on over her nightie, with a bag packed.

“I asked her where she was going but she couldn’t remember. I managed to get her settled with a cup of tea, but something obviously wasn’t right.”

A month after John’s dad died, doctors gave John and family the bombshell news about Linda’s Alzeimer’s.

“You don’t expect it to happen to someone so young. The death of my dad was heartbreaking for the whole family but for my mum it seemed to really speed up her Alzheimer’s.

“The decline was so fast.”

The video for Dear Mama was filmed by Scottish Bafta-winning director David Newman, and John hopes sales for the song can raise money for thousands in his family’s position.

Linda is now in full time care, and John is honest about her outlook.

“The phone isn’t going to ring with the care home on saying, ‘There’s your mum back,’

“I know she isn’t likely to get better soon. But with the single I hope it raises awareness with people.

“Lots of people have heard the song and said it’s touched them, that’s given me hope.

“You don’t have to be alone, and Alzheimer’s Scotland is there to support you. It helped me and it can help you too.”

Hayek on Mill:

The Mill-Taylor Friendship and Related Writings

by Friedrich Hayek, edited by Sandra J. Peart

University of Chicago Press, 2015, 373 pages, $65

John Stuart Mill had the worst personal life of any libertarian philosopher, a competitive category for bad personal lives. Marriage in particular has a record of making libertarian philosophers behave discreditably—that is, in a way that brings discredit not just on their character but on their ideas.

Bertrand Russell famously divorced the first of his four wives after a bicycle trip: “suddenly, as I was riding along a country road, [I] realized that I no longer loved Alys.” Thus reasoned the most rational man in England. Ayn Rand forced her husband to endure loud and lofty protestations that forgoing an affair with Nathaniel Branden would be a sin against objectivism. William Godwin, England’s first anarcho-libertarian, wrecked two marriages on his individualism: first to Mary Wollstonecraft, whom he set up in a separate apartment and communicated with by letter, and then to a harridan of no redeeming qualities apart from her ability to keep house whom he, in his solipsism, permitted to torment Mary’s children.

Even in this company, John Stuart Mill is on another plane. Under the influence of his wife, Harriet Taylor, he drove his youngest brother George to suicide. His doting sisters were banished from his life over the flimsiest imagined slights to his wife’s honor. He gave up his former friends and became a recluse, retiring to a cottage in Blackheath Park where he entertained virtually no one while Mrs. Mill lived. After her death, he made himself a national laughingstock by declaring in his Autobiography that his wife had been more poetic than Shelley and a greater thinker than himself, and that he had “acquired more from her teaching than from all other sources taken together”—phrases written not when Mill was a grieving widower but during Harriet’s lifetime, in drafts which she read and approved for publication evidently without embarrassment.

And that’s only what she did to him after they wed. Their marriage was preceded by twenty years of brazen and self-righteous infidelity. When Mill met Harriet she was married to a good-natured pharmacist of enlightened political opinions, if no great intelligence, named John Taylor. After three years of growing mutual obsession, they bullied him into giving Harriet her own household, where she lived with their three children and entertained Mill on weekends. No one, not even his family, was permitted to mention Harriet’s name in Mill’s presence, much less to allude to the scandal their conduct had raised. His oldest friend, John Arthur Roebuck, was the only one who ever dared; Mill never spoke to him again. The couple withdrew into their private ménage, reassuring each other that it was only society’s “baby morality” (her phrase) that cast shame on their exalted passion. A bizarre story—and until the 1950s, an unknown one.

The Morbid Curiosity of Friedrich Hayek

Strange as it seems, the first biography to treat John Stuart Mill’s private life was not written for more than eighty years after his death. The reason for the delay was simple. Mill’s papers, including his letters to Harriet, were stored at his house in Avignon and guarded by his stepdaughter, Helen Taylor, who considered it her life’s mission to uphold Mill’s legacy and her mother’s. When Helen died, her niece Mary Taylor took over and was if anything more protective, having some notion of editing Mill’s collected correspondence herself. Mary was institutionalized for insanity in 1918, and the Avignon papers were put up for auction at Sotheby’s and dispersed to the four winds.

The task of assembling Mill’s letters had to await another libertarian philosopher who, true to type, was in the middle of his own soap opera. The love of his life had married another back in Vienna in the 1920s, and he had married his secretary on the rebound. Two decades later, after World War II, his lost love was widowed and he decided to get a divorce to be with her. His colleagues at the London School of Economics, who were left to nurse his first wife through a breakdown, stopped speaking to him (“As far as I am concerned the man I know is dead and I should find it almost intolerably painful to have to meet his successor,” said one). This was Friedrich Hayek.

Hayek became obsessed with the Mill-Taylor relationship. He tracked down Mill’s letters across half a dozen university libraries and countless private collections—mundane work for a scholar of his stature, especially in the flush of celebrity he enjoyed after The Road to Serfdom. After that surprise hit, the first book he wrote to follow it up was a Mill-Taylor dual biography, which is still the only book about their marriage. The Constitution of Liberty was first outlined during a vacation Hayek and his second wife took in Italy and France that retraced exactly a journey Mill and Taylor had taken a hundred years earlier.

It was not the resemblance to his own situation that drove Hayek’s obsession. It was the suspicion that Harriet had turned Mill into a socialist.

Hayek’s intellectual allegiance was to the tradition of British liberalism, which since the Scottish Enlightenment has been different from anything on the continent. He loved its pragmatism, its impatience with abstraction, its celebration of bourgeois rather than romantic-heroic virtues. But sometime around World War I, that priceless legacy had been captured by socialists. The party of Gladstone and Macaulay had become the party of Laski and Keynes.

It occurred to Hayek that the same trajectory had played out in miniature in the life of John Stuart Mill. His beginnings were solidly Benthamite; the original edition of his Principles of Political Economy was mostly sound; but the second edition said alarmingly nice things about the Fourierists and the third edition all but endorsed Communism. “If the choice were to be made between Communism with all its chances, and the present state of society with all its sufferings and injustices,” Mill averred, “all the difficulties, great or small, of Communism would be but as dust in the balance.” The manuscript Mill was working on when he died, later published under the title Chapters on Socialism, showed that his drift toward collectivism might have proceeded even further had he lived.

Hayek imagined that figuring out what had sent Mill down the wrong path might reveal what had gone wrong with British liberalism more broadly. And to solve the mystery of Mill—cherchez la femme.

Utilitarian Adultery

No one can help falling in love with another man’s wife. It is what happens next that determines a man’s character. John Stuart Mill did not handle it well.

One might blame his unusual upbringing—the Greek lessons at three, the apprenticeship in Benthamism at ten, the isolation from other boys until his teenage years and from the female sex until well after that. But his father was just as doctrinaire and, if possible, more robotic, and even James Mill knew not to go chasing after married women. He confronted his son with a remorselessly utilitarian argument for giving Mrs. Taylor up before matters went too far, in order to facilitate the greater happiness of all three parties in the long run. John replied that “he had no other feelings towards her than he would have towards an equally able man.”

This pretense of platonic admiration lasted from their first meeting in 1830 until the crisis of 1833. In September of that year, Harriet persuaded her husband to grant her a six-month separation, and she departed for France with the children. Unknown to Mr. Taylor, Mill followed her there in October.

After six weeks with Mill and at his urging, Harriet wrote a letter to her husband explaining that she and Mill had run the numbers, so to speak, in their utilitarian calculation, and concluded that whatever compromise would most conduce to Mr. Taylor’s happiness would be all right with them as long as the two lovers were not required to “renounce sight” of each other (which had been Mr. Taylor’s opening bid). Mr. Taylor acquiesced, and soon Harriet was able to tell Mill that she had received “one of those letters from Mr Taylor which makes us admire & love him. He says that this plan & my letters have given him delight—that he has been selfish—but in future will think more for others & less for himself.”

The way Mill and Harriet enlisted utilitarian language to justify their adultery is unattractive. Shortly before the Paris jaunt, Harriet had—with audacity entirely in character—asked Mill to write an essay explaining his position on marriage. The unpublished manuscript, found in the Avignon papers, reads in part:

All popular morality is, as I once said to you, a compromise among conflicting natures, each renouncing a certain portion of what its own desires call for, in order to avoid the evils of a perpetual warfare with the rest. That is the best popular morality, which attains this general pacification with the least sacrifice of the happiness of the higher natures, who are the greatest, indeed the only real sufferers by the compromise; for they are called upon to give up what would really make them happy; while others are commonly required only to restrain desires the gratification of which would bring no real happiness.

The “general pacification” of Taylor having been obtained in the Paris negotiations, the parties muddled along in their compromise for the next fourteen years. Mill and Taylor spent two nights a week and nearly every weekend together, but did not appear in public as a couple. Eventually Taylor died, and in 1851 Mill and Harriet were finally wed.

Marriage solved nothing. Quite the opposite, it led Mill to terminate relationships that had long been preserved, however tenuously, by the omertà surrounding Mrs. Taylor. Friends who expected to find their relations with Mill eased instead discovered that Harriet was settling old scores. Anyone she suspected of having gossiped about her during her first marriage or not sufficiently approving of her new one, she declared an enemy of the household, and naturally Mill adopted her grudges as his own.

The most egregious example was George Grote Mill, John’s younger brother by nineteen years. John had not bothered to inform George of his marriage. Nevertheless, when he learned of it a month late and at second hand, George sent his best wishes. The letter survives; it is utterly inoffensive. His crime was to make a jovial reference to Harriet’s well-known feminist opinions. (“Believing that [she] would generally rather discourage than encourage the marriage of others, I certainly was at first surprised to find her giving so deliberate an example of marriage in her own case.”) This elicited from Mill a letter beginning:

I have long ceased to be surprised at any want of good sense or good manners in what proceeds from you—you appear to be too thoughtless or too ignorant to be capable of either—but such want of good feeling, together with such arrogant assumption, as are shown in your letters . . . I was not prepared for. The best construction that can be put upon them is that you really do not know what insolence and presumption are: or you would not write such letters & seem to expect to be as well liked as before by those to whom & of whom they are written.

Many of those who received letters like this regained Mill’s affection after Harriet’s death—his sister Mary, Sarah Austin, George and Harriet Grote. But it was too late for his baby brother. Two years after John cut off contact, George Mill, driven into exile in Madeira by his worsening tuberculosis, committed suicide.

“The Saint of Rationalism”

So Harriet was awful—fine, but did she affect his work? That would raise the story above mere gossip. Mill maintained that everything written after Political Economy was effectively a joint production. Was this true, or did he misjudge her influence as badly as her virtues?

Independent testimony would settle the question, but independent testimony is just what we do not have, since so few of Mill’s friends were ever permitted to make Harriet’s acquaintance. Thomas and Jane Carlyle were among the tiny handful who ever met her, and they both thought Mill was out of his mind. “Full of unwise intellect, asking and re-asking stupid questions,” was Carlyle’s opinion of her. “A peculiarly affected and empty body,” was Jane’s. (In one staggering letter, Harriet recites a long list of Mill’s eminent friends, including Carlyle, the jurist John Austin, and Alexis de Tocqueville, and dismisses them as “narrow in intellect, timid, infinitely conceited . . . more or less respectable puppets.”)

The other obvious place to check would be their letters to each other. Alas, these are almost entirely devoid of intellectual discussion. Even allowing for the mundanity of most correspondence between husbands and wives, one might have hoped that they would, at least occasionally, discuss something other than their respiratory ailments.

Our only source for judging Harriet’s influence is Mill’s writing, which thankfully includes eight full years before they met. The most glaring change is the complete disappearance of a sense of humor. Few of his fans realize that Mill did not always write in the lucid, lawyerly style of On Liberty. Consider this squib from 1828, mocking the Duke of Wellington’s new cabinet:

ONE GUINEA REWARD—Lost or stolen, from a Cabinet of Curiosities near the Treasury, a Skull. It is extremely thick, and the eyes are so fixed in it, as to be unable to see beyond the length of the nose. It is also remarkably soft to the touch, and the organ of place is very strongly developed. It is entirely empty, and of no use to any person, except the owner. The reward offered, greatly exceeds the value of the article, as the owner, having recently been appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer, cannot conveniently do without it.

Or this from an article defending grave-robbing, on the Benthamite grounds that everyone benefits from having surgeons well instructed in anatomy: “If bodies had never been dissected, sentimentalists could not have appealed to our hearts in behalf of the sanctity of the tomb, for whether we have or have not such an organ, would probably to this day have remained a problem.”

Both of these pieces were written after Mill’s notorious “mental crisis,” the life-changing depression he fell into at the age of twenty. It was not depression that robbed him of his humor. It was Harriet. In everything written after he met her, he is indignant where before he would have been biting or sarcastic. You may read The Subjection of Women from cover to cover, for example, and find nothing resembling wit.

But Mill’s progressive leftward tilt, Hayek eventually decided, was not Harriet’s fault. Mill’s own principles unfolded naturally on their own. Hayek had not yet come to this conclusion when he published his Mill-Taylor book, which contains an abundance of previously unavailable primary sources but surprisingly little analysis. It took decades to dawn on him that Mill had never been a good classical liberal. “Many years of work on John Stuart Mill,” admitted Hayek near the end of his life, “actually shook my admiration of someone I had thought a very great figure indeed, with the result that my present opinion of John Stuart Mill is a very critical one.” One Hayek biographer went to the trouble of totting up the citations in his major works and found that Mill went from being the most frequently cited author in The Constitution of Liberty to being the sixth-most in Fatal Conceit, where every mention of Mill is negative.

Hayek should not have been so surprised. After all, the Benthamites had always been in favor of confiscatory inheritance taxes, as a way of eliminating England’s landed oligarchy. The first edition of Mill’s Political Economy was explicitly billed as “a refutation of socialism” by its German translator, but even there Mill proposed limits on inheritance and bequest that he later claimed “would pull down all large fortunes in two generations.” It was a very short leap from there to the position expressed in Chapters on Socialism, where Mill argues that socialism is no different from the limitations on property rights that have been part of Western law since Rome. English village law limited the rights of landholders to evict their tenants; why not limit the right of factory owners to fire their employees? The only reason not to would involve trust in emergent order, which, as Hayek came to realize, Mill utterly lacked where economics was concerned.

In his correspondence with true-believing socialists, Mill usually told them that he fully expected socialism to come to England one day but that at present mankind was unprepared for it. Mill had every hope that this unpreparedness would be temporary, for he had limitless faith in the power of education to shape humanity. If a single group of children could be raised to be socialists as deliberately as James Mill had raised him to be a Benthamite, then it would only take one generation to prove to the world that cooperative socialism was no utopia but an alternative within reach. Instructing this pioneer generation was one of the things he thought Harriet could have done for humanity, if she had lived.

For a thinker whose entire philosophy depended on human perfectibility, Mill had remarkably little idea how to bring it about. Not only was he silent on the mechanics of moral education, socialist or otherwise, he betrayed a total ignorance of the most basic facts of how character is cultivated—for example, that knowing the right thing to do is a lot easier than doing it. “He who does anything because it is the custom, makes no choice,” he sneers in On Liberty. “He gains no practice either in discerning or in desiring what is best. The mental and moral, like the muscular powers, are improved only by being used.” To the countless Englishmen following the same code as their grandparents—work hard, raise upright children, don’t sleep with other men’s wives—he offered not merely dismissal but mockery. Long after his youthful fanaticism had waned, he still contemptuously referred to Judeo-Christian morality as “the notions of a tribe of barbarians in a corner of Syria three thousand years ago.”

Mill’s nickname, given him by Gladstone, was “the Saint of Rationalism.” He had a reputation as England’s gentle philosopher, whose school, if it erred, did so only in assuming that the rest of mankind was as decent and benevolent as himself. But the more we examine him, the less plausible it is that Mill was too good for this world. Instead it begins to appear that Mill was unable to tell his readers how to become decent, benevolent people—because he wasn’t one himself.

Mill and the “Smug Style” in Pragmatic Neoliberalism

It is sometimes said that John Stuart Mill was ahead of his time, that all the radical things he believed have become the commonplaces of today. But Mill’s principles were always commonplaces. “The greatest happiness for the greatest number”? The phrase originated in 1725, and in any case it loses its punch once you grant that society should value certain kinds of happiness over others. Mill discounted all forms of happiness that did not strike him as having been rationally chosen; eighteenth-century utilitarian William Paley felt the same way about happiness that did not come from doing God’s will. Which rather leaves political philosophy back where it started. Mill’s real contribution was to associate philosophical banalities—like the harm principle, which sounds comprehensive until you try to pin down “harm”—with political liberalism.

Once he popularized this connection, everyone who disagreed with him seemed to be not just against liberalism but against happiness. Once at a party, Jane Carlyle was introduced to a woman who said, “Oh, you’re the wife of the man who believes in the least good for the greatest number.” That is not what Carlyle believed, obviously. But he disagreed with Mill on politics, so that is how he has come down to us.

In that sense, at least, today’s globalist Left could hardly be more Millian. In his obituary for Mill, his disciple John Morley related this description from an American visitor who came to pay his respects to the great philosopher:

You placed before him the facts on which you sought his opinion. He took them, gave you the different ways in which they might fairly be looked at, balanced the opposing considerations, and then handed you a final judgment in which nothing was left out. His mind worked like a splendid piece of machinery; you supply it with raw materials, and it turns you out a perfectly finished product.

Does this not sound like Vox? Across the distance of a century, today’s rationalists share with Mill a conviction that every problem can be solved with a single basic set of analytical tools—in our case, the pragmatic neoliberalism of modern social science. This simplicity does tend to give analysis a certain superficiality; Mill’s polymathic contemporary William Whewell said that “he appears to me to write like a man whose knowledge is new.” But utilitarian calculation will give you an intelligent-sounding answer every time, and these days a compelling infographic as well.

Utilitarianism has inclined the leading lights of the modern Left to embrace some positions that Mill (and their other liberal forebears) would find odd: Vox executive editor Matt Yglesias once praised Bangladeshi sweatshops. But they are still recognizably Mill’s descendants, sharing with him a basic preoccupation with making everything in public life account for itself rationally. Any relationship of allegiance, authority, or dependence must either be translated into the language of utilitarian advantage or else discredited as an irrational restriction on personal choice.

And yet the irrational keeps bubbling up. For all his overgrown powers of reason, Mill in his private life was roiled by passions that he never understood. So instead he rationalized them. To justify his overwhelming love for Harriet, he made up a story about her being objectively the greatest human being on earth.

There is a lesson in that: in pursuing the utilitarian ideal, it is not the unformed rabble whose irrationalism betrays them, but a man’s own. Today’s Left spends all its time worrying about backlash from irrational populists, when it really ought to be worried about social justice warriors, masked “antifa” thugs, and gnostic diviners of a “privilege” that mysteriously pervades all things yet is based on studies that cannot be replicated and history that telescopes the facts.

In 1835, Harriet revealed the underlying principle of her philosophy in a letter to Mill designed to steel his resolve to persist in their relationship despite his friends’ and family’s disapproval.

I have always observed where there is strong feeling the interests of feeling are always paramount & it seems to me that personal feeling has more of infinity in it than any other part of character—no ones mind is ever satisfied, nor the imagination nor the ambition—nor anything else of that class—but feeling satisfies.

Feelings were the great loophole for Mill. His fundamental metric of happiness rested on the foundation of feelings, and it turned out that his feelings were—without his fully realizing it—under his control. In order to justify his relationship with Harriet, he needed his passion for her to overwhelm anyone else’s unhappiness in the utilitarian calculation, and so his feelings grew and grew until the equation balanced.

He posed as a modern Stoic who thought that with the right education and self-discipline men could channel their emotions toward higher ends. But as Harriet proved, all the incentives in Millian philosophy are to make feelings bigger, more demanding, more willful, more intense. Which may explain why the Left today is simultaneously more utilitarian, more pragmatic-sounding, more soothingly chart-driven than ever before—and more irrational than at any time since the 1960s.

88,Andrews,Helen,claremont,"In 1960, at age 16, I purchased my first book. It was Hazel Barnes’s translation of Jean-Paul Sartre’s Being and Nothingness (1943), whose 500 pages I turned uncomprehendingly. Though I could hardly afford the book, I did not regret the expense, because I had learned from Walter Kaufmann’s collection of existentialist extracts, Existentialism from Dostoevsky to Sartre (1956), that Sartre’s philosophy was a life-changing guide to an emerging and liberating world. He had proved that radical choice would sweep away the old attachments and set the individual free. Henceforth, thanks to this learned survey of I knew not what, I would be me, the pure individual me, in a world illuminated by a single consciousness, namely mine. All our gang at school were self-declared existentialists, each committed to proving himself with an act of radical commitment: Denzil’s was to seduce a Nigerian princess who had been installed in a posh local boarding school for girls, mine was to blow up the school cadet corps’ glider with a homemade bomb. We all claimed intimate knowledge of this book that few of us had read and none of us had understood. And we all rejoiced in the message that we read into it: the message of self. As William Wordsworth wrote of another French radical movement: “Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive.”

By 1968, when the aftershocks of the existentialist earthquake were being felt in the streets of Paris, I was as disillusioned as the aging Wordsworth. I could not believe that anyone would take this stuff seriously, certainly not so seriously as to do what Sartre at the time was recommending, which was to pull down the fabric of French society and install a “totalizing” system in its stead. By then, however, I had read the early Sartre properly—the Sartre of La Nausée [Nausea], of the plays and novels, of Being and Nothingness, and the two studies of imagination. With a deep admiration for his gifts, I envied his ability to bring philosophy, fiction, and essay writing together, in prose that is both argumentative and full of imagined life. I wondered whether this synthesis of literary talents might be available to someone like myself, who believed the opposite of what Sartre believed, and who was convinced that life is not about self but about others. Thus did I set out on my own peculiar journey.

* * *

Sarah Bakewell, too, had an existentialist awakening, which occurred 20 years after mine, when she was swept off her feet at age 16 by La Nausée. This, if nothing else, is a proof that existentialism was not merely a fashion, but a literary experience that touches something deep in many of us, something that comes to the surface in those teenage years, when it is so clear that the world is governed by a conspiracy to exclude us, even though it is no fault of our own that we are here. Bakewell is a gifted writer and a serious thinker, whose previous book is How to Live: Or a Life of Montaigne in One Question and Twenty Attempts at an Answer (2010). She is able to explain engagingly the ideas of Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and Martin Heidegger while relating them to the lives from which they sprang. And in this she clarifies the essential point, which is that existentialism was both a genuine philosophy, rooted in speculations that are of permanent significance, and also a way of life, in which ideas, feelings, and actions grew organically together in response to the peculiar condition of a self-destroying Europe.

The heroes of At the Existentialist Café are Sartre and de Beauvoir, for both of whom Bakewell has a soft spot. She is able to pass quickly over glaring and often inexcusable moral faults, such as de Beauvoir’s habit of grooming her female students to have sex first with her and then with Sartre, or Sartre’s excuses for the Communist genocides. Like so many commentators, Bakewell cannot find it in herself to be similarly lenient towards Heidegger, whose support for the Nazis—loathsome though it was—fell well short of the support offered by Sartre and de Beauvoir to the various revolutionary murderers who from time to time enjoyed their commitment. (Bakewell does not even mention Sartre’s public endorsement of the murder by Palestinian terrorists of the Israeli Olympic team at Munich in 1972.) I guess this is something we have to accept, now, as part of the culture—that crimes attributed to the “Right” are inexcusable, while crimes attributed to the “Left” are for the most part simply mistakes. Sartre and de Beauvoir made many such mistakes. But Sartre’s philosophy of absolute freedom and de Beauvoir’s radical feminism offered a lifeline to the adolescent Bakewell, and she clings to it still.

* * *

Bakewell brings across Heidegger’s gloomy and shut-in character, and although she repeats the now accepted platitude that he was a great philosopher—perhaps the greatest philosopher of modern times—she doesn’t hesitate to quote the oracular utterances that show him to have been no such thing. Many people whom I respect endorse the orthodox view of Heidegger, and I hesitate to say that he was a portentous old windbag who had nothing to say. The problem is that he had a way of saying nothing with a capital “N,” at a time when Nothing was on the march across our continent, and when people would prick up their ears on hearing that “Nothing noths,” or “The Meaning of Being is Time.” In emergencies we listen out for those capital letters, and forget that the mantras of the metaphysician and the slogans of the demagogue are both in the business of silencing our questions.

Bakewell gives a lively evocation of the Parisian café culture of those days. The café was a home for the metaphysically homeless, where self and other could enjoy the apricot cocktails of her title, and exchange looks across a smoke-filled room, while wondering whether any such thing is really possible. After all it is not the pour-soi (for itself) but the en-soi (in itself) that meets the eye, so how can I meet I when eye meets eye? Yet somehow it happens, and the various studies of le regard—from Emmanuel Levinas, Merleau-Ponty, Sartre, and others—have changed, for me as much as for Bakewell, what philosophy can tell us about the human condition.

* * *

Bakewell expounds the arguments in a way that is, by and large, true to their inspiration, as well as imbued with her own sense of why they matter. Rare among commentators she traces the existentialist moment to the phenomenology of Edmund Husserl, and does her best to give an account of the crucial concept that he took from his teacher Franz Brentano and brought into the center of modern philosophy: the concept of intentionality. Husserl’s phenomenology begins from the recognition that the I knows itself as subject only because it targets something else: the object of attention; as Husserl put it, “all consciousness is consciousness of something.” I cannot think without thinking of something; I cannot love or fear without loving or fearing something; I cannot see, hear, or imagine without representing the world in thought. Our mental states have aboutness, presenting us with objects and coloring those objects according to the way they are given to consciousness. But the subject, the pure awareness that defines the horizon where I stand, can never be an object to itself: the subject flits from its own attention, to occupy always the position of the knower, and never of the thing that is known. Philosophy is possible, therefore, only as a study of the “transcendental self,” the observer on the edge of the world, who cannot be found within its boundaries.

“Understood in this way,” Bakewell writes, “the mind hardly is anything at all: it is its aboutness…. Nothing else can be as thoroughly about or of things as the mind is: even a book only reveals what it’s ‘about’ to someone who picks it up and peruses it, and is otherwise merely a storage device.” Husserl developed a technical language with which to isolate and explore this aboutness, believing that he could, from a study in depth of the first-person case, arrive at the essence not only of our states of mind, but also of the world as it is represented in thought. He wrote down his unending dialogue with himself in a peculiar shorthand, creating trunk-loads of notes that survived many adventures in war-torn central Europe before ending up at the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium, where the Husserl archive still exists, as a school within the university. (This is one of the many stories that Bakewell tells with style and sympathy, bringing Husserl to life for me for the first time.)

* * *

Sartre rightly ignored Husserl’s technical language, and the accompanying theories about the structure of consciousness. Beginning from the same premise of self-consciousness he embarked on an extended and wonderfully imaginative exploration of “what it is like” to exist as a subject, a pour-soi, conscious of a freedom that no object can exhibit, and hungry for a relatedness that can never be assured. Bakewell quotes from an essay on Husserl, published in 1939, describing what it is to be conscious, namely:

to wrest oneself from moist, gastric intimacy and fly out over there, beyond oneself, to what is not oneself. To fly over there, to the tree, and yet outside the tree, because it eludes and repels me and I can no more lose myself in it than it can dissolve itself into me: outside it, outside myself…. And, in this same process, consciousness is purified and becomes clear as a great gust of wind. There is nothing in it any more, except an impulse to flee itself, a sliding outside itself.

And so on, in emotionally laden and poetic metaphors that really do seem to tell us something about our condition, without ever giving a single reason that would carry weight with the literal-minded. Why do we have recourse to metaphor, in our attempt to say what our states of mind are like? This question—not asked, I think, by any of the existentialists, and certainly not by Husserl or Heidegger—lies at the heart of Ludwig Wittgenstein’s beautiful discussion of the first-person case in Philosophical Investigations, a work that Bakewell, alas, does not mention.

* * *

Phenomenology of Sartre’s kind lies behind all his most powerful invocations and arguments, including the incomparable description of sexual desire and its paradoxes in Being and Nothingness. But there is another input too, and one that Bakewell mentions only in passing, and in the course of describing de Beauvoir’s discussion of the alterité (otherness) of the “second sex.” The other input is G.W.F. Hegel’s Phenomenology of Spirit. This great work, which introduced the term “phenomenology” to philosophy, though not quite in its subsequent sense, was the topic of influential lectures delivered by Alexandre Kojève at the Institut des Hautes Études between 1933 and 1939. Those lectures, attended by de Beauvoir, Merleau-Ponty, Raymond Aron, Georges Bataille, Jaqcques Lacan—in short by anybody who was anybody in the French intellectual élite—implanted in all of them a common language with which to shape their response to the postwar reality. Self-consciousness and freedom are, in Kojève’s interpretation of Hegel, synonymous, and come into being not through reflection on the self but through encounter with the other, and through the “life and death struggle” that leads first to slavery, and then to the moment of mutual emancipation, when my freedom is realized through acknowledging the freedom in you. The argument, in all its many details, underlies the little that is true in Karl Marx, and the much that is true in Sartre, Merleau-Ponty, and Levinas, and would have benefited from Bakewell’s candid, engaging way of presenting abstract ideas through the attempt to live by them.

That lacuna aside, Bakewell admirably shows the legacy of phenomenology, not only in the writings of the major existentialists, but also in central European thinkers who have in their own way affected the self-understanding of our continent in modern times—notably in Jan Pato?ka and his disciple Václav Havel. Her wide and adventurous reading inspired me to follow her into some unusual corners of intellectual history, and almost persuaded me to forget the great fact that she veers constantly away from, which is that her two favorite thinkers, who were such a positive inspiration to her, were also vast negative forces in the France of their day. Their advocacy of liberation went hand in hand with a contempt for those who lived by the old middle-class values—the only values that held the French together in the postwar trauma. Their writings did much to bring about the great fissure in French society between the law-abiding “bourgeoisie” and the intellectuals who despise the bourgeois decencies. Les salauds [bastards], as Sartre called them, emerged in the century after Gustave Flaubert as the enemy, the thing to lampoon and destroy, and this enterprise, which is responsible for what is most feeble in Sartre’s writing, notably the patchwork Marxism of the Critique de la raison dialectique (Critique of Dialectical Reason, 1960), was adopted by all those who took part in the 1968 revolution, from Louis Althusser to Alain Badiou to Gilles Deleuze and Lacan, who imagined that they were so much the more glamorous for the contempt with which they greeted those who subsidized their narcissistic lifestyle.

* * *

It is in these terms that I would respond, now, to both the radical freedom of Sartre and the radical feminism of de Beauvoir. Their philosophy was, primarily, one of rejection, a refusal to emulate or be bound by the sacrifices on which social order depends. They lived in a world of self-esteem, and because they did nothing to deserve this esteem, they postulated “bonne foi” or authenticity as sufficient grounds for it. If everyone lived and thought as they did, society would come to an end, and there would never again be children. But they needed those children—how else is the stock of lovers to be renewed? Like the effete English intellectuals of the Bloomsbury Set, the existentialists depended on what Lytton Strachey called “the marrying classes” to bear the burden of society, so that they could flit from flower to flower, enjoying a freedom that could never be allowed to those whom they despised for making it possible.",1,http://www.claremont.org/crb/article/song-of-myself/#.WRntLLBBiO4.twitter
89,Andrews,Helen,claremont,"""It would be an invidious thing,"" Edmund Burke once said, ""to remark the errors into which the authority of great names has brought the nation, without doing justice, at the same time, to the great qualities whence that authority arose."" In these remarks, taken from a 1774 speech to the House of Commons against the Tea Act, Burke attacked the last remaining element of the Townshend Acts, but was careful not to attack Charles Townshend himself. Though he was not above invective at the proper time, Burke understood the difference between honoring the man and attacking his legacy. Two recent interpretations of Burke offer examples of each approach.

Drew Maciag and Jesse Norman approach Burke in quite disparate ways. Maciag, an intellectual historian, chronicles the use and abuse of Burke's authority throughout American history, with an eye toward criticizing the conservative appropriation of Burke. Norman, a Conservative member of the British Parliament and a trained philosopher, gives us a sparkling biography of Burke and a distillation of his main political principles. Norman wants to make Burke available to conservative thinkers once again, while Maciag thinks that that approach is always flawed.

For Maciag, Burke's reception in America is a story of the ideological exploitation of Burke's authority on behalf of causes that he never could have known. By showing the twists and turns of the American Burke, he hopes to pave the way for a progressive reading of the good Burke, the pre-French Revolution Burke, freed from the concerns of American conservatism.

Maciag constructs his own 16-page ""Burke in Brief,"" a yardstick by which to measure Burke's American readers. Maciag's Burke is a Janus-faced ""progressive-traditionalist,"" initially opposed to many elements of the ""archconservative power structure"" of his day, but then turning toward their defense. Prior to 1790, Burke was ""a Whig reformer and progressive thinker."" After 1790, Burke appears to Maciag ""obsessively single-minded and narrowly focused."" The Burke who opposed the French Revolution was motivated, as Maciag says in a later chapter, by ""fear rather than conservatism."" The reformist thinking which should have been Burke's legacy was overshadowed by the dour visage of reaction.

* * *

Americans have tried and failed to understand Burke, in Maciag's reading. When John Adams was called ""the American Burke,"" it was myth-making; an attempt to search for respectable antecedents that would justify America's self-image. When the Jacksonians and the transcendentalists read Burke, only the reformist Burke appeared. Maciag has little patience for admirers of the later anti-revolutionary Burke, like the Whigs Rufus Choate and Edward Everett. He faults them for using Burke to make a myth about America, but then he says that Whig conservatism ""failed to link its worldview with American ideals."" It seems that everyone was a failure. Only Joseph Story is close to ""the Burkean core,"" as Maciag sees it, because Story embraced Burke's ""progressive-conservative philosophy"" rather than his mysticism.

According to Maciag, then, Burke was a man of two -isms, progressivism and traditionalism, or liberalism and conservatism. A form of the Whig interpretation of history, now largely passé among academic historians, undergirds Maciag's account. Those who are on board with the known direction of history are progressives. Those who fail to adjust (as Maciag says of John Adams) are traditionalists. Since Burke was ""always shifting from one side of the vessel to the other,"" efforts to make him face port or starboard necessarily fail.

Maciag's peculiar approach frequently leads to bizarre and unhelpful generalizations. Speaking of Joseph Story and Burke, Maciag wagers that ""perhaps he and Burke were both ahead of and behind their own times, depending on the circumstance."" Every age features a contest of -isms, such as the ""irreconcilable tug of war between traditionalism and exceptionalism"" that marked the era of Teddy Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson. In one breath, Maciag mocks Burke's overreaction to the French Revolution, and in the next asserts that the French Revolution was an epochal change. Was Burke ahead of his time or behind it?

It is remarkable that Maciag ascribes the Whig interpretation of history to Burke, even though British historian Sir Herbert Butterfield didn't coin the term until 1931. For Maciag, Whiggism means taking all changes as faits accomplis, and so Burke's shift toward reaction in the 1790s was a failure to follow his own principles. Yet this approach doesn't even make sense of the prerevolutionary Burke. Was British misrule in Ireland, America, or India not already a fait accompli to which Burke should have adjusted?

* * *

In this sort of framework, it's a foregone conclusion that Maciag would have no use for postwar American conservatives, whom he prefers to psychologize rather than understand. Strangely, he treats Russell Kirk, Peter Stanlis, and the ""Austrian-born"" Leo Strauss (who was actually born in Germany) without reference to the Cold War, as though their interest in Burke reflected the down-and-out status of conservatives, desperately longing for what Maciag calls ""the legitimacy of a respected father.""

Writing intellectual history in this manner tends to lead to condescension, and Maciag treats postwar conservative interest in ""the natural law"" with gentle mockery. Most scholars agree that Burke tied human laws to some grounding in nature. However, he rejected the use of nature or natural right as a trump to overthrow existing institutions. The dispute between Strauss and Burke's Catholic interpreters concerned the status of political foundings, which Burke tended to view organically. In one place Maciag criticizes the ""use of ‘right reason' as a moral trump card""; in another, he says Burke had an ""almost irrational fear of rationalism."" Which is it?

For Maciag, doubts about progress are basically irrational, and the forgotten early Burke was a progressive. Maciag, who does a brisk trade in -isms, claims that exceptionalism, egalitarianism, equalitarianism, individualism, liberalism, environmentalism, and so forth have all left Burke behind. Well-adjusted people get with the program. Those who follow Burke's ""monarchism, mysticism, Old World traditionalism"" have got the wrong -isms. To be sure, in Maciag's view few Americans actually follow the Burke of mysticism. But if any did, he would surely blame them.

Because of the opposition Maciag imposes on the pre- and post-revolutionary Burke, he doesn't attempt to explain why a supporter of reform shifted to being an opponent of revolution. Yet the change isn't so strange. Burke thought that the British constitution encouraged a politically fecund debate about the value of reform. In opposing the French Revolution, he opposed the loss of the political context in which reform could occur by its usual means.

Maciag uses a later, more radical distinction between liberalism and conservatism in order to assert Burke's incoherence and the incoherence of any attempt to interpret Burke. Since one can't consistently follow someone who was inconsistent, Burke's American readers always fall into one or the other extreme of Maciag's pincer strategy.

* * *

Jesse Norman's book eschews the simplistic dichotomies on which Maciag depends. Instead he weaves a colorful tapestry of Burke's career, drawing out the threads that unite Burke's apparently opposed stands. Norman's biographical reading of Burke dominates the first half of his book, and it has the effect of making Burke's reactionary shift of the 1790s take a more natural place in the context of Burke's practices of reform. Though Norman's Burke disliked dry scholastic reasoning from an early age, his decision to go into politics wasn't a departure from learning. Burke instead looked for knowledge of the human things in the place where he was likely to find it.

In Norman's interpretation Burke's early works introduce themes that remain important to him later. By way of satire, his Vindication of Natural Society (1756) emphasizes the organic growth of societies over time in the absence of rational planning. His Account of the European Settlements in America (1757) brings out the general, shared character of human nature as well as the particular elements that distinguished each political culture.

Norman finds the same combination of the general and the particular in Burke's first mature political works. His detailed 1769 Observations on economic policy concludes with a statement on the heterogeneous character of the British constitution, which human reason in rationalizing would ruin. Burke's more famous Thoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents (1770) begins his exposition of party government in opposition to the king's rule through the use and abuse of personal favorites.

In Burke's attempts at conciliation with the American colonies, and his pleas for liberalization of trade with Ireland (even at the expense of the Bristol merchants whom he represented), Maciag finds proof of a softer-hearted Burke. Norman's Burke is instead ""filled with a profound hatred of injustice and of the abuse of power,"" which animated his response to injustices in Ireland, India, and France. Indeed, Burke's disgust at the Irish Penal Acts contains language as fierce as anything found in the Reflections on the Revolution in France. When popular resistance to the perceived accommodation of Catholics brought riots all the way to Burke's door in 1780, he witnessed a ""rapid and near-total collapse of society"" that would later come to mind as he studied the revolution in France.

* * *

Norman takes the view that Burke's Reflections ""refines and extends ideas with which Burke had been working for almost thirty years."" The debate over whether he had a reactionary turn after 1790 was already a live one when Burke wrote his apologia, An Appeal from the New to the Old Whigs. Burke's work of the 1780s also continued into the 1790s, as he pressed his impeachment of Warren Hastings, a government official who had corruptly misruled India-Burke's last effort from an era in which reform was possible.

The key insight of Norman's Burke is that membership in human society shapes men before being shaped by them. The reformist spirit accepts both of these aspects, seeking to preserve what is best in what is given and to improve it where possible. Many social institutions store and transmit the knowledge that becomes a reference point for human activity.

Norman's exposition of Burke brings together the themes of reform and conservation, for the parliamentary institutions dear to Burke, including political parties, were sites of debate. The party system should preserve the viewpoints out of which genuine reform can arise. At their best, parties offer stability, openness, moderation, leadership, and discussion. The political designs that Burke lambastes as ""abstract"" had no use for partisan dispute. Though France's National Assembly made ""Left"" and ""Right"" into political terms, the Right was progressively expunged—culminating in the purge of the moderate republicans in 1793. The revolution had divided Left and Right only in order to wipe out one of the two parties.

* * *

Edmund Burke appears in Norman's book as the exponent of a well-functioning party system, led by statesmen distinguished for their virtue. Though Burke died before the advent of liberal individualism, his thought ""carries within it a devastating analysis and critique"" of the attempt to found policy only in the social sciences. The ""simplifying assumptions"" which animate modern economics ignore man's social nature, and cannot grasp the transgenerational character of human society. Political judgments involve trade-offs that social science cannot always resolve. Statesmen must preserve the particular moral community in which judgments about shared goods are possible—not viewing human beings as analytical archetypes but considering them in the variety of their motivations.

Norman calls Burke ""the first conservative,"" but admits that he ""would have rejected"" some elements of modern market-based conservatism, and even the more strident tones of religious conservatism. The varied uses of Burke which so gall Drew Maciag come in part from Burke's own wish to preserve the space within which political leadership may grow and exercise itself.

True, it's never quite clear where Burke's temperament is going to cash out in the modern setting. Jesse Norman's book provides the guideposts, and leaves it to his readers to exercise their own judgment. Perhaps that's just how Burke would have wanted it.",1,http://www.claremont.org/crb/article/the-first-conservative/#.WRNYIhGWw7U.twitter
90,Andrews,Helen,claremontinstitute,"The word “crisis” hardly captures the dismal situation in Indian Country. Consider just one statistic: the leading cause of death for Indian boys ages 10 to 14 is suicide. In fact, suicide among Native American youths is more than twice the U.S. average, and in Canada, five to seven times the national average. Last April, eleven members of the Attawapiskat First Nation attempted suicide on a single day. Nine were children.

What’s causing this despair? The answer typically offered is racism—which is correct, but not in the sense usually meant. In The New Trail of Tears, Naomi Schaefer Riley, a columnist and former Wall Street Journal editor, explains that Indian policy is a spider web of rules and bureaucracy, converging on one central point: the interests of governments—federal, state, and tribal—routinely trump individual Native Americans’ rights and wishes, ensnaring them in a collectivism subversive of every value necessary to a flourishing society.

Take property rights. Indian country contains some of the continent’s richest natural resource deposits and loveliest tourist destinations. Yet reservation land, generally, cannot be individually owned—it’s owned either by the whole tribe, or by the federal government “in trust” for the tribe. This means it cannot be mortgaged, so it cannot serve as collateral to start businesses or build infrastructure. Layers of federal bureaucracy require multiple permits before Indians can develop land, and tribal governments add their own restrictions on top of that. Thus, writes Riley, “Indian land has become all but useless to Indians themselves.”

The situation is aggravated by a legal system that blocks tribal prosecution of non-Indians for crimes on reservations, and immunizes tribal governments from lawsuits—both of which undermine the legal security necessary for businesses to operate. Unemployment on the Navajo Nation, which is more than twice the size of Massachusetts and home to 175,000 people, is 42%. The average per capita income is $7,269. On the San Carlos Apache reservation, it’s about half that.

* * *

The problems aren’t just legal. One of Riley’s key insights is that identity politics, leftist propaganda, and the welfare state have crippled the mores essential to growth. The notion that “true” Native culture means prelapsarian socialism and the priority of tribal group rights over individualism is worse than false—it’s a racist fantasy concocted by whites who were either seduced by Rousseauian visions of the noble savage or were eager to rationalize Indian removal. Riley quotes one Native leader: “the concept that we never had private property has been foisted upon us.” But that myth has taken such firm root in everything from Disney films to sociology departments that it’s almost unquestioned, even among Natives themselves.

Actually, pre-contact Indians had a robust understanding of private property and were notoriously individualistic. And the disastrous consequences of Western collectivist myths were early noted. The Pequot William Apess, bemoaning the state of New England reservations, complained that Indians “are made to believe they are minors and have not the abilities given them from God, to take care of themselves, [except for making and selling] a few little articles, such as baskets and brooms. Their land is in common stock, and they have nothing to make them enterprising.” He wrote that in 1833.

Things worsened in the century that followed. A series of laws beginning in the 1930s organized today’s tribal governments—forcing groups like the Navajo to choose chiefs when they’d never had any—and elevated government interests over individual rights. Alongside the federal “trust” system, these laws ensured that every necessity of reservation life—education, medicine, housing, employment, and even tribal membership—would come under bureaucratic control. “Indians,” writes Riley, “are the most overregulated race on the planet.” Yet thanks to Supreme Court neutering of the Indian Civil Rights Act, tribal officials aren’t limited by the constitutional rules that protect Americans against state governments, despite the fact that all American Indians are citizens of the United States.

* * *

Centralized planning on reservations stifles individual initiative, all but forbids construction, and offers still more government programs as virtually the only solution. It has, in the words of the Harvard Project on American Indian Economic Development, “maximized the politicization of investment and employment decisions.” That, in turn, maximizes the power of politicians at the expense of tribal citizens, whose only alternative is often the dole. The moral consequences are a crippling culture of anti-individualism and broken families.

Nothing about this is unique to Indians. “The cultural problems on Indian reservations,” Riley concludes, “are really the results of economic and political circumstances that have been foisted upon Indians. If you live in a place where there are no jobs and no access to capital, not working becomes the norm. Any entrepreneurial impulse you have is quickly squelched.” Any group subjected to this mess of infantilizing social science experiments would come out the same. J.D. Vance’s bestselling Hillbilly Elegy (2016) reveals a similar pattern at work among Appalachian whites, where poverty and addiction are prolonged by a mix of entitlement and despair. People come to see success as a lucky stroke, not the result of devoted effort.

Psychologists call this “learned helplessness.” If the malady is concentrated on reservations, that’s because patronizing government policies are so entrenched there—shielded by white romanticism and, on the Native side, an us-versus-them mentality that summarily dismisses criticism as racist. Dependency is not part of any Native American culture, Riley notes. But stifling government policies have now made it the norm.

* * *

Still, Riley’s book is not bleak. on the contrary, she profiles several heroic individuals who are today fighting the odds—and often fighting tribal governments—to improve the lives of Native Americans.

There’s Whispering Pines Chief Mike Lebourdais, who is pushing for legislation to roll back restrictions on native land ownership in Canada. Sadly, the obstacles seem enormous. “The biggest opposition, Lebourdais says, has come from other First Nations…. Aboriginal people in Canada ‘think property ownership is a white thing.’”

There’s Minnesota Chippewa lawyer Mark Fiddler, who defends the rights of children subject to the 1978 Indian Child Welfare Act. That Act imposes a separate set of rules for child welfare and adoption proceedings involving children of Native ancestry—and is often a powerful tool for ideologues who think abused or neglected Indian kids should never be adopted by people of other races. It even bars state courts from using the “best interests of the child” test that ordinarily governs cases involving children. In 2013, Fiddler successfully represented the adoptive couple in the headline-grabbing “Baby Veronica” case, in which a Cherokee father who abandoned his child in utero tried to veto the adoption arranged by the child’s non-Indian, unwed mother. “The theory behind [the Act] is that Indian children won’t be screwed up as long as they’re parented by Indians,” says Fiddler. But what matters to children isn’t race-matching; it’s loving, permanent homes.

And there’s Ben Chavis in California, a Lumbee who worked his way from poverty to earn three Ph.D.s, a fortune in real estate, and a successful tenure as principal of the American Indian Public Charter School (AIPCS) in Oakland. Thanks to his strict discipline and traditional teaching, AIPCS was rated the best high school in the United States, all of its students passing at least one Advanced Placement test. He now runs a school on a North Carolina farm. “Chavis sees American Indians as immigrants to the dominant American culture,” writes Riley. “They’re poor, just like immigrants, and starting from behind, so he’s proposing strategies that have helped immigrants succeed.”

* * *

Sadly, some Indians have what Riley calls “the opposite of an immigrant mentality.” Where immigrants typically hope their children will move up the economic ladder, some Indian parents and activists preach against the American Dream. This is partly an understandable reaction to unjust government policies that until recently outlawed Native religions, forced kids into boarding schools, and sought—in the infamous words of Richard Pratt, founder of the Carlisle Indian School—to “kill the Indian to save the man.” But insularity is a major obstacle to the improvement of life for Native people. Consider Blackfeet lawyer Gyasi Ross’s warning to Native students that “western education is assimilation,” and that “when Native people go away…from the rez for education, and then…just live in middle class splendor away from their homelands…that’s not positive.” Living a fulfilling life of one’s own, Ross thinks, means “buying fully into the assimilation lie.”

Jules, Fiddler, and Chavis prove that such race-first collectivism isn’t shared by all Native Americans, but it’s common enough to sap the ambition of countless youth and to breed hopeless alienation. And such dogma isn’t just reactionary, it’s fundamentally racist. It classifies Natives as the property of tribal communes—just as imperialists and white supremacists regarded them in past ages—rather than as equal individuals in charge of their own destinies. Whether offered by Jacksonians in the 1830s or race-obsessed activists in 2016, it’s the same old serpent that says the pursuit of happiness is for other people.

Nothing today can undo the Sand Creek Massacre or the Trail of Tears. But it is within our power to open the door of opportunity for our fellow citizens. Doing so requires that they cease to be regarded as a separate people. “[Y]ou ask yourselves, ‘What do they, the Indians, want?’” wrote William Apess. “[Y]ou have only to look at the unjust laws made for them, and say, ‘They want what I want,’ in order to make men of them, good and wholesome citizens.”",1,http://www.claremontinstitute.org/crb/article/losing-ground/
91,Andrews,Helen,claremont,"It turns out that the Emerging Democratic Majority (2002), by Ruy Teixeira and John B. Judis, has a shrewdly unfalsifiable title. The fact that the Democratic majority has not yet emerged neither does nor can disprove the book’s contention that it’s still in the process of emerging. It’s only a matter of time, albeit a good deal more time than we were led to believe when the book’s thesis first thrilled Democrats and dismayed Republicans.

Hillary Clinton’s loss in the 2016 election to the supposedly unelectable Donald Trump was bad enough. Democrats in politics and journalism quickly insisted that there was less to that contest’s outcome than met the eye, blaming Clinton’s defeat on the anti-majoritarian Electoral College, FBI Director James Comey, Russian hackers, “fake news,” and her campaign’s blunder in taking wins in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin for granted.

These efforts to reconcile Trump’s victory with the idea that the Democrats are this century’s natural governing majority cannot, however, account for congressional and state results. Democrats held 257 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives during Barack Obama’s first year as president, 59.1% of the total, but now have only 194, 44.6%. Over the same eight years, the number of Democratic senators has fallen from 60 to 48. By the time the 2018 midterm elections take place, Republicans will have held a majority in the House for 20 of the preceding 24 years. In the Senate, where the GOP was defending 24 of the 34 seats up for election in 2016, including seven in states Barack Obama had carried twice, it was widely expected that Democrats would regain the majority they lost in 2014. Instead, they managed a net increase of just two senators, three fewer than needed to take control. (And the Democrats’ immediate prospects are grim. Republicans currently hold only eight of the 33 Senate seats to be contested in 2018. Of the 25 seats Democrats must defend, five are in states—Indiana, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, and West Virginia—where Hillary Clinton received less than 40% of the popular vote.) There were 29 Democratic governors in office when Barack Obama was first inaugurated, but only 16 today. In 2009, 56% of state legislators were Democrats; only 44% are now, a decline of nearly 1,000.

In short, with Democrats holding fewer offices and wielding less power than at any time since the 1920s, they do not look like a party on the verge of commanding an enduring majority. Emerging’s co-authors are now…diverging. Ruy Teixeira still insists that the demographic trend is the Democrats’ friend. The book had argued that as America becomes less white and better-educated, the GOP’s weakness with every group other than white voters without a college degree would condemn it to decades of electoral defeat and governmental irrelevance. After Election Day Teixeira wrote, “Looking back from 2032, we are far more likely to view the 2016 election as the last stand of America’s white working class, dreaming of a past that no longer exists, than as a fundamental transformation of the political system.”

John Judis has become far more skeptical. When most Democratic analysts explained Republican gains in the 2014 midterm elections as the result of low turnout, a problem that would solve itself in a presidential election year, Judis cautioned that 2014 may not have been “an isolated event but rather the latest manifestation of a resurgent Republican coalition.” The problem was that Democrats’ “coalition of the ascendant”—minorities and millennials—wasn’t ascending as fast as Democrats were losing votes from two large groups: whites without a college degree and whites with a four-year degree but no postgraduate one. Based on gains with these working- and middle-class voters, who together account for about 60% of the electorate, Judis discerned an “emerging Republican advantage” that is likely to make the GOP less than dominant but more than competitive in American politics.

The demography-is-destiny argument for an emerging Democratic majority has other problems. First, the fact that an ethnic group is growing does not guarantee that its partisan loyalties won’t evolve. Despite doing little to attract and much to antagonize Hispanic voters, Donald Trump still received 28% of their votes, according to the CNN exit poll, slightly better than Mitt Romney had done in 2012. Second and more specifically, the long-term political cohesion of the coalition of the ascendant is possible but by no means certain. The Democratic tent may or may not prove big enough to include advocates for increased immigration and activists seeking more economic opportunities for the native-born poor; or Catholic Hispanic voters and crusaders against patriarchy, heteronormativity, and restrictions on abortion. At the very least, holding the party coalition together will be a continuing struggle.

Most fundamentally, sociologist Richard Alba has challenged the widespread belief that present demographic trends guarantee that by 2050 America will become a “majority-minority” nation. Many children with just one white parent or even grandparent, he argues, will grow up to consider themselves white rather than members of a minority group. Furthermore, cultural assimilation will work in tandem with biological mixing to increase the number of Americans who think of themselves as part of the mainstream, and reduce the number who regard themselves as members of “marginalized minorities.”

Understandably, Democrats are fond of the Teixeira thesis: it assures them that no matter how many bad Election Days they suffer, they’re not doing anything wrong and don’t need to do anything different. Persuading people receptive to some things you advocate but dubious about others is ordinarily considered essential to electoral politics. Teixeira’s argument, however, tells Democrats that politics can be all about turnout, not persuasion. Since Democrats will win if they get enough of their voters to the polls, the only pressing demand is to motivate the party’s core constituencies, not to devise appeals for other voters. Defeats are anomalies that call for staying the course rather than reconsidering it. After all, the groups that constitute the Democratic base will make up an even larger part of the electorate in the next election cycle, and a larger one still in the election after that.

Moral Panic

Democrats’ determination to tie their fortunes to the coalition of the ascendant rests, however, on something far stronger than inertia or risk-aversion. Democrats have come to regard the promotion of diversity, multiculturalism, and inclusion as their most urgent goal—indeed, the party’s reason for existence. As Sean Illing of Vox.com put it, “America was founded on a system of white supremacy, and contemporary liberalism is a necessary corrective to this.” Or, in the words of feminist author Linda Hirshman:

The American project started with white men’s freedom and equality, and has been, for more than two centuries, all about expanding the circle to include more and more people in that blessed plot. It has almost always been the left that forces such expansions.

Thus, to seek the votes of minorities and the marginalized is a practical imperative, but to champion their cause is a moral one. Any attempt to expand the Democratic coalition by diluting the ascendant groups’ claims betrays the party’s core clientele, constituents, and purpose.

Columbia University historian Mark Lilla discovered just how fiercely his fellow Democrats oppose any recalibration of their commitment to diversity when, ten days after the election, the New York Times website published his op-ed, “The End of Identity Liberalism.” It called for Democrats to get past the “moral panic about racial, gender and sexual identity that has distorted liberalism’s message and prevented it from becoming a unifying force capable of governing.” Democrats suffer avoidable electoral defeats, Lilla contended, because liberals’ “obsession with diversity has encouraged white, rural, religious Americans to think of themselves as a disadvantaged group whose identity is being threatened or ignored.” Identity liberalism’s electoral benefits cannot be detached from its costs. “Those who play the identity game should be prepared to lose it.”

Our nation’s politics, Lilla believes, “will be dominated by whoever best captures Americans’ imaginations about our shared destiny.” Thus, we need a “post-identity liberalism” that addresses “Americans as Americans” and emphasizes issues “that affect a vast majority of them.”

It would speak to the nation as a nation of citizens who are in this together and must help one another. As for narrower issues that are highly charged symbolically and can drive potential allies away, especially those touching on sexuality and religion, such a liberalism would work quietly, sensitively and with a proper sense of scale.

For all the good it did him, Lilla went out of his way to make clear that he wrote as a liberal Democrat enthused about making our national garden ever more splendidly variegated. He called Donald Trump’s victory “repugnant,” and hailed the “beautiful” process of America becoming more diverse as “an extraordinary success story.”

Katherine Franke, his Columbia faculty colleague, was not fooled. The day after Lilla’s essay appeared in print, she wrote that Lilla and David Duke were advancing the same cause: “the whitening of American nationalism, and the re-centering of white lives as lives that matter most in the U.S.” Lilla’s contribution to this project was “nuanced,” which made his efforts even more “nefarious” than Duke’s. The liberalism Lilla endorsed was not worthy of the name, in Franke’s view, since it regards as a mere “distraction” the “efforts of people of color and women to call out forms of power that sustain white supremacy and patriarchy.” In urging Democrats to appeal to as many Americans as possible in terms that resonate with all, Lilla erroneously and destructively imagines that what matters is “the idea of America as a ‘shining city on a hill’ that deserves our allegiance, not our protest.”

When asked by an interviewer about Franke’s attack, Lilla said simply, “I rest my case.” You get what he means. If the Democratic Party attempts to win elections by accusing people like Lilla, who support 99% of the diversity project, of being morally indistinguishable from people like David Duke, who oppose 100% of it, then many otherwise persuadable people in the middle regions of that spectrum are going to dismiss and resent entreaties to vote, speak, think, and live ever more multiculturally.

Franke’s inquisitorial approach is no idiosyncrasy, but the default mode for modern leftist discourse. Even before Election Day, some liberals were worrying that their history of rhetorical excesses had given rise to a “cry wolf” problem. That is, no thesaurus provided terms of alarm and condemnation strong enough to denounce Donald Trump and his supporters’ racism, given that the message came from the same sources who insist that George W. Bush, John McCain, Mitt Romney, and, now, Mark Lilla are also racists.

In 2012, for example, liberal columnist Michael Tomasky accused Romney of being a “race-baiter” and “race-mongering pyromaniac.” The entirety of the prosecution’s case was that in an address to the NAACP, Romney had used the word “Obamacare.” Even though by 2012 that term was a ubiquitous descriptor, Tomasky still judged it to be, in context, a “loaded phrase” and “gratuitous broadside.” Little wonder that assertions of Trumpist bigotry over the course of the 2016 campaign got ever less traction as they became ever more strident.

And that was before the ballots were counted. After the astounding outcome—New Yorker editor David Remnick immediately declared Trump’s victory a “tragedy,” “sickening event,” and “crushing blow to the spirit”—many Trump opponents apparently decided that their mistake had been too little stridency. The election results were, for Slate writer L.V. Anderson, bitterly clarifying, revealing to white liberals “our unjust, racist, sexist country for what it is.”

Whitelash

This assessment would appear to contradict the contention that “America is already great,” President Obama’s rejoinder at the Democratic convention to Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan. But not really. The liberals Anderson speaks for had, before November 8, imagined that America was “making meaningful progress” toward an era of “tolerance, justice, and respect for the dignity and rights of all,” an illusion shattered by the election.

The belief in progress, of course, defines progressivism. Its adherents are necessarily, though usually implicitly, patriots of the reformed America of the future, and antagonists of the benighted one of the past. A progressive can think that America is great if, and only if, it’s making progress toward being great.

Barack Obama applauded this progress over and over, apparently in the hope that hailing it as an irresistible force would help make it one. The Reverend Jeremiah Wright’s “profound mistake” in damning America was that “he spoke as if our society was static,” Obama said in his 2008 “More Perfect Union” campaign speech. As president, at Selma, Alabama, in 2015, Obama lauded America as “a constant work in progress,” a nation “unencumbered by what is” because it’s always ready to “seize what ought to be.”

His supporters who chanted “Yes we can” throughout 2008 ended 2016 confronting the grim possibility that maybe we can’t. From their perspective, the fact that so many Americans want to make America great again means that Trump voters cannot or will not understand that our nation’s heritage deserves protest, not allegiance. An America that suspends, abandons, or reverses the project of becoming great, of atoning for the historical sins that define it, is not now great but, rather, reprehensible. The 2016 contest, according to the Washington Post’s Greg Sargent, pitted “an evolving America that embraces pluralism, tolerance, inclusion, and cultural change” against a reactionary one that demands “intolerance, bigotry, ethno-nationalism, and white identity politics.” This is the “whitelash” theory of Trump’s victory, put forward on Election Night by CNN commentator and former Obama Administration official Van Jones.

Thus, the refusal to make the first woman president the first black president’s successor was a victory for the forces of oppression over those of liberation. Another Slate writer, Michelle Goldberg, declared, “In the defining drama of our time, a woman who was the most qualified person ever to run for president lost to a man who was the least.” The election that was supposed to signal the collapse of the historical “gender hierarchy,” Goldberg lamented, turned out to demonstrate that men still run things, and may well forever.

Identity-politics polemicists dismiss any consideration that might modify these harsh accusations. Didn’t 41% of all women vote for Trump, for example, only three points less than Romney’s showing in 2012? That result suggests that neither electing a woman president nor defeating her opponent—accused throughout the campaign of contempt for, and abuse of, women—was all that big a deal for many female voters.

Not so. Millions of women voted for Trump due to their “internalized misogyny,” as one Clinton campaign aide, Jess McIntosh, explained on MSNBC. They voted against what McIntosh considered their self-interest because “[w]e as a society react poorly to women seeking positions of power.”

And the exit polls showing that white women voted for Trump by 52% to 43%, even though “feminism…makes everybody feel good about themselves all the time,” as one journalist argued? Racism, Amanda Marcotte explained in Salon: “Given the choice between improving their own lives and screwing over someone else’s life so they can feel superior, large numbers of Americans will choose the latter.”

But, again, wait. Basically, Donald Trump won by holding the Romney states and then carrying six others, with a total of 99 electoral votes, that Obama had won twice—Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. If white racism is so politically powerful, shouldn’t it have prevented the election or re-election of America’s first black president, rather than manifesting itself decisively only after he was off the ballot?

Nope. Indeed, to ask that hateful question not only fails to cast doubt on the pervasiveness of white racism, but strengthens the case for it by revealing the asker’s bigotry. “Pointing to citizens who voted for both Obama and Trump does not disprove racism,” pronounced the Atlantic’s Ta-Nehisi Coates, “it evinces it.” In the words of Slate’s Jamelle Bouie, “Trump forged a politics of white tribalism, and white people embraced it.” Which is why, he contends, there is no such thing as a good Trump voter. Whatever their motives or thinking, every last one of them voted for “state repression of disfavored minorities.”

Well, is it possible that some part of the explanation for November’s result, other than malevolent racism and sexism, is that Hillary Clinton really wasn’t—despite fervent claims on her behalf—the most qualified candidate for high office in the history of carbon-based life forms? That she was better described as a mediocre politician who had been a national figure for a quarter-century without ever providing a persuasive rationale for being made president? (“I’m not going away until you give it to me,” doesn’t qualify, as Harold Stassen proved.) Coates allows that this may have been a problem. “Clinton was a candidate who’d won one competitive political race in her life,” he correctly observes, “whose political instincts were questioned by her own advisers, who took more than half a million dollars in speaking fees from an investment bank because it was ‘what they offered,’ who proposed to bring back to the White House a former president dogged by allegations of rape and sexual harassment.” So, then, maybe bigotry was not the sole or decisive factor?

You should know better by now. “Imagine an African American facsimile of Hillary Clinton,” says Coates. “She would never be the nominee of a major political party and likely would not be in national politics at all.” In other words, the fact that Clinton won a presidential nomination despite being uninspiring, secretive, deceptive, and too entitled to follow rules applicable to others, is also a function of white America’s racism.

To put it mildly, then, Mark Lilla has taken up a forbidding task. His article provoked a “civil war” within the Democratic Party, according to New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof, and every indication is that the correlation of forces favors Lilla’s opponents. Though most of his critics were less spiteful than Katherine Franke, the dominant impulse within the Democratic Party is to say everything in 2017 they said in 2016, only louder. But since sweeping, scathing accusations of racism and sexism couldn’t prevent the election of a Republican president and Congress, it’s unclear how even more sweeping and scathing accusations will rally the citizenry to thwart the GOP’s governing agenda. Such an approach holds promise only in a world in which “The beatings will continue until morale improves” is a time-tested maxim of industrial psychology.

Diversity, Tolerance, and Inclusion

When you lose the electoral contest, the ensuing challenge is to win the post-electoral interpretive contest. Ascribing the 2016 election to your opponents’ bigotry makes clear that the problem was not that Democrats didn’t do enough to deserve people’s votes, but that the people weren’t good enough to deserve Democrats’ governance. This posture is obviously satisfying—and obviously suicidal. As Lilla wrote in the Times, the whitelash thesis “is convenient because it sanctions a conviction of moral superiority and allows liberals to ignore what [Trump] voters said were their overriding concerns.”

One imagines that, sooner rather than later, even Democrats will come to suspect that denigrating people until they vote for you lacks a certain strategic plausibility. When joined, the debate over Lilla’s critique of identity will be contentious but also important. Speaking to National Public Radio about his essay, Lilla elaborated his position in formally provocative but substantively conciliatory language. Identity liberals “are in love with noble defeats,” he said, “and I’m sick and tired of noble defeats. I prefer a dirty victory to a noble defeat…. Get over yourself.”

If identity liberalism is noble, Lilla’s case against it rests entirely on the claim that as a practical matter it’s very ill-advised, given the political realities of early 21st-century America. The “core aim of political action in a liberal democracy,” Lilla told another interviewer, “is not to speak truth to power but to acquire power.” Elections are neither seminars nor therapy sessions, he added pointedly.

The fact that a smart man believes it necessary to explain such elementary concepts, as if to children, indicates how difficult it will be to loosen identity liberalism’s grip on the Democratic Party, even on pain of an electoral losing streak. Getting over yourself is exactly contrary to the whole point of identity politics, which is excessively preoccupied with identity, Lilla complains, and insufficiently concerned with politics. He calls it “a kind of pseudo-politics” that focuses “on questions of personal identity or social recognition.”

Lilla’s critics help to demonstrate his point. He identifies two examples of identity liberalism’s failure to “work quietly, sensitively and with a proper sense of scale.” First, some colleges’ policies now give students who feel their gender identities are ignored or disparaged by pronouns like “he” and “she” the right to be addressed by ones they consider more appropriate and respectful, including “they” (as a singular),” “ve,” and “ze.” Second, the fight over who gets to use which public restrooms culminated in the Department of Justice and the Department of Education telling public schools that asking students to prove or document their gender identities before using the restroom of their choice could result in the loss of federal funding. (That 2016 letter of guidance was later blocked by a federal district court in Texas.)

Lilla’s dismissive argument, insists ACLU attorney Chase Strangio, a transgender man, “suggests marginalized communities should wait until white, straight men are comfortable before demanding their right to exist.” Lilla says, “America is sick and tired of hearing about liberals’ damn bathrooms.” Strangio, however, contends that such mainstreaming public policies are the difference between fighting “the impulse within myself” that “I should not exist,” and finding “my way to a sense of beauty and pride in who I am.”

In a similar vein, Ta-Nehisi Coates wrote in 2008 of “the rage that lives in all African Americans, a collective feeling of disgrace that borders on self-hatred.” He further observed that, “Liberalism, with its pat logic and focus on structural inequities, offers no balm for this sort of raw pain.”

The problem is even more fundamental than Coates’s remark suggests. For one thing, asking public policy to make everybody feel good about themselves all the time is futile and dangerous. Liberalism, in the oldest and most basic sense of that term, obligates government to secure rights to liberty and the pursuit of happiness. But a right to the attainment of happiness, encompassing a sense of beauty and pride that banishes any sort of self-hatred, will require severe restrictions on liberty. If by criticizing or even withholding encouragement, you impair my self-esteem, then not only does my right to feel good about myself all the time circumscribe your words and conduct, but my subjective determination of whether I do feel proud or ashamed is the final arbiter of what you can’t and must say or do. Thanks to the rise of identity politics, the old Revolutionary rallying cry “Don’t Tread on Me” has been replaced with the 2016 Trump bumper sticker “F–k Your Feelings.”

Identity politics proceeds in the complacent assumption that diversity, tolerance, and inclusion mean pretty much the same thing. The reality is far messier. The etymology of “tolerance,” for example, rests on the Latin word for bearing or enduring, a notion markedly different from encouraging or affirming. The modest demand to put up with people, ideas, or customs you don’t like but which do you no harm lubricates greater diversity. By contrast, the idea that true tolerance mandates applauding and welcoming any and all that are alien or disagreeable stokes resentments, which inevitably make getting along more rather than less difficult.

Inclusion is no less tricky. Being inside a group or entity is meaningless unless it’s possible to be outside. If everyone belongs, no one belongs. In 2010 the U.S. Supreme Court, divided 5-4, ruled that the University of California Hastings College of Law was right to demand, as a condition of being an official student organization, that every student be eligible to join the school’s Christian Legal Society. The decision means, in the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education’s summary, that a public university can “require its student organizations to accept any student as a voting member or leader, regardless of whether the student openly disagrees with or is even hostile to the group’s fundamental beliefs.” The nebulous though powerful right to be included supersedes the freedom of association. Because the Christian Legal Society was not utterly inclusive, Hastings College excluded it from the roster of student organizations. Diversity did not encompass tolerating diverse opinions on this question.

Universal Principles

In its obsession with self-validation, identity politics not only diminishes liberty but thwarts democracy. Its thoroughgoing subjectivity imposes what philosophy professor Cressida Heyes calls “an epistemology of provenance,” wherein “political perspectives gain legitimacy by virtue of their articulation by subjects of particular experiences.” The danger is that this framework “closes off the possibility of critique of these perspectives by those who don’t share the experience, which in turn inhibits political dialogue and coalition-building.”

Lilla’s less abstract explanation to NPR made clear how identity liberalism, “narcissistic” and “isolating,” is politically self-defeating:

It says, on the one hand, you can never understand me because you are not exactly the kind of person I’ve defined myself to be. And on the other hand, you must recognize me and feel for me. Well, if you’re so different that I’m not able to get into your head and I’m not able to experience or sympathize with what you experience, why should I care?

Rather than betting liberalism’s political fortunes on voters’ limitless capacity to walk in others’ shoes and see through others’ eyes, Lilla argues the cause would be better served by appealing to principles applicable to all citizens. So, for example, invoking equal protection under the law is more likely to get a white voter to care about restraining police departments’ treatment of blacks than expecting him to comprehend and emotionally engage the black experience. The less sweeping but more comprehensible and powerful argument, says Lilla, is that blacks as citizens deserve protection. It’s worth remembering in this connection that the civil rights movement’s self-designation was not about identity or group rights, but about making categorical political commitments and principles universally applicable. This universality was lost when “civil rights” was challenged by “Black Power” in the 1960s.

Economist Glenn Loury, who is black, arrives at the same conclusion as Lilla. In a paraphrase of his thinking by the New Yorker’s George Packer, he warns against “race [becoming] an irreducible category in politics, rather than being incorporated into universal claims of justice.” We must not, says Loury, “lose sight of the goal of racially transcendent humanism being the American bedrock.”

Many, inside and outside academia, have already lost sight of it. The whole point of what some of theoreticians call “identitarianism” is that achieving identity-transcending humanism is impossible, and seeking it pernicious. According to Retrieving Experience: Subjectivity and Recognition in Feminist Politics (2001), by Sonia Kruks, the core identitarian claim is the “demand for recognition on the basis of the very grounds on which recognition has previously been denied: it is qua women, qua blacks, qua lesbians that groups demand recognition.” This demand means categorically rejecting “inclusion within the fold of ‘universal humankind’ on the basis of shared human attributes.” The scare quotes scoff at the idea of universal humankind. Shared human attributes are irrelevant, and un-shared ones decisive. This formulation precludes respecting black citizens’ rights qua citizens, as Lilla urges.

If universal principles are jettisoned, what are straight, white males’ political rights and obligations qua straight, white males? “I really don’t know how you ask white people not to be white in the world we’re creating,” Loury cautions. “How are there not white interests in a world where there are these other interests?”

Here’s how. The Trump voters’ anger was real, writes Amanda Marcotte, but it just wasn’t valid. Identitarianism is valid only for those seeking recognition on the grounds on which it was previously denied them. Those not so denied, or who were doing the denying, or who benefit from past denials, cannot avail themselves of the leverage and latitude identity politics affords. Trump voters’ interests and grievances have no legitimate place in the political arena, says Marcotte, because they are animated by the refusal to relinquish “unearned privilege,” which is sustained by social structures that enable whites to think they’re better and more important than non-whites, and men to think they’re smarter and more authoritative than women.

Identitarianism assigns the unprivileged a politics of recognition, and the privileged a politics of renunciation. Last year saw the creation of a new political action committee, “Can You Not,” that exists to “dis/empower and dis/incline people in positions of privilege, specifically straight white men, from ambitions of running for office in progressive urban districts.” “There is not space here to list all the ways in which white privilege plays out,” wrote University of Texas journalism professor Robert Jensen, “but it is clear that I will carry this privilege with me until the day white supremacy is erased.”

For all the fervor and rending of garments, however, there is an awkward fact that Loury pointed out to Packer: “the new racial politics actually asks little of sympathetic whites: a confession, a reading assignment.” It’s been 12 years since Jensen wrote The Heart of Whiteness: Confronting Race, Racism and White Privilege, but his zeal to erase white supremacy has not entailed going to work for a community college, giving up his U.T. professorship so that it could be filled by a paraplegic black lesbian. In the same way, the colleges that devote the most anguished attention to inclusion are usually the most “selective”—exclusive, that is—rejecting twice to 20 times as many applicants as they accept.

Insufferables versus Deplorables

Identity politics may, however, demand more of unsympathetic whites. Those who do not require so much space to list all the ways white privilege has played out for them needn’t renounce their privilege; others stand ready to renounce it for them. New York Times numbers-cruncher Nate Cohn says that compared to either of Barack Obama’s presidential campaigns, Hillary Clinton ran especially well among whites making more than $250,000, winning “huge margins in the most well-educated and prosperous liberal bastions.” She won landslides in such “old-money Republican enclave[s]” as Scarsdale, New York; Greenwich, Connecticut; and Glencoe and Winnetka, Illinois.

By contrast, Donald Trump won Dubuque County, Iowa, by 1.3%. I mention Dubuque because when President Obama’s Department of Housing and Urban Development threatened a city for taking too few Section 8 housing voucher applicants from Chicago, which had torn down its massive public housing projects without creating enough homes for the displaced low-income residents, it chose to play hardball with Dubuque. Not Winnetka, which is 20 miles from the Loop, or Glencoe, 25 miles away, but a small, struggling city in a different state, 180 miles distant. Winnetka, Glencoe, and Dubuque all have populations that are more than 90% white and less than 5% black. The difference is that in Winnetka the median household income is $212,000 and the median home value is $958,000. In Glencoe, the corresponding figures are $180,000 and $880,000. Dubuque’s median income is $47,000, below Iowa’s overall figure, and the median home value is $133,000. Having voted for her overwhelmingly, the enlightened citizens of Winnetka and Glencoe could watch Hillary Clinton’s concession speech with dismay, indignant at the prospect that the new Republican administration would enable Dubuque’s oppressors to reassert their privilege.

A significant portion of the Clinton coalition appears to be blessed with the special combination of a social conscience, determination, and resourcefulness that allows them to expiate their guilt by devising penances to be imposed on other people. A significant portion of the Trump coalition believes that they are the other people conscripted for these atonements, a division of labor they deeply resent. The 2016 main event between these two groups will someday be remembered as the Insufferables versus the Deplorables.

Hillary Clinton’s famous accusation about the latter was that a large portion of Trump supporters—she subsequently walked back the claim that it was half—were “irredeemable” and “not America” by virtue of their being “racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic—you name it.” It’s gratifying for identity liberals to hold as self-evident the truth that the identitarian project’s opponents have no motives apart from hate, irrational fears, and demographic revanchism. This analysis helps convince those who were on the wrong side of an election outcome that they are still, always, on the right side of history.

Democrats might, however, help their cause by considering Lilla’s suggestion and entertaining the possibility that many anti-identitarian Trump voters understood themselves to be acting in self-defense. Harvard law professor Mark Tushnet, for example, made clear the modus operandi of the anticipated Democratic president and Senate in a May 2016 blog post. Expecting that the Obama presidency would conclude, or the Hillary Clinton presidency begin, by filling the Antonin Scalia Supreme Court vacancy, followed by President Clinton appointing several additional liberal justices, Tushnet called on liberal jurists to be maximally aggressive in overturning old precedents and establishing new ones. He looked forward, for starters, to the courts validating and facilitating the aggressive expansion of affirmative action, campaign finance reform, access to abortion, and use of the disparate-impact test to reduce all kinds of inequalities. “The culture wars are over,” he said. “They lost; we won.”

For liberals, the question now is how to deal with the losers in the culture wars. That’s mostly a question of tactics. My own judgment is that taking a hard line (“You lost, live with it”) is better than trying to accommodate the losers, who—remember—defended, and are defending, positions that liberals regard as having no normative pull at all. Trying to be nice to the losers didn’t work well after the Civil War, nor after Brown. (And taking a hard line seemed to work reasonably well in Germany and Japan after 1945.)

“Of course,” he allowed, “all bets are off if Donald Trump becomes president.” Many Americans realized, with Tushnet’s help, that the stakes were so high as to merit comparisons to a conquered people living in an occupied country. Not surprisingly, such threats ended up helping Trump with voters who may have had deep misgivings about him.

One begins to understand that The Emerging Democratic Majority’s argument was so popular because Democrats were committed to becoming a party that could win elections in majority-minority America. The danger is of becoming a party that cannot be confident about winning until and unless majority-minority America comes to pass. Democrats need an in-the-meantime strategy, especially if the meantime turns out to be a very long time. Replicating Barack Obama’s coalition and victories may prove impossible without nominees who replicate his campaign skills—talents that cannot be summoned just because they’re indispensable.

Democrats would hedge their bets and improve their chances by doing better with white voters who live outside the liberal archipelago of college towns, gentry suburbs, and big-city hipster neighborhoods. Hillary Clinton’s strategists, however, thought campaigning among white working-class voters, as Bill Clinton repeatedly urged, was a waste of time. No Democratic presidential nominee has won West Virginia since he carried it twice in the 1990s. And, one of her advisors told the former president, no Democrat would do so again.

Post-2016 Democrats, chastened, are likely to rediscover a basic political reality: victory requires winning by as much as you can where you win, but also losing by as little as you can where you lose. Winning West Virginia may be out of the question for Democrats, but losing by smaller margins in portions of swing states whose voters have concerns and outlooks similar to West Virginia’s could make a decisive difference.

Through such calculations, Democrats might be led to engage Mark Lilla’s critique of identity liberalism in order to avoid repeating noble defeats like 2016. Doing so will be very difficult, however, while remaining convinced of identitarianism’s nobility. Even a politician more adept than Hillary Clinton will be challenged to anathametize and attract the same voters simultaneously.

The result Lilla seeks, a more competitive Democratic Party, will require taking up and then going beyond his argument. Identitarianism is not just imprudent but morally wrong in reducing identity to subjective reactions to victimhood, and rejecting equal treatment under the law in favor of “sliding scales” that are subject to infinite adjustments and flagrant manipulations. Understanding that the defeats caused by this identity illiberalism are deserved, not noble, is necessary before going on to address productively the Democratic and American challenge of refining and clarifying the basis on which a heterogeneous nation can cohere and sustain its republic.",1,http://www.claremont.org/crb/article/the-democratic-partys-identity-crisis/
92,Andrews,Helen,claremont,"For political taxonomists, Donald J. Trump is a difficult specimen to classify. A Democrat most of his life, admittedly more out of opportunism than conviction, he toyed once with running for president on the Reform Party ticket, the erstwhile political vehicle of his fellow billionaire Ross Perot. Trump said he admired Ronald Reagan and Winston Churchill, but also, for a while, Barack Obama, at least until discovering that his birth certificate was missing.

As he launched his run for president as a Republican, Trump said he had always been a conservative of sorts, a “common-sense conservative,” as opposed to the impractical, ideological, all-talk-and-no-action conservatives, as he regarded them, with whom he would share the stage during the long primary election season. He never considered himself a movement conservative, and still doesn’t. He gave short shrift to those—above all Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio—who boasted of their conservative pedigrees. (The party platform on which he ran was a different matter. It embodied the lengthy catechism of principles and policies promoted by today’s conservative movement, with slight nods to Trump’s own America First themes.)

All this makes him seem to many observers politically exotic, erratic, unserious—at best eclectic, at worst simply unprincipled. And viewed against the recent history of liberalism and conservatism, both of which have grown more doctrinaire as they’ve grown more institutionalized in Washington, D.C., it’s easy to see why those pat dismissals are so common. But a closer look, with the benefit of a broader historical perspective, suggests that President Trump’s notions have many precedents within both capital-R and small-r republicanism, and that they are not nearly so outré as they may seem when viewed against post-Reagan trends.

Granted, there has never been a president quite like Mr. Trump, but the voters, with reason, greeted his principal views as a kind of long overdue return to home truths—truths highly relevant though half forgotten. As he would say: sad!

The Party of McKinley and Coolidge

A clue to this dimension of Trump came last May, in a conversation with George Stephanopoulos on ABC. “Don’t forget,” Trump said, “this is called the Republican Party. It’s not called the Conservative Party.” Though he didn’t dilate on the distinction, he was pointing to a plain fact, connected to a whole set of facts: that the Republican Party is much older than the modern conservative movement (dating, in most accounts, only to the 1950s); that the former used to have a progressive or liberal wing, vigorous until the conservatives took over the party in 1964 and began to remake it in their image; that there are not enough self-declared conservative voters to win the presidency, and that Republicans must always attract, therefore, some non-conservative voters if they intend to win. Trump likes to win.

Add to those facts some gleanings from the campaign trail. About the only “movement” Trump talks about is his own, the unplanned, unanticipated, unnamed popular movement that arose in response to his candidacy and carried him to the White House. He respects the conservative movement—not so much its journalistic interpreters at National Review and the Weekly Standard, or its political leaders who challenged him—but he doesn’t love it with the ardor he reserves for his own, nameless popular movement. But with his victory, the Trump movement is now in the process of taking over the Republican Party, displacing the “Republican establishment,” which was partly the conservative establishment, he enjoyed vilifying so much.

The new Republican Party that he hopes to form will, I submit, resemble in certain crucial respects the old Republican Party that existed before the modern conservative movement got going. Where could you find a Republican Party that stood for high, or at any rate protective, tariffs; immigration only with assimilation or, to use Teddy Roosevelt’s term, Americanization; and a restrained foreign policy guided by a firm but modest version of the national interest? (One might extend the list to include, for example, “internal improvements” or infrastructure spending to stimulate commerce and unite the nation, and judges prepared to be activist in order to defend the Constitution.) If not in Mr. Trump’s dreams, you would have to turn to the pre-Cold War GOP, which reached its heyday at the turn of the 20th century and in the 1920s, but whose (declining) influence extended at least to the Eisenhower and Nixon Administrations.

It’s not that Trump consciously set out to return the GOP to its roots. There is very little evidence of that, other than some expressed interest in Nixon. It’s more like his reading of the political situation led him to retrace some of the old GOP’s reasoning, and arrive independently at some policies similar to its own. In fact, he may now have arrived at a point where some acquaintance with the party’s history and principles may help illuminate his administration’s own way forward; and for well-wishers and critics alike, the knowledge could be helpful.

The party of William McKinley and Calvin Coolidge dominated national politics. In the 72 years between Abraham Lincoln’s first election and Herbert Hoover’s loss to Franklin Roosevelt in 1932, only two Democrats were elected president. Between them, Grover Cleveland and Woodrow Wilson racked up 16 years of Democratic presidencies, versus 56 years of Republican ones. That’s a staggering 40-year advantage. Republicans’ control of Congress started strong but became episodic in the late 19th century, only to steady again after McKinley’s victory in 1896. Overall, the GOP controlled both houses of Congress for about 46 of the 72 years. By these measures, the old GOP, the national majority party for decades, achieved far more power and popularity than the modern, conservatized party ever has.

Those halcyon days of power and popularity coincided with the party’s embrace of the Trump-like policies mentioned above. Which doesn’t prove that these policies caused that political success, needless to say. Many other factors figured in, like the little matter of the Democratic Party’s discrediting itself for decades by its support of slavery, secession, and Jim Crow. Still, a glance at the old GOP’s rationales for these policies may reveal something.

Protectionism

Tariffs played a central role in American politics for most of its history, because they played a central role in funding the government. Before the income tax, tariffs were usually the federal government’s chief source of revenue. One of the Lincoln Administration’s first acts was to pass a tariff bill; and afterward, until Hoover’s administration, at least, the Republicans remained the party of high tariffs. They inherited their support for protective tariffs from their predecessors in the Whig Party, who stood for Henry Clay’s “American system” of protection and internal improvements, and who had in turn inherited their protectionism from the Federalist Party and its leading economic thinker, Alexander Hamilton. In his “Report on Manufactures” (1791), Hamilton first spelled out the argument for tariffs on imported manufactured goods as a way to stimulate infant industries and thus a balanced, interdependent, and more dynamic American economy.

The economic case for protectionism has always been thin, of course, and from Adam Smith to Milton Friedman great economists have preached the disadvantages of high tariffs, and their typically self-defeating consequences. The interesting thing is that Hamilton and his Republican descendents knew all that. He had read The Wealth of Nations, and agreed, as a matter of economic theory, that free trade was the superior policy. He restated some of the objections to excessive tariffs in The Federalist: they are “prejudicial” to the revenue itself; “they tend to render other classes of the community tributary to an improper degree to the manufacturing classes, to whom they give a premature monopoly of the markets; they sometimes force industry out of its more natural channels into others in which it flows with less advantage.” In today’s language, picking winners and losers, crony capitalism, raising prices for domestic consumers, losing tax revenue by setting the tax rate too high—he was aware of all these downsides.

Yet he favored a policy of protection, nonetheless, because he thought the political reasons for it outweighed its economic drawbacks and reinforced some of its salutary political-economic effects. In Hamilton’s day and until the Civil War, at least, these overriding political reasons included stimulating an American armaments industry and merchant marine, encouraging the interdependence of South and North so as to cement the Union, stimulating inventive genius and entrepreneurial risk-taking, weakening the power of the nation’s vast agricultural faction, and, in particular, lessening the economic and political might of slave-based agriculture.

After the Civil War, the Republican Party continued to follow the protectionist logic, though with a few modifications. The slave-power was no longer a threat, but European empires had expanded in Africa and Asia, introducing new threats to national security, as well as new competition and terms of trade to ever more globalized trade flows. Tariff policy became controversial within the GOP, though the issue was seldom whether to have tariffs but how high they should be and what imports they should affect. American agriculture sank into a prolonged depression after the war, adding an industry that needed protection but also one increasingly unable to pay higher prices for manufactures and other protected goods.

One of the classic GOP statements of the wisdom and justice of protectionism occurs in the party platform of 1896, the year of McKinley’s big victory:

We renew and emphasize our allegiance to the policy of protection, as the bulwark of American industrial independence, and the foundation of American development and prosperity. This true American policy taxes foreign products and encourages home industry. It puts the burden of revenue on foreign goods; it secures the American market for the American producer. It upholds the American standard of wages for the American workingman…. We demand such an equitable tariff on foreign imports which come into competition with American products as will not only furnish adequate revenue for the necessary expenses of the government, but will protect American labor from degradation and the wage level of other lands.

The platform specified that protection went with “reciprocity,” meaning that “protection for what we produce” should go hand in hand with “free admission for the necessaries of life which we do not produce.” The idea was to “gain open markets for us [i.e., for our surplus] in return for our open markets for others” in goods not produced at home. Free trade and protectionism could be combined in a statesmanlike package.

In 1924, the year of Coolidge’s big victory, the Republican platform reiterated, “We believe in protection as a national policy, with due and equal regard to all sections and to all classes.” The goal was to assure “American standards of life” to farmers, workers, and manufacturers alike, so that American families would not be forced to endure globalized low wages and low safety standards. The tariff, according to the GOP, brought economic confidence, stability, and employment sufficient to maintain the middle class as the basis of American republicanism, and without a huge federal welfare state.

Products taxed and tax rates would fluctuate. The nation’s first tariff under the Constitution, the revenue Tariff of 1789, had average rates of 8% on listed articles. Lincoln’s war-time tariffs raised rates to 48% on dutiable items. The highest modern duties ever came in the Smoot-Hawley tariff, passed under Hoover, which set dutiable rates at 59% and led to a trade war and a deepening of the Depression its supporters had hoped to ameliorate. These were the kind of negative effects from an “excessive” tariff that Hamilton, following Smith, had warned against.

Donald Trump, in his Inaugural Address, became the first Republican president to speak favorably of “protection” in a long time. He used the term in a broad sense, not limited to high tariffs, asserting that we must “protect our borders” from economic invasion, that we are “protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement,” and perhaps most memorably, that “we will be protected by God.” The Great Protector is not necessarily a protectionist, of course. But Trump’s assurance that “Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength,” despite flying in the face of several generations’ worth of conservative Republican orthodoxy, not to mention the disaster of Smoot-Hawley, harks back to a moral-political argument once vital to the party of Lincoln: that in setting economic policy, Americans should be considered not merely as consumers and producers but also as citizens, who have a democracy to maintain.

Immigration

Here too Trump’s positions are more old-school than they may seem. In 1860 the Republican Party platform opposed the nativism of the former Know-Nothing Party, which had called for the exclusion of Germans and (Irish) Catholics from public office. The GOP opposed any change in federal or state laws “by which the rights of citizens hitherto accorded to immigrants from foreign lands shall be abridged or impaired.” By 1872 the party took a stand for “continued careful encouragement and protection of voluntary immigration,” taking exception explicitly to “the doctrine of Great Britain and other European powers concerning allegiance—‘Once a subject always a subject.’” The Republicans insisted that allegiance was voluntary, on both the foreigner’s part who wanted to become an American, and the U.S.’s part, which was being asked to receive and naturalize the immigrant.

The latter consideration, especially after the mass immigration of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, led Republicans to expound on what kind of immigrants America should be looking for. The 1920 platform put it this way:

The standard of living and the standard of citizenship of a nation are its most precious possessions, and the preservation and the elevation of those standards is the first duty of government. The immigration policy of the U.S. should…insure that the number of foreigners in the country at any one time shall not exceed that which can be assimilated with reasonable rapidity, and to favor immigrants whose standards are similar to ours.

Unexceptionable perhaps in theory, in practice those standards could be interpreted in capricious and tendentious ways, e.g., as in the nation’s then existing policy “for the practical exclusion of Asiatic immigrants,” which the platform approved. Such sentiments were strengthened by the racial science—or scientific racism—of the day, which many leaders of the Progressive movement in politics and education (e.g., Woodrow Wilson) regarded as settled science. To be sure, what we might call race science-deniers, many of them Republicans, were part of the public debate then; but there were plenty of Republican Progressives who had views similar to Wilson’s. It was a mixed bag, but the mixture was better than the Democrats had on offer. At the 1924 Democratic convention, the largest bloc of delegates belonged to the Ku Klux Klan, whose favored candidate, ultimately unsuccessful and not himself a KKK member, was William McAdoo, Wilson’s son-in-law.

In general, however, the GOP’s insistence on assimilation and Americanization of immigrants reflected the common sense of the social contract, as articulated by Lincoln and many others before and after him. In that view, joining a country was like joining a private club—it had to be voluntary on both sides, with standards of membership agreed to by all. In the U.S. these standards, applied on an individual basis, amounted to little more than minimal good health, English proficiency, and basic civic knowledge and loyalty. Applied on a group basis, however, the standards judged not actual civic knowledge and loyalty but the group’s purported propensity or capacity to acquire such virtues. Though more problematic, such generalizations could never be completely excluded from practical immigration policy. The 1924 immigration reform act—controversial at the time, and since—imposed limitations on maximum immigration and a new series of national-origins quotas, resulting in a long pause in mass immigration to the U.S., and establishing a policy favoring applicants, at reduced levels, from European nations already well represented in the U.S. population.

No individual alien, nor any alien group (race, religion, ethnicity, nationality, tribe), had therefore a right to come to America, much less to become citizens, without the consent of the American people through their government. And it was never doubted that “[e]very government,” in the words of the 1920 platform, had the right and power “to exclude and deport those aliens who constitute a real menace to its peaceful existence.”

Trump’s concern for our borders and caution about admitting alien enemies to America are consistent with these premises. As his focus shifted from Muslims as a group to immigrants from particular countries racked with “radical Islamic terrorism,” as he called it in his Inaugural, he revisited, in effect, some of the arguments that energized and divided the Republican Party and the nation early last century. Far-removed from open-borders libertarianism and from multicultural identity politics, Trump’s nationalism, his insistence on “America First,” points in this respect back beyond the Republican Party to the small-r republicanism of America’s beginnings.

Foreign Policy

What does America first mean for foreign policy? Trump said little about foreign policy in his first address as president, except to deny the isolationism critics inferred from the slogan. There was no hint of Charles Lindbergh in Trump’s pledge “to reinforce old alliances and form new ones—and unite the civilized world” against the Islamist terror movements, which he vowed to eradicate. That very day Trump had a bust of Winston Churchill (Lindbergh’s bête noire, as William McGurn pointed out in the Wall Street Journal) returned to a place of honor in the Oval Office. He acknowledged, perhaps more emphatically than necessary, “the right of all nations to put their own interests first.” His kind of American exceptionalism, he said, seeks not “to impose our way of life” but “to let it shine as an example…for everyone to follow. ”

He set his face, unmistakably, against the neoconservatives’ mad strategy of exporting democracy to the most inhospitable corners of the world, and against the sentiments and swagger of George W. Bush’s Second Inaugural. By the same token, Trump smiled on some of the weightier themes of traditional American statecraft, and of Republican statecraft a century or more ago. In 1896 the GOP declared elegantly, “Our foreign policy should be at all times firm, vigorous, and dignified, and all our interests in the Western hemisphere should be carefully watched and guarded.” The platform proceeded to discuss those interests, invoke the Monroe Doctrine, call for the protection of American citizens and American property abroad, and offer sympathy and indignation on behalf of the Armenians and other oppressed peoples. In 1924, the Republicans stated: “The basic principles of our foreign policy must be independence without indifference to the rights and necessities of others, and cooperation without entangling alliances.” That meant no part of the League of Nations, but a surprising trust in international arbitration and disarmament conferences.

By the 1920s, the party’s foreign policy was more Progressive than it had been in 1896. But it still demanded, first and foremost, the protection of American interests and security. The advancement of self-government in other nations, though desirable, was not our business, except through the power of the American example or, temporarily, through the administration of conquered territory like the Philippines. World War II and the Cold War changed things, but Trump’s assumption seems to be that the conditions of international relations—with the big exception of Islamist terrorism—have returned to something like the pre-Cold War norm.

The Business of America

When in 1920 Warren Harding announced that his party sought to return the nation to “normalcy,” he meant to liberate Americans from the wartime strictures imposed and never relaxed by the Wilson Administration. The government had remained on a war-time basis, exercising emergency powers to restrict speech and free assembly; tax exorbitantly; socialize the railroads, telegraph, and telephone lines; and to regulate what it did not socialize. Harding and the Republican Congress unwound most of this “unconstitutional and dictatorial course,” in the words of the 1920 platform, returning the nation to a peace-time basis; and his successor Coolidge continued the effort, slashing both government spending and income tax rates in a supply-side frenzy.

The 1920s roared because business boomed in reaction to Republican policies. Trump is not only our first billionaire president, he is the first famous businessman since Herbert Hoover to be elected to the office. He brings with him the ethos and enthusiasm not merely of a tycoon but of a business evangelist. (Reagan was a former Hollywood star, not businessman, despite all the nice things he said about them.) Trump’s belief in the know-how and nobility of business opens a huge cultural gulf between him and modern liberalism, especially its mandarins in the academy and the media. Republicans, by contrast, usually admire business leaders, and Republican presidents typically stock their cabinet with them. (Eisenhower’s cabinet, the jibe went, consisted of “eight millionaires and one plumber.”) To find full-throated support for something like the Trump ethos, however, it helps to go back to the Republicans of the 1920s, and particularly to the one who supposedly pronounced what could be Trump’s motto, “The business of America is business.”

That would be Calvin Coolidge, though his words are misquoted. What he actually said was, “After all, the chief business of the American people is business. They are profoundly concerned with producing, buying, selling, investing and prospering in the world.” The chief business is not the only, nor the highest, business of the American people, though liberal historians and journalists have deliberately misinterpreted Coolidge’s meaning, the better to tar his character and career. Thus Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.: “But, for Coolidge, business was more than business; it was a religion; and to it he committed all the passion of his arid nature.” Or William Allen White: “Coolidge exalts the ideals of the peddler, the horse trader, the captain of industry…. [He has] a mystic faith in the righteousness of a swap.” Trump’s detractors have said worse about him.

Schlesinger and other New Deal apologists invested heavily in the thesis that the 1920s were an orgy of moneymaking, a one-percenter’s delight, which brought an inevitable correction and retribution in the 1930s—bad economics, but bestselling history. In fact, Coolidge Prosperity was rapid and widespread, bringing radios, automobiles, and rising incomes to families throughout the land.

Yet to the mainstream media of the New Deal era, Coolidge was, as Thomas B. Silver wrote, “the unlikely pimp” for a prostituted generation. Now, there could hardly be two more different characters than Coolidge and Trump, Silent Cal and the Tweeter-in-Chief, however much their tax policies may coincide. It is instructive to wonder how far their differences may extend to the ultimate valuation they put on business and moneymaking. Here is Coolidge, from the same speech in which he described the chief business of the American people:

Wealth is the product of industry, ambition, character and untiring effort. In all experience, the accumulation of wealth means the multiplication of schools, the increase of knowledge, the dissemination of intelligence, the encouragement of science, the broadening of outlook, the expansion of liberties, the widening of culture. Of course, the accumulation of wealth cannot be justified as the chief end of existence. But we are compelled to recognize it is a means to well-nigh every desirable achievement. So long as wealth is made the means and not the end, we need not greatly fear it.

Coolidge made the same point in many other addresses. Here is a pointed passage putting the captains of industry, whom Coolidge allegedly worshipped, in proper perspective:

Great captains of industry who have aroused the wonder of the world by their financial success would not have been captains at all had it not been for the generations of liberal culture in the past and the existence all about them of a society permeated, inspired, and led by the liberal culture of the present. If it were possible to strike out that factor from present existence, he would find all the value of his great possessions diminish to the vanishing point, and he himself would be but a barbarian among barbarians.

We haven’t seen anything like that tribute to liberal education from Trump, and probably won’t. Yet this was an understanding that men of immense wealth and intelligence like Andrew Carnegie, or Coolidge’s Treasury secretary, Andrew Mellon, shared. Business involved the pursuit of gain, but it could minister to higher ends. “It rests squarely on the law of service,” Coolidge once said. “It has for its main reliance truth and faith and justice. In its larger sense it is one of the great contributing forces to the moral and spiritual advancement” of the nation.

Then and Now

As the example of Coolidge suggests, the similarities between Trump’s agenda and sensibility and those of the historic Republican Party have to be balanced by the many differences. McKinley and Coolidge were deeply experienced political men; Trump, though a fast learner, is an amateur. Although Hoover’s first elected office was president, too, unlike Trump he had served as secretary of Commerce and as the “Napoleon of Mercy,” bringer of emergency relief to Europe, Russia, and the lower Mississippi River. The GOP in those days was a much stronger political force. The party was superior to the candidate then, and the Constitution was regarded as superior to both; nowadays a candidate like Trump, or Obama, can bring his party to heel, and neither major party, nor any major candidate, has to wonder very much about getting the Constitution’s permission before setting out to transform America.

By contrast, in 1912 the Republicans waged a civil war between the supporters of William Howard Taft, the incumbent president, and Teddy Roosevelt (who lost, and then bolted to run as a Bull Moose Progressive), over what the Constitution required of modern Americans. T.R., borrowing a page from the late People’s Party (the original populists), endorsed the spirit of direct democracy in state-level use of the initiative, referendum, and recall, extending even to the legislative override of state Supreme Court decisions. He did not have a good reason why something similar might not be tried at the national level. He already, as Taft’s predecessor, had taken a very expansive view of presidential power. This inclination alarmed Taft, Henry Cabot Lodge, and many of T.R.’s old party friends and allies, who denounced him as a threat to the Constitution. Though Taft lost the presidency to Wilson, he managed to preserve the Republican Party as the future home for non-, and even anti-, Progressive politics.

Thus both the conservative movement of William F. Buckley and Ronald Reagan, and Trump’s insurgency against their successors, depend in a distant way on Taft’s achievement. But neither the movement nor its singular critic is as steeped in constitutionalism as the old, pre-Cold War Republicans were. Among other things, they founded the National Association for Constitutional Government, which published the Constitutional Review from 1917 to 1929, arguing against Progressivism in the name of the old constitutional order. (There is now a good book on this subject, Toward an American Conservatism: Constitutional Conservatism during the Progressive Era [2013], edited by Joseph Postell and Johnathan O’Neill.) Their efforts, and the GOP’s “return to normalcy” during the ’20s, were swept away by the Depression and the New Deal landslides of the ’30s.

What’s interesting is why, when Buckley and company decided to found modern conservatism in the 1950s, they didn’t recur to the historic Republican formulas of McKinley, Taft, and Coolidge, not to mention Lincoln. Hoover was alive and played a role, mostly ceremonial, in the launching of National Review. But the new conservatives paid little attention to the pre-New Deal Republicans. They were far more interested in the Burkean cultural criticism of Irving Babbitt, the sectionalism and communitarianism of the Southern Agrarians, the “philosophical anarchism” of Albert Jay Nock, and the Nietzschean anti-populism of H.L. Mencken.

Perhaps Buckley thought that, as Trump might say, the old GOP formulas had proved such political losers that a revival was impossible; or he suspected that their opposition to the New Deal revolution had been insufficiently anti-statist. Or maybe he concluded that a return to normalcy was simply inadequate to the problems of the Cold War world, which made any hint of a modest foreign policy, much less of America First-style isolationism (always a slippery word), untenable.

Whatever the reasons, the conservative movement spent decades debating traditionalism versus libertarianism, and neoconservatism versus everybody, and not concentrating on the business before it, as it were: how to get back to the Constitution, to a responsible if hardly perfect form of popular self-government based on American standards. Trump captured the resulting American way of life rather nicely in his Inaugural Address: “When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.”

Bypassing most of the existing conservative interests, Donald Trump may be in a position, paradoxically, to reconnect conservatism and the GOP to their American roots, and to renew them for the next generation. Much depends, therefore, on how he, his administration, and the people come to terms with his Republican patrimony.",1,http://www.claremont.org/crb/article/the-republican-trump/
93,Andrews,Helen,weeklystandard,"Dante puts Pontius Pilate in the outermost circle of Hell, among the indolent—scant punishment, you might think, for the man who executed Jesus Christ. By letting Pilate off easy, Dante was situating himself firmly on one side of a centuries-old debate: Who was more responsible for killing Christ, the Roman government or the Sanhedrin? It should be obvious, then, why any author trying to write a sympathetic biography of Pilate needs to tread carefully. Every particle of guilt taken off Pilate inevitably winds up added in the scales against the Jews.

The Italian classicist Aldo Schiavone does his best to avoid this fraught dilemma by confining himself to the facts that we know about Pilate the historical figure. And we do know a great deal about him, compared with other figures mentioned in the Gospels. His name was added to the creed—not at the Council of Nicaea but at Constantinople, 50 years later—precisely in order to emphasize that the crucifixion was a matter not of legend but of historical fact. Tacitus, Josephus, and Philo all mention him by name, and in 1961 archaeologists uncovered a fragmentary stone inscription in Caesarea reading in part, unmistakably: [PO]NTIUS PILATUS / [PRAEF]ECTUS IUDA[EAE].

He would have been about 40 when he arrived in Judaea in 26 a.d., after a career that probably included a military command, as was typical for one of the equestrian order. He held office there for 10 years—an unusually long time, suggesting that the emperor Tiberius was pleased with his service. What happened to Pilate after he was recalled to Rome is not known, but Schiavone concludes that he must have been dead or retired by the year 40, given the contemptuous way Philo and Herod Agrippa write of him in their letters to Caligula. If Pilate had been in any position to fight back at the time, men so ""extremely sensitive to shifting balances"" at the imperial court ""would have been much more guarded.""

In addition to the things we know about Pilate, there are the things we know that just ain't so. He never washed his hands while proclaiming ""I am innocent of this man's blood,"" according to Schiavone, who calls this fabulation ""the zero point in the genealogy of Christian anti-Semitism."" Handwashing was a specifically Jewish gesture, foreign to Roman culture; and in any case, Pilate would hardly have wanted to emphasize his powerlessness before his own subjects—especially with six years of ruling them left to go. The incident appears only in the gospel of Matthew, the same gospel that features such embellishments as Pilate's wife warning him not to have anything to do with Jesus because she had seen him the previous night in a dream. Wives rarely accompanied prefects on their postings, so it is unlikely that she was even in Jerusalem.

More controversially, Schiavone argues that there was never any crowd baying for the prisoner's execution. The shouts of ""Crucify him!"" came not from a multitude but from the same small delegation that had escorted Jesus to the palace. This is a claim with theological implications, since Christian political theorists have long rested their case against democracy on the fickleness of the crowd that cheered Jesus into the city one day and called for his death the next.

Schiavone gives three reasons for doubting that version. First, there was no square big enough for an assembly outside the Praetorium, only a small courtyard. Second, the gospel he considers most reliable (John) assigns the cry to ""the chief priests and the guards""—with no mention of the crowd described in Matthew, whose embroidery of the Passion tale has already been noted. Third, the temple guard had arrested Jesus in the middle of the night in order to avoid popular outcry in his favor. Why, just a few hours later, would the high priests reverse themselves and mobilize a crowd?

Roman law is Schiavone's specialty, so he is able to demonstrate that the procedure that led to Jesus' execution could in no sense be described as a trial. The interrogation, the presentation of witnesses, and the final judgment conform to no legal framework we know of, Roman or Judaic. This means that Pilate's decision was a political act, which is to say that it could have gone either way.

Schiavone mentions two precedents that would have been on Pilate's mind, both known to us from Josephus. In the first, from the very beginning of his tenure, Pilate backed down and removed offensive imperial banners from Jerusalem after civil disobedience threatened to corner him into ordering a massacre. In the second, he commanded Roman soldiers to use lethal force to put down a riot over misuse of temple funds. Together, the two stories reveal a politician skilled in navigating Jewish public opinion—sometimes giving way to it and, at other times, standing firm.

In the case of Jesus, Pilate's preference would have been to let the prisoner go. This explains his ploy with Barabbas, and also his most famous line. ""What is truth?"" is a question that bears multiple interpretations. Nietzsche read it as ""the noble scorn of a Roman before whom an impudent misuse of the word 'truth' was carried on."" But Schiavone makes a convincing case that Pilate was genuinely baffled and amazed by his curious prisoner. He had been led by the Sanhedrin to expect a political rabble-rouser, but Jesus did not fit that type at all. The long interrogation shows Pilate testing the limits of his pagan imagination, and his questions indicate his dawning realization that Jesus represents something beyond his comprehension.

Which, if anything, makes Pilate's guilt the greater. He knew that Jesus was something more than an inconvenient agitator who had threatened the local elite, and he crucified him anyway.

From the December 7, 2015, issue of NR

The progressive resurgence that began sometime between Brendan Eich’s resignation from Mozilla and the burning down of the Ferguson QuikTrip has turned into something more than just another turn around the culture-war maypole. When the Confederate flag came down over the state capitol in Columbia — South Carolina! — that was a portent. When TV Land pulled The Dukes of Hazzard from its broadcast lineup over the roof decal on the General Lee, that was another. A cable channel that shows four hours a day of Gunsmoke reruns is not the Berkeley sociology department. Then the Memphis city council crossed the crucial messing-with-corpses threshold, voting in July to exhume from a public park, and relocate, the remains of a Confederate general and his wife. Two weeks later, protesters calling themselves the Commission on Religion and Racism attacked the grave with shovels because the contaminating couple had not been removed fast enough. Next time, said the ringleader, “we are going to bring the backhoe.”

College students were on summer vacation while these stories were unfolding, but obviously the campus Left was not about to yield its place in the vanguard of political correctness to the likes of the Memphis city council. The first campus to erupt once midterms were over was Yale, where, in default of more serious grievances, activists had fixated on making sure no one’s Halloween costume featured a culturally insensitive sombrero, kimono, or feathered headdress. On November 5, about a hundred students were gathered on the main quad chalking slogans (“Our culture is not a costume”) on the sidewalk when the dean passed by. He stopped to listen and ended up staying for three hours. “Please know that I have heard your stories and I’ll leave here changed,” he assured them. Flushed with this success, a group of students returning to one dorm tried the same gambit on their house master, who, like the dean, just happened to be walking by. But Master Nicholas Christakis refused to be cowed. His display of spine sent one girl into a meltdown, and camera-phone video of her rant found its way onto YouTube and from there into the New York Times.

After the scare comes the shakedown. The following Thursday, a coalition of student groups handed Yale’s president a list of demands ranging from the rococo to the baldly mercenary. In addition to things such as an ethnic-studies course requirement and the abolition of “master” as an administrative title, they asked for each cultural center on campus to get a $2 million top-up. That same day, a sit-in surrounded the Georgetown president’s office and pledged not to disband until, among other things, the university funded an endowment to recruit more “black identifying” professors. On other campuses, apologies were a popular request. Amherst Uprising, which posted its demands online, specified that President Biddy Martin must submit her apology for the racist nature of the school’s mascot “by Friday, November 13th, 2015 by 5:00pm” — no extensions! The ConcernedStudent1950 group at the University of Missouri specified that President Tim Wolfe’s apology should be handwritten. In the event, they got more than that — Wolfe resigned, as did Mizzou chancellor R. Bowen Loftin. Dean Mary Spellman of Claremont McKenna College was forced to resign after writing in an e-mail, by way of underlining her eagerness to meet with a Latina student who had sent her an op-ed about racism on campus, that “we are working on how we can better serve students, especially those that don’t fit our CMC mold” (emphasis added).

These convulsions have put some in mind of the campus unrest of the 1960s. In fact, they fit a much older pattern.

Not since environmentalism has the prevailing variety of leftism more closely resembled a religion. John McWhorter calls it Antiracism — “it seriously merits capitalization at this point” — and notes that it has its own clergy in such men as Charles Blow and Ta-Nehisi Coates (friendly vicar and hellfire preacher, respectively). Casting his net more widely to include all talk of “privilege,” from male to cisgender, essayist Joseph Bottum has observed that the concept is functionally equivalent to original sin. “I have to every day wake up and acknowledge that I am so deeply embedded with racist thoughts and notions and actions in my body that I have to choose every day to do anti-racist work and think in an anti-racist way,” said a graduate student whom Bottum was able to locate, sounding for all the world like a Calvinist explaining the T in TULIP. No wonder the guest lectureship that Yale offered #BlackLivesMatter quad-botherer DeRay Mckesson was in the divinity school.

Leftism has become a religion, and what we are seeing now is a revival.

Leftism has become a religion, and what we are seeing now is a revival. The revivalists testify from behind megaphones instead of pulpits and in “safe spaces” instead of country churches, but they stand squarely within the American tradition of converts who spread their gospel by bearing their witness. The way they keep bursting into tears is a clue. The Yale chalkers cried when they confronted the dean, the ranting girl cried when she confronted Christakis, audience members cried during a perfectly ordinary Yale Political Union debate on affirmative action. Ferguson was the same way. “There were a lot of people who were angry, a lot of people crying,” one protester recalled of Michael Brown’s funeral week. “There were a lot of people with backpacks and books saying the revolution is starting.” (That final dash of millennialism is entirely appropriate.) This is not a sign of fragility; this is part of the attraction.

Like the First and Second Great Awakenings, this revival spreads like a contagion on the strength of remarkable stories. In the days of Jonathan Edwards, a preacher could set the Connecticut River valley aflame by telling of mass conversions up in Northampton or a miraculous healing in Plainfield or a notorious free-thinker who had suddenly arrived at salvation over in Braintree. Edwards himself got a lot of mileage out of the incredible conversion story of his youngest congregant, Phebe Bartlet, age four. Some of these stories omitted certain deflating details (the mass conversions had been prompted by an outbreak of disease, say), and some are hard to credit. But there is not a single story in the annals of either Great Awakening, not a blind man restored to sight or a cripple made to dance the Highland jig, that strains credulity as much as the idea that on October 24, 2015, the Ku Klux Klan snuck into the third-floor bathroom of a Mizzou dormitory in order to paint a poop swastika on the wall.

The enthusiasm for personal denunciation that sets the present eruption apart from the usual PC background noise is a trademark of American revivals, too. When colonial congregations invited George Whitefield to preach for them, they quickly learned to ask in advance that he not sow dissension by denouncing local worthies by name. No one bothered asking Charles Grandison Finney to stick to generalities. One reason Finney was the most popular revivalist of the Second Great Awakening was that his audiences derived a certain frisson from knowing he would call out by name any deacon he’d heard was an adulterer and any shopkeeper he’d heard saying “dammit” in the street. An ordinary preacher who noticed an overdressed woman in the pews might pointedly take the day’s reading from Proverbs 31 and leave it at that. Finney glared at the unfortunate woman and asked her, in front of everyone, “Did you come in here to divide the worship of God’s house, to make people worship you?” Recounting the story in his memoir, he notes, “This made her writhe.”

Finney acted as if it were some great methodological breakthrough that he “said ‘you’ instead of preaching about sin and sinners and saying ‘they.’” He was more proud of it than of his more famous innovation, the “anxious bench.” But it’s not as if other preachers didn’t know that they could call down the 19th-century equivalent of a Twitterstorm on any parishioner they wanted. They just didn’t think it would be tactful. Tact, that pillar of decency, is not a principle so much as a truce. To break it, a person needs only to believe that he and his ideas are more important than other people. We all do this sometimes in the flush of passion — and sometimes we do it legitimately. When entire nations do it simultaneously — when bakers and tech CEOs and private conversations between NBA team owners and their mistresses are all placed outside the protection of civilized norms of live and let live — it is a sign that the flush has become a fever.

What is behind all this? The same factors that gave us the late-’90s campus tantrum are partly to blame, since most have continued unchanged or gotten worse. Nothing paves the way for PC like ignorance, and the farther removed we get from the last generation to receive a proper education, the more ignorant college students become. Millennials have no idea that the rule of law and the presumption of innocence are older and more important concepts than intersectionality and white privilege. To them, they’re all just phrases that somebody made up, sometime before yesterday. They glibly refer to Amherst’s “legacy of oppression” and Yale’s “history of institutionalized racism,” but they cannot explain what they mean by those phrases. As far as I can tell, they just mean an institution existed prior to 1980. They are also more ignorant than ever of life outside the upper middle class, thanks to the increasing self-segregation of the classes that Charles Murray has identified in Coming Apart, and this ignorance leaves them ready to believe the most outlandish things about the marginalized groups they claim to champion. Sometimes when your cousin tells you he was literally minding his own business when the cop started hassling him you let it pass to spare his dignity, but these Belmont kids omit the grain of salt.

One new development is how easily administrators are caving. Why did the Yale girl’s expletive-filled tirade result in an apology from Christakis (“I’m genuinely sorry to have disappointed you. I’ve disappointed myself”) and not her immediate rustication? The rising college price tag surely has something to do with it: Students paying $50,000 a year feel entitled to throw their weight around. But the activists have also benefited from the same loophole that has protected every revival in American history: They can’t condemn you for getting serious about beliefs that everyone else is supposed to share.

There is not a single item on the Yale demand list that would be shocking to read in the alumni bulletin. Increased funding for mental-health services, naming the new residential hall after a person of color — did radicals write this or did the development office? A Georgetown professor spoke for more than just Catholics when he said of the sit-in, “This is what I teach.” People who are abnormally intense about their beliefs tend to make their co-religionists feel ashamed, but there is a world of difference between being a fanatic they are ashamed of and a purist they are shamed by. The latter is a sweet spot occupied by saints, prophets, holy fools — and now, social-justice warriors.

RELATED: The Ululations of Radical Campus Crybabies

That is why there is a limit to how much can be gleaned from listening to what these activists say. Their slogans are drawn from the ideological air supply. They seize on whatever grievances are closest to hand simply for the sake of having a grievance. If it weren’t one damn thing, it’d be another — as can be seen from the way the latest contagion has jumped from campus to campus regardless of local conditions. The driving compulsion to complain is the phenomenon here, not the complaints.

New enthusiasm for an old message seems to come out of nowhere, unconnected to anything like a war or a national crisis — people just get religion all of a sudden.

This is also typical of revivals. By definition, a revival has no obvious cause. New enthusiasm for an old message seems to come out of nowhere, unconnected to anything like a war or a national crisis — people just get religion all of a sudden. Christian historians who have examined the underlying causes of revivals have been obliged to admit that, in a sense, their proximate cause is the Holy Spirit. In the same way, sympathizers claim that campus radicalism is fully explained by the reality of structural racism. But something makes revivals occur at one time and not another. Let us grant that the Holy Spirit (or the spirit of social justice, in this case) lights the flame. Something else piles up the tinder.

When emotions run this high, there is usually fear in back of it. Today’s college students have been raised to believe that they must navigate the world without assuming any shared values or bonds of community with anyone they meet, and that is enough to scare anyone. Attempts to quantify the Millennial mindset have uncovered a generation that is isolated (single people outnumbered married ones for the first time in 2014, and an increasing share of personal interactions are conducted online instead of face-to-face) and untrusting (Gallup and Harvard polls show rock-bottom trust in churches, Congress, the professions, and every other established authority in America). In her memoir, Lena Dunham quotes a friend complaining of a no-good ex, “How could someone who cares so much about social justice care so little about my feelings?” What I hear in that quote is a girl who is desperate for something, anything, that can serve as a reliable guide to who is a good person. Not an unreasonable thing to want in a world where you feel that no one’s good faith can be taken for granted.

Certifying that someone is a trustworthy person is precisely the role that evangelical religion served in the Second Great Awakening. It is no coincidence that the “burned-over district,” where Finney and his fellow revivalists had their greatest successes, was in upstate New York after the advent of the Erie Canal. The explosion of trade meant that people moved around a lot more. Towns such as Rochester started seeing population turnover of 80 percent in six years, and diaries of the period are full of complaints that you just don’t know whom it’s safe to do business with anymore. At the same time, cottage industry was being replaced by the factory model, which meant that instead of living in their masters’ houses as boarders, employees now lived in their own houses and their own neighborhoods. These two changes left the average upstate New Yorker’s social world suddenly denuded of people he felt confident he could trust.

The other common thread linking the various American revivals is the sudden disappearance of a longstanding mark of adulthood. The First Great Awakening started among the first generation of young New Englanders to be told that there was not enough land available for them to be given their own plots when they came of age. The Second Great Awakening coincided with a bigger upheaval than a land shortage: the final demise of the Jeffersonian dream. It used to be that even an unambitious worker expected to end his life on a homestead of his own.

Something similar is happening in our present culture. A college degree used to certify that a person had “made it,” but it no longer does. The result is status anxiety — which helps fuel the revival.

If this latest spasm really is a kind of revival, is that a bad thing? To judge by their after-effects, revivals seem at first glance to be highly salutary. The First Great Awakening gave us the American Revolution, inasmuch as it was the first truly national event in the country that would become the United States, and the sense of common identity it forged would later flower into patriotism. As for the Second Great Awakening, it ended slavery. Abolitionism was in many ways merely a sequel to Finneyite revivalism, having taken from revivalism its personnel, its institutions (such as Oberlin), and its methods. The emotional excitement that the revivals inspired also whetted the northern public’s appetite for other forms of avocational righteousness that could provide the same moral thrill.

#related#If each bout of national soul-searching translated into one chit labeled “resolve,” good for the elimination of one national evil, that would be a mark in revivalism’s favor. But really it was just a lucky fluke that the radicals of the 1830s had such a monumental evil to turn their sights on. If slavery had been abolished earlier, there just would have been that many more campaigners against Sunday mail, that many more members of the Oneida commune.

In his History of American Revivals (1904), Frank G. Beardsley calls the awakening that took place in the 1850s “a Providential Preparation for the Civil War.” “As the Great Awakening enabled the feeble colonies to pass through the baptismal fires of the American Revolution,” he explained, “so the Great Revival of 1857–58 served to prepare the people and sustain them in the fearful cataclysm.” In making a comparison to the revivals of Jonathan Edwards and George Whitefield, Beardsley ignored the biggest difference between the two, a difference that makes any resemblance between our current moment and a religious revival cause for worry instead of hope. The First Great Awakening knitted a country together. The Second tore one apart.

95,Andrews,Helen,firstthings,"Toussaint Louverture: A Revolutionary Life

by philippe girard

basic books, 352 pages, $29.99

The Virginia planter and Fire-Eater Edmund Ruffin, who in 1865 blew his brains out rather than live under Yankee rule, called Toussaint Louverture “the only truly great man yet known of the negro race.” In his assessment of the man, if not the race, he was joined by William Wordsworth, Frederick Douglass, and Ralph Waldo Emerson. At a time when most slaves in French Saint-Domingue were illiterate, Louverture was well-read enough to accuse his rivals of practicing “Machiavellism” and Napoleon of hounding him as the Romans hounded Hannibal. He was a more impressive figure than our own Founding Fathers in at least three respects: He had been a slave for most of his life; he was a famously devout Christian; and his accomplishment remains unmatched to this day, for the Haitian Revolution is still the only successful slave revolt in history. And yet few Americans know his name.

The neglect of the Haitian Revolution cries out for explanation, and of course some have blamed racism. One anthropologist has claimed that the idea of black slaves seizing their own freedom has been for reactionary white historians “unthinkable.” In fact, it was the abolitionists who first scrubbed Haiti from the record. What they needed was a real-world example of emancipation leading to peace and prosperity, as their speculative arguments insisted it would, and this Haiti most definitely was not. William Wilberforce wrote to an ally in 1817 that it would be “better to keep Haiti in the background till it is better able to stand on its own legs”—a delicate way of referring to the country’s total collapse into blood-soaked anarchy. Haiti constituted a massive blow to the empirical (if not the moral) case for abolition. To compound the tragedy, it might well have become everything that Wilberforce and his friends desired, if only Louverture had lived.

Defenders of slavery in the French sugar colonies did not claim for the system any paternalistic benevolence, as did its defenders in the American South. The sweltering Caribbean bred no such high-mindedness. The white planters’ case rested on two points, both of them practical. The first was that emancipation would inaugurate a general massacre. The second was that it would be the end of productive agriculture on the islands, the particular needs of sugar cultivation being sadly incompatible with a free labor market. Most abolitionists dismissed the first argument (or, like Brissot, said that execution was no more than what slave-drivers deserved) and were indifferent to the second. As Philippe Girard shows in his fine new biography, Louverture accepted the basic validity of both concerns and made it his mission to disprove them, not just in theory but also in practice.

He was, first of all, the only rebel general to whom white families could safely surrender once the Haitian slave revolt began in 1791. The French Revolution had thrown the island into a state of political uncertainty, but uncertainty did not teeter into chaos for two years. The initial conflict was a three-way fight between royalists and republicans among the white population (40,000) and the free mulattos or gens de couleur (35,000), some of whom were already aiming at independence. Each faction threatened to raise the slaves (460,000) against their enemies, but no one was reckless enough to do it until a twenty-eight-year-old Jacobin fool named Sonthonax arrived from France with orders to establish himself as commissioner in the name of the National Convention. (“I am white but I have the soul of a black man,” Sonthonax once told Louverture.) He distributed arms to the slaves, with the predictable result that the war degenerated into a savage guerilla free-for-all. General Louverture was one of the few exceptions. He kept his troops drilled and disciplined, even as success inundated him with new recruits. It was known by all that when Louverture offered terms of surrender or safe conduct, he kept his promises and could make his men keep them, too.

His labor policy was more remarkable still, for this great champion of emancipation, when he established himself as governor, reintroduced slavery in all but name. Louverture had read Abbé Raynal’s history of the West Indies and he knew that the reason Saint-Domingue was wealthy and important was sugar. There are two facts of sugar cultivation that cannot be avoided. The first is its economies of scale—nothing smaller than a plantation is sustainable. The second is that the full growing cycle takes more than a year, and several points of the process are extremely time-sensitive. A single lost day at the wrong time can ruin an entire crop. The planters therefore demanded a guarantee of labor supply over the long term, enforceable by compulsion if necessary. This Louverture gave them.

The labor regulations he issued in October 1800 required all former slaves to return to their plantations. The penalty for disobedience was to be shot like deserting soldiers. He also forbade them from relocating without permission. Chains and the whip were banned, but other forms of physical coercion were widespread. Later, Louverture banned the sale of plots under 160 acres, to prevent freedmen from following their instinct to revert to small-scale subsistence farming, which would (and, after his death, did) reduce the Haitian economy to a nullity. Louverture could not afford the disappearance of his country’s tax base, not with soldiers to pay. Devoting the best sugar-farming land in the world to subsistence plots would have been the agricultural equivalent of building a McDonald’s on top of the Kimberley Mine. More important, prosperity would set a precedent. As Louverture explained to a crowd of field laborers who had grown restive under his labor code, “We would prove to the entire universe that Saint Domingue could recover all its riches with the work of free hands.”

Accepting the validity of the planters’ two worries, massacre and poverty, is more than most modern historians can bring themselves to do. Unlike Louverture, they have portrayed subsistence farming as a legitimate—even a more ecologically benign—alternative to commercial agriculture, rather than the economic calamity it was. They describe the invasion of Haiti by English, Spanish, and Napoleonic forces as a racist conspiracy to throttle the world’s first black republic, not as the natural consequence of being a small and valuable island with no means of supporting a permanent army. (This is the point of belonging to an empire.) They claim that reports of rebel barbarism are overblown (Laurent Dubois has said this repeatedly), although historian Jeremy Popkin has found that many eyewitness accounts “are corroborated by other documents.” These accounts record, among other atrocities, human heads hanging from trees, churches turned into rape dungeons, and babies impaled on pikes used as battle standards.

The worst offender is C. L. R. James, the Trinidadian Marxist whose leftist classic The Black Jacobins is well-researched and well-beloved but still false for all that. He asserts, for instance, that the reason Louverture’s successor Dessalines exterminated Haiti’s remnant white population in 1804 was that a British agent named Hugh Cathcart told him he could have a trade deal “only when the last of the whites had fallen under the axe.” Anti-French feeling did not run quite that high even under Pitt. Records show that Cathcart actually told Dessalines that Britain wanted to see the émigré planters’ property restored. In his three-act play Toussaint Louverture, performed in 1936 with Paul Robeson in the starring role, James outrageously has him die with the cry on his lips, “Oh, Dessalines! Dessalines! You were right after all!” Dessalines, who made a flag for the new republic by ripping the white from the French tricolor, made good his metaphor with a genocide.

James’s dogmatic Marxism and indifference to white suffering (“for these there is no need to waste one tear or one drop of ink”) add up to Black Jacobins’ wicked thesis that the Haitian Revolution was inevitable and therefore not a tragedy. “The rich are only defeated when running for their lives,” he wrote—not, one senses, with much regret. This is the version of the Haitian Revolution that has made Louverture an object of veneration among trendy neo-Marxists and failed grad students. The hot new socialist quarterly Jacobin has a portrait of Louverture as its logo. Their design editor has explained that he wanted to associate the magazine with the ethic of slave resistance, not just the revolt but also the pre-war period when “slaves had effectively instituted their own policy of poisoning damn-near everything that breathed . . . master, the mistress and the rest of the f—ing plantation Brady Bunch.” Setting aside its historical accuracy (poisoning was not epidemic), this gleeful embrace of revolutionary violence has nothing to do with Toussaint Louverture. A man who refused to endorse killing civilians in the midst of a guerrilla war is now a mascot for people who joke about killing them in peacetime.

James also has his theatrical Toussaint character take part in a voodoo ceremony during which the houngan symbolically rips a crucifix from a chain around his neck and throws it away, the most false image of any in the play since the real Louverture was renowned for his Catholic piety. On his old plantation’s 152-person slave register, he was the only one described as “devout.” As governor general, he insisted that his subordinates make honest wives of their concubines, made Catholicism the official religion, forbade divorce, and on one occasion placed his handkerchief on a woman’s décolletage, telling her, “Modesty should be the endowment of your sex.” Even after he cast his lot with the Jacobin regime, he would celebrate military victories with a Te Deum. And, of course, there is no better proof of his moral greatness than his magnanimity toward the planters—not just personally but as a policy enforced throughout his command—when vengefulness was so common and easily indulged.

Philippe Girard records all this because he is a more scrupulous historian than James was. Indeed, he is just the sort of evenhanded writer to tell a fraught story like Haiti’s fairly. He is also impressively up to date in the latest scholarship, which is more important than you might think for a biographer whose subject died over two centuries ago. It was only in 1977 that archivists discovered that, as a free man, Toussaint had owned slaves. If Girard has any weakness, it is a susceptibility to modern liberal clichés. For instance, he blames the first generation of Haitian leaders for not doing more to build the country’s industrial base, when they had enough trouble managing basic tasks like keeping roads from being swallowed up by jungle. On the other hand, his narrative of Louverture’s tragic end—lured across the Atlantic by Napoleon and then locked away to die in a stone fortress in the Jura without so much as a trial—is told with more pathos than the average academic historian could manage.

Girard hammers again and again his theme that Louverture was enigmatic, contradictory, hard to “pin down” or “make sense of.” It is true that the documentary material about his life is thin, not an uncommon obstacle in the Caribbean, a rough climate for print archives even in countries that haven’t spent two centuries mired in anarchy. But Louverture was clear and consistent in his principles. He wanted freedom and prosperity for the people of Saint-Domingue, and to deliver them in an honorable and Christian way. These goals he never altered or renounced. Contra James, he did not die shouting that Dessalines had been vindicated. He died asserting his right, as a French officer, to wear a uniform instead of prison fatigues. Louverture held many views modern progressives find hard to endorse: his loyalty to the empire, his defense of the plantation system, his willingness to forgive former slaveowners. But if we cannot reconcile those beliefs with his status as a hero and a liberator, the deficiency lies with us and not with the nearest thing the Age of Revolutions produced to a saint.

Helen Andrews writes from Sydney, Australia.

96,Andrews,Helen,claremont,"In the days leading up to the inauguration of Donald Trump, the streets in one wealthy corner of northwest Washington, D.C., were draped with flags almost from one end to the other. They recalled Monet’s painting of the Rue Montorgueil that hangs in the Musée d’Orsay, or the oils that the American impressionist Childe Hassam painted of street parades towards the end of World War I. These, however, were not national flags but the rainbow-striped banners of the gay rights movement. They were directed, in embitterment rather than celebration, at an audience of one: Indiana Governor Mike Pence, the vice president-elect. Pence had done two things to offend the flag-wavers. As Indiana governor in the days after gay marriage became law in 2015, he had signed a bill defending freedom of religion. Worse, after November 8 he had rented a house on nearby Tennyson Street for the presidential transition. Now up and down his street the yard signs jostled, some reading “I Stand With Planned Parenthood,” others “This Neighborhood Respects Women.” Particularly popular was a peacock-blue sign reading “Hate Has No Home Here” and “El odio no tiene hogar aquí,” which must be Spanish for “Stay out of our neighborhood, Hoosier.”

Regrettable though it may be that political passions would lead a whole neighborhood to act inhospitably, it is only human. It was a bitter contest, after all. Trump’s win was a shock. What is more worrisome is the estrangement of ruling-class neighborhoods like this one from the part of the country that voted for Trump, their near-unanimous incomprehension of, and contempt for, the democracy movement that just said “Enough!” to the politics of recent decades. In an election that Democrats lost at virtually every level, the capital city gave Hillary Clinton 93% of its votes, and Trump 4%. All the country’s grand, modern, and cultured places followed suit. Pence’s neighbors seemed to assume he did not realize there was any such thing as homosexuality or abortion or the Spanish language. Merely alerting him that such things existed might therefore be a satisfying way to wound him. And why not wound him? It was impossible that Trump and Pence could be legitimate occupants of the White House because it was impossible to believe that 60 million people would vote for such boobs.

A robust enthusiasm for American democracy is unlikely to survive where such sentiments prevail. Michael Tomasky of the New York Review of Books described Trump as laboring under “suspicions about his legitimacy far greater than those faced by any modern president,” partly because he lost the popular vote by more than two million votes. On the other hand, President Trump arrives in power with more of the country behind him than either Richard Nixon or Bill Clinton had. His victory was, of course, a close-run thing. But looked at closely, it leaves a political situation resembling those that have followed some of the great landslides in American history. Conflict awaits.

The Democratic Archipelago

Here is a trivia question for you: Ohio has only one city with more than 400,000 people. Name it.

Strangers to the Buckeye State might well tick through Cleveland (388,000), Cincinnati (299,000), Toledo (280,000), and even Akron and Dayton before they get the answer. It is Columbus, the capital, which, at 850,000, is more than twice as populous as any other city in the state. It is the 15th-largest city in the country. It grew, in part, because energies that used to go into building and selling now go into managing and administering. Fortunes and family lives now depend on how regulations get drawn up and how problems get defined. It is only natural that political “polarization” should be on the rise: The stakes of governing are rising.

Any place that has political power becomes a choke-point through which global money streams must pass. Such places are sheltered from globalization’s storms. They tend to grow. Austin, Texas, adds tens of thousands of residents a year, and is now the country’s 11th-largest city. The four richest counties in the United States are all in the suburbs of Washington, D.C. Resources are sucked from almost everywhere into political capitals and a few high-tech centers and university towns allied with them, where ambitious people settle and constitute a class. The Democratic Party is the party of that class, the class of the winners of globalization.

There are now just three regions of the country in which Democrats dominate—New England, California, and the Pacific Northwest. Otherwise, the party’s support comes from the archipelago of powerful New Economy cities it controls. Washington, D.C., with its 93-to-4 partisan breakdown, is not that unusual. Hillary Clinton won Cambridge, Massachusetts, by 89 to 6 and San Francisco by 86 to 9. Here, where the future of the country is mapped out, the “rest” of the country has become invisible, indecipherable, foreign.

And the rest of the country belongs to Trump. Pretty much all of it. Trump took 85% of America’s counties; Hillary Clinton took 15%. Trump even won a third of the counties that voted for Barack Obama twice. In November the New York Times had the idea of drawing up a topographical map for each candidate that showed won counties as land and lost counties as water. Trump’s America looks almost exactly like the actual United States, diminished a bit on the coasts and with a couple of new “lakes” opened up in urban areas. Hillary’s looks like the Lesser Antilles. It is possible to travel coast to coast—from, say, Coos Bay, Oregon, to Wilmington, North Carolina—without passing through a single county that Hillary Clinton won. Indeed there are several such routes. This is the heart of the country and it is experiencing a kind of social decline for which American history offers no precedent. (The economic crises of the 1870s and 1930s were something different.) Here people fall over, overdosed on heroin, in the aisles of dollar stores, and residential neighborhoods are pocked with foreclosures. This country, largely invisible to policymakers until the 2016 election, is beginning—only just beginning—to come into view. Trump was the first candidate to speak directly to the invisible country as something other than the “everyplace else” left over when you drive away from the places that are powerful, scenic, or sophisticated.

We have no idea what forces Trump has unleashed. They look mighty in some lights and meager in others. It was a very unfashionable thing to vote for Trump, and Americans are, as Alexis de Tocqueville noted, an emulative people. Even a person who desperately wants to change his society would never expose himself to the scorn and retribution of his shift manager or his fiancée’s parents, if he thought the chances of change were zero. When pundits spoke during the campaign of the two candidates having the lowest approval ratings of any pair in history, they were comparing different things. Hillary Clinton was the candidate of the culture. She represented what people were supposed to believe. When she rose in the polls, the newspapers filled up with speculation about her cabinet. Donald Trump stood against what people were supposed to believe. When he rose in the polls, the papers were full of anxious reflections on how ignorant and hateful Americans had become. Once Trump had won, and it was no longer embarrassing or socially dangerous to declare one’s support, his approval began to drift towards its natural level—from 38% on Election Day to 47% in mid-December. It may drift higher still. Voters can dissemble a long time before they show their hand. On November 8, 2016, they showed their hand.

Tribalism, Not Ideology

Trump understood something no Republican had understood in decades. The partisan division in the United States was less about ideology than about sociology. Ideology was there, of course, but it arose from the sociology: you look at life differently when you write the rules than when you have to submit to them.

Republican consultants thought exclusively in ideological terms. After their defeat in 2012, they assumed they just needed nicer “messaging.” Led by RNC chairman Reince Priebus, now President Trump’s chief of staff, they composed a 100-page “Growth and Opportunity” report, which urged the party to be less “scary” by taking more liberal positions on gay marriage and immigration. This was an insult to Republicans, Democrats, and interest groups of all sorts, and a misunderstanding of how politics works. Politicians need to do considerably more than be nice to win a following, ethnic or not. Voters rally to a politician who delivers rights, privileges, and services. Over decades, Democrats had earned the allegiance of minorities by fighting for real gains—affirmative action, funding for women’s athletics, gay marriage, delayed deportation. Democrats occasionally pursued these rights at a cost to their careers, and often at a cost to democracy. They had gone so far as to devise new categories of minority to whom rights, privileges, and services could be promised and delivered—“transgender” people, most recently. If you appreciated the new rights, as most minorities came to, you would have to be crazy to vote for a Republican just because your opinions overlapped on this or that issue. Republicans were auditioning for a role as the second-best civil rights party, which they planned to add to their portfolio as the second-best (because too far from power to deliver favors) capitalist party. Every Republican candidate for president in 2016, except Trump, swallowed this strategy whole.

Trump intuited that the difference between Republicans and Democrats was a tribal one. Feminism and anti-racism had become successful policies not because they convinced voters logically or struck them as sensible, although in many cases they did, but because they conveyed loyalty viscerally. “Breaking the glass ceiling,” for instance, was supposed to be the theme of Hillary Clinton’s victory party on election night at New York’s Javits Center. Her staff chose that venue because it literally has the largest glass ceiling surface in New York. Glass-ceiling rhetoric was not an ethical argument but a war-cry. It was not about women but about our women. When, shortly after the election, Trump named his campaign manager Kellyanne Conway a White House counselor, his press release announced she was “the first female campaign manager of either major party to win a presidential general election,”—which indeed she was! Had ideological feminism rather than tribal loyalty been at issue, this would have been considered an achievement worthy of extensive coverage. It was not.

The Democrats appeared to be overwhelming old Republican redoubts through sheer force of demographics. Almost all the networks had begun hiring young, hip, metropolitan quipsters to explain the “America of Tomorrow” or the “Next America” that residents of the Democratic Archipelago had charted out for everyone else. CNN had L.Z. Granderson, whom the website Queerty described as “breaking barriers for black gay men in journalism.” In 2014, Granderson had surely spoken for many progressives when he gave his idea of what he would like to see traditional American culture do in this increasingly diverse age:

We often talk openly about the different generational views when it comes to same-sex marriages and how we cavalierly say, as the older generation die off, so does that hatred and perspective die off in our country as well. And it needs to be said, the same thing about race. When it comes to certain aspects of talking about people of different races, certain ideas and perspectives, it’s time to die off. I’m not saying people need to die off, but those attitudes need to die off.

Unfortunately actual white people, particularly in rural areas, did happen to be dying off. Their life expectancy was falling sharply, even as those of other ethnic groups was rising. At three o’clock in the morning on Election Night, as Donald Trump was making his way through the crowd to deliver his victory speech to the sound of the Rolling Stones’ “You Can’t Always Get What You Want,” a shocked Granderson, commenting on a show called “Your Voice, Your Vote,” implied that the white death rate had been the bedrock of Democratic Party strategizing all along:

For quite some time now Democrats have been hemorrhaging white male votes. And the assumption was that, because of the changing demographics of the nation, that that would not hurt them in a general election…. This is a huge slap in the face in terms of all the people who thought that this white part of the population was dying off and that all you had to do was appeal to minorities.

Culture of Corruption

The archipelago of constituencies loyal to Democrats is small geographically. But it has lately set close to 100% of the agenda, and did so even in the 2016 election. Even Trump dared offer only minor dissents from it. The important cultural innovations of the Obama Administration can fairly be said to have been introduced without debate, or at least in disregard of what debate had been going on. Gay marriage was this way, as was the complex of issues surrounding transgender bathrooms. Where did the anti-police movement Black Lives Matter come from, with its mix of street violence and campus political correctness? Who was funding it? Why didn’t it halt its protests when five police were massacred at one of them in Dallas? Why was no one in authority talking about the heroin and opioid epidemic, even as it was killing more Americans than any drug wave in American history, more even than car accidents? Perhaps the main thing voters were trying to do in 2016 was to restore democratic scrutiny to actors who had long managed to evade it. We will never know, because for many years Americans have felt unable to talk about such things in public at all. The morning after the election, President Obama said to Rolling Stone editor Jann Wenner, “The most important thing that I’m focused on is how we create a common set of facts.” That was the problem of his whole presidency. Political rhetoric doesn’t create facts. There was something Soviet about this whole approach—a tendency to mistake dissent for psychosis or hallucination. In a 93-to-4 world, no other grounds for dissent could be imagined.

Never in American history had a ruling class been more poorly equipped to take the moral high ground against a candidate who played fast and loose with the facts. One need not have supported Trump to see that he did not do an extraordinary number of the things he was alleged to have done. It is not true, as New Yorker editor David Remnick alleged, that “Trump began his campaign declaring Mexican immigrants to be ‘rapists.’” What he said was:

When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.

It is not true, as PBS alleged, that Trump was “urging a foreign government to meddle in American politics.” Any human being with a sense of humor could see that Trump was joking when he tweeted, in response to an allegation that files had been stolen from DNC servers, “If Russia or any other country or person has Hillary Clinton’s 33,000 illegally deleted emails, perhaps they should share them with the FBI!”

Those who couldn’t understand Trump were even less likely to understand Trump’s people. Hillary Clinton’s remark, at a gay-rights fundraiser, that half of Trump voters were a “basket of deplorables” has been understood as one of the major blunders of the campaign. That is clear only in retrospect. It is not as if Clinton was appearing on Candid Camera. She herself had opened the event to the press. It is likely she was trying to shame a public that was proving reluctant to vote for her, to show them that if they persisted in backing Trump they would be laughed at by their social betters. Why not try such a strategy? It had worked in Tocqueville’s time, and for as long as Clinton had been in politics. The whole press embraced it. A headline from Dana Milbank of the Washington Post in late October read: “Trump can’t just be defeated. He must be humiliated.” Another, ten days later, over an article by Dean Obeidallah of the Daily Beast, read: “Donald Trump Can’t Merely Be Defeated—He and His Deplorables Must Be Crushed.” After the election, Jamelle Bouie of Slate was undaunted: “There’s No Such Thing as a Good Trump Voter,” the headline ran.

This harmony of views was the result not of co-ordination, at least not in most cases, but of a common culture that rested on naïveté about, or indifference to, how life is lived outside of the urban archipelago. A moment that defined Trump to the country, cleaving his potential supporters from sworn enemies, came on February 23 as he was trying to brag about how broad-based was the victory he had just won in the Nevada Republican caucuses:

We won with young. We won with old. We won with highly educated. We won with poorly educated. I love the poorly educated.

It is hard to recall a single journalist in any major venue who thought that last sentiment was anything but a disgrace. Who the heck loves the poorly educated? Being poorly educated was a culpability. It was not a compensable status, like being tempest-tost or lacking health insurance. No one thought to say that Jesus loved the poorly educated, or that the poorly educated were no less citizens of the republic than the tenured faculty at Oberlin. No, Trump’s remark was considered not just awkward but appalling. He seemed to have forgotten who America was for.

We now know he was the only candidate who hadn’t. The key to Trump’s victory was his interpretation of the cultural elite as a class in the strongest sense of the word, a set of people who used government as a means of expanding their privileges and imposing their values. Democrats, again, were the party of this class.

As his campaign had been, his presidency was thus a standing insult to his opponents. He treated them as if they were propping up some kind of racket. He didn’t even do them the honor of disagreeing with them. Most of the people who flew the rainbow flag against Mike Pence in northwest Washington are not gay, and most of the people who displayed the signs reading “El odio no tiene hogar aquí” do not speak enough Spanish to order a burrito. They simply have, as they see it, a more highly elaborated sense of the public good than Trump and Pence do. Trump answered their orotund earnestness with Tweets. He hit practitioners of identity politics at the core of their identity, implying they said these things not because they were more virtuous but because they were, like him, members of the One Percent.

Back to Jackson

The victory that Trump won was about more than applying the epithet “Crooked” to the Democratic opposition. It was also an acknowledgment that essential parts of so-called “movement conservatism”—not just George W. Bush’s wars but also Ronald Reagan’s economic philosophy—had failed. The 1980s was a time of many Republican successes. It was also the decade when the Right broke the Left’s monopoly on making stupid generalizations about capitalism. Over the past generation, while Republicans have been dreaming their dreams of pure free markets, more and more of the American economy has been regulated into conformity with government administrators’ wishes. A lot of this process has been driven by the very corporations Republicans champion. It is extraordinary how much liberty has been extinguished since Republicans brought the libertarians to Washington.

Trump saw Republicans not as Democrats’ foes but as their sidekicks and enablers. The system needed, as Trump saw it, to be reformed in a much deeper way than Republicans had ever thought necessary. Ronald Reagan, however vivid and appealing his diagnosis of government inefficiency, had underestimated the wiliness and tenacity that an administrative ruling class would bring to the defense of its prerogatives. Running in 2012, Mitt Romney could not conceive of such a thing. In speeches and in debates with Barack Obama over favoritism towards the Obama-connected green energy firm Solyndra, Romney had said he didn’t think government should be “chasing fads and picking winners and losers.” But his differences with the Obama Administration were purely a matter of efficiency, never of fairness or self-government. Cronyism was not the problem at Solyndra:

Programs like NASA develop technologies that ultimately can be commercialized. But for the government to say “oh, we think the world should make this kind of car” or “that kind of solar panel,” that’s almost certain to fail. Now and then there will be a winner, but overwhelmingly they’re going to be losers. Let the private market work.

Republicans like Romney have traditionally warned that the government was being run by incompetents. Trump did something different. He implied the government is being run by crooks. The New York Times was puzzled by Trump’s cabinet picks, looking at them in terms of policy subtleties, and finding that “a picture is emerging of an administration with little ideological cohesion and no single animating purpose.” In fact there has never been a cabinet picked on simpler or more coherent grounds. Namely, that the agencies as they are now constituted are terminally corrupt. “Drain the swamp,” as much as any policy suggestion about trade or immigration, appears to be the message at the core of the early Trump presidency. Almost all his nominees are skeptics or opponents of the agencies they have been brought in to run. He has nominated Andy Puzder, a fast-food entrepreneur skeptical about union rights, as Labor secretary. Georgia congressman Tom Price, who wants an end to Obamacare, has been nominated to run Health and Human Services. Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, a skeptic about climate change, was tapped for EPA. Lawyer Robert Lighthizer, a free trade skeptic, is his pick for U.S. trade representative.

Certain parallels are emerging between President Trump and Andrew Jackson, another wealthy and capable conservative (of a sort) who was nonetheless thought a barbarian by many of his peers, and who overturned a good deal of what in his time was considered conservatism. Daniel Webster alleged that Thomas Jefferson had said of Jackson: “He is one of the most unfit men I know of for such a place…. [H]e is a dangerous man.” Jackson, too, came to power a decade after a major banking panic, from which the malefactors appeared to have escaped with impunity. In fact, what had happened over that decade was that the broad public undertook a slow, autodidactic reassessment of the economic and social system they had been living under.

Much the same process made the election of Trump possible. Americans like capitalism a lot less than they did at the end of the George W. Bush Administration. It can be not just an antidote to, but a variety of, cronyism. Just as Jackson found his symbol of corruption in the Second Bank of the United States, so has Trump in Nafta and other free trade agreements. Just as defenders of the status quo in the 1830s warned that not rechartering the National Bank would lead to local abuses, today’s argue that scrapping the Trans-Pacific Partnership, as Trump has done, will allow China to strengthen its trade position in the Western Pacific. Triumphant pundits prove that Trump “can’t bring back” the jobs that fled the country 40 years ago. Of course he can’t. In the same way he can’t un-fight the Vietnam or Iraq wars or un-inflate the credit bubble of the 2000s. But that doesn’t mean that citizens of the Republic are not entitled to hold accountable those who have blundered them into such predicaments.

Reassessment and Renewal

In our time, as in Jackson’s, the ruling classes claim a monopoly not just on the economy and society but also on the legitimate authority to regulate and restrain it, and even on the language in which such matters are discussed. Elites have full-spectrum dominance of a whole semiotic system. What has just happened in American politics is outside of the system of meanings elites usually rely upon. Mike Pence’s neighbors on Tennyson Street not only cannot accept their election loss; they cannot fathom it. They are reaching for their old prerogatives in much the way that recent amputees are said to feel an urge to scratch itches on limbs that are no longer there. Their instincts tell them to disbelieve what they rationally know. Their arguments have focused not on the new administration’s policies or its competence but on its very legitimacy.

Thus, activists called for recounts in three states—Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan—where there was no cause for a recount beyond the fact that losing those states cost Clinton the election. Hollywood hipsters tried to suborn the Electoral College with a video promising Republican loyalists that history would remember them as great heroes if they would only undermine the country’s democratic verdict. Progressives in the high-tech states introduced the concept of “fake news”—false stories, usually generated in obscure corners of the internet, which, whether connected to Trump or not, were supposed to have led well-meaning citizens astray in illegitimate ways. The New York Times even devoted a front-page story to an Englishman named James Dowson, “a far-right political activist who advocated Britain’s exit from the European Union and is a fan of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia,” and whose postings had been shared “tens of thousands of times in the United States.” Some internet surfers, it turned out, were even insulting Hillary Clinton on social media.

January saw the extraordinary turn to blaming Putin himself for having tried to influence the election by hacking the computers of the Democratic National Committee. As of mid-January, these allegations were backed up by assurances—but no hard evidence—from senior intelligence sources in the Obama Administration. The hack having taken place at the DNC, the sources cited included CrowdStrike, the cybersecurity firm hired by the Democrats, along with those who served on a secret anti-hacking committee the party convened, including former party chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz and party lawyer Michael Sussmann of the Washington firm Perkins Coie. Increasingly dire warnings appeared of a “rift” between Trump and his intelligence agencies. “Donald Trump Fuels Rift With CIA Over Russian Hack,” headlined the Wall Street Journal. The strange and erroneous implication was that there is something improper about such a rift, some looming constitutional crisis, as if the administrative state were a fourth co-equal branch of government, rather than a part of the executive.

More need for reform has accumulated in the American system than almost anyone seemed to realize a year ago. Barack Obama was first nominated by his party in the boom days before the financial crash—he is a figure of the old regime. In a similar way, the Republican majorities that have just arrived in both houses of Congress were nominated under their own old regime of New Economy glad-handers, which Republican voters repudiated in the presidential primaries. President Trump is the only new element in a system crying out for renewal. Government itself has been rendered vulnerable by various irregularities of the Obama years—in particular the administration’s overreliance on judicial manipulation, executive orders, and ad hoc rule-writing. The new president arrives, alas, well-armed with occasions for saying, “Well, you did it too!” His scope for action will depend on just what reassessments Americans have made in their own minds over eight years of dashed economic dreams, lost global influence, and wobbling social stability. Since the people who elected Trump have gone unheard for a long time, we don’t know what these reassessments are. But we are about to find out. It may take years before we can tell whether Trump’s election hastened America’s decline or provided the last possible means of escaping it.",1,http://www.claremont.org/crb/article/sanctimony-cities/
97,Andrews,Helen,firstthings,"The last quarter of the nineteenth century saw movements calling themselves “decadent” in both England and France, and from the modern reader’s perspective there is very little that separates Oscar Wilde and Arthur Symons, on one hand, and Joris-Karl Huysmans and Villiers de L’Isle Adam on the other. They wrote in the same exquisitely mannered prose, embraced the same cult of artifice and ornament, took as their anti-heroes the same dissolute aristocrats bemoaning the same prevailing philistinism. At the end of Villiers’ play Axël, the hero withdraws from the world with the parting cry, “As for living, the servants will do that for us.” That is a line Walter Pater would have applauded from his box, if he could have bestirred himself to do something so vigorous.



There is one difference between the two decadences: Only the French really believed their civilization was in terminal decline. It was not just the humiliating Prussian rout that made the French decadents believe, with Flaubert, that they were witnessing “le fin du monde latin.” Consumption of alcohol was exploding (it tripled between Sedan and Ypres), science had declared heredity degeneration to be a proven fact, the republican experiment teetered at the brink of failure, and industrial corruption was prevalent enough to trouble even those who did not consider industrialization corrupting by definition. Across Europe, prophets of Western decline from Spaniards to Slavophiles held up France as their chief portent.

In literature, all the old creative schools from classicism to romanticism seemed utterly played out, leaving in their place only a dull philistinism. It was not even the sort of philistinism one could amuse oneself by provoking, as Wilde did with such zest. Emile Zola, the chief novelist of this vulgar school, had been a mentor to Huysmans before the latter abandoned Naturalism for Decadence, and it was with great trepidation that a young Huysmans sent his former master an advance copy of the novel that cemented their artistic break, A Rebours (1884). This is the book that features that famous symbol of decadence, the tortoise with the jewel-encrusted shell, which Waugh borrowed in Brideshead Revisited. In his private critical reply, Zola wrote to Huysmans, “A very bourgeois thought came to me: It’s lucky the tortoise died, because it would have crapped on the carpet.” With such men ranked among France’s literary eminences, little wonder Huysmans felt there was no one left worth writing for.

The English who embraced the label “decadent” used the word mainly in its chocolate sense. It may be contradictory to speak of an optimistic and self-confident decadence, but that is what flourished in the fifteen years after Victoria’s Golden Jubilee. Wilde and his coterie imported the word without realizing that la décadence was something their French counterparts were resigned to, not something they championed. Where the French were genuinely listless, the English were merely bored. Aesthetes on both sides of the Channel reveled in luxury, dismissing more prosaic concerns as beneath their attention, but the English did so on grounds of abundance, the French on grounds of apocalypse.

“Aestheticism has not an enervating influence on society,” Wilde buoyantly declared in 1882. “It redeems it from gross errors and cleanses it from the accumulation of the scraps of ages.” It may be worth noting that, around the same time Wilde was taking all the desperation out of modern decadence, certain British classical historians were rehabilitating the original decadents of the late Roman empire. The influential John Bagnell Bury scoffed at the Victorian view that the fall of Rome was somehow a natural consequence of “the dinners of Apicius and the orgies of Nero. . . . As a matter of fact, luxury and immorality do not constitute, and need not be symptoms of, a disease that is fatal to the life of states.” Interestingly enough, Wilde and Bury both studied classics at Trinity College Dublin within a few years of each other in the 1870s.

Alas for the English, hopelessness turned out to be a crucial ingredient of the decadent worldview. Without it, they fell into errors that their genuinely gloomy French counterparts managed to avoid. Their biggest mistakes usually involved shooting off their big mouths. Wilde’s troubles on this score are well known; less familiar is the story of Walter Pater’s study of the Renaissance. Published in 1873, The Renaissance served as a bible for the rising generation of Decadents, especially its “Conclusion,” which features the famous exhortation to “get as many pulsations as possible” into this brief life and “to burn always with this hard, gem-like flame, to maintain this ecstasy.”

Pater assumed, wrongly, that readers would understand that he was referring to a lifelong cultivation of discriminating taste and not simply hedonism. His error was, as T. S. Eliot put it, “not wholly irresponsible for some untidy lives.” Consumed with regret, Pater omitted the “Conclusion” from the book’s second edition and reinstated it only partially in future editions, altering some offending passages and eliminating any reference to “art for art’s sake.”

Compare this with Huysmans. When his return to the Church was reported in the Paris gossip sheets, many faithful Catholics called for Huysmans to repudiate, and for his publishers to withdraw from sale, the novels of his Decadent period. To be clear, these are books in which a satanic black mass featuring desecration of the host is not the most offensive scenario depicted. But Huysmans refused. As he explained to the Cardinal Prefect of the Index, his novels were all part of the same autobiographical arc, and this testimony had “brought about a number of conversions” among people the Church would otherwise find it difficult to reach.

Huysmans was able to stand behind his books, as Pater was not, partly because he had never attempted to evangelize for his philosophy. He had always assumed he was writing for an audience of the forty people who would understand him, and beyond that, decadence was not a message he particularly wanted to spread. Huysmans was never the enthusiastic exponent that Pater and Wilde werebut then, Huysmans was never as naïve as Pater or as frivolous as Wilde. During his American tour, Wilde marveled at how silly it was that his clique had been denounced from the pulpit back at Oxford: “They took our epigrams as earnest and our paradoxes as prose!” French decadents like Huysmans took their ideas more seriously than that, and this seriousness made them less destructive.

Fundamentally, the difference between the two movements was that the English thought decadence was just a game. Only after intense personal suffering did they come to realize what the French had known from the beginning, that it was serious business in which a person couldalmost certainly wouldget hurt.

If our age bears a resemblance to either decadence, it is the English. There is, for example, very little difference between treating your life like a work of art, which was Wilde’s theory of how to be a person, and the digital dandyism of “cultivating your personal brand.” Political leanings have not yet been mentioned, but it should come as no surprise that the French Decadents were generally reactionaries but the English generally soft socialists. It is right-wing to observe decadence, left-wing to grab decadence with both hands because it sounds like a great deal.

If this comparison has anything to it, are there any lessons to be drawn? Two, I think. The first is cautionary. Among the anti- and post-decadents of a century ago, there was a marked tendency to swing to the other extreme, trading the effete cult of refinement for the manly cult of muscle. W. E. Henley did it, Lord Alfred Douglas sort of did it, even Teddy Roosevelt (college nickname “Oscar Wilde”) can be said to have done it. Call it the Gabriele D’Annunzio fallacy. Strangely enough, it is a Frenchman who recently came closest to endorsing this form of reaction. In his rich essay on James Poulos’s idea of the pink police state, Pascal-Emmanuel Gobry closes by recommending “a reinvigorated and rethought military service.”

Modified universal conscription does not necessarily put Gobry into D’Annunzio territory, but neither is it the right prescription for his diagnosis. I think Gobry is right that “what we need is to find some way to reeducate most people to risk,” but there is quite enough risk in the modern decadent lifestyle already. The problem is blindness to it. Instead of overamplifying our praise for anti-decadent masculine virtueswhich is the one thing I am saying we must not doconservatives should continue to point out how the misery young people feel is directly attributable to psychologically, sexually, and spiritually risky behavior. Better still would be connecting such behavior to the misery felt by the people around them. In my experience, university-educated people believe that staying within the protocols of consent and good intentions absolves a person of moral responsibility for any suffering they might inflict in their personal lives. “Who have you hurt without meaning to?” is a hard question for anyone to answer honestly, but decadence makes it harder.

The second piece of advice for modern anti-decadents is more passive. Many people know that several of the English and French decadents ended up embracing Catholicism. Nowadays it is easy to take pride in these exotic converts, but at the time very few Catholics were hastening to slaughter the fatted calf. Some doubted their sincerity, others worried that even a sincere aesthete might well be treating the Church like a glamorous accessory. G. K. Chesterton, for instance, never warmed to Wilde, sniping that the old decadent had been drawn to the Church only because “he desired all beautiful thingseven God.”

If our present decadence inspires any conversionsand I will be very surprised if it does not, assuming it hasn’t alreadywe may find it as difficult to welcome our new brethren as Chesterton found it to accept Wilde. Just as the ex-decadents of the fin de siècle still sounded too beauty-minded, their modern equivalents may sound too utilitarian, or too therapeutic, or may speak too much in the language of self-help. Chesterton was right that desiring all beautiful things, even God, is not enough, but for some it made a good beginning. If we can welcome such souls, so should we welcome those who may desire all improving thingseven faith.

Police have warned motorists “don’t do it”, as they launched a crackdown on drink-driving over the festive season.

Extra police patrols will be out on Scotland’s roads from Friday as the party season gets under way, targeting drivers who are over the limit.

Last year – 12 months after the lower drink-drive limit was introduced – one in 35 drivers stopped during the festive season was over the legal limit. That compared to one in 50 motorists caught drink-driving over the same period of the previous year.

The new Scottish Government and Road Safety Scotland campaign aims to drive home the message that “the best approach is none”, reminding motorists that even if they are only slightly over the limit, in the eyes of the law they are a drunk-driver.

Assistant Chief Constable Bernard Higgins and Justice Secretary Michael Matheson launched the campaign in Glasgow’s Ashton Lane, a street full of bars and restaurants.

More than 20,000 drivers are stopped by police every month and the force warned drink-drivers that the chances of being caught are higher than ever.

Mr Higgins said: “The message to drivers is don’t believe the myths. Don’t believe that if you’re 5ft 10in and weigh 170lb you can have two pints and you’re safe to drive – it’s utter nonsense.

“People react differently to alcohol dependent on their metabolism, and it applies the same the morning after. Don’t go on to the internet and Google how much you can drink, it’s just rubbish.

“So my advice, my very strong advice and plea, is just simply don’t do it.”

He added: “We are urging people to plan ahead during the party season. Think about how you’re going to get home – before you head out – and don’t forget about any journeys you’ll make the morning after.”

Police said that between December 2015 and January, 452 drivers failed a breath test.

Scotland’s lower drink-drive limit came into force in December 2014, reducing it from 80mg to 50mg in every 100ml of blood.

Mr Matheson said: “We led the way in the UK by reducing the legal alcohol limit and this is already having an effect on changing attitudes in a way that keeps people safe. More people now know that even one drink before driving is one too many.

“Unfortunately, there is a persistent minority of drivers who continue to ignore the law. These people are not only risking their own lives, but are risking the safety of other road users and pedestrians by drinking and driving.

“This campaign reinforces that drink-driving is unacceptable and if you get caught, you will get a minimum 12-month driving ban, a criminal record, points on your licence and a substantial fine.”

Referrals from calls to a dedicated football abuse hotline more than tripled the amount made in the first three days of the Jimmy Savile scandal, the NSPCC has revealed.

Launched on November 23 to support the victims of child sex abuse within football, the charity said more than 860 calls had been made to the helpline in its first week.

NSPCC chief executive Peter Wanless said there had been a “staggering surge” in the amount of people getting in touch.

He said: “The number of high-profile footballers bravely speaking out about their ordeal has rightly caught the attention of the entire country.

“We have had a staggering surge in calls to our football hotline, which reveals the worrying extent of abuse that had been going on within the sport.”

The helpline was set up with the support and funding of the Football Association after former player Andy Woodward revealed he had been abused as a young player at Crewe Alexandra Football Club.

Within two hours of the opening of the helpline, the charity said it had been contacted 50 times by members of the public. Within the first three days, it had made 60 referrals to the police or children’s services.

The charity made 17 such referrals In the same time frame following the opening of its Savile helpline in 2012.

Mr Wanless said anyone who wishes to contact the helpline “can do so in confidence, with the knowledge they will be listened to and supported”.

“In future, footballers – both young players and former athletes – must have the confidence to open up about sexual abuse and feel able to come forward,” he said.

The NSPCC’s football abuse helpline can be called 24 hours a day on 0800 023 2642.

"" From that paper football sprang a magazine that would launch the careers of Conan O'Brien, Fred Gwynne, Robert Benchley, and dozens of writers whose names you've never heard of for shows you most certainly have, including The Simpsons and Late Night with David Letterman. The Harvard Lampoon has outlasted the British magazine that inspired it and today is the oldest continually published humor magazine in the English-speaking world.

Wheelwright's reminiscence is in The Harvard Lampoon Centennial Celebration (1973), a superior anthology in every respect to this one. For one thing, it is bigger. Getting the full effect of the Lampoon's justly celebrated magazine parodies ( Life, Playboy, Mademoi selle), exact down to the tiniest details of layout, really does demand a book the size of an LP cover. Those parodies are missing, understandably but regrettably, from this present six-by-nine hardback. The older book features an introduction by John Updike, the newer by Simon Rich, who is not even the most talented of Frank Rich's sons. The older book is entirely devoid of Andy Borowitz.

However, this latest anthology has one major advantage: It covers the years of the Harvard Lampoon's greatest national influence. The precise moment its alumni launched their conquest of American professional comedy might be 1970, when Doug Kenney and Henry Beard moved to New York and started the National Lampoon. Or it might be 1976, when Jim Downey was hired as a writer for Saturday Night Live two years out of school. He stayed for the next 35 years, give or take a few gaps, and became ""Patient Zero"" in Harvard's takeover of TV writers' rooms (in the words of Simpsons show-runner and fellow 'Poonie Mike Reiss). But whatever the exact date, this is the first anthology published since the Harvard Lampoon became a name to conjure with in Hollywood.

No surprise, then, that the funniest pieces here date from 1975 and after. The earlier stuff—and the book has nearly a hundred pages of it, going back to 1886—falls into two categories: Some are pieces by authors who became famous as nonhumorists, like a painfully unfunny Charles Kuralt parody by Walter Isaacson or ""Hold Up"" (1954) by John Updike, which has no more laughs than the average Updike short story and qualifies as a humor piece only in the sense that there is no sex or death in it.

The others were presumably chosen for historical value, such as ""The Arms Conference: A Fable"" (1924) or the inscrutable ""Diary of an Amoeba"" (1924), in which the unicellular narrator proposes electing ""Amoebess Sanger"" to the presidency. He adds: ""The Lord knoweth it is not for me to talk, whose descendants have already founded and overfilled four towns."" The second-rate sketch ""How I Was Taken at the Cleaners"" (1941) by one Walter R. Bowie Jr. can only have been included in order to show just how derivative of S. J. Perelman most of that era's humor writing was.

But the quality begins to pick up with a theater review of the end of the world by Stephen O'Donnell from 1975:

Bogged down by heavy-handed symbolism and millions of actual deaths, the Second Coming of Our Lord Jesus Christ would have done better to stay a few extra months in New Haven. . . . The lyrics are repetitious (""Holy, holy, holy"") and reminiscent to the point of plagiarism of many old church tunes. . . . I was also outraged that upon entrance to the show last night I was branded on my forehead with the number 666. A simple inkstamping on the back of the hand would have saved the management and the public a lot of inconvenience.

O'Donnell is not a famous name, having made his career off-camera as a writer for David Letterman and Jimmy Kimmel. Most of the standout pieces are from authors of this type— NewsRadio creator Paul Simms (who?), West Wing writer Paul Redford (huh?), Veep writer Alexis Wilkinson (is that a man or a woman?).

The celebrity contributions are lackluster in comparison. Conan O'Brien's six-panel cartoon ""Nader's Raiders of the Lost Ark"" lives down to its premise. The two pieces from Colin Jost, current coanchor of SNL's ""Weekend Update,"" are better than O'Brien's only insofar as they do not feature a character called ""Co-Co, the Legal Aid Chimp."" The exception to the rule is B. J. Novak, a star of NBC's The Office, whose travel piece parodying magical realism is genuinely funny (""When she served the meal, each bite echoed with the unbearable sadness of Juanita's limitless heartbreak. It was the worst burrito I ever had"").

One quality that was lost when the Lampoon became more professional in the 1970s was any distinctive Harvard flavor, either academic or patrician. Many entries in the first half of the book are distinctly WASPy—explicitly so in the case of Thomas Feran's ""WASP Jokes,"" which is three pages of exactly that:

How can you tell when you're in a WASP neighborhood? The homes are very large and well cared for. Why did the WASP throw his alarm clock out the window? As a histrionic gesture demonstrating his dissatisfaction with the regimentation of his life.

Henry Beard, the blueblood on the original National Lampoon staff, is represented by a 1964 piece imagining that Harvard's three-dollar-a-year deans go on strike for a $1.30 raise (""A dollar doesn't buy what it used to""), leading Lyndon Johnson to threaten to release a stockpile of dollar-a-year men left over in Washington from World War II. Beard himself was very much from the dollar-a-year men's world: After growing up in the Westbury Hotel on the Upper West Side, and then being sent off to the Taft School, his great act of teenage rebellion was to enroll at Harvard, his father being a Yale man.

No doubt, some of this change was due to demographics. There were simply fewer pedigreed students on campus after meritocracy kicked in. But the Lampoon's very success is also partly responsible: Once it became a ticket to a real comedy career, students began to approach writing for the Lampoon as an audition, with a national audience in mind. They were not simply trying to amuse their fellow classmates anymore, with the result that the magazine ceased to be any guide to what young members of the ruling class in particular found funny in any given generation. The later pieces are, therefore, of minimal sociological interest. But they are still, many of them, damn funny.

More than 250,000 young women are not receiving the support they need to find work, according to a report.

A study showed they faced obstacles, such as unaffordable childcare and transport, that could shut them out of employment.

The Young Women’s Trust said 285,000 young women were classed as economically inactive, meaning they are not working or not looking for a job.

Caring for family members was the main reason given by women for being economically inactive, but mothers also struggle to find jobs, said the report.

Young women out of work can feel isolated and struggle to get by financially, according to the charity. It said almost a third of those who are economically inactive want to work.

Some are not eligible for Jobseeker’s Allowance because issues such as childcare prevent them from being available for work, the trust said.

Dr Carole Easton, the trust’s chief executive, said: “Young women are telling us they want to work but too often they are shut out of the jobs market by a lack of networks and support and a lack of convenient childcare.

“While the Government focuses on reducing its unemployment figures, hundreds of thousands of women who are not included in the numbers are being forgotten.

“The report recommends support and mentoring to help ease young women’s transition back into the world of work, access to affordable childcare, better mental health provision and more careers advice and guidance.

“The Young Women’s Trust is also calling for a new Minister for Young People to oversee progress.

“Giving young women the support they need to find work will not only help them to become financially independent but will benefit businesses and the economy too.”

Time wasted in the UK’s worst traffic jams will cost motorists £62 billion by 2025, according to a study.

Transport information company Inrix identified more than 20,000 congestion pinch points in 21 cities across the country.

Analysis of the average duration, length and frequency of the hold-ups in September found that the impact of traffic hotspots will cost London drivers £42 billion over the next decade. Edinburgh was in second place at £2.8 billion, followed by Glasgow (£2.3 billion).

The estimated £62 billion cost to drivers of hours wasted in queues was calculated using value of travel time figures from a Department for Transport-commissioned report.

This was more than any other country in Europe, with Germany the next closest at £42 billion and Italy third at £19 billion.

In last week’s Autumn Statement, the Government pledged to spend £220 million to tackle congestion on England’s motorways and major A roads.

Inrix’s chief economist Graham Cookson said identifying where delays are having the biggest impact can allow for the most efficient use of investment.

He told the Press Association: “Let’s make sure we focus spending on those worst-hit hotspots because, given the amount of money, we want to get the most benefit out of it.”

Here are the 10 UK cities with the worst impact from traffic jams, according to Inrix (cost of congestion by 2025 in brackets followed by worst hotspot):

London (£42 billion) M25 northbound between junctions 15 and 16 Edinburgh (£2.8 billion) A720 westbound Edinburgh Bypass at Dreghorn Barracks Glasgow (£2.3 billion) Eastbound junction of the A8 Glasgow and Edinburgh Road with the M8 Birmingham (£2 billion) Northbound junction of the A38 (M) with the M6 Manchester (£1.9 billion) M60 northbound at junction 1 for the A6 Stockport Bristol (£1.6 billion) M5 southbound at junction 20 for Clevedon Leeds (£1.5 billion) Westbound M62 junction 26 with M606 junction 1 Cardiff (£1.1 billion) A48 westbound at Riverside Park Bradford (£1.1 billion) From the A650 in the city centre to the A6038 Otley Road Belfast (£797 million) A12 eastbound at the junction with the M2 and M3

AS a thank you for their never ending support, Scotland stars Darren Fletcher and Robert Snodgrass put down their football kits and picked up the phones to give dedicated fans a special treat.

Manning the Vauxhall Fan hotline for one day only, the players surprised lucky supporters with a FaceTime call.

The Tartan Army were encouraged to enter a competition to win a signed shirt as part of the Vauxhall Motors #GetIN campaign, designed to bring fans close to the players with one off experiences.

And a few lucky winners certainly got that, with Scotland captain Fletcher and Hull City star Snodgrass calling them on FaceTime personally.

The two footballers didn’t waste the opportunity to have a bit of fun with the lucky winners, making one fan perform his best lion impression on camera.

Talk about the Hampden Roar…

Another fan was surprised on his way to boxing practice.

Neill was asked to perform his best boxing moves on camera in order to win the signed shirt and impressed the players with a knockout performance.

Fletcher and Snodgrass also did their best Simon Cowell and Louis Walsh impressions and took on the role of talent judges as fans Stuart and Logan belted out the national anthem in exchange for a signed shirt.

https://youtu.be/XVgkOeMU9hU

Andrew Curley, Head of Sponsorship and Events at Vauxhall Motors, said: “As sponsors of the Home Nations we were delighted to surprise these dedicated fans with their national heroes – giving them their own #GetIN moment. #GetIN is about rewarding the fans for their unwavering support as we build excitement ahead of Russia 2018.”

Vauxhall launched #GetIN as a platform for fans to show their support for their teams, celebrate the spirit of football and give fans one off experiences and real #GetIN moments. Kicking off earlier this year, the campaign started with a nationwide hunt for the ultimate #GetIN goal celebration ahead of the European Championships in France.

Margaret Thatcher secretly continued to pursue politically explosive plans to dismantle the welfare state even after ministers thought they had been killed off by a cabinet revolt, according to newly-released official files.

The proposals – drawn up by the Whitehall’s think-tank the Central Policy Review Staff (CPRS) – were among the most contentious and the most radical to be considered by Mrs Thatcher’s Conservative government during her 11 years in office.

They included scrapping free universal healthcare and requiring people to take out private insurance, charging for education, and ending the annual uprating of benefits in line with inflation, as well as sweeping defence cuts.

The CPRS paper baldly stated: “For the majority the change would represent the abolition of the NHS. This would be immensely controversial.”

When chancellor Sir Geoffrey Howe, who commissioned the report, introduced the proposals at a specially convened meeting of the cabinet on September 9 1982 there was uproar.

Nigel Lawson, then the energy secretary, later recalled in his memoirs that it was “the nearest thing to a cabinet riot in the history of the Thatcher administration”.

And when the so-called cabinet “wets”, who opposed Mrs Thatcher’s hardline economic policies, contrived to leak details of the report to The Economist it sparked a public outcry.

In an attempt to quell the political storm, Mr Thatcher felt compelled to use her speech to the annual Conservative Party conference in Brighton to declare the NHS is “safe with us”.

Mrs Thatcher later claimed to have been “horrified” by the CPRS plan which was deemed so contentious it was designated a “non-paper” in Whitehall.

But while the “wets” believed they had seen off the proposals for good, Treasury papers released by the National Archives at Kew, west London, show the prime minister and her chancellor continued to work behind the scenes to keep them alive.

On November 26 1982, P Mountford in the Treasury informed Sir Geoffrey that Mrs Thatcher had set up a series of meetings with the key ministers involved – health secretary Norman Fowler, education secretary Sir Keith Joseph and defence secretary John Nott.

“This series of meeting is designed to soften up the three big spenders. Without their support the operation will not work,” Mr Mountford wrote.

“Your main aim, I suggest, should be to ensure that no sacred cows are prematurely identified. Given the prime minister’s concern about the NHS, this may be difficult.

“But we want to make sure that the ministers concerned a) do not close off any options at this stage, and b) if possible put their personal weight behind the exercise and encourage their officials to co-operate fully with the Treasury.”

Others however saw little prospect of success. GW Monger warned: “DHSS (Department of Health and Social Security) officials say there is no chance that Mr Fowler would agree to further study of this idea.

“I imagine that in the circumstances, and especially given the prime minister’s speech at Brighton, it is difficult to press them.”

While Sir Geoffrey remained adamant that radical reform was needed if public spending was to be brought under control, he was alarmed when the free market Adam Smith Institute intended to set out its own plans for privatisation and deregulation.

His political adviser Robin Harris said that while the portentously named “Omega Project” could be “politically useful” to the Conservatives in the run-up to a general election, there was a real danger it could “fall on its face”.

“The timescale proposed is very tight; one has legitimate doubts about the competence of some of those involved; and ill-researched proposals which will be portrayed as strongly resembling ours might prove an embarrassment,” he wrote.

Sir Geoffrey scrawled in the margin: “Every proposal will be seized on and hung round our neck. I see v great harm.”

Get a weekly round-up of stories from The Sunday Post:

It’s at least 32C on a late afternoon at Legoland in Billund, Denmark, home of the legendary plastic brick empire.

My wife and three boys are queuing for the mini-boats ride for the third time today.

We’ve already spent almost seven solid hours dashing from ride to ride, only really stopping for a late lunch.

And, of course, our kids have absolutely loved every minute of it.

Between them, they’ve driven a fire engine, sailed inside a secret cave, taken a ride on a Duplo train, fired water cannons at pirate ships, watched a 4D mini-movie, climbed a lighthouse, ridden on a dragon roller-coaster and… well, loads more I’ve forgotten in a blur.

By any measure, this has been a grand day out. With the final boat ride done, we retreat to Hotel Legoland where we have a

Kingdom-themed room.

Waking up next to the image of beaming, yellow-faced knight is a stark reminder that you’re on a kids’ holiday.

I imagine relatively few guests here are on their honeymoon.

Guests at the hotel are entitled to two days’ access to Legoland, so after making the most of the expansive buffet breakfast, we take the short walk to the park.

Feeling a little like we are on a mad trolley dash, we sprint to the 4D ride in the new Ninjago World, and then on to Lloyd’s Laser Maze, in which you have to step through red laser beams, Mission Impossible-style.

By midday, we’ve been on 10 rides and attractions, but it’s time to drag ourselves away to go to Lalandia, a popular, Center Parcs-style resort which is literally just across the road.

We have day-tickets for the Aquadome, Scandinavia’s largest waterpark – and, after a frantic day-and-a-half at Legoland, it proves to be a welcome change of pace and scene.

Tired and hungry after a marathon six hours in the water, we then head to nearby restaurant, Ristorante il Bambino. It’s part of the same complex at Lalandia, which also features bowling lanes and a softplay area.

Not for the first time on the trip, conversation with my wife turns to the cost of food and drink. There’s no denying it can be expensive in Denmark, but our buffet dinner here is a semi-reasonable £24 for adults and £10 for kids. Drinks are pricey though – a ‘medium’ Coke is a whopping £4.70.

There aren’t dozens of bar and restaurant options in Billund. This is a small residential town with just 6000 or so inhabitants. The Lego HQ and factory dominates the area, but apparently, even most of its employees commute in from somewhere else.

Just 15 miles away (and served by a local bus route) is Givskud Zoo and an adjacent hostel, which is a great option if you’re looking to keep down the cost of your stay.

Givskud is actually part-zoo, part-safari and part-dinosaur park. Our kids enjoy driving among lions, elephants and giraffes, watching gorillas being fed, petting goats, getting up close to lemurs and then walking among 40 life-sized dinosaur models.

We spend our final night at the popular Ribe Byferie holiday village, about an hour’s drive from Billund. Ribe is Denmark’s oldest town and extremely picturesque, with a beautiful cobbled centre, and gorgeous shops and restaurants.

Our kids are a little young to appreciate local Viking history, but enjoy staying up to follow the town’s night watchman, as he gives a tour of the area and tells stories of yore.

If we’d had the time, we would have loved to explore Ribe on bicycle and maybe even try canoeing but, sitting at the swish Billund Airport, we reflect on what has been a fun-filled, action-packed few days.

The kids, meanwhile, are eyeing up the airport’s solitary toy shop. It only sells one brand of toy – no prizes for guessing what it is.

Facts

Legoland is open for its new season from April 2017 and booking is now available.

Warren was as a guest of VisitDenmark (www.visitdenmark.co.uk) and Legoland Billund Resort (www.legolandbillundresort.dk/en).

Hotel Legoland offers family rooms from £103 B&B (four people).

British Airways (www.britishairways.com) flies to Billund from London Heathrow from £42 one-way.

SADLY we know all too well that some patients in what used to be called ‘old folks homes’ suffering from forms of dementia are neglected and the level of ‘care’ is simply unacceptable.

There are of course many care homes where management and staff go ‘above and beyond’ to ensure that sufferers are looked after in the best way possible.

But we only hear about the bad ones and there are far too many places where lack of funds, lack of staff and lack of training means those suffering from one of the cruelest diseases of all aren’t getting the correct care.

Now it appears that there has been a hidden problem right under our noses which is even more cause for concern and was brought to light this week by the Alzheimer’s society.

They have discovered that many men and women with dementia are being cruelly neglected – not just in care homes but actually in their own homes.

When families can’t cope but a patient can still live at home, professional care is needed to ensure they are healthy and safe.

We all know there is lack of money due to spending cuts and elderly people with diseases like Alzheimer’s are at the bottom of a very long list of priorities, but this report makes particularly grim reading. The Alzheimer’s society discovered four in 10 care workers don’t have sufficient training and that patients were even being left without food and correct medication.

There is also a real worry that busy, overworked carers who are under enormous pressure, simply don’t have time to chat or interact with those they are supposed to be looking after and can treat them like “objects”. Heartbreaking.

It must be tough enough to see someone you love deteriorate and to lose them bit by bit and day by day to this disease, but the guilt and upset caused when they are not being properly looked after must tear families apart.

In an ideal world, friends and loved ones would rally round and there would be no need for “professional” carers.

But here in the real world families are fractured and often scattered far and wide with sons and daughters having to move away because of work commitments.

Plus it’s extremely demanding and exhausting to look after anyone with dementia; so no wonder families need to turn to the professionals, but it is clear that too many are being let down.

We need proper funding and carers who are well trained and paid properly. We can’t have cases like the 86-year-old man who was found confused on a busy road because his harassed carer had forgotten to lock the door.

Also this week there was a disturbing report from Age UK, who reckon that almost a million elderly people don’t get the help they need to live at home.

A cash injection to have people visiting them at home – who can help them to get dressed and make sure they eat their meals, and just have the time to have a chat with them – would make all the difference in the world.

We will all grow old one day and we deserve to be treated like human beings with a kind word and compassion from people who look after us.

It’s about time carers were given the respect they deserve and the wages their job merits.

Then the elderly and vulnerable will get looked after properly.

THE Post Office stands accused of closing its branches “by stealth” after a Sunday Post probe revealed scores have been shut “temporarily” for as long as five years.

Thirty two Post Offices – many of which serve Scotland’s most remote communities – have been closed for half a decade, yet Post Office bosses claim the situation is a “temporary fix”.

Union figures say the reality is a Post Office “in crisis” as our investigation paints a picture of a fast-disappearing network leaving elderly and isolated people across Scotland stranded.

The nation has lost 511 Post Offices since 2000 as part of a planned programme of shutdowns made public by the Post Office.

But a Freedom of Information probe has unveiled the true figure lost is 589, with 78 closures going unannounced as they are classified as “temporary” (figure has dropped from 1999 from 1410).

The Post Office maintains these branches could reopen but the Communication Workers’ Union (CWU) said it is virtually impossible to attract people to man a branch as many are “unsustainable” due to cutbacks and a lack of Government support.

Dave Ward, general secretary of the CWU, said: “While the Post Office describes these branches as being ‘temporarily’ closed, communities who haven’t had a post office service for well over a year won’t see it like that.

“For many people, the Post Office is a lifeline and these figures raise serious questions for the Post Office about whether these communities will ever have a branch again. With 78 post offices in Scotland having been closed for more than 12 months, this isn’t just one or two examples.

“Our fear is that alongside the decline of its traditional revenues, the cost-cutting we have seen in recent years means Post Offices are becoming unsustainable and can’t attract new people to take them on when a postmaster retires, particularly now that it is completely separate from Royal Mail.

The result of this is a closure programme by stealth and from what our own members are seeing, we believe the Post Office is in crisis.”

Some of the most remote parts of the country were among the hardest-hit. Almost half of the abandoned branches are in the sparsely-populated highlands and islands of Scotland where residents most need a lifeline.

Alistair Carmichael, MP for Orkney and Shetland, said some branches, such as Tankerness SAS in Orkney, were unlikely to reopen their doors and the Government’s target of putting a Post Office within three miles of 95% of the population in rural areas was not being met.

He called for the Post Office to be more upfront. “These figures will surprise no one in rural Scotland,” he said.

“The vast majority of these temporary closures will never open again and we would have a better picture of Post Office coverage if the Post Office were to admit this.

“At the very least there should be a period after which the Post Office should regard a temporary closure as being permanent and, in my view, that should be no more than two years.

“In remote and island communities, we rely more than most on having accessible Post Offices and I hear from many sub postmasters that the money paid per transaction isn’t enough to make a living.

“Until that’s sorted, the decline of rural Post Offices will continue.”

Turning to urban areas, Glasgow has been particularly hard-hit by temporary closures, losing six branches in the Stepps, Rogerfield, Sighthill, Killearn, Craigton and Penilee areas of the city.

Labour’s Glasgow MSP James Kelly laid the blame at the door of the UK Government. He said: “The Tory Government has to take responsibility and set out a proper strategy for the future of the Post Office.

“The public and businesses which rely on the Post Office have a right to expect more than a managed decline. That is why Labour is calling for a strategy to grow revenues and services as a matter of urgency.”

Tom Moran, Post Office general manager, said the number of branches is regularly reviewed and three new branches will open in Scotland in early 2017 with “more in the pipeline”.

“Our branch network is constantly changing – for example as a result of an existing postmasters leaving, or use of premises being withdrawn, and we work hard to avoid any break in service,” he said.

“A branch will only remain temporarily closed where no suitable operator comes forward to run it and we take every opportunity to restore the service if the circumstances change.”

It was a little while before I began automatically picturing Theresa May whenever I saw or heard the words Prime Minister.

When she first took up the reins, I kept writing David Cameron and then having to press delete. Force of habit, I guess.

It is taking me even longer to get used to Philip Hammond as Chancellor.

Even now, four months after he was sacked, George Osborne persistently pops into my head and I have to remind myself he’s no longer at the helm.

At the Tory party conference, the now not-so-new chancellor (yes, one Mr Hammond) had lots to say in his speech.

Although not proposing to end austerity altogether, he set out a radically different plan for the economy – ripping up his predecessor’s deficit reduction commitments.

But his delivery was underwhelming – some described the address as “that of a bank manager”.

So when he takes to the despatch box on Wednesday, he will be keen to assert his authority, to look the part.

The Autumn Statement is his first set-piece in the Commons and will be his first big test in the driving seat.

After all, it is no ordinary “fiscal event” as these things are officially dubbed.

As well as his debut, it is the first since the UK voted to leave the European Union.

And, with Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecasts to unveil, he won’t have the luxury his boss enjoys of simply deferring to the default “no running commentary” answer.

These are reportedly expected to reveal Britain faces a £100 billion black hole as a result of Brexit.

This would be the most damning indication so far of the financial impact of the June vote, although of course the forecast, is precisely that, a prediction and thus uncertain.

Hammond would not have been armed with all of this detail at the time of his Birmingham speech – seven weeks ago.

But with hindsight, it’s clear he was anticipating the worst and sought to get ahead of Wednesday’s prognosis.

With entirely understandable caution, he was doing the groundwork, paving the way for his big day.

Admitting the Brexit negotiations would be a rollercoaster ride for the economy and country, he abandoned Osborne’s goal of getting the UK’s finances into a surplus by 2020.

Instead he promised to shore up the raft, to take “whatever steps are necessary to protect this economy from turbulence”.

There were a few modest give-aways and he intimated tax cuts to stimulate activity could have a role in boosting confidence, alongside interest rate reductions.

It is likely the Chancellor will now move forward in the same vein.

With additional borrowing predicted, a large stimulus package is hardly on the cards, but analysts are anticipating some help for the so-called “Jams”.

The latest acronym to be adopted by Whitehall officials, it refers to families who are“just about managing”.

Policies thought to be under consideration include a freeze in fuel duty, confirmation of an increase in the tax-free personal allowance and bolstered support for childcare.

This would tally with the Prime Minister’s pitch to working class voters at conference – her pledge to run a country that works for everyone.

There is unlikely to be any help for the women adversely affected by the accelerated state pension increase, however, despite repeated calls by the SNP for the chancellor to use his mini-Budget to “right the injustice”.

Ian Blackford and Mhairi Black made an 11th-hour plea last week, but the pensions minister ruled out reversing the speeding up of the equalisation process in no uncertain terms.

Whatever Hammond says when he gets to his feet, not everyone will be happy and it is bound to be over-shadowed by the OBR forecasts.

But a good performance would help make the job his own, dispelling any remaining Osborne ghosts from the front bench.

If he again adopts the guise of bank manager Phil, then so be it.

Perhaps a bank manager is exactly what Britain needs as it negotiates Brexit and beyond.

Tory cheerleader for Brexit Owen Paterson has urged Theresa May to abandon the appeal of a High Court ruling on Article 50 for fear Holyrood could get the power to veto Brexit.

He joins senior Conservatives Sir Oliver Letwin, former attorney general Dominic Grieve and ex-solicitor general Sir Edward Garnier, who have made the same demand of the Prime Minister after the Scottish and Welsh Governments were given permission to intervene in the case.

Alex Salmond said the calls showed contempt for the rights of Scots.

The High Court ruled MPs should get a vote on triggering Article 50, which sets in motion the formal process of leaving the EU.

Sir Oliver, a Remain-backer who was formerly director of the Government’s Brexit unit, said avoiding the Supreme Court would avert a risk of judges granting “veto powers” to the Scottish and Welsh devolved administrations.

Brexit-backer Mr Paterson said Mrs May should concede defeat because uncertainty is bad for the economy.

He told the BBC: “I’m not a lawyer and I’m not an expert on this but … I wouldn’t have a bet on the Government winning this one.”

Sir Edward and Mr Grieve said Mrs May should now bring forward a Bill in Parliament as Labour has now committed not to block or delay Brexit.

Sir Edward said: “That way you avoid an unnecessary legal row, you avoid a lot of unnecessary expense but you also avoid an opportunity for ill-motivated people to attack the judiciary, to misconstrue the motives of both parties to the lawsuit, and you provide certainty.” Mr Grieve added: “I can’t see the point in the Government continuing with the case and also agree that if they enact primary legislation, they will get it through Parliament.”

Alex Salmond said the Tory figures’ position showed their contempt for Scotland’s rights.

The SNP’s Europe spokesman said: “Sir Oliver Letwin and co have now blurted out the true blue Tory attitude towards Scotland.

“They would even rather abandon the Brexit appeal than take any chance of the Supreme Court being sensitive to Scottish-European concerns.

“Every Tory in Scotland should cringe with embarrassment as the Tory contempt for Scotland’s rights as a nation has been laid bare. The trouble for the Tories in Scotland is that their Westminster colleagues have been caught telling the truth about their anti-Scottish prejudices.”

Police and members of the public have been honoured for their courage in the Police Scotland Bravery and Meritorious Service Awards.

Among those honoured are five young boys from Edinburgh who spotted a distressed woman entering a river and tried to stop her before calling the Coastguard.

Two off-duty Marie Curie nurses in Aberdeenshire also received awards for assisting an off-duty police officer who had been the victim of a hit-and-run road accident.

A total of 36 police and 21 members of the public were honoured at the ceremony at Police Scotland College in Tulliallan, Clackmannanshire.

Officers who received commendations included a constable who was able to prevent three men from intervening in an arrest in Glasgow, despite being hit in the face himself with an iron.

Also honoured were two Fife constables who were attacked by a member of the public with a Taser, and a sergeant in Edinburgh who helped saved the life of a man walking along the M8 motorway.

Chief Constable Phil Gormley presented the awards, and he said: “It is genuinely humbling to hear of the extraordinary lengths people have gone to, to help others. I was privileged to present these awards, meet the winners and to hear more about their stories.

“It is absolutely right we honour their bravery and show not only how proud we are of our police officers in Scotland, but also of members of the public who don’t hesitate to take action to help another person at what could be the most difficult time of that individual’s life.

“The actions of today’s winners – both officers and members of the public – have undoubtedly saved lives and touched the hearts of people across the country.

“People become police officers to help others – I hope these awards make more people consider policing as a career when they see the difference they could make to others in their day-to-day work.”

Justice Secretary Michael Matheson said: “This is a chance for us to recognise the actions of police officers and staff who have gone beyond the call of duty to help others in times of great need. Also members of the public who have shown true community spirit and put themselves at risk to help others, including five young people whose maturity and resourcefulness avoided a potentially tragic outcome.

“We are indebted to everyone receiving awards today. I have no doubt their actions have touched the lives of individuals, families and communities across the country. They serve as an inspiration to us all.”

Andrew Flanagan, chairman of the Scottish Police Authority, paid tribute to the loyalty and flexibility of officers and staff and said the awards were an opportunity to acknowledge and reward their outstanding work.

He added: “But importantly, the awards also give us the unique opportunity to acknowledge those members of the public who have helped policing to keep the people of Scotland safe. Congratulations to all today’s winners.”

PARKS across Scotland were awash in purple last weekend as Memory Walks took place all over the country.

Hundreds of walkers of all ages donned their purple T-shirts at seven walks in support of Alzheimer Scotland.

Nicola Love, from Airdrie, participated in the Lanarkshire event at Strathclyde Country Park in honour of her mum, Margaret Quinn, alongside sister Sharon and nieces Danielle and Megan.

“Mum was diagnosed at 58 with early on-set Alzheimer’s and she’s now 64,” Nicola explained.

This was Nicola and her family’s first Memory Walk but they’ll be back next year in bigger numbers.

“I organised a babysitter but once I saw the atmosphere I wished I had brought my kids,” she continued.

“We didn’t know anyone who had been diagnosed at such a young age as my mum, so it was great to speak with people on the walk and realise there are others going through the same thing as us.

“Mum still lives with my dad, who is her full-time carer.

“We noticed it coming on. She worked as a janitor at a local primary school for 25 years and began struggling to fill in her time sheet.

“We also spotted a change in her personality.”

Eventually a diagnosis was made and Alzheimer Scotland appointed a care worker to offer help and advice. At the Forth Valley walk in Stirling last Sunday, three generations of Nan Oswald’s family showed their support as she got the walk under way.

Among her relatives taking part were Michael and Margo Kucsera, who came all the way from California to be part of the big day.

There were also walks held in Moray, Aberdeen and Wigtownshire, while two of the best attended were held in Dalkeith Country Park, near Edinburgh, and Kelvingrove Park in Glasgow.

Among those in attendance at Glasgow was Still Game and River City actor, Sanjeev Kohli. “There’s no one in my

family who has dementia but I’m well aware it could happen to anyone,” he said.

“As a country we are living longer, so this is becoming more of an issue.

“I think people are more understanding of dementia than we used to be and it’s important we take the power away from the condition by talking about it.”

Cutting the ribbon at the Glasgow walk was Ian Dunn and his wife, Agnes.

This was their third year doing a Memory Walk following retired engineer Ian’s Alzheimer’s diagnosis five years ago, when he was 71.

“Ian’s short-term memory is the real issue,” Agnes said.

“It was our son’s wedding recently and Ian can’t remember it. It’s a strange world for us, but he enjoys the moments at the time.

“He’s also physically fit and doesn’t take life too seriously.

“We’re part of a walking group and three dementia cafes, which has allowed us to meet lots of new friends, who are all going through similar challenges at varying levels.

“With Alzheimer Scotland around I know I’m never isolated and the Memory Walks are an extension of that.”

More fundraisers pulled on their walking shoes yesterday for the Fife event at Lochgelly, while another four take place today – in Dundee, Bathgate, Dumfries and Helensburgh. You can register and pay on the day.

The final Memory Walk happens in Inverness next Saturday.

EVERYONE’S been there: you want chocolate – and you want it now.

That was the case for world famous pop star Beyonce when she visited Glasgow last week.

Hit with a serious case of the sweet-toothed munchies ahead of her sell-out show at Glasgow’s Hampden Stadium on Thursday, she despatched an aide to bring her some sweet treats.

But when a member of the 34-year-old’s entourage returned with Dairy Milk bought on the High Street, they were immediately told its cocoa content wasn’t high enough, and despatched to try again.

Second time round, the worker hit the right notes after trying a specialist chocolate shop in Glasgow city centre.

They ended up in Kimbles where the manager was thrilled to help out, as they stock chocolate made with more than 35% cocoa solids, ticking Beyonce’s check list.

Chris Kimble, manager of Kimbles, said he believed Beyonce wanted a bar with a high cocoa content as it’s, generally speaking, less fattening.

“We had one of Beyonce’s entourage in our St Enoch Centre branch to look for quality chocolate,” he told The Sunday Post.

“We were able to help him out and he took back the chocolate to Beyonce for her to enjoy.

“They ordered four bars of Cachet chocolate, around a kilo in total, at £4 each: three bars of organic dark and one bar of creamy milk.

“They had to be over 35% because she knows her chocolate.

“First of all the guy actually went out and bought a cheaper chocolate – Cadbury’s Dairy Milk – and was then sent out to get a different type of chocolate because it wasn’t deemed good enough.

“When he came in he introduced himself because he want a premium brand product.

“He had a list of other things he needed to pick up specifically for her.

“Unfortunately I didn’t get to see what else she wanted.

“All is saw was chocolate over 35% cocoa and it was double underlined.

“It’s was very cool.”

The singer made her chocolate request on World Chocolate Day, a global celebration of the beloved sweet stuff.

And it’s clear she’s a big fan of the treat.

After her daughter Blue Ivy was born back in January 2012, the bootylicious star went on a strict diet to shed her baby weight.

The Texan singer stuck religiously to her diet, telling fans at a US show later that year: “Y’all have no idea how hard I worked!

“I had to lose 60 pounds. They had me on that treadmill. I ate lettuce!

“Now tonight I’m gonna get chocolate wasted!”

Beyonce brought her sell-out Formation tour show to the national stadium on Thursday.

The Crazy in Love singer blew away a 50,000 strong crowd with a medley of knockout hits.

And the energetic performance clearly worked off all those choccie calories, as afterwards she swamped a newly-opened Mexican fast food place with a mega-order.

Staff at Barburrito in Glasgow received an order consisting of 441 tacos, two naked burritos and 78 portions of chips with guacamole for 13 bus loads of people, including the production team and crew.

Iain Gallie, the chain’s Scots operation manager, said: “I think they were pretty happy that we were able to turn the order around so quickly.

“We hope everyone enjoyed it.”

A 2011 poll by MoneySavingExpert declared Dairy Milk Britain’s favourite chocolate.

It was closely followed by Galaxy, in second place, and Snickers, the peanut treat which used to be called a Marathon, in third.

Last fall, Toby Young did something ironic. Toby is the son of Michael Young, the British sociologist and Labour life peer whose 1958 satire The Rise of the Meritocracy has been credited with coining the term. Toby has become an education reformer in his own right, as founder of the West London Free School, after a celebrated career as a journalist and memoirist (How to Lose Friends and Alienate People). In September, he published an 8,000-word reconsideration of his father’s signature concept in an Australian monthly. The old man was right that meritocracy would gradually create a stratified and immobile society, he wrote, but wrong that abolishing selective education was the cure. “Unlike my father, I’m not an egalitarian.” If meritocracy creates a new caste system, “the answer is more meritocracy.” To restore equality of opportunity, he suggested subsidies for intelligence-maximizing embryo selection for poor parents “with below-average IQs.” The irony lay in the implication that Young, because of who his father was, has special insight into the ideology that it shouldn’t matter who your father was.

His outlandish resort to eugenics suggests that Toby Young found himself at a loss for solutions, as all modern critics of meritocracy seem to do. The problems they describe are fundamental, but none of their remedies are more than tweaks to make the system more efficient or less prejudicial to the poor. For instance, in Excellent Sheep, William Deresiewicz accuses the Ivy League of imposing a malignant ruling class on the country, then meekly suggests that elite universities might solve the problem by giving greater weight in admissions to socioeconomic disadvantage and less to “résumé-stuffing.” In The Tyranny of the Meritocracy, Lani Guinier belies the harsh terms of her title by advising that we simply learn to reward “democratic rather than testocratic merit.” Christopher Hayes subtitled his debut book Twilight of the Elites “America after Meritocracy,” but the remedies he prescribes are all meant to preserve meritocracy by making it more effective. In his latest book, Our Kids, Robert Putnam proves that American social mobility is in crisis, then reposes his hopes in such predictable nostrums as housing vouchers and universal pre-kindergarten.

When an author caps two hundred pages of rhetorical fire with fifteen pages of platitudes or utopian fantasy, that is called “the last chapter problem.” When every author who takes up a question finds himself equally at a loss, that is something else. In this case, our authors fail as critics of meritocracy because they cannot get their heads outside of it. They are incapable of imagining what it would be like not to believe in it. They assume the validity of the very thing they should be questioning.

But what would it be like not to take meritocracy for granted? The basic idea—that we should rank candidates for power according to some desirable quality, then pick the best of them—seems too obvious to have needed inventing, but invented it was, and (at least in the West) not so long ago. If we go back to the occasion of its first appearance in the English-speaking world, we will find a group of men who opposed it, not just because they did not think it would work in practice, but because they disagreed with it in principle. Meritocracy had a beginning and a middle and may yet have an end, and the beginning is exactly where the man who coined the term said it was on the very first page of his book: the Northcote-Trevelyan Report of 1854.

* * * * *

King George III is said to have remarked that any man was fit to occupy any government post he could manage to get. That is about as far as someone of his generation was likely to go in justifying patronage. Mostly it was accepted as a fact of politics. A party democracy required political workers, and without civil service jobs to distribute to the faithful, how could parties persuade anyone to work for them? Patronage was seen then as cash donations are now: seedy, no doubt, and definitely vulnerable to corruption, but not illegitimate. Benjamin Disraeli, in this as in so much else, formed a bridge between Georgian laxity and Victorian moral justification, writing in 1858, “Patronage is the outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace, and that is Power.”

This sacramental reasoning meant nothing to the Protestant reformers then coming of age, and certainly not to Sir Charles Trevelyan. Thomas Babington Macaulay is today considered the archetype of liberal Clapham Sect self-satisfaction, and even he thought his brother-in-law was a prig. “His mind is full of schemes of moral and political improvement,” Macaulay wrote of Trevelyan when they were in India together. “His topics even in courtship are steam navigation, the education of the natives, the equalization of sugar duties.” This did not prevent Macaulay from using his influence to have Trevelyan appointed senior permanent secretary to the Treasury in 1840, although he never told him of this intervention. History might have turned out differently if he had. As it was, Trevelyan thought his promotion was a case of virtue rewarded, and he returned to England more convinced than ever of the merit principle.

So when William Gladstone needed a second chairman for his inquiry into civil service reform, in addition to Sir Stafford Northcote, his own former private secretary, he knew that Charles Trevelyan was someone he could rely on to return the answer he wanted. A consensus had arisen that something ought to be done about the civil service, which had become disorganized, unaccountable, and inefficient—Tite Barnacle of the Circumlocution Office made his appearance in Charles Dickens’s Little Dorrit around this time. Gladstone’s particular concern, as chancellor of the exchequer, was the expense of maintaining hacks and protégés in their sinecures, and his innate moral prissiness inclined him toward competitive examination as a way of removing all discretion, and thus temptation, from ministers at a single stroke.

It took less than eight months for Northcote and Trevelyan to complete their report, which is only twenty-three pages long. Fortunately for them, it appeared just as the Crimean War debacles were arousing public clamor for administrative reform. (No one seems to have noted that the military commissary system, as part of the Treasury, was under Trevelyan’s supervision.) The report recommended that all new recruits to the government service be subject to some form of examination by a central civil service commission. At minimum, a qualifying examination in basic spelling and arithmetic would keep out obvious incompetents. Better would be a competitive examination of university-level difficulty, to be conducted on a set date each year, in a handful of locations, in a range of available subjects from Greek to chemistry. Anyone could take the test, no sponsorship required. However many vacancies there were in the civil service that year, exactly that many names would be accepted from the top of the list of scores.

Public reaction was divided. Like most reform-minded liberals, John Stuart Mill was exultant: “Competitive examination appears to me to be one of those great public improvements the adoption of which would form an era in history.” The headmaster of Harrow admitted that beneficiaries of the status quo might make reform difficult to enact, but, he said, “I can scarcely understand the existence of two opinions as to its abstract desirableness.” But for the bulk of Englishmen who were not yet accustomed to test taking as a feature of life outside the schoolroom, it seemed (in the words of a later historian) “like the intrusion into the world of politics of a scheme of cause and effect derived from another universe—as if one should propose to the Stock Exchange that the day’s prices should be fixed by prayer and the casting of lots.”

Trevelyan canvassed opinions of the finished report from headmasters, professors, and mandarins, and it is remarkable how unanimously the educators favored the plan and how unanimously the mandarins opposed it. The report’s finely phrased ideas would collapse in practice, the latter warned. For instance, replacing promotion by seniority with more subjective “promotion according to merit” would give free rein to favoritism. In departments that had experimented with qualifying exams, supervisors found that the tests put money in the pockets of “crammers” but did little for productivity. To its opponents, the whole thing smelled like a schoolmasters’ scheme. In Anthony Trollope’s The Three Clerks—the first and as far as I know the only satirical novel written against the Northcote-Trevelyan reforms—the character modeled on Oxford don and reform booster Benjamin Jowett fantasizes about the day when “every man in England should . . . be made to pass through some ‘go.’ The green-grocer’s boy should not carry out cabbage unless his fitness for cabbage-carrying had been ascertained.” As a civil servant himself, Trollope suspected that this proliferation of examinations would benefit no one but the examiners.

There was also worry about what throwing competition open to all comers would do to the service’s social tone. “The more the civil service is recruited from the lower classes, the less it will be sought after by the higher,” warned the MP Edward Romilly. This was not mere snobbery. If the government wanted civil servants who could face down MPs, financiers, and foreign statesmen, it had to recruit men of comparable social standing. Robert Lowe, who as Gladstone’s chancellor did more than anyone to put the Northcote-Trevelyan reforms into practice, nevertheless thought the service ought to remain at least partly aristocratic. Class was no guarantee of merit, he thought, but it nevertheless constituted “a sort of freemasonry among men which is not very easy to describe but which everybody feels.”

Perhaps Lowe was thinking of his schooldays at Winchester and the famous “fags’ rebellion” of 1829, which was sparked when the school decided to appoint the top scholars in the senior class as prefects, instead of the “haughty heroes of the playing field” who had always been appointed before. Underclassmen revolted, and Lowe—one of the unathletic prefects deposed—had an early lesson that people will decide for themselves what kinds of authority they will recognize.

* * * * *

Other objections approached closer to the principle. There were, first of all, questions of democratic accountability. Civil servants who felt they owed their jobs to no one and nothing but their own merit would be independent, which was also to say impervious to checks and balances. They would not derive their power from the people even by so remote a means as a parliamentary patron. Ralph Lingen of the Education Office begged Trevelyan to remember that the voters of England were used to treating office as among “the legitimate prizes of war” after elections, “not merely for its emoluments, but also for the sake of influencing administration.” It was almost a kind of direct democracy.

A greater concern was that meritocracy would produce an overweening centralized state. The Prussian precedent left Walter Bagehot wary of “establishing, virtually for the first time in England, an organized Bureaucracy.” On the floor of the House of Commons, MPs brandished warnings from Tocqueville and Montalembert against following imperial France’s example, which would inevitably lead to administrative tyranny, the creation of a political clerisy, and “a venal and servile humor” to supplant the English spirit of liberty. Gladstone replied that such worries were “idle, pusillanimous, and womanish,” since Parliament could be trusted to keep the civil service in its place. “In certain continental states the experiment may be perilous, but in England you may make the Civil Service as strong as you please.”

Hearing this, Robert Cecil (later Lord Salisbury) rose to say that “he did not regard that fear as so groundless and unfounded as the right honorable Gentleman appeared to do.” Salisbury’s comprehensive case against Northcote-Trevelyan was dismissed by Gladstone biographer John Morley as “the lazy doctrine that men are much of a muchness.” Beyond ensuring that candidates could spell and add, he thought that selecting the most intelligent men you could find was unnecessary—even positively harmful. Such men would be arrogant and argumentative, and would “look upon their duties as beneath their abilities.” This was not mere speculation, but the attested experience of their supervisors in departments where examination had been implemented. One bitter customs officer cited by Salisbury complained of “a self-sufficiency and presumption, from an imagined superiority in having undergone such examination, and a desire for literature in business, which I have been obliged to check.” This arrogance was bad enough around the office, Salisbury believed, but to the extent that it encompassed the public, it was a threat to their liberties.

More generally, Salisbury predicted that competitive examination would dangerously transform the spirit of government. As he saw it, reformers were seeking to automate the art of politics in a way “manifestly repugnant to the commonest and not the worst feelings of our nature.” Rattling off instances of patronage exercised nobly by Sir Walter Scott, Samuel Johnson, and Robert Peel, Salisbury asked whether it was worth abjuring such acts merely to keep out a handful of slow-witted copyists: “Why should favour and friendship, kindness and gratitude, which are not banished by men from private life, be absolutely excluded from public affairs?” And in the effort to eliminate all unmathematical considerations from the exercise of power, what other human qualities might not be driven out? Mercy? Flexibility? Loyalty to country? It was a dangerous and metastatic idea, this notion that statesmen could govern by formula.

Then again, Salisbury was a reactionary who never had a good word for progress of any kind. The same could not be said of open competition’s other vocal opponent, Sir James Stephen, whose credibility as a liberal was matched only by his reputation as an administrator of genius. His long experience in Whitehall had led him to believe, like Salisbury, that “the man whose name stood half way down the examinations list of merit would probably make a better clerk than he whose name stood first”—not as good a clerk, but better. Working for the government did not offer enough scope for the talents and ambitions of the men at the top of the list. Nor should it, a small-government man like Salisbury would have added.

But like a good Victorian liberal, Stephen objected mainly on humanitarian grounds. According to the findings of the Northcote-Trevelyan Report, the civil service deserved its reputation as a stashing place for crippled, blind, deaf, and sickly clerks (some of whom, it neglected to add, were highly competent). Stephen admitted the charge with pride. “Patronage exercised in the spirit of nepotism is made the shelter of the weak and otherwise helpless,” he wrote to Trevelyan. “Those whom nature or training have made strong can usually help themselves.” Worse, if the meritocratic principle were widely adopted, Stephen suspected that a surprising number of men would discover to their dismay that they stood in relation to the talented minority as cripples and deaf-mutes stood in relation to themselves. “A detur digniori world [one in which merit decides] would, I imagine, be a world made up of despots and slaves.”

So who turned out to be right, merit’s boosters, or its naysayers? The boosters made surprisingly few specific predictions, apart from asserting that, in general, men chosen on a more rational basis would be superior. It is thus hard to tell whether appointment by merit fulfilled their expectations for it. “The adoption of open competition in 1870 seemed to obviate any necessity for further consideration not only of the method by which officials were appointed but also of the system under which they did their work,” reflected a Fabian progressive in 1908. Competitive examination, “like the wedding in a middle-Victorian novel, was to be the end of the story.”

There is no question that the size of government did explode. The staff of the civil service tripled in fifty years and then doubled in ten, hitting 281,000 on the eve of World War I. Obviously, this was mainly because the government had taken on so many more tasks—but one reason for that was that the public had come to trust that the government was full of people who knew what they were doing. Interference that would have never been tolerated in the bad old days of jobbery was now justified by the national government’s (largely meretricious) mystique as a repository of intelligence. Herbert Spencer, usually a great fan of competition, complained that under competitive examination “men who might otherwise reprobate further growth of officialism are led to look on it with tolerance, if not favourably.” It was a self-perpetuating dynamic, too. A complicated budget like Lloyd George’s demanded more intelligence to implement than the straightforward arithmetic of the Victorian tax system—and once you’ve hired a cadre of clever men, why not get the most out of them?

Bagehot had warned that the smart young men ensnared by open competition would “only mope, wither, and blaspheme in the Public Departments.” If only he had been right. Alas, Bagehot forgot that intelligent people who are bored by their jobs will make their jobs interesting as far as possible—which, when civil servants do it, is not necessarily to the public good. The domestic departments began hunting around for problems to solve, whether anyone wanted their solutions or not, and the Colonial Office started meddling even more in the decisions of local officials. Anytime a district officer cabled home about a dispute, headquarters would examine the question from every angle with lingering attention, rummaging for precedents and murmuring “Most intriguing!” Meanwhile, the man on the spot was desperate to make a decision, any decision, regardless of whether it was consistent with what had been done under Shippard in Bechuanaland in 1885.

The Colonial Office became especially notorious for its highhandedness, probably because the rough, active men it supervised had in many cases gone abroad in the first place from a lack of prospects at home. Permanent Undersecretary Robert Meade’s comment in 1892 that colonial governors were “very inferior persons” was typical. But this was emphatically not the old arrogance of the landed aristocracy. (Meade himself was a meritocrat of unimposing background.) The debate in the days of Northcote-Trevelyan had been over whether open competition would benefit the middle class or the upper class. Gladstone and Trevelyan both thought the latter, and they considered this a mark in its favor. In the event, neither side in that debate turned out to be correct. Meritocracy called into being an entirely new class, partly taken from the old gentry, partly from the new commercial class, and loyal to neither. Between 1870 and World War I, this new class took possession of all the former pillars of the old aristocracy’s power, not just the civil service but the army, the bar, local government, party associations, and the church.

This was the significance of Northcote-Trevelyan. The merit principle was like a virus in the code of the British polity; the class it created was perfectly designed to sweep all before it. In the same way that religious fanatics and nationalists can sometimes defeat ordinary soldiers from sheer fervor of belief, so the meritocrats prevailed by being more convinced of their own superiority than the old grandees had ever been, with none of that deo gratias nonsense to keep them humble, either.

Another battlefield advantage of the meritocrats was mobility. A good way to measure their takeover of national politics is to look at the percentage of rural MPs who were born in their constituencies—the sharp decline in Cheshire, from 70 percent (1832–85) to 25 percent (1885–1918), was not unusual. The new men, as David Cannadine writes in The Decline and Fall of the British Aristocracy, were primarily “outsiders, professionals, and trade-union leaders, men with no local links or of limited standing in the community.” Local government went the same way, as its responsibilities became too much for the amateur mayors and magistrates of the local gentry, and professionals had to be imported. As Cannadine explains, “The patrician element on the county councils had not been undermined by the lower-class democrats, as had been feared initially, so much as by the upstart bureaucrats.”

Therein lies the essence of the story. The purpose of the old aristocracy, in its own mind, had been to act as a counterweight to the plutocracy on one hand and the impulsive common masses on the other. It turned out the aristocrats had more to fear from the bureaucratic class than from either of these. In their responsibility to prevent that class from dominating the state, the aristocrats failed utterly. This defeat was not just the replacement of one ruling class by another, but the end of the venerable system of social checks and balances that not even monarchs and Chartists had been able to upset. This made the meritocracy’s victory in England almost more impressive than its later, more comprehensive victory in the United States.

* * * * *

Meritocracy began by destroying an aristocracy; it has ended in creating a new one. Nearly every book in the American anti-meritocracy literature makes this charge, in what is usually its most empirically reinforced chapter. Statistics on the decline of social mobility are not lacking. In 1985, less than half of students at selective colleges came from families in the top income quartile; in 2010, 67 percent did. For those authors brave enough to cite Charles Murray (as Robert Putnam, for one, was not), Coming Apart documents quantitatively the growing tendency of the members of America’s cognitive elite to marry each other, live near each other in “Super Zips,” and launch their children into the same schools, and thence onto the same path to worldly success. Deresiewicz puts this betrayal of the democratic impulse neatly: “Our new multiracial, gender-neutral meritocracy has figured out a way to make itself hereditary.”

But the solutions on offer never rise to the scale of the problem. Authors attack the meritocratic machine with screwdrivers, not sledgehammers, and differ only in which valve they want to adjust. Some think the solution is to tip more disadvantaged kids over the lip of the intake funnel, which would probably make things worse. If more people start competing for a finite number of slots, slim advantages like those that come from having grown up with two meritocrats for parents will only loom larger. And has anyone asked working-class families if being sucked into a frantically achievement-obsessed rat race is a benefaction they are interested in?

Others favor the slightly more radical solution of redefining our idea of merit, usually in a way that downplays what Guinier calls “pseudoscientific measures of excellence.” She even has a replacement in mind, the Bial-Dale College Adaptability Index, the testing of which involves Legos. (Why are you laughing? It is backed by a study.) This is even less likely to work than fiddling with the equality-of-opportunity end. For one thing, the minority of families willing to do whatever it takes to get into Harvard will still do whatever it takes to get into Harvard. They have adapted to new admissions criteria before, and they will do so again. Furthermore, unless families are abolished, successful parents will always pass on advantages to their children, which will compound with each generation. It does not matter how merit is defined; the dynamic of meritocracy remains the same, its operations inexorable.

My solution is quite different. The meritocracy is hardening into an aristocracy—so let it. Every society in history has had an elite, and what is an aristocracy but an elite that has put some care into making itself presentable? Allow the social forces that created this aristocracy to continue their work, and embrace the label. By all means this caste should admit as many worthy newcomers as is compatible with their sense of continuity. New brains, like new money, have been necessary to every ruling class, meritocratic or not. If ethnic balance is important to meritocrats, by all means they should engineer it into the system. If geographic diversity strikes them as important, they should ensure that it exists, ideally while keeping an eye on the danger of hoovering up all of the native talent from regional America. But they must give up any illusion that such tinkering will make them representative of the country over which they preside. They are separate, parochial in their values, unique in their responsibilities. That is what makes them aristocratic.

A tough sell, I realize. Not since the Society of the Cincinnati has a ruling elite so vehemently disclaimed any resemblance to an aristocracy. The structure of the economy abets the elite in its delusion, since even the very rich are now more likely to earn their money from employment than from capital, and thus find it easier to think of themselves as basically working stiffs. As cultural consumers they are careful to look down their noses at nothing except country music. All manner of low-class fare—rap, telenovelas, Waffle House—is embraced by what Shamus Rahman Khan calls the “omnivorous pluralism” of our elite. “It is as if the new elite are saying, ‘Look! We are not some exclusive club. If anything, we are the most democratized of all groups.’”

Khan’s Privilege: The Making of an Adolescent Elite at St. Paul’s School is a fascinating document, because he seems to have been genuinely surprised by what he found when he returned to his old boarding school to teach for a year. Khan, the grandson of Irish and Pakistani peasants, worked his way to a Columbia University professorship in sociology via St. Paul’s and Haverford College, so he thought he knew meritocrats—but today’s breed gave him a bit of a fright. For one thing, they proved to be excellent haters. Consider how they talk about a legacy student whose background can be inferred from the pseudonym Khan gives him, “Chase Abbott”:

After seeing me chatting with Chase, a boy I was close with, Peter, expressed what many others would time and again: “that guy would never be here if it weren’t for his family.… I don’t get why the school still does that. He doesn’t bring anything to this place.” Peter seemed annoyed with me for even talking with Chase. Knowing that I was at St. Paul’s to make sense of the school, Peter made sure to point out to me that Chase didn’t really belong there.… Faculty, too, openly lamented the presence of students like Chase.

“Openly lamented”! Poor Chase. This hatred is out of all proportion to the power still held by the Chases of the school, which is almost nil. Khan discovers that the few legacy WASPs live together in a sequestered dorm, just like the “minority dorm” of his own schooldays, and even the alumni “point to students like Chase as examples of what is wrong about St. Paul’s.” No, the hatred of students like Chase feels more like the resentment born of having noticed an unwelcome resemblance. It is somehow unsurprising to learn that Peter’s parents met at Harvard.

Of course, Peter is not at St. Paul’s because his parents went to Harvard; as he makes clear to Khan, he is there because of his hard work and academic achievement. Here we have the meritocratic delusion most in need of smashing: the notion that the people who make up our elite are especially smart. They are not—and I do not mean that in the feel-good democratic sense that we are all smart in our own ways, the homely-wise farmer no less than the scholar. I mean that the majority of meritocrats are, on their own chosen scale of intelligence, pretty dumb. Grade inflation first hit the Ivies in the late 1960s for a reason. Yale professor David Gelernter has noticed it in his students: “They are so ignorant that it’s hard to accept how ignorant they are. It’s very hard to grasp that the person you’re talking to, who is bright, articulate, conversable, interested, doesn’t know who Beethoven is. Looking back at the history of the twentieth century, just sees a fog.” Camille Paglia once assigned the spiritual “Go Down, Moses” to an English seminar, only to discover to her horror that “of a class of twenty-five students, only two seemed to recognize the name ‘Moses’.… They did not know who he was.”

Once again, Khan uncovers the clue to this phenomenon by letting his St. Paul’s students speak for themselves:

“I don’t actually know much,” an alumnus told me after he finished his freshman year at Harvard. “I mean, well, I don’t know how to put it. When I’m in classes all these kids next to me know a lot more than I do. Like about what actually happened in the Civil War. Or what France did in World War II. I don’t know any of that stuff. But I know something they don’t. It’s not facts or anything. It’s how to think. That’s what I learned in humanities.” “What do you mean, ‘how to think’?” I asked. “I mean, I learned how to think bigger. Like, everyone else at Harvard knew about the Civil War. I didn’t. But I knew how to make sense of what they knew about the Civil War and apply it. So they knew a lot about particular things. I knew how to think about everything.”

“How to think bigger” is indeed a fine quality for a governing class to have, but this young man was cheated if his teachers tried to cultivate it as a skill in isolation and not via the discipline of learning “particular things.” It was the meritocratic ideology that paved this road to ignorance. Being open to all comers, with intelligence the only criterion, meant that no particular body of knowledge could be made mandatory at an institution like St. Paul’s, lest it arbitrarily exclude students conversant only with their own traditions. This has predictably yielded a generation of students who have no body of knowledge at all—not even “like about what actually happened in the Civil War.”

Unlike meritocracies, aristocracies can put actual content into their curricula—not just academically, but morally. Every aristocracy has an ethos, and a good ethos will balance out the moral faults to which that aristocracy is prone. The upper-class WASPs who constituted “the Establishment” in twentieth-century America were very rich, so they instilled in their children a Puritan asceticism. The Whig grandees of eighteenth-century Britain, who were the opposite of ascetic, cultivated a spirit of usefulness to check their tendency toward idleness. The besetting sin of the current elite seems to be arrogance, both moral and intellectual, with humorlessness a close second. To address the first, their acculturating institutions might try putting greater emphasis on humility—and they may find that learning how to laugh at oneself is one way this virtue can be acquired.

There is a wonderfully sad anecdote about Kingman Brewster, the man who as president of Yale did more than any other individual to create the modern meritocracy. In his first portentous strike at the WASP elite that reared him, he turned down his Skull and Bones tap on anti-elitist grounds. He then hopped on his bicycle and rushed to boast of his principled stand to A. Whitney Griswold, his ultra-WASPy but reform-minded mentor, whom he would succeed as Yale president two decades later. Far from being impressed, Griswold was not even home to receive him—he was across town at his own secret society, Wolf’s Head, for its Tap Night ceremonies. The poignancy of this story lies in the realization that, for all his Mayflower pedigree, Brewster really did not understand at all the class he would destroy. In retrospect, it seems likely that Brewster could have achieved all he desired—a more diverse student body, a more rigorous academic curriculum, a more liberal general atmosphere—by building upon the existing virtues of Old Yale, its sense of public duty and fair play. Unfortunately, he was blind to these virtues. So he did the only thing contempt can do: He destroyed.

The task of reforming our present elite ought to be entrusted to someone with a feeling for what is good in it. For all its flaws, this elite does have many virtues. Their moral seriousness contrasts favorably with the frivolousness of certain earlier generations, and their sense of pragmatism, which can sometimes be reductive, can also be admirably brisk and hard-nosed. What is needed is someone who can summon a picture of the meritocratic elite’s best selves and call them to meet its example. But this process can begin only when this new ruling class finally owns up to the only name for what it already, undeniably is.",1,https://herandrews.com/2016/07/01/the-new-ruling-class/

Thank you for signing up to our Sunday Post newsletter.

Get a weekly round-up of stories from The Sunday Post:

Soaring numbers of claims are being brought against big-name carriers because they have refused to cough up damages to people whose trips have been ruined.

Lawyers claim passengers are being forced to take the desperate step because airlines are simply ignoring their complaints.

They have accused well-known budget firms such as easyJet and Ryanair as being among the worst culprits.

Daniel Morris, director of aviation law specialists FairPlane UK, said: “It sounds ridiculous, but it is the only way we can obtain compensation for passengers within a reasonable time frame.

“In some cases airlines have even confirmed in writing that they owe this money, and have agreed a timescale to pay it, but have simply failed to do so.

“They are simply playing the system.”

FairPlane is currently dealing with more than 3,000 claims from disgruntled passengers – with fresh cases brought every week.

Specialist lawyers from another firm, Bott & Co, have another 7,000 on their books and say they have already settled claims for almost 45,000 people.

Unless there are exceptional circumstances, passengers are entitled to compensation of between £180 and £430 if their flight lands three or more hours late.

Airlines have a duty to let passengers know about their right to a pay-out but often wait for court proceedings to be issued until settling compensation claims.

Lawyers say excuses such as bad weather, staff sickness and technical faults have been used to dodge paying money rightfully owed to their customers.

Most cases are settled before court action but, in one extreme case highlighted to the Sunday Post, bailiffs were ordered to chase a well-known carrier for money.

The case involves a customer, who did not wish to be named, whose easyJet flight on July 29 from the UK to Milan was late.

Despite admitting the delayed customer was entitled to compensation, the airline failed to pay out.

Last week, he was still waiting to be paid, despite FairPlane instructing bailiffs to visit easyJet’s headquarters on January 26 to recover funds.

Kevin Clarke, flight delay lawyer with Bott & Co, right, said European rules on compensation payments are crystal clear but that has not stopped airlines from making the pay out system “very complicated”.

“To my mind, it is really clear what their responsibilities are,” he said. “The law says you have a duty of care to your passengers if flights are delayed.”

Online company AirHelp – which assists air passengers secure compensation for delayed, cancelled or overbooked flights – has ranked 27 of the world’s airlines according to how well they deal with flight compensation claims.

It named easyJet as among the worst airlines for dealing with compensation claimants. Ryanair was also high on the list.

Co-founder of AirHelp Nicolas Michaelsen said the “overwhelming” number of cases which go to court went in favour of the customer. They include Sandra Dunbar, from Glasgow, who won compensation when she was stranded for more than six hours when a flight from Malaga, Spain, to her home city was held up.

easyJet said the delay was caused by bad weather.

They argued the flight was late because of “extraordinary circumstances” and refused to stump up the compensation Ms Dunbar was owed.

But at Paisley Sheriff Court, Sheriff Derek Livingston ordered the company to pay £283 compensation, as well as covering her £78 legal costs.

The sheriff accused Stuart Trounson, an operations officer with easyJet, of making a “gross exaggeration” by claiming it was impossible to avoid the delay without having “an unlimited amount of spare aircraft”.

At the time, an easyJet spokesman said the airline was “disappointed” by the ruling, adding: “We always ensure that appropriate measures are taken to avoid disruption to flights during extraordinary circumstances.”

Mr Michaelsen said the firm also took easyJet to court after the airline drafted a cheque containing a spelling mistake.

AirHelp contacted easyJet “countless times” over the error but they “ignored all requests to draft a new cheque”.

“We have been working on this particular case since July, and the passenger is still waiting on their money,” said Mr Michaelsen.

He added: “In the long run, employing such tactics only ends up resulting in overall customer dissatisfaction and eventual loss of business, which in turn, is a real financial threat to the airline industry.”

A spokesman revealed the CAA has received nearly 25,000 complaints since October 2012.

The airline industry has accused legal firms of attempting to cash in on the law change, fuelling a rampant compensation culture with slick sales pitches and ads touting their services.

Key defender of the industry is easyJet, which last night strongly refuted claims it deliberately uses tactics to delay customers’ claims.

A spokesman said the airline takes its responsibilities under airline compensation laws “very seriously” and would pay compensation to passengers “when it’s due”.

He said: “The rules for when this is payable are now very clear and the process for customers to claim has been made simple and apply to all airlines equally.”

He said customers who believe they are due compensation can complete a form on easyJet’s website.

“We try and get back to them within three working days with an answer and if payment is due, aim to have the money in their account within a further 21 days,” he said.

“We are working to speed this process up with the aim of refunding within seven days.”

“Our understanding is that no other airline in Europe will consistently provide this level of service.” Ryanair also insisted it adheres to the Euro edict, paying out compensation where appropriate.

A spokesman for the airline said: “The fact that we receive the fewest complaints highlights how irrelevant these ‘statistics’ are.”

From the December 7, 2015, issue of NR

The progressive resurgence that began sometime between Brendan Eich’s resignation from Mozilla and the burning down of the Ferguson QuikTrip has turned into something more than just another turn around the culture-war maypole. When the Confederate flag came down over the state capitol in Columbia — South Carolina! — that was a portent. When TV Land pulled The Dukes of Hazzard from its broadcast lineup over the roof decal on the General Lee, that was another. A cable channel that shows four hours a day of Gunsmoke reruns is not the Berkeley sociology department. Then the Memphis city council crossed the crucial messing-with-corpses threshold, voting in July to exhume from a public park, and relocate, the remains of a Confederate general and his wife. Two weeks later, protesters calling themselves the Commission on Religion and Racism attacked the grave with shovels because the contaminating couple had not been removed fast enough. Next time, said the ringleader, “we are going to bring the backhoe.”

College students were on summer vacation while these stories were unfolding, but obviously the campus Left was not about to yield its place in the vanguard of political correctness to the likes of the Memphis city council. The first campus to erupt once midterms were over was Yale, where, in default of more serious grievances, activists had fixated on making sure no one’s Halloween costume featured a culturally insensitive sombrero, kimono, or feathered headdress. On November 5, about a hundred students were gathered on the main quad chalking slogans (“Our culture is not a costume”) on the sidewalk when the dean passed by. He stopped to listen and ended up staying for three hours. “Please know that I have heard your stories and I’ll leave here changed,” he assured them. Flushed with this success, a group of students returning to one dorm tried the same gambit on their house master, who, like the dean, just happened to be walking by. But Master Nicholas Christakis refused to be cowed. His display of spine sent one girl into a meltdown, and camera-phone video of her rant found its way onto YouTube and from there into the New York Times.

After the scare comes the shakedown. The following Thursday, a coalition of student groups handed Yale’s president a list of demands ranging from the rococo to the baldly mercenary. In addition to things such as an ethnic-studies course requirement and the abolition of “master” as an administrative title, they asked for each cultural center on campus to get a $2 million top-up. That same day, a sit-in surrounded the Georgetown president’s office and pledged not to disband until, among other things, the university funded an endowment to recruit more “black identifying” professors. On other campuses, apologies were a popular request. Amherst Uprising, which posted its demands online, specified that President Biddy Martin must submit her apology for the racist nature of the school’s mascot “by Friday, November 13th, 2015 by 5:00pm” — no extensions! The ConcernedStudent1950 group at the University of Missouri specified that President Tim Wolfe’s apology should be handwritten. In the event, they got more than that — Wolfe resigned, as did Mizzou chancellor R. Bowen Loftin. Dean Mary Spellman of Claremont McKenna College was forced to resign after writing in an e-mail, by way of underlining her eagerness to meet with a Latina student who had sent her an op-ed about racism on campus, that “we are working on how we can better serve students, especially those that don’t fit our CMC mold” (emphasis added).

These convulsions have put some in mind of the campus unrest of the 1960s. In fact, they fit a much older pattern.

Not since environmentalism has the prevailing variety of leftism more closely resembled a religion. John McWhorter calls it Antiracism — “it seriously merits capitalization at this point” — and notes that it has its own clergy in such men as Charles Blow and Ta-Nehisi Coates (friendly vicar and hellfire preacher, respectively). Casting his net more widely to include all talk of “privilege,” from male to cisgender, essayist Joseph Bottum has observed that the concept is functionally equivalent to original sin. “I have to every day wake up and acknowledge that I am so deeply embedded with racist thoughts and notions and actions in my body that I have to choose every day to do anti-racist work and think in an anti-racist way,” said a graduate student whom Bottum was able to locate, sounding for all the world like a Calvinist explaining the T in TULIP. No wonder the guest lectureship that Yale offered #BlackLivesMatter quad-botherer DeRay Mckesson was in the divinity school.

Leftism has become a religion, and what we are seeing now is a revival.

Leftism has become a religion, and what we are seeing now is a revival. The revivalists testify from behind megaphones instead of pulpits and in “safe spaces” instead of country churches, but they stand squarely within the American tradition of converts who spread their gospel by bearing their witness. The way they keep bursting into tears is a clue. The Yale chalkers cried when they confronted the dean, the ranting girl cried when she confronted Christakis, audience members cried during a perfectly ordinary Yale Political Union debate on affirmative action. Ferguson was the same way. “There were a lot of people who were angry, a lot of people crying,” one protester recalled of Michael Brown’s funeral week. “There were a lot of people with backpacks and books saying the revolution is starting.” (That final dash of millennialism is entirely appropriate.) This is not a sign of fragility; this is part of the attraction.

Like the First and Second Great Awakenings, this revival spreads like a contagion on the strength of remarkable stories. In the days of Jonathan Edwards, a preacher could set the Connecticut River valley aflame by telling of mass conversions up in Northampton or a miraculous healing in Plainfield or a notorious free-thinker who had suddenly arrived at salvation over in Braintree. Edwards himself got a lot of mileage out of the incredible conversion story of his youngest congregant, Phebe Bartlet, age four. Some of these stories omitted certain deflating details (the mass conversions had been prompted by an outbreak of disease, say), and some are hard to credit. But there is not a single story in the annals of either Great Awakening, not a blind man restored to sight or a cripple made to dance the Highland jig, that strains credulity as much as the idea that on October 24, 2015, the Ku Klux Klan snuck into the third-floor bathroom of a Mizzou dormitory in order to paint a poop swastika on the wall.

The enthusiasm for personal denunciation that sets the present eruption apart from the usual PC background noise is a trademark of American revivals, too. When colonial congregations invited George Whitefield to preach for them, they quickly learned to ask in advance that he not sow dissension by denouncing local worthies by name. No one bothered asking Charles Grandison Finney to stick to generalities. One reason Finney was the most popular revivalist of the Second Great Awakening was that his audiences derived a certain frisson from knowing he would call out by name any deacon he’d heard was an adulterer and any shopkeeper he’d heard saying “dammit” in the street. An ordinary preacher who noticed an overdressed woman in the pews might pointedly take the day’s reading from Proverbs 31 and leave it at that. Finney glared at the unfortunate woman and asked her, in front of everyone, “Did you come in here to divide the worship of God’s house, to make people worship you?” Recounting the story in his memoir, he notes, “This made her writhe.”

Finney acted as if it were some great methodological breakthrough that he “said ‘you’ instead of preaching about sin and sinners and saying ‘they.’” He was more proud of it than of his more famous innovation, the “anxious bench.” But it’s not as if other preachers didn’t know that they could call down the 19th-century equivalent of a Twitterstorm on any parishioner they wanted. They just didn’t think it would be tactful. Tact, that pillar of decency, is not a principle so much as a truce. To break it, a person needs only to believe that he and his ideas are more important than other people. We all do this sometimes in the flush of passion — and sometimes we do it legitimately. When entire nations do it simultaneously — when bakers and tech CEOs and private conversations between NBA team owners and their mistresses are all placed outside the protection of civilized norms of live and let live — it is a sign that the flush has become a fever.

What is behind all this? The same factors that gave us the late-’90s campus tantrum are partly to blame, since most have continued unchanged or gotten worse. Nothing paves the way for PC like ignorance, and the farther removed we get from the last generation to receive a proper education, the more ignorant college students become. Millennials have no idea that the rule of law and the presumption of innocence are older and more important concepts than intersectionality and white privilege. To them, they’re all just phrases that somebody made up, sometime before yesterday. They glibly refer to Amherst’s “legacy of oppression” and Yale’s “history of institutionalized racism,” but they cannot explain what they mean by those phrases. As far as I can tell, they just mean an institution existed prior to 1980. They are also more ignorant than ever of life outside the upper middle class, thanks to the increasing self-segregation of the classes that Charles Murray has identified in Coming Apart, and this ignorance leaves them ready to believe the most outlandish things about the marginalized groups they claim to champion. Sometimes when your cousin tells you he was literally minding his own business when the cop started hassling him you let it pass to spare his dignity, but these Belmont kids omit the grain of salt.

One new development is how easily administrators are caving. Why did the Yale girl’s expletive-filled tirade result in an apology from Christakis (“I’m genuinely sorry to have disappointed you. I’ve disappointed myself”) and not her immediate rustication? The rising college price tag surely has something to do with it: Students paying $50,000 a year feel entitled to throw their weight around. But the activists have also benefited from the same loophole that has protected every revival in American history: They can’t condemn you for getting serious about beliefs that everyone else is supposed to share.

There is not a single item on the Yale demand list that would be shocking to read in the alumni bulletin. Increased funding for mental-health services, naming the new residential hall after a person of color — did radicals write this or did the development office? A Georgetown professor spoke for more than just Catholics when he said of the sit-in, “This is what I teach.” People who are abnormally intense about their beliefs tend to make their co-religionists feel ashamed, but there is a world of difference between being a fanatic they are ashamed of and a purist they are shamed by. The latter is a sweet spot occupied by saints, prophets, holy fools — and now, social-justice warriors.

That is why there is a limit to how much can be gleaned from listening to what these activists say. Their slogans are drawn from the ideological air supply. They seize on whatever grievances are closest to hand simply for the sake of having a grievance. If it weren’t one damn thing, it’d be another — as can be seen from the way the latest contagion has jumped from campus to campus regardless of local conditions. The driving compulsion to complain is the phenomenon here, not the complaints.

New enthusiasm for an old message seems to come out of nowhere, unconnected to anything like a war or a national crisis — people just get religion all of a sudden.

This is also typical of revivals. By definition, a revival has no obvious cause. New enthusiasm for an old message seems to come out of nowhere, unconnected to anything like a war or a national crisis — people just get religion all of a sudden. Christian historians who have examined the underlying causes of revivals have been obliged to admit that, in a sense, their proximate cause is the Holy Spirit. In the same way, sympathizers claim that campus radicalism is fully explained by the reality of structural racism. But something makes revivals occur at one time and not another. Let us grant that the Holy Spirit (or the spirit of social justice, in this case) lights the flame. Something else piles up the tinder.

When emotions run this high, there is usually fear in back of it. Today’s college students have been raised to believe that they must navigate the world without assuming any shared values or bonds of community with anyone they meet, and that is enough to scare anyone. Attempts to quantify the Millennial mindset have uncovered a generation that is isolated (single people outnumbered married ones for the first time in 2014, and an increasing share of personal interactions are conducted online instead of face-to-face) and untrusting (Gallup and Harvard polls show rock-bottom trust in churches, Congress, the professions, and every other established authority in America). In her memoir, Lena Dunham quotes a friend complaining of a no-good ex, “How could someone who cares so much about social justice care so little about my feelings?” What I hear in that quote is a girl who is desperate for something, anything, that can serve as a reliable guide to who is a good person. Not an unreasonable thing to want in a world where you feel that no one’s good faith can be taken for granted.

Certifying that someone is a trustworthy person is precisely the role that evangelical religion served in the Second Great Awakening. It is no coincidence that the “burned-over district,” where Finney and his fellow revivalists had their greatest successes, was in upstate New York after the advent of the Erie Canal. The explosion of trade meant that people moved around a lot more. Towns such as Rochester started seeing population turnover of 80 percent in six years, and diaries of the period are full of complaints that you just don’t know whom it’s safe to do business with anymore. At the same time, cottage industry was being replaced by the factory model, which meant that instead of living in their masters’ houses as boarders, employees now lived in their own houses and their own neighborhoods. These two changes left the average upstate New Yorker’s social world suddenly denuded of people he felt confident he could trust.

The other common thread linking the various American revivals is the sudden disappearance of a longstanding mark of adulthood. The First Great Awakening started among the first generation of young New Englanders to be told that there was not enough land available for them to be given their own plots when they came of age. The Second Great Awakening coincided with a bigger upheaval than a land shortage: the final demise of the Jeffersonian dream. It used to be that even an unambitious worker expected to end his life on a homestead of his own.

Something similar is happening in our present culture. A college degree used to certify that a person had “made it,” but it no longer does. The result is status anxiety — which helps fuel the revival.

If this latest spasm really is a kind of revival, is that a bad thing? To judge by their after-effects, revivals seem at first glance to be highly salutary. The First Great Awakening gave us the American Revolution, inasmuch as it was the first truly national event in the country that would become the United States, and the sense of common identity it forged would later flower into patriotism. As for the Second Great Awakening, it ended slavery. Abolitionism was in many ways merely a sequel to Finneyite revivalism, having taken from revivalism its personnel, its institutions (such as Oberlin), and its methods. The emotional excitement that the revivals inspired also whetted the northern public’s appetite for other forms of avocational righteousness that could provide the same moral thrill.

#related#If each bout of national soul-searching translated into one chit labeled “resolve,” good for the elimination of one national evil, that would be a mark in revivalism’s favor. But really it was just a lucky fluke that the radicals of the 1830s had such a monumental evil to turn their sights on. If slavery had been abolished earlier, there just would have been that many more campaigners against Sunday mail, that many more members of the Oneida commune.

In his History of American Revivals (1904), Frank G. Beardsley calls the awakening that took place in the 1850s “a Providential Preparation for the Civil War.” “As the Great Awakening enabled the feeble colonies to pass through the baptismal fires of the American Revolution,” he explained, “so the Great Revival of 1857–58 served to prepare the people and sustain them in the fearful cataclysm.” In making a comparison to the revivals of Jonathan Edwards and George Whitefield, Beardsley ignored the biggest difference between the two, a difference that makes any resemblance between our current moment and a religious revival cause for worry instead of hope. The First Great Awakening knitted a country together. The Second tore one apart.

120,Andrews,Helen,firstthings,"I lost my taste for rhapsodies to the power of reading—rhapsodies like Teju Cole’s—around the same time I became a halfway competent reader. It was two months into what would become a twelve-month period of unemployment, and I had come to realize that the reading style that got me through college and young adulthood was not suitable for reading several hours at a stretch—and it was desperately important that I be able to read for hours at a stretch, both because I wanted to make the most of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to read mountains of books and because I needed something to fill the long, dragging, structureless days. (Television made the time pass, but oh, the self-loathing after!) It took several rather humiliating weeks, and I am not sure I would have seen it through if circumstances hadn’t forced me to, but I gained conscious control over my distractibility, relieved my mental tonus, and became a decent reader.

The better I became at reading, the less I felt like talking about how much reading meant to me, which may be a natural side effect of coming to love something that previously you only wanted to love. I used to do quite a lot of that sort of book bragging, I’m sad to say, and I don’t suppose the victims of my tediousness will be much consoled to know that I believe those years of pretension were a necessary prelude to what followed. It was also around that time that I stopped thinking that whether a person read books was the most important thing about them, or the best indication of whether we would have anything in common or whether I would like them—all of which are things I believed back when reading was more of a tribal affiliation than a passion.

The thesis of Teju Cole’s New Yorker piece is that President Obama has undergone some kind of transformation from “an elegant and literary man” who relaxed with the poetry of Derek Walcott to someone who can order drone strikes. (The title of the piece is “A Reader’s War.”) The assumption here is that Obama was much of a reader in the first place, when really it’s more likely that he’s simply fluent in the language of intellectualism. It’s easy enough to mimic if you spend enough time with the right crowd. The president certainly seems like the sort of person who likes to read, but that’s not the same thing as being a reader. He has made excellent tactical use of the power that dropping semi-obscure book titles can exert—I saw many jaded, pox-on-both-your-parties libertarians swoon when, early in the 2008 campaign, Obama mentioned Hayek in a Time interview—but all that means is that he’s a smart politician.

The evidence Cole puts forward as proof that Obama is, or was, “a reader in chief” is rather flimsy. He says “a man who names among his favorite books Morrison’s ‘Song of Solomon,’ Robinson’s ‘Gilead,’ and Melville’s ‘Moby Dick’ is playing the game pretty seriously.” Cole really ought to have learned by now that 20 percent of people who list those three titles among their favorite books are (as he puts it) people “for whom an imaginative engagement with literature is inseparable from life,” and the other 80 percent are faking it.

Frankly this makes me wonder about Teju Cole, since an awareness of this 80 percent is one of the marks of literary maturity. He’s a novelist. Hasn’t he been approached by enough “fellow novelists” to know that nine out of ten are not the kindred spirits they claim to be? Hasn’t he personally wrestled with the temptation to just relax into his reputation as a literary person while letting the actual labor of literariness slide? Doesn’t he realize how many literary-minded people have taken that much, much easier route and never regretted it, or never realized it?

Whenever I read an article about the reading life at a site like the Millions or the Rumpus, I try to assume that what the author has written is the honest truth, though sometimes I end up doubting it. If they say that reading has helped them become better critical thinkers, I say: Okay, then I hope your political views aren’t a carbon copy of every other artsy Brooklynite’s. If they say writing has enhanced their empathy, I want to ask whether they can imagine themselves inside the head of someone who supports traditional marriage, or someone for whom “reading” means James Patterson and management books, or someone who doesn’t read. (Or someone with V.S. Naipaul’s politics, Teju.) You say reading has improved your own prose. Then how come your essay is so clumsily written?

Actually, I retract that last one, not only because it’s snarky but because I’m not sure it’s correct. Many people are at their most inarticulate precisely on the subject closest to their heart. When I was writing my senior thesis on Oscar Wilde, I asked my adviser whether I had to address “The Soul of Man under Socialism,” which I thought was not very Wildean and moreover not very good. He told me I could write about it or not, but that in general I should always pay close attention to little freak essays where an author departs from his usual subject matter and his usual standard of quality, because often it’s a sign that the author is being more honest and more vulnerable than usual.

Wilde really did think of himself as a socialist humanitarian—it was the secret of his private self-image—but when he tried to write about it, he couldn’t get enough distance to be clever about it. He couldn’t even come up with good arguments, maybe because he couldn’t imagine what it would be like not to believe in it. Even a genius like Wilde had to write where his ideas were, not where his heart was. (My adviser had other examples of this anomalous-essay-as-secret-decoder-ring phenomenon. I wish I could remember them.) Maybe overly ingenious testimonies to the importance of reading deserve as much skepticism as overly insistent ones.

The consensus rebuttal to the Teju Cole piece has been that he was wrong to assume that reading makes people more morally sensitive; the Nazis read Goethe, etc. I’m not sure what I think about that. The relationship between reading and conscience is complicated but they have something to do with each other, is my instinct. In any case, the population under examination here is not real lovers of books but vague fans of reading. Being well-read enough to bluff your way into a reputation for bookishness has many benefits—you have something to talk about with your friends, you feel a sense of belonging, often you meet attractive members of the opposite sex—but moral seriousness is not one of them.

121,Andrews,Helen,firstthings,"Dame Rebecca West had a theory that the history of civilization since Christ could be divided into three panels like a triptych. In the first panel, stretching roughly from the Crucifixion to the Middle Ages, the language of theology so dominated learned debate that all complaints were expressed in religious terms, even when the problem at issue was economic or political. The poor and discontented “cried out to society that its structure was wrong . . . and said that they did this because they had had a peculiar revelation concerning the Trinity. The hungry disguised themselves as heretics.” After a few brief centuries of clarity, mankind proceeded to the third panel, in which the opposite problem prevails: “Those suffering from religious distress reverse the process, and complain of it in economic terms. Those who desire salvation pretend that they are seeking a plan to feed the hungry.”

West, writing in 1949, was thinking primarily of communism. From the Stalinists recently ascendant in her beloved Balkans to Fabian grandees Sidney and Beatrice Webb in England, from whose dinner parties she had lately been banned for being too argumentative, the socialists of her day were united in their endorsement of the Marxist axiom that all human behavior can be traced back to material motivations. The purpose of this logical razor was to discredit their opponents by attributing all bourgeois beliefs to class interest, with religion and morality reduced to power plays designed to keep the proletariat in subjection.

West was clever enough to realize that vulgar Marxism was just as likely to be directed inward. A socialist, especially a Western European one, was often someone who had perceived within himself certain longings that an earlier age would have properly identified as moral or religious, but whose intellectual equipment could only process these longings as commitment to social justice. An entire generation had developed a warped idea of what moral seriousness sounds like, and they ended up pledging their souls to economics as a result.

The moral vocabulary that now prevails in the United States is less Marxist but no less vulgar, for it is just as adamant that all moral claims be translated into material terms. The only difference is that material self-interest is now permitted to coexist with material altruism. Bad behavior can be condemned only if it is shown to correlate with some quantifiable negative outcome like a greater likelihood of receiving a free or reduced-price lunch among grade-schoolers, a higher incidence of antidepressant use among adults, or a measurable decline in the national GDP. Moral questions are treated as if they were, at the end of the day, merely empirical. We are hesitant, almost to the point of paralysis, about making moral claims on moral grounds.

This error is not the same thing as scientism, that ripe intellectual leftover of the Progressive Era. In fact, it is almost the reverse. Scientism was an error of extravagant overconfidence, an optimistic faith that experimentation could lead us to grand truths formerly unknown. Nowadays, we suffer more from timidity than arrogance. Rather than expecting science to solve all our hitherto insolubles, we lean on science when making even the most modest claims. The arrogance has not entirely abated—especially not among economists—but still: It is one kind of madness to expect science to put a permanent end to war abroad and inequality at home, as the Progressives did, and another kind of madness to hope that science will someday find evidence suggesting that adultery is in fact wrong or drug addiction in fact undesirable.

In its 2005 decision in Roper v. Simmons, the Supreme Court ruled that criminals who commit their offenses before turning eighteen are protected from execution by the Eighth Amendment. It is possible that the court erred in its treatment of precedent and legislative prerogative, but certainly it erred in relying as heavily as it did on studies by developmental psychologists showing, for example, that “adolescents are overrepresented statistically in virtually every category of reckless behavior,” as if such findings could settle the moral meaning of cruelty. The Roper majority did not explicitly refer to any neuroscientific studies, though several amici did. This omission was rectified in the subsequent juvenile-offender case Miller v. Alabama (2012), in which Justice Elena Kagan, distressingly confident that scientific and social-scientific conclusions are reliable and impartial and mean just what they appear to mean to the average layman, cited an amicus brief that states: “It is increasingly clear that adolescent brains are not yet fully mature in regions and systems related to higher-order executive function such as impulse control, planning ahead, and risk avoidance.”

The Roper and Miller majorities obviously meant to convey the message, “Executing juvenile offenders, or sentencing them to life without parole, is wrong. We abhor the idea. It revolts us. We would as soon bring back drawing and quartering as affirm this practice in twenty-first-century America.” In a decision hinging on the definition of cruelty, such ethical resolve is entirely appropriate. Yet when taking this moral stand, the justices felt it necessary to reach for evidence, and when reaching for evidence, they looked to behavioral science and neurology.

Perhaps judges are just overscrupulous by nature, or by training, and should be allowed to err on the side of evidential punctilio. If that’s the case, then surely politicians should tend in the opposite direction. Making grand moral pronouncements based on no more than anecdotal evidence was once every politician’s bread and butter. It is much less so now. In reviewing the two parties’ platforms ahead of the 2013 parliamentary elections here in Australia, I came across this startling sentence in a platform brochure about mental health policy: “The financial cost to Australia of mental illness in young people aged 12 to 25 was $10.6 billion in 2009, approximately 70 percent of which is productivity lost due to lower employment, absenteeism, and premature death.” There are only two things to be said about that $10.6 billion figure: as an attempt at numerical accuracy, it is useless; as an attempt to demonstrate that youth mental illness is a bad thing, it is superfluous.

Plenty of politicians talk this way in America, too—take President Obama’s claim that universal pre-K will return seven dollars for every dollar invested by reducing drop-out rates, teen pregnancy, and violent crime, as if that could possibly be true. But infinitely worse are the journalists. Writers on economics predominate among the left’s star columnists and bloggers (Paul Krugman, Matthew Yglesias, Ezra Klein, et al.), and they share a bad habit of denigrating anyone who does not approach politics the way an economist would as unserious or indifferent to facts.

Lesser pundits and journalists parrot academic studies as if they were unimpeachable, even when the resulting headlines are as absurd as “Racial Inequality Costs GDP $1.9 Trillion,” “Feminists Have Better Sex Lives,” or (my favorite, courtesy of Yahoo! News) “Holy Water May Be Harmful to Your Health, Study Finds.” Even Ross Douthat, generally reputed as a moralist, can be caught buttressing with social-scientific evidence a claim as uncontroversial as that serious downsides attend being a pothead: Excessive marijuana use, he reports, “can limit educational attainment, and with it economic mobility.” The impression left by these sorts of citations is not rigor so much as lack of confidence in one’s assertions, and persuasion, like seduction and stand-up comedy, is 90 percent confidence.

At this point in the argument, an optimist might suggest that we should count our blessings. It wasn’t so long ago that vast swaths of the mainstream left were unwilling to pass any moral judgments at all. Today’s bien-pensant elites may praise and condemn things in a weirdly bloodless and utilitarian way, but at least they praise and condemn things. Half the time it’s even the right things they praise, like the two-parent family (boosts test scores) or regular church attendance (lowers divorce rates). They are extending a hand of friendship, after a fashion. Do we really want to bat it aside?

This argument occurred to Thomas Babington Macaulay, who was the first man to attempt a systematic unmasking of utilitarianism as a pernicious influence on his country’s political discourse. The vehicle for this rhetorical assassination attempt was a review of James Mill’s Essay on Government, which was itself a distillation of the thought of Mill’s mentor, Jeremy Bentham (incidentally, the man who invented the word “maximize”). Macaulay’s review pointed out that utilitarianism was, among other things, pointless: “If the only fruit of the ‘magnificent principle’ is to be that the oppressors and pilferers of the next generation are to talk of seeking the greatest happiness of the greatest number, just as the same class of men have talked in our time of seeking to uphold the Protestant constitution—just as they talked under Anne of seeking the good of the Church, and under Cromwell of seeking the Lord—where is the gain?” Though he proceeded to sneer at it, this is the crucial question: What is gained, and what is lost, when political discussion must be conducted in utilitarian and social-scientific terms?

The first three answers to that question are related, for they all have to do with the tendency of social scientists to run around identifying problems in need of solutions. Daniel Patrick Moynihan thought that this proactivity was the defining characteristic of modern social scientists, and he saw it as the driving force behind the transformation in American political culture between the 1930s and the 1960s. During the Depression, the problems that government sought to address had mostly been brought to its attention by cries from below, expressed by people who could see the problem with their own eyes. From Kennedy’s presidency onward, bureaucrats armed with national statistics—then a fairly new phenomenon, not coincidentally—began searching their data for problems to solve, whether popular demand for such solutions existed or not. Moynihan’s term for this phenomenon was “the professionalization of reform,” and although a social scientist himself, he was intensely ambivalent about it.

When professionals put such zest and seriousness into persuading people that they have a problem that can be solved, several things can go wrong. It may be that the targets of their attentions have a problem that cannot be solved. It may be that they do not have a problem at all. Or it may be that they do have a problem and it can be solved, but it would be better for them in the meantime to be able to appreciate, relish, draw from, or find the richness in their problem instead of simply deprecating it. The professionals’ response to each of these three possibilities ends in false hope, false despair, or false resentment for the sufferers, yet ever greater self-satisfaction for their would-be saviors.

For the first two of these offenses, the rogues’ gallery is especially full of representatives of the medical sciences. The American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine has for the last twenty years tried to convince patients that old age is not a fact of life but merely a collection of symptoms, each of which is in theory curable (their motto: “Aging is not inevitable!”). Purveyors of estrogen-progestin treatments tell women that the “disease” of menopause can be deferred indefinitely. And of course, no profession has been more aggressive in applying the label of “disorder” to normal human experiences than psychology.

But social scientists engage in solution mongering of the same kind, and more of it lately. To the extent that inequality is a live topic in politics today, it is entirely attributable to the efforts of economists who think it ought to be an issue because their graphs tell them so. Lack of prosperity is something people suffer from, but “rising inequality” is something social scientists notice in data. In the field of education—probably the most massive black hole of bogus expertise in the policy world—professionals use statistical legerdemain to make an immutable fact of human life sound like an eminently remediable policy problem. If the governor of New York were to promise to abolish stupidity within ten years, anyone hearing him would think, “Physician, heal thyself.” By framing the same goal in the language of narrowing achievement gaps and bringing scores up to grade level, the futile endeavor begins to sound rather sensible.

The third offense—when professionals identify a solvable problem but, by seizing hold of it, flatten the experience of it—is the cruelest of the three, because it snatches longstanding consolations from the hands of the most vulnerable. The process is simple. The first thing a social scientist will do when addressing a problem is to break it down into distinct elements, to make it easier to analyze and to tweak. In the case of poverty, that means separating out its component difficulties. In the case of marginalized groups, it means isolating all the obstacles imposed by their race, sex, gender, disability, or whatever other characteristic.

Applying this analytic solvent is helpful to the social scientist’s mission because it separates a permanent problem (like poverty or sex differences) into fragments that in themselves seem fixable (finding jobs for welfare recipients or eliminating some statistical disparity between men and women). But speaking about disadvantaged groups in these discrete and objective terms robs their experience of its coherence. It takes a rich identity and shatters it to pieces. Membership in the lower class, for example, has never been a picnic, but it used to be something that a person could draw from and take pride in. Described in the terms that politics permits us to use today, as “socioeconomic disadvantage” (or worse, “lack of privilege”), it sounds like nothing more than a list of things to complain of.

Finally, it should not go unmentioned that, for all its vaunted empiricism, social science is very often wrong. Sometimes it is wrong in ways we do not necessarily regret, as in the case of Dr. Kenneth B. Clark’s “doll tests,” which cemented the Supreme Court’s decision in Brown v. Board of Education but were so flawed in their method as to be scientifically worthless. Sometimes a social science is saved from being wrong only by being persistently inconclusive, with economics being the prime example. As the George Mason University professor Russ Roberts is fond of asking, “Is there any statistically sophisticated study of a politically controversial question in economics that was so iron-clad and undeniably reliable that it has persuaded the people on the other side of the issue to change their views?” Bernard Lewis, speaking from outside the discipline, put the case more mordantly: “In the history of human thought, science has often come out of superstition. Astronomy came out of astrology. Chemistry came out of alchemy. What will come out of economics?”

Something similar happened to Lewis’ own discipline in the 1960s with the rise of “social history.” Oxford professor Brian Harrison, who studied for his Ph.D. during the social historians’ heyday, remembers that they “were all keen to count things wherever possible, to display material diagrammatically and graphically, to engage in prosopographical analysis, and to see how far sociological and other models could help to make sense of the material.” Often this quantifying tendency was justified as a way to capture the voices of the poor and powerless, who did not leave the same paper trails as kings and politicians but did turn up in census rolls.

The vogue for social history subsided for many reasons—not least because its plodding books made for excruciating reading—but perhaps most relevant to the current situation was the realization that it did not actually rescue the neglected populations it was intended to serve. Georg Iggers summarizes this aspect of the backlash in his survey of twentieth-century historiography: “‘Little people’ . . . had been neglected as much in social science–oriented history as they had been in the conventional political history that focused on the high and mighty . . . . [It] missed the point by attending to material conditions without examining how these conditions were experienced” (emphasis added).

How did we get here? The most obvious answer is that there is simply more social science being done today than ever before. The old Progressives would have loved to have been able to ground all of their favored policies in academic studies with irrefutable-looking charts and graphs, but there were not enough practitioners around to produce them. As late as the 1960s, only a minority of professors at four-year colleges published regularly. Now, not only are there vastly more credentialed social scientists, but they are producing more findings, thanks to the peer-reviewed-journal treadmill on which their careers have come to depend.

On the demand side, the audience for these social-scientific pronouncements has increased with the growth of college enrollment. Most adult Americans today receive some form of higher education, which, whatever else it may do for them, acculturates students into a mindset where academic findings are granted serious weight and being skeptical of eggheads is considered philistine. Not since the Edwardian era, when philanthropy was replaced by social work, has there been such a pronounced swing against amateurs and toward professionals. Indeed, echoes of that old battle can be heard in today’s expressions of contempt for those who dare to put forward a political argument without a white paper’s worth of research to support it.

One remembers how Mrs. Ramsay in To the Lighthouse (1927) “wrote down in columns carefully ruled for the purpose wages and spending, employment and unemployment, in the hope that thus she would cease to be a private woman whose charity was half a sop to her own indignation, half a relief to her own curiosity, and become what with her untrained mind she greatly admired, an investigator, elucidating the social problem.” (Lady Bountiful and Mrs. Jellyby have not become any more popular in the intervening century, though in light of what replaced them, their particular brand of foolishness seems more harmless than not.)

It may also be that the supremacy of social science came about not entirely because of impersonal forces but because people actively wanted it. The medicalization of personal suffering is probably the trend most similar to the economicization of political suffering, and the thing everyone forgets about medicalization is that it has been largely patient driven. The term “medical imperialism,” though catchy, is a misnomer. The mantra that alcoholism is a disease, the extension of ADHD to adult patients, the application of the term “PTSD” to trauma sufferers other than combat veterans, the use of human growth hormone to treat “idiopathic short stature” in children of non-disabling but less than average height—it was the sufferers themselves (or, in the case of ISS, their parents) who drove these developments.

Convincing a doctor to legitimize their moderate levels of suffering with a medical diagnosis brings no small amount of psychic relief: validation that their suffering is real; hope that their situation can be cured, since it is officially abnormal and not one of the ordinary pains of human existence; and, of course, absolution from moral responsibility. It is not hard to see how some of these same comforts might accompany the recategorization of social ills as economic or sociological errors.

It should be clear from the foregoing description that there are a great many people with good reason to resent the “social-science-ification” of public discourse. There is, first of all, the large portion of the population that would like to participate in the political conversation but cannot because they lack the familiarity with economic jargon that has been made a criterion for being taken seriously. There are those who know social science well enough to frame their arguments in those terms but who feel that in doing so, rather a lot would get lost in translation.

Among consumers of news media, there are—or I hope there are—many who rue what social science has done to the quality of prose. Much of the writing that appears in political magazines nowadays is unreadable, which is a dereliction of both art and civic duty on the authors’ part. It is not entirely their fault. Poor things, it is simply not possible to write an elegant sentence with two statistics in it.

Finally, there are those who rightly complain that social science has made politics dull. This is not a frivolous point. Edward Banfield, the great theoretician of urban politics, observed that when the big-city bosses were replaced by colorless reformers, the lower and working classes stopped paying attention to urban politics. The decline in entertainment value led to a decline in participation among those who needed local politics most, as one of the very few arenas where they could make their voices heard. Dullness is regressive.

Should this coalition of the ignored, the reluctant, and the bored to tears ever attempt to take back our political discourse from the technocrats, the first lesson we will have to keep in mind is not to fight the enemy on its own terms. During the Cold War, especially its early stages, the books written in defense of the Soviet model fairly bristled with statistics. Wisely, the West’s more effective defenders did not attempt to refute tractor-production figures from the Ukraine with tractor-production figures from Moline, Illinois. They made more fundamental points, like the difficulty of collecting accurate statistics in a police state, or the conclusiveness with which even accurate statistics are trumped by the brute fact of mass starvation.

At a more Kirkian level of abstraction, there were such simple observations as: Our people are free, yours are not; we produce poetry, you produce propaganda; our cities are beautiful, yours are hideous. The equivalent arguments in the modern context might be (1) no amount of creative accounting will convince a sane person that you have made a money-saver out of a vast new entitlement like Obamacare; (2) no study could ever refute the fact that character is both a cause and a casualty of government-subsidized poverty; and (3) I will listen to econometricians as soon as you show me one that can write with more fluency than a high school sophomore.

The mistake most frequently made by modern anti-social-science polemicists is to focus too much on their target’s philosophical shortcomings. This would be excellent high ground to stake out if Americans were attached to terms like “empirical” and “falsifiable” because they had all given deep consideration to the works of Bertrand Russell and Karl Popper, but the reality is more superficial. They put their faith in academics and research analysts because they have an idealized picture of the sciences as a self-policing community of disinterested truth-seekers with laboratories and databases and state-of-the-art modeling programs.

This superficiality is not negligence, really. Most of our decisions about whom to trust take place at this aesthetic level. You and I do not know enough neuroscience to refute a convinced phrenologist, but if we have a feel for the pseudoscientist type (say we have read Martin Gardner), we will have no trouble identifying our bumpologist as a textbook example. So it is, in reverse, with social scientists. We come to them with a jumble of opinions and half-formed personal judgments, and they repeat them back to us as facts. Their main contribution is not information, but authority.

But there are other kinds of authority than a philosophiae doctor. The civil rights movement deployed not only the authority of the gospel but also the moral authority that comes from nonviolent protest. Anyone who can withstand brutal treatment and still speak in a calm voice is someone saintly enough to demand a hearing. It is not so different from the moral authority of ex-generals, another phenomenon with precedent in American politics. In circumstances less conducive to displays of moral authority—and political issues very rarely invite actual heroism—there are other options. Christopher Hitchens was not an expert in anything, but people cared what he had to say for two reasons: It was evident that he had read widely, and he expressed himself beautifully. Both of these are forms of authority. Things that require discipline often are.

Authority does not have to be self-generated. It can also be borrowed, or rather assumed, like a mantle. When Rep. Herbert Parsons spoke in favor of child-labor laws on the floor of the House in 1909, he quoted Matthew 18: “Our doctrine . . . is that, if possible, ‘not one of these little ones should perish.’” I would guess that Congressman Parsons began with the same starting point a modern politician would have: a vague but definite conviction that the law ought to address child labor. When he proceeded to ask himself what it would sound like to make that assertion in a public forum in a way that would command agreement, the answer came back to him: Scripture. To a modern, it would have been: lifetime earnings differentials.

I do not mean to say that all political arguments should be made more biblical. I only suggest that, when we find ourselves looking for ways to bring some authority to our political convictions (or looking for spokesmen who might carry such authority), we should broaden our search. It may be that integrity, erudition, literary genius, holiness, or wisdom carry as much weight in a democracy as expertise.

Herman Kahn was no one’s idea of a moral authority. Hugely obese, slovenly in dress, and insensitive in manner, Kahn was the RAND Corporation egghead who tallied up megadeaths and mineshaft gaps in earnest years before Dr. Strangelove turned the concepts to satire. He was also the most passionately utilitarian policy analyst of the last century. When the public ridiculed him for subjecting the moral issue of nuclear war to such grotesque calculation, he snapped back, “Would you prefer a warm, human error? . . . a nice emotional mistake?” His colleague Malcolm Hoag laid out RAND’s position in more detail: “The man who solves complex problems in the space of five minutes on the intuitive basis of ‘sound’ . . . judgment and experience” will sleep well, and the analyst who employs Kahn’s method will “sleep badly, but only because he has become acutely aware of all the pitfalls in the problem.”

This is what it looks like to try to achieve authority by sheer mechanical effort. Modern politics is full of people who think like this, who prefer to make decisions in a way that makes them sleep badly because the laboriousness seems like proof of their own diligence and good intentions. The giveaway is their tendency to lose enthusiasm for social science at exactly the point in the process where it might do some good: afterwards, to evaluate whether a policy has actually worked. They prefer their empirical analysis front-loaded as they try by sheer force of will to put a harness on fate: If they had fallen in the first panel of Rebecca West’s triptych, they would have been pelagians.

But authority, like salvation, is a gift, not an item for purchase. It will take effort for non–social scientists to reclaim some of it, but we should not make our opponents’ mistake of thinking that sheer quantity of effort is all that is required.

Helen Andrews, a former associate editor of National Review, has written for the American Conservative, the Weekly Standard, and the American Spectator. This essay was underwritten by the Issachar Fund.",1,http://www.firstthings.com/article/2014/02/bloodless-moralism
122,Andrews,Helen,firstthings,"When Yale first bowed to the spirit of meritocracy and began admitting large numbers of students from outside the New England upper class, it set in motion a nationwide arms race among high-achieving high school students. After fifty years of escalating competition, it is no longer enough to have an SAT score in the top 1 percent and a record of achievement in a single activity. To have a decent chance of being admitted to Yale, a student must be a top all-rounder: an academic star, a varsity athlete, a musical virtuoso, a community-service volunteer, and president of some extracurricular club. To have a better-than-even chance, he must be world-class or nationally ranked in one of these.

As a result, every admitted student believes he must be excellent at anything he tries. In the old Yale, campus culture developed from the upper-class traits that most students shared and the rest hoped to adopt. In the new, more diverse Yale, the only thing students share is ambition, and it determines attitudes toward grades (anything below an A-minus can be disputed with the professor), extracurriculars (hardly anyone spends four years in a club without achieving a leadership position), and even drugs. Instead of marijuana or cocaine, Yale’s pharmaceutical network now traffics mostly in Adderall, the wonder drug that, as one girl told me, “makes you want to work.” Surely this is the first generation of college students in which even the drug users are more interested in working hard than getting high.

This overachiever’s mentality has also determined campus attitudes toward sex. Few notice the connection, because the end result—sexual permissiveness—is the same as it was in the sixties and seventies, when the theme of campus culture was not overachievement but liberation, and the eighties and early nineties, when it was postmodernism and the overthrow of all value judgments. The notorious Yale institution known as Sex Week—a biennial series of sex toy demonstrations, student lingerie shows, and lectures by pornographers—wouldn’t have been out of place in either of these eras. Consequently, Yale’s sexual culture is often mistaken for mere depravity by outside observers who assume that it is just another byproduct of moral relativism.

It would be more accurate to say that Yale students treat sex as one more arena in which to excel, an opportunity not just to connect but to impress. Every amateur sonneteer secretly believes his verse to be as good as the United States poet laureate’s, and every undergraduate programmer suspects his code rivals the best in Silicon Valley. It’s not very different for Yale students to say that, if pornography is the gold standard of sexual prowess, then that is the standard to which they must aspire.

Take a look at the Sex Week schedule of events (if you have a strong stomach) and you will see just how much of the itinerary is devoted to instruction—how to give the best this, get the most that, and generally become as accomplished at sex as you are at everything else. “Many of us here have never failed at anything, and we don’t want to start now,” explained a rather frank female attendee of a Sex Week event called “Getting What You Really Want,” quoted in the Yale Daily News in 2010. This attitude toward sex is not nearly as dark as the moral relativists’ savage antinomianism, but in a way it is more disturbing.

Nathan Harden has not picked up on any of this. That is a shame, considering that he has just written a three-hundred-page book on the sexual and moral culture of the university from which we both recently graduated. To hear it from Sex and God at Yale, students have too much sex because they no longer recognize the existence of moral values. Their professors “are afflicted with ethical apathy” and so students have cast themselves, lemming-like, into relativism and, perforce, sadomasochism and naked parties. After two years on campus (only two because he was a transfer student) Harden says, “I became aware that I was witnessing much more than the decline of a great university. I was witnessing nothing less than a prophetic vision of America’s descent into an abyss of moral aimlessness.” All because Yale as an institution is “plagued by a void of moral purpose.”

I rather think Yale is plagued by an excess of moral purpose—that purpose being the pursuit of perfection, however perversely defined. Its students are not relativists; they are not even radicals. They are ordinary modern liberals, with all the earnestness and all the moral blind spots the term implies. Concepts like social responsibility and public service animate them greatly (not many Gordon Gekkos in this generation), honor and loyalty less so. Their code of sexual ethics is limited—consent, respect, fidelity within a relationship, basic etiquette—but they have one.

Harden believes that Yale students look upon traditional institutions like marriage with contempt or indifference, but he’s wrong there, too. Yale students still value marriage and aspire to it. The problem is the timetable: Most of them don’t envision marrying until their late twenties at the earliest, to give themselves time to establish a dazzling career and to find the perfect partner (though why they think delaying marriage for so long will improve their chances at the latter, I don’t know). All romantic activity up to that point is just study and practice, and if there’s anything Ivy Leaguers know how to throw themselves into, it’s study and practice. Harden spent his years at Yale as a married man—having entered in his mid-twenties after several years of odd jobs in various states—which would have made his reflections on this problem exceptionally valuable. Unfortunately, he does not take it up.

The first problem with Harden’s book is his credibility, which is undermined by the fact that he makes errors any decent fact-checker should have caught. Recycling the old complaint that today’s postmodern universities are eager to flatter every culture except their own, he accuses Yale’s religious studies department of shutting out Christian instructors while welcoming believers in more exotic faiths. He writes: “Professors who teach about Hinduism, Buddhism, or Islam . . . tend to be actual believers of what they teach. It’s as if the university believes that devout faith is a mark of cultural authenticity for those—and only those—who teach about non-Western religions.”

This is false. The department has only two professors specializing in Islam and five in Asian religions, and as a religious studies major I took classes with many of them. The two Islam experts are clean-shaven German men, one of whom is actually a Jesuit, and I am not sure why Harden would impute Eastern authenticity to professors with names like Hugh Flick and Stanley Weinstein. Yale’s experts in Christianity aren’t usually believers themselves (though there are some exceptions), but neither are their experts in other religions.

The bigger problem is that Sex and God at Yale contains virtually no quotes from any Yale students besides Harden, and those that do appear are either stray sentences he overheard or things his friends said to him in conversation. I am not sure he conducted a single interview. Harden’s M.O. is to sit at the back of a Sex Week event, write down egregious quotes from the speaker or from the chatter in the audience, and then leave early, secure in the knowledge that everyone else in the audience was in complete agreement with the message on offer. At no point does he pull aside fellow students and ask what they thought of the spectacle they just observed.

If he had, he might have discovered that Yalies are more ambivalent about Sex Week than he assumes—and this is only counting the students who actually attend, which I would bet is less than half of the student body. Some of the Sex Week attendees I knew were motivated by curiosity, some by the hope they might learn something useful, and some were just out for titillation. Moviegoers paid to see Last Tango in Paris in the theater for the same assortment of reasons, and Yalies take Sex Week about as seriously as most people took that movie.

When a professional pick-up artist spoke at Sex Week 2008—a fellow named Matador, who was hawking his “Mystery Method” for seducing women—his lecture was popular, but his ideas emphatically were not. The consensus was that some of his tips might be good for boosting the self-confidence of shy men, but on the whole his philosophy was disrespectful to women. One female student who attended that lecture told the Yale Daily News, “I actually came more for the guys’ reaction in the audience than anything.” I wonder what she concluded from their reaction. If only Harden had spoken to her. The one time his book does quote a fellow student on the subject of Sex Week—she is a personal friend of his—her conclusion is, “It is just pretty degrading.” This in no way shakes his conviction that every other Yale student is an uncritical supporter.

Most Yale students are content to confine their criticisms of Sex Week to dorm-room bull sessions, but not campus feminists. They write op-eds, blog posts, letters to the editor, and magazine articles about their objections. Yet Harden writes, “I wonder what the feminists at the Women’s Center think about all the porn that is on display around campus. Doesn’t porn degrade women?” I wonder that he wonders—in our day, their opinions on the subject were available to anyone who asked, and often those who didn’t.

“Free Speech Aside, Porn Is Pernicious” was the title of a Yale Daily News op-ed written by the Women’s Center’s “political action coordinator” during my years there. Other YWC officeholders said elsewhere that they saw a direct connection between certain Sex Week events and date rape, the objectification of women, and male sexual opportunism. Apart from the small faction that believes absolute sexual liberation is the key to utopia, Yale feminists don’t need Harden to tell them that a hypersexualized campus is problematic. Sure enough, in the essay from which Sex and God at Yale was expanded, Harden admits, “During my years at Yale, I never once set foot inside the Women’s Center.”

It is true that the feminist’s case against Yale’s sexual culture is self-contradictory, with their praise of autonomy coming into collision with objections to some of the choices that autonomy results in. That is precisely what makes the situation at Yale so tragic. Most students, not just the feminists, know that there is something wrong with pornography, serial hook-ups, and a code of sexual ethics that recognizes no restriction other than consent. They’ve all either seen the dark side of that culture or been burned by it themselves. They just don’t have a moral framework that allows them to explain why such a culture is wrong, and they don’t feel that they have any alternative. So they fall back on their most ingrained habit—setting ambitious goals and then meeting them—while all the time suspecting that there must be a better way.

Speaking of a better way, I don’t know whether Harden is a Christian. He is silent on the subject in his book, but that may just mean that he didn’t want to be written off by readers with a bias against religion. On the other hand, he does seem to be a bit of a philistine where matters of faith are concerned. He gets bizarrely exercised over a class field trip to a mosque where female students were asked to cover their heads before entering the building. “Would any white professor dare to take his students to visit an organization that actively practices apartheid, and then instruct Yale’s black students to sit in the back of the bus and avoid drinking out of the white man’s water fountain? Just so students could gain a nice multicultural understanding of apartheid society? . . . Why then, when it comes to a field trip to a mosque, is a symbol of women’s political oppression adopted without question?”

It is odd that Harden should be so upset by a perfectly ordinary display of interfaith courtesy. My grandparents were once on vacation and found themselves attending Sunday Mass in a church that, as it turned out, was much more conservative than their parish back home, and my grandmother had no option but to jerry-rig a mantilla out of my grandfather’s handkerchief, into which he had unfortunately just blown his nose. I suppose Harden would call that a capitulation to oppression, too. I hope he never tries to visit the Wailing Wall bareheaded.

One doesn’t need to be a Christian to give an accurate picture of Yale’s sexual culture, but to construct a practical plan for creating a moral sexual culture—or more realistically, subculture—that could thrive at the school today, it would be a helpful qualification. Students need a positive moral vision more than they need a fresh set of prohibitions, which is one reason Yale’s campus priests, preachers, and rabbis are in a better position to solve this problem than its rule-makers, the administrators and professors. The other reason is that the administrators and professors consider moral questions to be above their pay grade, and there is not much chance that these pusillanimous figures could be enticed to enter this particular fray. If they do nothing, conservatives may complain; if they do something, liberals will sue. So much for in loco parentis.

In addition to moral leadership, faith leaders could offer something more concrete. The single most helpful contribution that campus religious institutions could make would be to sponsor single-sex dormitories where adult supervision is a reality. The sexual culture of any group tends to adjust itself around the level of misbehavior that members can get away with fairly effortlessly. When young people lived with their parents and didn’t have their own cars, that level was low. At a university where male and female rooms can be on the same floor, with no adults nearby, the level is considerably higher.

Things would be much different if students’ rooming options included places where, for example, rules against visitors of the opposite sex after 10 p.m. were strictly enforced, or a packet of birth-control pills sitting on a girl’s desk raised an eyebrow. If a few more obstacles—or really any obstacles at all—were thrown up between sexual desire and sexual contact, Yalies might find it easier to turn their theoretical objections to the hook-up culture into an actual rejection of it. In 2006, Yale’s Catholic headquarters, the St. Thomas More Center, built a $75 million complex called the Golden Center (after its sponsor, Thomas E. Golden Jr.) that includes a library, a courtyard, and a meditation room. A dormitory might be something for future sponsors to consider.

There is still the problem that most college-educated Americans don’t marry until their late twenties or early thirties. It is much more difficult to ask an average eighteen-year-old to remain celibate for the entirety of his twenties than just the first half of them. But to convince Yale students to start marrying earlier, it is necessary to know their objections to early marriage. One is the fear that a romantic commitment will limit their post-graduation plans by forcing them to factor another person’s needs into their career choices. This is immaturity, and they should be told to get over it. Accommodating another person’s desires is an important part of being an adult, and if people don’t learn that skill before they marry, they are going to get an unpleasant crash course in it when they have kids. It is foolish to think that, with careful planning, one can construct a marriage—or, for that matter, a happy life—that does not involve sacrifices, and the sooner this is learned, the better.

Another objection to early marriage is that twenty-year-olds, by their own admittance, are not mature enough to make such important choices on their own. This is entirely correct, which is why young people considering marriage have traditionally relied as much on the judgment of parents, priests, and communities as on their feelings for each other. The real problem for Yalies isn’t that they are too young to choose but that the adults in their lives are in no position to advise them. A girl’s parents might have met her beau once or twice over Thanksgiving and Christmas, and her other main sources of advice—her girlfriends—are as young and inexperienced as she is.

Students cannot solve this problem on their own. The adults in their lives will have to put in most of the effort. A young woman’s parents will have to make more frequent visits, or a young man’s pastor will have to get to know his potential bride and form a judgment about her character, which he can then share with the young man as well as his parents. In cases where the parents are reluctant to entertain the idea of early marriage and want to pressure the young couple to reconsider, they are more likely to be brought around if a responsible adult can give a well-informed endorsement of the idea. Military recruiters at Yale always make a point of offering to speak to a student’s parents before he enlists, in case they’re the sort who think the armed forces are no place for someone with an Ivy League education. At Yale, early marriage is as countercultural as the military; its advocates should be just as willing to speak in its defense when relevant parties object.

I believe that there are enough students at Yale committed to virtuous living that, with a little help, they could form a vanguard against the prevailing culture; Harden, I think, is less optimistic. This may have something to do with the differences in our Yale experiences. I threw myself into the conservative underground, which was full of students intent on avoiding the moral and ideological traps of contemporary undergraduate life, though they were not always clear on how to avoid them effectively. Within that tight-knit subculture, there was hardly a club with which I did not have at least a passing acquaintance, yet I did not meet Harden once or even hear his name until after I graduated, when I saw his byline in a magazine. He does not discuss any of Yale’s right-leaning organizations in his book, either.

Perhaps he is one of those conservatives who prefers feeling marginalized and aggrieved. In any case, while Harden may not have found these students, they found each other. Things will start to improve when those adults who bemoan the moral degeneration of the modern campus, including those in the conservative movement and in our churches, succeed in finding them.

123,Windsor,Henry,fairobserver,"Allegations made against Marsha Lazareva suggest that sexism and racism may have played a role in her incarceration.

To quote Amnesty International, 2018 was a “particularly brutal year” for human rights activists, journalists and dissidents in the Gulf. The killing of Jamal Khashoggi in particular called attention to Saudi Arabia’s human rights record at home and in Yemen, but all Gulf states continue to restrict freedom of expression, association and assembly. Recent summits involving Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states, which includes Kuwait, have been noticeable for the absence of human rights on the agenda.

A trend that began last year has so far continued unabated. Marsha Lazareva is, arguably, the most successful businesswoman in the Middle East. For the past 13 years, as the CEO and vice president of KGL Investment, she has developed and managed private equity funds in Kuwait, creating hundreds of jobs in the process. But was it in the spite of all this, or because of it, that she was sentenced to 10 years’ hard labor last year for misappropriating funds and thrown in jail?

Her case has become one of global humanitarian interest. Since Lazareva’s arrest and incarceration in May 2018, high-profile officials and human rights groups have called vociferously for her immediate release. According to legal experts, the charges on which she was convicted were baseless. And what’s worse, there are murmurings that her detention and conviction were motivated by sexism, racism and envy.

Lazareva’s own record of her trial would seem to bear this out. According to Lazareva, a Russian citizen who studied at the prestigious Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, she was “singled out” because she was a woman. Many “racist comments” were allegedly made against her. “In spite of numerous requests by my lawyers,” she said, “the judge denied me full access to all accusatory documents and also denied my calling of all my witnesses.” She further claimed that having told the judge she was feeling unwell, she was instructed to “vomit in the corner at the back of the room.”

Lazareva now shares a cell with seven other woman in the notorious Sulaibiya prison, which has an official capacity of 2,500 prisoners but houses more than 6,000. Her mother has traveled from the US to Kuwait to care for her 4-year-old son, whom she has been prevented from seeing. Her health is in decline. Indeed, Louis Freeh, the former director of the FBI who has joined the appeal for her release, told The Daily Caller that “she’s deteriorating both physically and mentally in this condition, and there’s no reason for it.”

A series of hearings held since her trial have proved inconclusive or been abandoned entirely. A £50 million cash bail put up by Lazareva and Saeed Dashti, who was incarcerated on similar charges of embezzlement, has failed to secure even a temporary reprieve. Lord Carlile of Berriew, QC, who is senior counsel for Lazareva, has since made it known that the “expert auditor” on whose testimony much of the evidence relied has since been charged with the forgery of the three documents on which he depended during the case.

According to Lazareva’s legal team, her success in Kuwait generated enemies. It was after the lucrative sale of a real estate project in the Philippines to Udenna, a Davao City-based holding company, that the arrest finally came. Though Kuwaiti women are among the most emancipated in the Middle East — Kuwait was ranked first among Arab countries in the Global Gender Gap Report for 2014 and 2015 — the allegations made against Marsha Lazareva, as well as the comments purportedly made by the judge, suggest that sexism and racism may have played a role in her incarceration.

The upshot of this is that relations between Kuwait and the US, a close ally, may be overshadowed. Neil Bush, son of the late former president, has taken a personal interest in Lazareva’s plight, suggesting Congress must “take steps to sanction the individuals responsible” if the Kuwaiti leadership does not correct the injustice. Louis Freeh has added that Lazareva is “probably one of the most, if not the most, prominent female business executives in the mid-East just completely run roughshod over in terms of her basic rights.” In the UK, the US and Russia, the consensus is clear: Marsha Lazareva’s jailing was unjust.

The ball, it seems, is now very much in Kuwait’s court. There are 5,000 international students of Kuwaiti origin in higher education in the United States. Relations have been largely untroubled since the Gulf War. On paper, Kuwait remains a major non-NATO ally of the US and the UK. Now the team of political and legal heavyweights working for Lazareva’s release warn that Kuwait risks losing its support. Equally, it risks losing international investment at a time when it is actively seeking foreign direct investment. And all this, it seems, because Marsha Lazareva was a woman who was too successful.

124,Windsor,Henry,commentcentral,"Imprisoned on false charges and denied fair treatment, businesswoman Marsha Lazareva must be released, says Henry Windsor.

For the legal team working to free Marsha Lazareva from Kuwaiti prison, the recusal of the sitting judge was out of the blue. Even more surprising was his decision to withdraw his request to step down.

On Easter Sunday, at the third hearing for the Russian businesswoman accused of embezzlement, the judge disqualified himself without warning, once again putting a potential reprieve for Lazareva at a distance. He later withdraw his request to recuse himself and will continue as the sitting judge. It was only the latest frustration in a human rights case that has animated high-profile officials, groups and private citizens the world over.

Before her arrest, Lazareva was working as the CEO and vice-chairman of KGL Investment, a private equity and venture capital firm she had led since its launch in 2007. KGLI, oversaw The Port Fund, a financial house which counted two Kuwaiti government agencies among its investors and poured money into development projects around the world. Before Lazareva's arrest, the Fund had concluded the $500-million sale of a real estate project in the Philippines. She was charged soon after with fraud.

But independent experts have concluded that the claims made against Lazareva?namely that she illegally took Kuwaiti Port Authority monies?have no grounding in fact. And the intervention of political heavyweights like the former GOP Rep. Ed Royce, former FBI director Louis Freeh and Neil Bush, son of George H. W., reflects the profound sense of injustice the case has elicited worldwide. Lazareva's senior counsel, Lord Carlile of Berriew, CBE QC, points out that the expert auditor (on whose claims the bulk of the evidence relies) has himself been charged with the forgery of the three documents relevant to Lazareva's case. By charging that auditor the prosecutor has, in effect, admitted the evidence was false.

This begs the question of why Lazareva has yet to be released. The situation is nuanced by Kuwait's dealings with the US, with which it has strong ties, and the UK, whose government it is asking to ratify an extradition treaty. These relations are 'threatening to darken', Neil Bush says?and the foreign direct investment the Kuwaiti authorities are seeking may not flow into the country so readily if they do. Though the legal systems in all three countries have much in common, the interpretation and execution of the law appears to differ substantially. Lazareva's lawyers were reportedly given a single week to examine 18,000 pages of allegations before the trial; she was denied full access to her accusatory documents and refused witnesses.

And yet the presiding judge in her May 2018 trial will be the sitting judge at her next trial hearing, which takes place this coming Sunday. According to Lazareva he 'made many racist comments toward me during the case and singled me out as a woman'. Sources in the court say that Lazareva was also refused permission to excuse herself after telling the judge she was sick. She was reportedly told to 'vomit in the corner at the back of the room'. Significant attention, then, will surely be paid to the way in which the court upholds the Rule of Law more than a year after Lazareva was first imprisoned. It now seems clear that these standards were not met in the first instance, and indeed that the evidence which underpins her 10-year sentence to hard labour is demonstrably false.

The voices calling for the release of Marsha Lazareva are gathering in number and volume. There is a feeling that in continuing to hold Lazareva Kuwaiti officials are acting in contravention of international law. There is also deep concern over her wellbeing and the wellbeing of her four-year-old son, a US citizen living in Kuwait. And there are murmurings that what was once a highly attractive place for investors may no longer be so.",-1,http://commentcentral.co.uk/kuwaiti-authorities-must-free-marsha-lazareva/
125,Joshi,Hirsh,themaneater,"Hirsh Joshi is a first-year law student at MU. He writes columns about government, race, politics and culture

Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos is among the Trump administration’s most infamous cabinet picks. Secretary DeVos was the first cabinet nominee in American history to be confirmed by a vice president’s tie-breaking vote. Since her confirmation, Secretary DeVos and her department have consistently worked to reshape Title IX-mandated provisions that set out a safe, fair process by which students can report sexual harassment and assault on campus.

Earlier this year, the Department of Education finalized a list of the new Title IX regulations that some argue will dissuade reporting. All postsecondary institutions that receive federal funding, like MU, must comply with the new regulations. This is the first time since 1997 that the Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights (OCR) has released formal Title IX regulations.

The released material includes guidelines that merely direct universities to their options under Title IX. For instance, one new guideline is a change in the amount of evidence needed to find a student in violation of a school’s student code. The Obama administration mandated that schools use the standard of “preponderance of the evidence.” This means over half of the evidence is needed to find a student in violation of a school’s student code.

The new guidelines allow universities to decide between using the “preponderance of the evidence” or “clear and convincing” standards. The latter is a much higher standard, which makes it harder to find a perpetrator in violation.

The result of using the higher standard would be devastating because a respondent (the party accused of discrimination or harassments) is more likely to not be found in violation of the student code. A direct consequence is less reporting of harassment and sexual misconduct. This process can drag out over months and take a toll on the complainant, who we presume has already been through enough.

Having a higher standard for finding a violation will dissuade survivors from reporting their very real claims. Along with the personal and emotional reasons that a survivor may not report, adopting a high standard of evidence would only worsen the issue.

Luckily, the UM System chose to keep the standard as “preponderance of the evidence.”

However, one part of the UM System code that deserves strict scrutiny is their definition of a complainant. (Section 600.030). Their definition of a complainant states that even if a victim of discrimination, harrassment or sexual misconduct decides to report but not pursue a claim for sanctions under the same code, the university may serve as the complainant and nevertheless pursue charges against the respondent.

“The University may serve as the Complainant when the person alleged to have been subjected to discrimination, harassment or sexual misconduct in violation of the University’s Anti-Discrimination Policies chooses not to act as the Complainant in the resolution process or requests that the Complaint not be pursued.” (Section 600.030 (C)(2)).

This can have an adverse effect on someone who wishes to report.

If universities wish to keep their campuses safe, they will argue for pursuing any claim that might prevent this type of activity from happening again. If a survivor has been threatened by a respondent, and subsequently drops a charge, that reeks of injustice. How can the UM System enforce justice if those who complain can be threatened out of reporting?

On the other hand, it takes power away from the one person who ought to matter — the survivor. There can be a number of compelling reasons that one may wish to withdraw their complaint. Some of those reasons include not wanting to testify or answer questions regarding a traumatic event. They may want to seek counseling and move on. That’s a decision that should be theirs to make.

What’s even more disturbing is that a University-complainant might call a survivor in as a witness, despite the survivor dropping the complaint. Even if a survivor chooses to be done with the entire process, for whatever reason, they may still be involved as a witness and have to recount their entire story again. Under new Title IX regulations, live cross-examinations are mandated for post-secondary institutions, only by an advisor for both sides.

This would mean that a survivor would have to take antagonistic questions from someone appointed by the respondent as their advisor. A cross-examiner seeks to ask unfair questions of the complainant and witnesses to undermine their credibility.

While questions about sexual history are explicitly banned by new Title IX regulations, questions about drinking and “implied consent” are not.

The UM code does not explicitly say that this will definitely happen, but it should horrify students that the university reserves this right. While protecting a community at large is certainly a valid concern, it’s dangerous that this right can be invoked at the university’s will.

It’s worth noting that a good handful of people who are writing these rules are appointed by elected officials. From Betsy Devos on down, voting determines these outcomes. Demand better from those elected officials. The best way you can do this is by voting. Vote for candidates that won’t appoint officials who create regulations that will lead to traumatic situations. Vote for candidates who will impose a better process for survivors.

126,Joshi,Hirsh,themaneater,"Hirsh Joshi is a first year law student at MU. He is a columnist that writes about race, culture, politics and government for the Maneater

It’s pretty easy to miss — the storefront is a single door squished between the Sycamore restaurant and Rally House. There are no large lit up signs. Yet, it’s very clear the Peace Nook is straight out of President Nixon’s nightmares; it exuberates ‘hippie’ culture.

When you go down the stairs to enter the store, somebody always greets you (and gently asks you to use the hand sanitizer provided).

They have a diverse selection of books, ranging in topics from sexuality to spirituality; politics to gardening; peace to interventionism. Some of these books aren’t available at Barnes & Noble. Similarly, their shirt game is unique. Some shirts directly take on politics such as “Dump Trump” and “He’s Not My President.” Some take on organic food gardening.

Other clothing includes tie dye shirts and wool threaded sweaters and pants. They also sell essential oils, organic foods, ayurvedic medicine, Pride accessories, bumper stickers, tapestries, posters, fair trade wallets and hats. Perhaps the most popular items at Peace Nook are in the incense section.

But the magic of Peace Nook is not just in the store; it participates in advocacy within the community. The Peace Nook opened in late August of 1990 and recently celebrated 30 years. The store has served as a progressive staple in the community for longer than most MU students have been alive.

To really do justice to this topic, I felt it necessary to interview someone who works at Peace Nook (from 6 feet away, of course). I had the pleasure of sitting down with Mark Haim, founder and director of Mid-Missouri Peaceworks, the 501(c)(3) non-profit that owns Peace Nook. Because Peace Nook is a non-profit, he told me he could not explicitly endorse or advocate for any political candidate.

“I want this to be an accessible point for people to enter progressive activism ... people should be able to come in and ask ‘Hey, is anyone doing something about this or that?’” Haim said when asked about his original vision for Peace Nook.

Mid-Missouri Peaceworks is not taking new volunteers this semester due to the pandemic. However, current volunteers help the cause through canvassing, passing petitions and organizing classes. This includes large events such as their upcoming 5K Walk for the Climate on Sept. 20th and Bike for the Climate Ride on Oct. 4th.

Next, I pointed out that in November we have, perhaps the most consequential election of both of our lifetimes (we are about five decades apart in age). I asked about the three largest things he hopes his patrons keep in mind when they vote.

Haim answered that climate change is the existential crisis of our lifetime. “The people of [Generation Z] are likely to inherit a miserable situation,” Haim said. He referred to a study by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change saying that we have until 2030 to cut carbon emissions in half, otherwise we’re doomed.

Haim then said denuclearization, saying that preventative measures should be taken before an irrational leader becomes emboldened.

He lastly said general inequality: whether it be fighting racism, homophobia, sexism or xenophobia. “These have been used by those at the top, of every party, to divide us for their profit.”

The conversation turned to campus matters.

I asked Haim how Peace Nook reconciles the need for students on campus and its own ideology of trusting science.

Haim has personally advocated for a more comprehensive testing system, similar to those at peer schools such as the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He said that testing should be made readily available and contact tracing should be widespread. Haim said that he sent four letters to the president of the UM system, Mun Choi. He only received a response to the first one, which was a generic letter sent to the community. He also said that he sent various unreturned letters to public health committees in Columbia and MU.

I asked what Peace Nook and Mid-Missouri Peaceworks will look like in the next 30 years. He pointed out that many of his organization’s members are older, despite being on a college campus.

“It seems like every day we hear about more of our members passing or moving into nursing homes,” Haim said. “There is high turnover for younger people.” They are only involved for as long as they are in taking classes.

He hopes to attract younger people to become long-term members of his organization. This is so that it can survive well past his time. I certainly hope so too.

I left the store feeling hopeful. The Peace Nook serves as a safe place for all people. The only thing that isn't tolerated seems to be intolerance itself. The message of Haim’s organization can seem diluted amongst everything going on, but that’s all the more reason to embrace it. Whichever direction Mid-Missouri Peaceworks and Peace Nook take, I know the right principles will live on. Here’s to another 30 years and beyond. Happy birthday, Peace Nook.

127,Joshi,Hirsh,allsides,"Dr. Anthony Fauci, the leading epidemiologist for the White House coronavirus task force, testified before the House Select Committee on the Coronavirus Crisis last week. During the hearing, Fauci exchanged words with Congressman Jim Jordan (R-OH) after Jordan asked about limits on protesting as possible means to control the coronavirus. Fauci maintained that he could not answer that question.

But people who only read one side of the news might have entirely separate impressions of how the confrontation went.

AllSides analysis found that right-rated media were more likely to paint Fauci as the loser of this exchange. For instance, the Washington Examiner’s coverage included only negative reactions towards Fauci, such as tweets from Meghan McCain. TheBlaze described Fauci as “visibly perturbed,” something few other outlets observed, if any. The Daily Caller focused its report on Jordan’s questioning of Fauci regarding violence in Chicago, in an apparent attempt to disparage protesters. Coverage from these sources and others, including the New York Post and Daily Wire, said that Jordan “grilled” Fauci. An opinion from the Washington Times described the questioning as Jordan “hammering” Fauci.

Center-rated outlets were more likely to describe the testimony in neutral terms, though some did frame Fauci as being on the favorable side of the exchange. The Hill used the word “presses""; Business Insider said that the two “clashed”. Real Clear Politics ran the headline, “Jim Jordan to Fauci: Did Nationwide Protests Help Spread Coronavirus?” The Week mentioned that Jordan failed in his attempts to elicit specific information from Fauci. Reuters also followed this trend, framing the confrontation as Fauci resisting a “Republican effort to turn testimony against protesters.”

On the other side of the aisle, left-rated outlets painted Jordan as incompetent. AlterNet suggested that Fauci laughed at Jordan’s questions. CNN merely called the exchange “heated”. Yahoo News described the exchange as “tense”. An analysis piece published by Mother Jones referred to Jordan’s line of questioning as “ranting”. Refinery29 pushed the idea that Jordan wanted to get a public health basis for banning protests that he politically disagrees with. Mediaite framed the issue as Fauci pushing back on Jordan’s questions. The New York Times framed the story as Jordan “tr[ying] to press Fauci”.

Some outlets resisted partisan conformity. One America News Network used rather neutral language when compared to coverage from its right-rated peers, running the headline, “Rep. Jordan Questions Fauci On How Protests Are Contributing To Pandemic.” BBC News, on the other hand, used similar language to its right-rated counterparts, saying Fauci was “grilled,” despite being a center-rated outlet.

These examples fit one of AllSides’ types of media bias: bias by spin. Spin is using loaded wording in order to suggest something stronger than what is actually happening. Often, ambiguous language is used that cannot be objectively supported. Can we empirically say that Fauci was “hammered,” “grilled,” or that Jordan was “ranting”? Not really. This is often used as a tool to pull an audience in or have them believe something much stronger than it really occurred.

AllSides points this all out for one reason: many Americans didn’t watch the testimony live. They read about the testimony afterwards, some even from the very sources we cited. This means that many Americans didn’t get the full picture, they just got framing from an outlet. This may include short clips of the interaction and selective quotes to push one side of the story or a specific characterization — both examples of bias by spin. Whether Fauci made Jordan look bad or vice versa should be up to the reader to decide. But the outlets that consciously decided to not use neutral language and direct quotes took that choice away from their consumers.

So the next time you read about a ""heated"" exchange, ""rant,"" or ""spar"", consider reading across the spectrum or going directly to the source to watch the exchange for yourself — instead of relying on subjective interpretations from biased journalists.

128,Joshi,Hirsh,allsides,"This year’s Democratic National Convention will take place from August 17-20 in Milwaukee (otherwise known as the second best city on Lake Michigan), where former Vice President Joe Biden is expected to be crowned the party’s nominee for president. But weeks before Milwaukee is set to host the festivities, more than 100 Wisconsin police departments have pulled their security forces for the convention, citing concern over a Milwaukee city directive to suspend the use of tear gas and pepper spray.

But not all media outlets covered the news.

According to AllSides’ analysis, few left-rated sources and some center-rated sources published original reporting on the matter. Business Insider and The Hill reported on the story. The Daily Beast (whose coverage was just one paragraph long), Newsweek, Al Jazeera, and Yahoo News were some of the left-rated outlets to offer original reporting on the story. Two of the center-rated sources are quite different: the Associated Press and Just The News. One is a longstanding titan of the industry that feeds contents to thousands of other publications, and the other is very small and lesser known. JustTheNews got roughly 3.9 million page visits in the last six months; the Associated Press got 37.2 million in the same time frame.

Right rated outlets that covered the story include The Daily Mail, The Epoch Times, Fox News and the Police Tribune. An opinion piece published in the Wall Street Journal opinion section, which is rated by AllSides as Lean Right, also mentioned the news. (The Wall Street Journal’s news section is rated center, however.)

We do note however, that some of our rated outlets did choose to repost the Associated Press story. These outlets include the Washington Times, ABC News, Washington Post, New York Times and Chicago Tribune. In addition, many unrated sources reported on the news, including local publications in the Midwest and law enforcement-focused outlets.

We should note that JustTheNews, The Police Tribune, and Al Jazeera are not part of our featured sources list, which is the list of sources we normally assess when doing media bias by omission research.

These examples of omission can potentially exacerbate a problem that AllSides aims to heal: filter bubbles. People in left-rated filter bubbles could be completely unaware of this news. While the DNC has yet to be canceled or rescheduled (or relocated two hours south, to a state where the pandemic is being handled with competence) it would still be in the interest of possible attendees and delegates to know that police presence at the event may be significantly reduced.

This isn’t the first time we have mentioned disparities in media reporting on policing or law enforcement; neither left-rated nor right-rated media is innocent from skewed coverage on the subject matter.

Right-rated outlets likely pushed this story more than their left-rated counterparts because it tackles an issue that is dear to conservative media, backing the blue. This story serves to give police departments and officers something crucial in politics: agency. It also strengthens the narrative of police officers being under attack, which is the basis of movements like “Blue Lives Matter” and “Thin Blue Line.” Fond du Lac Police Chief William Lamb: ""We believe [that] removing those tools, the use of chemical irritants or pepper spray, from the available resources that the law enforcement officers would have at their disposal if protests become non peaceful would severely compromise the safety of the public and also the safety of the law enforcement officers who would be assigned to protect the DNC.”

Of course, this news can similarly serve the narrative of defunding the police. Some would argue that if police aren’t willing to keep up their end of contracts based on the tactics available to them, they aren’t fulfilling their obligations to protect and serve, rendering their value as relatively useless. Some could also argue that the best way to reduce police brutality is by chasing the police away, leaving Milwaukee’s goal of reducing police brutality during protests a technical success. Police in this situation acted more like a corporate entity and not like a group of people. It should be noted that Fond du Lac is about 94% white, and worlds away from protests around the murder of George Floyd.

We believe that people should read across the spectrum, so that they can make an informed decision about the world around them. If you have any questions or tips regarding media bias, contact us.

129,Joshi,Hirsh,allsides,"Protests surrounding policing and police brutality in America have recently escalated in Portland. According to President Donald Trump, the protesters are escalating violence, leading Trump and Acting Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Chad Wolf, to send federal police to the City of Roses. While some may say that federal officers de-escalated the situation, some of their methods have drawn scrutiny—including reports of protesters being taken off the street in unmarked vans to undisclosed locations, which DHS Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli said was done “to keep both the officers safe and also, when crowds gathered, to move people to a safe location for questioning … out of reach of a mob"".

But another story that hasn’t gotten attention from media outlets, especially from right-rated outlets, were witness reports of federal officers damaging medical tents and destroying protesters’ first aid supplies. Some have even gone far enough as to call these allegations a war crime, citing the Geneva Conventions.

NBC News briefly mentioned the claim that federal officers destroyed medical tents; the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), USA Today, and Newsweek were other center- and left-rated outlets that reported on the claim.

The ACLU Foundation declared that it filed suit against DHS, Portland, and the US Marshals Service for allegedly attacking volunteer medics at protests. USA Today’s in-depth look into Portland protests mentioned the lawsuit; Axios, The Hill, and Common Dreams mentioned either the claim medics were attacked, the lawsuit, or both.

One fact check outlet, Truth or Fiction, reviewed the claims of pepper spraying being a war crime according to the Geneva Conventions and rated them as true. Some have refuted this claim, arguing that Geneva Convention rule 28 is only applicable when international entities are concerned. In other words, those few think that the actions of DHS are legal when applied to US citizens, but illegal when applied to other countries’ nationals.

No right-rated outlets offered original reporting on this specific lawsuit and set of accusations. Breitbart did republish a wire service story on the lawsuit. One right-rated source, the Washington Times, published a story about some conservatives and libertarians opposing government suppression of local protests. Some right-rated outlets, including Reason Magazine, PJ Media and Newsmax, mentioned a separate ACLU lawsuit that seeks to prevent federal agents from attempting to disperse journalists and “legal observers” in Portland. No other right-rated source mentioned the purported violence against volunteer medics, or the new ACLU lawsuit against government agencies.

Some right-rated outlets mimicked President Trump’s rhetoric, demonizing protesters and justifying actions taken against protesters at large (though they did not defend the claim of attacks on medics specifically). Ironically, the two groups mentioned in the Washington Times article, conservatives and libertarians, are generally known for ‘protecting’ the First and Second Amendments, yet have been uncharacteristically silent on the issue of medical supplies being pepper sprayed.

It is unclear how exactly the medical supplies were damaged, whether it was intentionally done by federal agents, or if the supplies were unintentionally damaged as agents tried to disperse the crowd. What we do know is that the president directed officers to quell violence, and that there were subsequent allegations of medical supplies being destroyed.

It should be noted that NBC News and the ACLU did not cite their sources. This illustrates bias by omission of source attribution. By not including their sources, both outlets do not allow for their reporting to be questioned or verified. However, the ACLU’s omission is understandable, given that they’re engaged in ongoing litigation and might wish to protect some witnesses. This method is usually done when retaliation is feared, so we cannot truly hold this omission against them.

Some may say that these protesters are violent anarchists, anti-government radicals, and just all around bad mamajamas. These same people would be aghast to learn how this country started its revolution for independence. Some may also say that the protesters themselves staged the pepper spraying of medical supplies. These protesters must be really good at multitasking if they were destroying their own medical supplies while getting tear gassed and pepper sprayed themselves during their fight for equality and justice. While some may say that more force is needed to stop ‘violent’ protesters, privately, some Feds believe that their presence escalated violence. Even former DHS Secretary Tom Ridge was critical of DHS being in Portland, calling it not consistent"" with the Department of Homeland Security's mission.

But a large problem is evident: those in right-leaning filter bubbles might be unaware of these alleged war crimes happening right here in their own country. If actions similar to war crimes were purportedly happening to my own countrymen, I’d rather be in the know than not. And I wouldn’t care that much to ask which government was performing them, as it would be largely irrelevant.

If medical supplies for protesters were truly destroyed intentionally, tyranny would have shown its ugly face where it is not welcome. And while the technicalities of rule 28 might rescue President Trump and DHS Secretary Chad Wolf from criminal prosecution in theory, such a technicality would hardly rescue the alleged action itself.

When only one side of the media reports something, it puts readers in a tough spot. To beat the bias, do your best to seek out multiple viewpoints and uncover any sides of the story you may be missing. If you have feedback or a tip, email us at admin@allsides.com.

130,Joshi,Hirsh,allsides,"Refrigeration trucks are being used to store the dead in parts of Texas and Arizona where morgues are reaching capacity. But depending on the kinds of media you consume or the filter bubble you’ve wound up in, you may not have known this, as the story was more likely to be covered by left-rated media outlets than right-rated outlets.

On the flip side, the right was more likely to cover Texas’s Department of Health removing roughly 3,400 cases from its official count as of July 17.

AllSides found few right-rated outlets mentioned the refrigerated trucks requested in Arizona, Texas, and Florida. Fox News did report on the story, but other right-rated outlets published works framing the spike in coronavirus cases as questionable.

On the other hand, left- and center-rated sources were more likely to cover the refrigerated trucks, including CNN, CBS News, CNBC, Business Insider, and Reuters. Some indicated that more trucks would be coming from New York on order from Gov. Andrew Cuomo.

The story of Texas removing thousands of probable COVID-19 cases from the total positive count, conversely, was focused on by right-rated outlets while being covered scarcely by left-rated outlets. The Daily Wire, TheBlaze, and Washington Examiner were some of the outlets to cover it. Left-rated outlets including Politifact and The Daily Beast did publish stories on the incident, with Politifact offering a fact check on why the cases were removed.

The difference in story choice on both the left and the right shows clear bias by omission, when media outlets omit information or choose not to report certain stories that seem deserving of coverage. It’s unfortunate that depending on the media you consume, you could have very different perceptions of the pandemic in these states.

Some may accuse left- and center-rated outlets of sensationalism; in some cases, morgue capacity was already quite low — the morgue in Nueces County, Texas, which was mentioned in the CBS article, had just a 12-body capacity, while the trucks hold 40 bodies. Focusing on refrigerated trucks without giving the death rate or low morgue capacity may provide readers with an inflated idea of how deadly the virus can be. Some may say that this is alarmist and makes the pandemic seem worse than it actually is. But right-rated voices could also be accused of sensationalism on this subject; even if all states cut 3,500 cases (ignoring population proportions) from their official count, we’d still have just under 4 million cases in the United States, making such a cut relatively insignificant.

This is dangerous. If one’s media consumption revolves around outlets with similar perspectives and priorities, they might be unaware of these refrigerated trucks and the removal of some case numbers. Left-rated media outlets could be accused of bad-faith bias by omission when not reporting on significant case count revisions, but the potential consequences are more severe when the pandemic’s human cost is disregarded, as it seemingly was by many right-rated outlets in this case. If refrigerated trucks for dead bodies were needed in my state, I’d care a lot more about that than if just 4% of my state’s total coronavirus positives weren’t confirmed. That fraction hardly represents the seriousness of the pandemic.

Types of media bias like sensationalism and bias by omission can prevent readers from getting the full view if they consume news in a filter bubble.

131,Joshi,Hirsh,allsides,"Given how chaotic the news seems to be everyday, it can be easy to miss stories that are crucial and consequential to certain communities. On July 14, Colorado became just the 11th U.S. state to outlaw the use of the ‘trans panic’ and ‘gay panic’ criminal defense.

The ‘trans panic’ defense is a legal strategy used as mitigating evidence for a defendant accused of assaulting or even murdering a gay or trans individual. Defendants claim to have been so shocked, offended, or outraged at perceived sexual advances from a member of the LGBTQ+ community that they argue diminished capacity or self-defense.

One may think that the advancement of LGBTQ+ rights would be covered prominently by major news media. In this case, that thinking proved to be wrong.

According to AllSides’ analysis, very few major news sources reported the news within the first day. The Hill was our only featured source to report on the news. Media outlets known for covering news affecting the LGBTQ+ community such as LGBTQ Nation, The Advocate, and Pink News reported on it, as did some local Colorado newspapers including the Denver Post. However, coverage of the ban was absent from major media on both the left and right.

The ban is considered a significant win for LGBTQ+ rights by civil rights activists. Since 2014, Illinois, California, New Mexico, Maine, Rhode Island, New York, Nevada, Hawaii, Washington, and New Jersey have also banned the panic defense. A 2018 congressional bill aimed to ban the trans panic defense for federal defendants. The same bill was reintroduced as H.R. 3133 in 2019. The Illinois ban was passed during the tenure of Governor Bruce Rauner. He is the only Republican governor to pass such a bill as of July 2020.

When New Jersey banned the panic defense in early 2020, mainstream media sites like NBC News, the New York Post, US News and World Report, and the New York Daily News did report on the incident. The Washington Times reposted an Associated Press story on the matter. Washington state’s ban of the panic defense, also in early 2020, was also covered similarly by some of the outlets listed above. The Seattle Times reported on Washington’s ban and HuffPost reposted an AP story. Reuters ran a story about the panic defense in general and briefly mentioned Washington’s move.

The ongoing push for LGBTQ+ equality has garnered substantial media coverage in the past few years, but national crises like the coronavirus pandemic and inflammation of racial tensions have made other stories outside seem hard to find. Underrepresented communities are no less worthy of media attention amid other social and political predicaments; some might argue those crises make reporting on minority communities and uncommon perspectives even more important.

Balancing coverage is a constant and inescapable challenge. Sometimes, stories relevant to local or state regions don’t make their way to the national forefront, and editors will always have to make tough editorial decisions about what to cover with limited resources. But it is still worth noting when certain stories have not gotten the attention some would think they deserve.

Never settle for the top headlines or most popular stories. Always check multiple sources and go the extra mile to read content that will round out your worldview. Even when a few topics seem to dominate the headlines, there’s always more news to be covered.

132,Joshi,Hirsh,allsides,"If you've been following AllSides this week, you probably read that rapper Kanye West announced that he’s seeking a presidential bid. While this announcement earned plenty of mainstream media attention, major outlets haven’t provided much information on a campaign arguably of equal or greater relevance to the average American — that of Libertarian Party candidate Dr. Jo Jorgensen.

Jorgensen is a third party candidate who is seriously running for president. But in an apparent case of media bias, there hasn’t been much news attention on her campaign, especially compared to the coverage focused on an impromptu, largely improbable presidential bid from a celebrity with no political experience.

Mainstream media covered West’s announcement thoroughly. He was interviewed regarding his platform by Forbes, and reported on by major sources including Fox News, CNN, Snopes, Business Insider and The Hill. In spite of the attention, it remains to be seen whether West’s White House bid is at all serious; he is not eligible for the ballot in multiple states, but voters in some can still write him in. West announced that he was running as candidate for the Birthday Party (let’s see if he can secure the nomination) and that Wyoming preacher Michelle Tidball would be his running mate.

According to AllSides’ analysis, West’s recent announcement received more coverage than Jorgensen has in total. The only source that consistently covered or published articles regarding Jorgensen was Reason Magazine, a known bastion of libertarian thought. Notably, NPR, the Guardian, and the Washington Times all covered Jorgensen winning the party’s nomination, but have not covered her much since. It should be noted that Jorgensen’s presidential bid was mentioned in some analyses regarding the Libertarian Party in general.

On July 8, the Guardian published a story about Jorgensen appearing on an ‘anti-government’ podcast associated with the boogaloo movement. The paper reported that members of the movement have been tied to white supremacy; Jorgensen denounced the Guardian article, saying the movement is “largely decentralized” with members being “both those who are aligned with the principles of non-aggression and those who run counter to it.”

Jorgenson did a Q&A where she answered policy specific questions. Find out more at Jo20.com.

While Jorgensen may be the more polished politician and viable voting option, stories about a Kanye West presidential bid get clicks. This logic, laid bare by the media’s imbalanced coverage, shows how many news outlets make the primary goal viral content that serves ad revenue — not providing their audience with balanced information that may make them a better and more informed member of their community.

When media outlets focus on clicks rather than information for voters, one could argue they become complicit in tampering with elections. Some may argue that West’s and Jorgensen’s candidacies have no feasibility and only serve to undermine the “real” campaigns. But that’s not a decision to be made for voters, it’s a decision to be made by voters.

Choosing clicks over balanced content hinders the ability of less visible, less common perspectives and values to break into the limelight. By ignoring alternative views, our civil discourse becomes unhealthy. People feel that you must pick between blue or red. This is not to deride or endorse any candidate or political system, but rather to note that when media outlets omit or obscure certain perspectives, our civil society is harmed.

Some other candidates you may not have heard of in the media include Howie Hawkins, who seems to be the presumptive nominee for the Green Party (which has not yet nominated a candidate), and Rocque de la Fuente, who is running as a Republican and as an Independent. In other words, there’s more than Biden, Trump, and Chicago’s second-greatest disappointment (behind only Mitch Trubisky).

AllSides won’t tell you who to vote for.

133,Joshi,Hirsh,allsides,"On June 24, President Donald Trump signed an executive order aimed at strengthening the foster care system. But with little coverage on the matter from major news outlets, you might not have read about it in the news, or heard it debated by the Coopers and Hannitys of the media industry. In fact, I first found out about the news because I follow the First Lady on Instagram.

The order received scarce news coverage from major outlets when compared to other decisions and rulings of late, especially divisive subjects such as the June 12 Department of Health and Human Services rule change regarding healthcare discrimination under the Affordable Healthcare Act.

Only one left-rated source had offered original reporting on the order at the time of this writing; the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which raised legal objections over possible discrimination it argued was implied by the order’s description of ""faith-based agencies"". The Hill and the Associated Press are the only center-rated sources that reported on the order.

This lack of coverage could be considered ""bias by omission"". In theory, a story that makes the president look good is not something that fits the left-leaning media narrative.

News outlets have long been accused of a negative bias in the stories they choose to cover, but research also suggests that readers themselves might bear some responsibility. Especially in today's digital first news media climate, if you're not going to click on it, they're probably not going to cover it. (The AP article was reposted by multiple other sources from the left, but those sources were excluded because they didn’t publish original reports.)

Right-rated sources reported more frequently on the news, with many framing the move as a good-hearted effort from the Trump administration to help children in need. Most also framed the order in the context of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, during which the foster care system has reportedly suffered major disruptions. Fox News (online), Deseret News, Breitbart, National Review, and Townhall were some of the right-rated sources that reported on the order. However, only the Deseret News made mention of the ACLU's legal challenge — another example of bias by omission.

The attention the news received in some right-leaning circles didn't compare whatsoever to the nonstop coverage of the pandemic, racial tension and unrest after the death of George Floyd, hyperpartisan Capitol Hill happenings, and the never-ending mudslinging and speculation associated with the 2020 election — hence why you probably hadn’t read about it. This could be seen as a reverse of the typical “bias by placement” case; a story with seemingly positive implications for children in need, at a time when the U.S. could arguably use good news more than ever, wasn’t prioritized by any major news media.

Our news team didn't see the reports on the order until Friday, and thus didn't incorporate them in our daily curation until then. AllSides makes it our mission to cover the uncommon perspectives, but in these unprecedented times our ambitions aren’t always met. This writing is both an attempt to report in full the media bias regarding this news, and to reassure our audience that we will always try to reflect the media climate in a way that empowers our readers to learn and decide for themselves — especially when major news media on all sides of the spectrum seem to fall short of their responsibilities.

134,Joshi,Hirsh,allsides,"On June 12, the Department of Health and Human Services reversed an Obama-era rule regarding religious freedom and healthcare access for transgender individuals under the Affordable Care Act.

Sources rated as being on either side of the AllSides media bias spectrum reported on the news within days of the HHS decision, and did so in similar proportions. 64% of our “featured” left-rated news sources (14 of 22) reported on the decision within five days of the news (AllSides rates the bias of over 600 news outlets, writers and sources, but highlights roughly 50 popular sources as “featured”); 54% of featured right-rated news outlets (7 of 13) did the same in the same span, as did 89% of our featured center-rated news sources (8 of 9).

We only counted the outlets that published within five days of the June 12 decision. It should be noted that AllSides categorizes fewer right-rated reporting outlets as featured than left-rated ones. This is the main reason that proportions are used rather than raw number of outlets.

As one may expect, right-rated and left-rated outlets covered the decision from opposing points of view. Left-rated voices framed this as an attack on LGBTQ+ rights and as discrimination sanctioned by President Donald Trump and the Republican Party. Right-rated voices framed this as the Trump administration fighting to protect religious freedom for healthcare providers, with some painting the Obama-era rule as unjust and muddled.

Let’s examine the differences a bit more.

Right-Rated News and Analysis

Coverage from right-rated outlets was more likely to highlight conscientious objections that some healthcare providers have to abortion, and how the rule change would put that liberty back in the hands of healthcare workers. Many reports from right-rated outlets also described the HHS decision as one that returned a biology-based definition of sexual discrimination to federal healthcare mandates, replacing an Obama-era rule that purportedly redefined “sex,” as in “male” or “female,” to include “gender identity.”

Some coverage focused on criticisms of the transgender community’s definition of “gender,” pointing to objections from conservatives and alleged feminists who say certain pushes for transgender rights impede women's rights by including women born as biological men in women’s issues. Similar reports criticized progressives for supposedly seeking “the power to rewrite civic rules.”

Some mentioned protections that stayed in place for persons with disabilities and non-English speakers. However, they also mentioned that explanations of benefits letters in multiple languages will no longer be required by providers, and the Trump rule change regarding trans people being barred from enlisting in the military.

Overall, right-rated outlets framed the change as a win for religious liberty and science, while painting the Obama-era rule and its interpretations of “sex” and “gender” as unjust.

Left-Rated News and Analysis

Coverage from left-rated sources often framed the decision as anti-trans discrimination, and a move by the Trump administration to narrow the definition of sex discrimination to exclude transgender individuals. Some focused specifically on the move's potential to allow healthcare providers to deny gender affirmation surgeries and basic healthcare needs to transgender people based on the provider's religious beliefs.

Many left-rated outlets mentioned the fact that the rule change occurred during National Pride Month, and specifically on the fourth anniversary of the Pulse nightclub massacre, a shooting at an LGBTQ+ oriented bar in Florida. Some also framed the decision in the context of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, suggesting that transgender persons in need of medical care may not recieve it.

One analysis referred to the rule change, along with other rule changes regarding sexuality, as a “war on trans people.” This piece often referred to Republican-led states recently enacting or considering legislation to hinder trans rights including Idaho’s law barring individuals from changing their gender on birth certificates and South Carolina’s hearings regarding banning transition care for minors. Some reports from left-rated media framed the move as one to appeal to Trump’s religious base while destroying anti-discrimination policies.

Overall, left-rated outlets framed the rule change as a loss for transgender rights and societal equality, while painting the decision as reflective of the current administration and ruling party’s purported lack of respect for the LGBTQ+ community.

Philosophical Differences

At the root of the difference in reporting likely lies the philosophical differences between left and right on this issue.

The right side of the spectrum often views gender as not being based on personal feelings, instead linking it to biology. Many on the right say treating biological males who identify as women (and vice versa) according to their gender identity rather than their biological sex could lead to improper healthcare decisions, and they object to federal requirements that would punish doctors who refuse to agree that biological females can become males, and vice versa. They often object to allowing people to legally force others to agree that they have become or even can become the opposite biological sex. They believe it is wrong to erase the distinction between male and female because it would allow biological men to compete in women’s sports competitions, win women’s scholarships, and enter traditionally women’s spaces, such as showers.

The left side of the argument, on the other hand, often believes gender is a spectrum and not tied to biology, that it is based on your internal sense of being male or female, and that individuals who feel they have been born in the wrong body are entitled to healthcare based on how they feel and identify. They believe it is wrong to legally allow doctors to deny care to people who have determined their internal sense of their gender is different than their biological body; many believe doctors serve a role in society that should inherently treat all people equally.

If only reading left-rated or right-rated media, one could be convinced of a certain viewpoint without ever considering the other side of the argument. Reading about an issue such as this, when a federal decision seemingly pits the rights of one group against another, is a task that could easily — sometimes misleadingly — shape the reader’s perception of a certain culture or demographic.

This is what makes AllSides so important. Journalists should be trusted, impartial sources of comprehensive information, but media bias often impedes that. Getting multiple perspectives and defeating biased filter bubbles is the only way to ensure you get a broad understanding of an issue and consider the whole picture.

135,Joshi,Hirsh,allsides,"Since recent rioting and protesting began in the wake of George Floyd’s death at the hands of police, media outlets across the spectrum have been accused of many types of bias. While these biases often favor one political party or political movement, some claim that coverage of the unrest in United States cities have favored certain racial and ethnic groups.

Univision and Telemundo, the predominant national Spanish-language news networks in the U.S., have come under fire for purportedly anti-black reporting on rioting and looting. Critics claim the broadcasts are guilty of bias by omission and sensationalism.

Some social media users criticized what they saw as a lack of context in Univision and Telemundo broadcasts covering rioting and looting. They say that the networks only focused on the violence, which could in theory lead Spanish-speaking communities to believe that rioters and protestors are part of the same group, or that protesters also loot to advance the same cause. Moreover, Telemundo and Univision have been accused of showing Latinx-owned businesses being robbed, supposedly giving off the idea that they’re being targeted specifically.

Some voices also accused the two networks of sustaining an anti-black culture, saying they only feature Spanish speakers who have the most European physical features at the forefront of their visible news team. This is known in some cases as colorism, which is also a common claim in the Asian-American diasporas.

Critics fear that Telemundo and Univision’s alleged biases could supposedly create more trouble for demographics they see are endangered, such as young black men, by giving an incomplete picture of the protests. Black men living in the Pilsen and Little Village neighborhoods of Chicago are reportedly being targeted by the Latin Kings, a notorious street gang aiming to protect their neighborhoods from looters. Critics say they are indiscriminately targeting black men.

Of course, some members of Latino neighborhoods have spoken out about this, including one Latin Kings member who offered support for Black Lives Matter and said he opposes the idea of targeting black people. This was certainly perplexing, with organized gangs and the Chicago Police Department reportedly working hand-in-hand to combat looting.

There is no known evidence that Telemundo and Univision are intentionally reporting disproportionately on black involvement in riots and looting, and no proof whatsoever that the network’s coverage has encouraged organized, indiscriminate hate crimes. But if it’s true that the broadcasts presented events that were relatively rare as commonplace, the two outlets would have presented an exaggerated view of the violence and rioting, which could have in turn stoked undue fear in the Hispanic community. And this is not the first time either of the outlets have been accused of anti-blackness.

AllSides does not examine television broadcasting, but we do report on claims of media bias. With fewer options for Spanish-language news sources in the U.S., the audience is contained in an often-inescapable TV news filter bubble. The relative oligopoly on Spanish-language broadcast means it is imperative that the news be balanced and critically examined, but if and when it’s not, be sure to get news from multiple sources and perspectives to ensure you’re getting the full picture.

136,Kurtz,Howard,washingtonpost,"The growing exodus of mainstream reporters from the nation's capital has ceded much of the turf to a new, more specialized kind of journalism.

Just as newspaper, magazine and television bureaus here are shrinking or shutting down at the dawn of the Obama administration, high-priced newsletters and trade publications are filling the breach. Climate Wire, an online newsletter launched last year, now has more Washington staffers -- 10 -- than Hearst Newspapers.

""This dramatically changes what gets covered and how,"" says Tom Rosenstiel, director of the Project for Excellence in Journalism, which surveys the new landscape in a report released yesterday. ""As the government is getting bigger and playing a larger role in our lives in an activist era, there are fewer reporters monitoring that on behalf of the general public.

""The niche media cover trees, not forests. . . . They're generally not involved in watchdog, exposé journalism that by its very existence is a check on malfeasance.""

Thirty-two of the nation's newspapers, representing 23 states, had their own Washington bureaus last year -- fewer than half the number of the mid-1980s. The Newhouse and Copley chains closed their D.C. bureaus last year, and Cox is shutting its down in April. Time and Newsweek have 14 and 20 staffers here, respectively, a decline of more than half during the same period. The three broadcast networks had 51 journalists in Washington early last year -- down from 110 in 1985 -- and that was before the latest cutbacks.

Dean Baquet, Washington bureau chief of the New York Times -- which, along with the Wall Street Journal, has maintained the general size of its office here -- said in an interview with the group that the trend is bad for democracy: ""It concentrates knowledge in the hands of those who want to influence votes. It means the lobbyist knows more about Senator [Richard] Shelby than the people of Alabama.""

The growth has been elsewhere, among publications with such names as Energy Trader, Government Executive and Food Chemical News. Since 1986, the number of newsletters with Washington staff has risen 61 percent, to 223, and the number of trade publications is up 24 percent, to 214.

""The 'balance of information' has been tilted away from voters along Main Street thousands of miles away to issue-based groups that jostle for influence daily in the corridors of power,"" the report says.

Congressional Quarterly, which includes such publications as CQ Budget Tracker and CQ Senate Watch, has an editorial staff of about 165 -- more than the number of Hill-accredited reporters for The Washington Post or Associated Press, the report says. But CQ recently put itself up for sale.

Some new organizations, such as Politico, have a broader appeal. Bloomberg News, which had no presence on Capitol Hill in the 1980s, had 112 accredited staffers last year. National Public Radio's Washington staff ballooned from 267 in 2000 to more than 400 last year. But NPR recently cut 64 jobs.

Foreign media organizations have also been expanding their Washington presence. The BBC's staff of 50 is one-third larger than four years ago. Al-Jazeera has 105. Overall, the report says, 796 media outlets from 113 countries have set up shop here, compared with 507 outlets from 79 countries in 1994. But though many serve large audiences back home, foreign journalists generally lack the access to break stories.

Beat reporting has taken a beating, with the number of mainstream newspapers and wire services covering the Pentagon full time dropping from 21 to 12 since 2001, and from 15 to 10 at the State Department. But the greatest impact of the Old Media erosion is the shrinking attention to local congressional delegations, and legislation and regulation that affects certain states and communities.

The once-mighty Los Angeles Times bureau has merged with that of parent company Tribune, which also provides coverage for the Baltimore Sun, Hartford Courant and other papers. Newsday, which had 15 reporters here when George W. Bush took office, now has one. Salt Lake's Deseret News and Maine's Portland Press-Herald have left town.

Salt Lake City Tribune correspondent Thomas Burr, who heads the Regional Reporters Association, told the group: ""We sometimes joke that we're becoming an endangered species.""",0,http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/10/AR2009021003935.html

Joe Lockhart's Insider Job

 McCurry Exit: A White House Wit's End (Washington Post, July 24)

By Howard Kurtz

Washington Post Staff Writer

Wednesday, September 9, 1998; Page D01 On the sixth night of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, Joe Lockhart hit the phones. The Dallas Morning News had just touted a possible White House witness to an encounter between the president and the intern, and Lockhart was harassing the networks that picked it up. He called ""Nightline,"" which reported the administration's denial before signing off. He called CNN reporter John King after the report was mentioned on ""Larry King Live."" ""The story is a piece of [excrement],"" Lockhart declared. ""Your network is putting it on the air. You can't just pin it on the Dallas Morning News. Your credibility is at stake."" During eight months of Lewinsky coverage, King says, ""I've probably had more conversations with Joe Lockhart between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m. than with my wife."" And Lockhart's instincts were right that night: The Morning News retracted the story hours later. Lockhart's style -- a mixture of hard-driving defense, provocative analysis and barbed humor -- is becoming familiar to Washington reporters. Many have tangled with him as the sharp-tongued deputy to outgoing press secretary Mike McCurry. Others remember him as the pit-bull spokesman for President Clinton's 1996 campaign. Still others recall his work as an editor and producer for three networks. That media experience may come in handy when Lockhart, 39, succeeds his pal McCurry in the $125,000 post next month. He will be the first White House press secretary since Ron Nessen in the Ford administration to have had a recent career as a newsman. The son of journalists and the husband of a longtime ABC producer, Lockhart was spinning through the revolving door between media and politics long before that phrase became fashionable. But he abandoned the news business a half-dozen years ago after concluding it was shallow. ""I just think I'm better at being inside than outside,"" Lockhart says. ""I'm someone who joins a team, loves a cause, more than someone who is a trained observer. I like to be on the right side, rather than just doing 'he-said/she-said.' "" A stocky man whose thick brown hair has a prominent gray streak, Lockhart is a Bruce Springsteen devotee and baseball fanatic with photographic recall of sports trivia. Friends say he recently showed a hint of a midlife crisis by indulging himself with a maroon Saab convertible. ""He's a likable guy who doesn't seem to have a huge ego,"" says CBS's Bill Plante. But it is a measure of Lockhart's relationship with the president, forged over long days and nights on the campaign trail, that no other serious contender emerged for the job. ""Clinton really, really likes him,"" McCurry says. ""He's always liked partisan shots taken with a little humor, and Joe is very good at that."" To his colleagues, Lockhart is a workhorse, not a flash-and-dash man, who plodded his way to the top job. ""He did it without a lot of elbows,"" says presidential counselor Doug Sosnik. ""He could have worked the cocktail party circuit and the politics of the building and he might have gotten ahead more quickly, but that's not who he is. He made no bones about the fact he'd like to have the job, but he wasn't going to get it by polishing Mike's shoes. He's not going to change to placate people."" When Rep. Dan Burton called Clinton a ""scumbag,"" McCurry took a cue from Lockhart by expressing admiration that the Indiana Republican had attempted ""a two-syllable word."" When the White House was accused of delaying the Lewinsky probe through yet another legal appeal, Lockhart whispered to McCurry that it was Day 1,400 of the Kenneth Starr investigation -- and that became the sound bite on all the networks. ""He's fed me a lot of lines that I've gotten credit for,"" McCurry confesses. Yet Lockhart has picked perhaps the worst possible moment to move into the spacious West Wing office with floor-to-ceiling windows that was occupied by Ron Ziegler during Watergate. Clinton's admission that he misled the country about his affair with Lewinsky has jeopardized his presidency and shaken loyalists like Lockhart who were sent out to doggedly defend him. ""It makes the job harder when you've got a credibility problem, and we've got one of those right now,"" he admits. ""It'll be a slow, painstaking process of repairing the credibility damage."" Pressed further about Clinton's lie, Lockhart turns opaque, saying, ""I'm trying as hard as I can not to be quotable."" Still, he says of his new job: ""Most of my friends think I'm absolutely out of my mind. I can't build a compelling case that they're wrong."" Lockhart's challenge is to be a body blocker for a president facing possible impeachment while satisfying the minimum dietary requirements of voracious reporters -- and their bosses. Yesterday, on his own initiative, Lockhart came to The Washington Post newsroom to pay a courtesy call on Executive Editor Leonard Downie. In the polarized atmosphere of the White House, however, aides who get along with journalists often come under suspicion. ""When people here get off ranting about the unfairness of the press, Joe will say, 'Wait a minute, here's how it works,' "" a White House official says. ""Internally, some people think he's too pro-press."" But Lockhart, who has a bit of a temper, has also gotten into shouting matches with reporters. And he doesn't always conceal his disdain for his former profession. When a New York Times reporter asked him about the political nature of a White House legal appeal, Lockhart snapped: ""I'm not going to waste my breath trying to convince a cynical press corps."" That, of course, is now his job. THE MESSENGER, PART I

In 1980, the future presidential press secretary dropped out of Georgetown University and became a bicycle messenger. ""My father was pretty freaked out,"" he recalls. This led to a serious discussion in which Raymond Lockhart, who spent decades running special-events coverage for NBC, tried to instill a sense of direction in his 20-year-old son. Joe had grown up in the New York suburb of Suffern, a boy with four sisters, and he had developed the natural resistance to doing what his dad did. But he liked politics and was surprised to learn that candidates had aides who dealt with the press. A quick phone call by his father led to a volunteer spot in Jimmy Carter's reelection campaign. That summer, however, Lockhart left to become an NBC foot soldier, writing for the network's internal wire at the Democratic National Convention in New York. Tom Brokaw gave the troops a speech on how to sneak onto the floor without credentials. Lockhart managed to do it every night. Afterward, Lockhart called Carter's campaign press secretary, Linda Peek Schacht, and talked his way into a paying job after waiting until her secretary left so Schacht would pick up the phone herself. ""He showed remarkable patience even then, an ability to keep his cool,"" she says. The following year Lockhart approached Dick Davis, who was running for lieutenant governor of Virginia. He got the press secretary's job when the woman who held it became a Busch Gardens singer because the gig paid better. Lockhart fed negative information about Davis's opponent to a Washington Post reporter, which helped Davis win the election. In 1982, Gannett hired Lockhart to help make a splash for its planned national newspaper. On the first night that USA Today was published, Lockhart took a limousine to Dulles, hopped on Chairman Al Neuharth's corporate jet to New York, was met by Neuharth's driver and delivered 40 copies to Brokaw and other Manhattan media mavens. He even gave a USA Today cap to Willard Scott, who wore it on the ""Today"" show. But politics seemed to exert a magnetic pull. Within months Lockhart, who by now had gotten his degree in European history, had climbed aboard Walter Mondale's presidential campaign. He was responsible for the care and feeding of the network cameramen and technicians, riding with them on the ""zoo plane"" and helping them find backdrops for better shots. ""There's a tendency in campaigns to see the guys who provide the pictures and sound as lesser human beings,"" says former Mondale aide Dayton Duncan. ""Joe didn't treat them that way, and they appreciated that."" Lockhart was working against McCurry, who was Sen. John Glenn's campaign spokesman at the time. When Glenn's presidential campaign crashed and burned, McCurry suggested that his deputy, Laura Logan, join the Mondale press operation. ""I was kind of overwhelmed by the fact that Joe could do this enormous task without being too ferocious about it,"" Logan says. Campaign adrenaline turned to romance, and the two were later married. Lockhart briefly worked for Paul Simon in the Senate, but he hated the Capitol's molasses pace. Once again, he drifted back to the media. He did a stint with ABC in Chicago, then became a CNN assignment editor here. ""He comes from a family where television is sort of in the blood,"" his wife says. Lockhart did some off-air reporting on the Iran-contra scandal, once making dozens of calls to track down an old college photo of shadowy operative Albert Hakim. But his main job was moving reporters and crews around the city. ""The assignment desk is pandemonium, but no matter what was falling apart around him, he was always very calm and in control,"" says Pat Reap, a CNN producer. The two men also drank beer and played poker, and when the New York Mets were one game from clinching the division title, Lockhart, a lifelong fan, dragged Reap to see them play in Philadelphia. Reap bailed out after the Mets lost Friday night and Saturday, but Lockhart insisted on staying until Sunday -- and was making plane reservations for the next game in Los Angeles when the Mets finally won. Eventually, Lockhart grew frustrated with the fledgling cable network -- ""They felt good news was cheap news,"" he says -- and his next stop was Michael Dukakis's ill-fated campaign. Perhaps the most memorable day on the campaign plane was the last one, when Lockhart belted out a bunch of Springsteen tunes. Professionally, Lockhart still seemed born to run, and he tried his hand at corporate PR with the high-powered firm of Robinson, Lake, Lerer & Montgomery, which would recruit McCurry as well. But ABC soon shipped Laura Logan to London, and Lockhart quit to follow her. After looking for work for months, Lockhart became a freelance producer for NBC and helped cover the revolution in Romania. He applied for a producer's job at British-based Sky News and was stunned when executives there wanted him for on-air work. ""In the great British tradition, they took me to a pub for lunch to see if I could drink,"" Lockhart says. Soon his daily business reports were running back home on Fox, albeit at 5 a.m. Sky News dispatched him to Washington to report on the Gulf War, but in classic show biz fashion, his program was later canceled. So Lockhart became a London representative for Robinson, Lake, where one of his clients was a D.C. law firm representing the government of Abu Dhabi. The emirate's ruling family was the major stockholder in BCCI, the bank at the center of an unfolding global scandal. Whenever a charge was made, Abu Dhabi authorities would do nothing for weeks and then issue a terse ""no comment."" Lockhart tried to tutor them in the art of damage control. One day, an Abu Dhabi official called him after putting out a statement. ""You very proud of me, right?"" Lockhart recalls the man saying. ""We respond in same news cycle."" When Lockhart returned to Washington after six years, his pal McCurry grabbed him as chief spokesman for the Clinton reelection campaign. Lockhart became a walking sound-bite machine, riddling the opposition with rhetorical fire. At times it seemed as if he were running against Bob Dole: ""After collecting hundreds of thousands from tobacco interests, Bob Dole today announces that cigarettes are not addictive."" ""Bob Dole has made a career out of negative politics, and choosing insults over ideas."" ""Bob Dole demonstrated today who is really calling the shots in his campaign -- Pat Robertson and the extreme right-wing radicals of the Republican Party."" But Lockhart did more than take partisan potshots. He called reporters traveling with Dole, tracked them down in hotel rooms, tried to get into the other guy's story. If Dole was about to give a speech on taxes, Lockhart would fax research material to the Dole reporters before the candidate spoke. And Lockhart wasn't shy about complaining. ""He does not hesitate to pick up the phone and get in your face when he thinks he's got a point,"" says CNN's King. ""A lot of the time he's right. He's an aggressive advocate. He's pretty tenacious in pushing his view."" With Clinton cruising in the polls, Lockhart was finally enjoying life with a winner. Then, two weeks before Election Day, his mother died. At the funeral, Lockhart delivered a bittersweet eulogy for the woman who was once Jack Benny's producer. The next day, at a campaign stop, Lockhart was touched when the president spent time talking to his sisters about their loss. Once Clinton was reelected, Lockhart received a slew of lucrative corporate offers, including a senior vice president's job at America Online. He was sorely tempted; he had been on the road so long that his 2-year-old daughter, Clare, was afraid to be alone with him. But McCurry kept pressing his friend to join the press office. ""Someday you should think about doing the job I'm doing now,"" he recalls telling Lockhart. ""I can't see myself making it to the end of the second term."" McCurry discussed the idea with Clinton and concluded that ""we could never hold out to Joe that it was a done deal, but he'd certainly have a shot at the job."" The pressure campaign began. Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles called. Senior aides Rahm Emanuel and Sosnik called. ""Deep down, he wanted to work at the White House,"" says his friend Peter Hutchins, a Democratic media consultant. ""It was a moment in life that doesn't come along often. Joe just felt that to the core."" THE BAD COP

One thing Lockhart understands is the media's rush to embrace conventional wisdom. That proved useful in the spring of 1997, when his first White House assignment was to help get Alexis Herman confirmed as labor secretary. Herman was being buffeted by an array of financial allegations. Lockhart knew he had to move quickly when the New York Times reported that ""some White House officials are increasingly pessimistic that Alexis Herman can be confirmed."" He called the Associated Press, ABC, The Washington Post and others to knock down the story. He had Erskine Bowles call the Times. He told Bowles that Herman needed a show of presidential support. The next morning, when Clinton was talking to reporters about Medicaid, he said: ""Let me just make one other comment here. . . . There has still not been a hearing scheduled for Alexis Herman. I think that is a big mistake."" Once Herman was confirmed, Lockhart became a deputy press secretary. ""He took a lot of heat off McCurry,"" says Lorraine Voles, former communications director for Vice President Gore. ""He was quickly sized up by people as a go-to guy."" Gore apparently agreed, for he later tried to lure Lockhart to be his chief spokesman. Instead, Lockhart became Clinton's chief scandal flack after the Lewinsky saga erupted, chiding reporters for what he described as shoddy stories or demanding that they investigate leaks by Starr's office. ""There's a good-cop/bad-cop thing going on between us,"" McCurry says. ""I can always be Mr. Nice Guy and he can be a little sharper."" On the morning of Sunday, Feb. 22, Lockhart and Voles were heading for a long-delayed outing. Their families met at church, then went to Chevy Chase Pavilion for breakfast. Lockhart arrived late, and then his beeper went off. He walked to a pay phone, came back and excused himself. ""We saw him for a total of eight minutes,"" Voles says. It turned out that Joe diGenova, the former U.S. attorney, had charged on ""Meet the Press"" that he and his wife, former prosecutor Victoria Toensing, were being investigated by private detectives with ties to the Clinton camp. After checking with White House lawyers, Lockhart put out a statement denying that anyone connected with the president ""has hired or authorized any private investigator to look into the background of Mr. diGenova [or] Ms. Toensing."" But the statement soon became, well, inoperative. It turned out that Clinton's lawyers had retained the services of private eye Terry Lenzner. The White House had to issue another statement saying it was free to gather ""public information"" but was not probing the ""personal lives"" of diGenova and Toensing. ""Everyone assumes the lawyers screwed me and hung me out to dry,"" Lockhart says. ""That's not really the case."" Instead, he says, he didn't ask enough questions. ""I do not believe I intentionally misled reporters that Sunday, but I take responsibility for the fact they were misled."" For all Lockhart's savvy about the media, he is sharply critical of journalists determined to turn over every last scandalous rock. ""This is where I'll have a problem with reporters,"" he says. ""Reporters think all information is good, everyone should know everything. I don't believe that."" Each night at 6:30, Lockhart joins other top strategists in White House chief counsel Charles Ruff's second-floor office to watch the network news. ""He's the only person around who knows how electronic journalism makes their sausage,"" Sosnik says. ""He'll watch how one network breaks a story on their morning show and talk about their psychology and how they're vested in that story and will play it up on the evening news, while the other networks won't want to make it a big deal."" The long hours have taken their toll at his Chevy Chase, D.C., home; Logan recently quit her ABC job so one of them could devote more attention to Clare, now 4. ""We just kind of looked at each other and said, 'This is ridiculous,' "" she says. As Clinton battles to salvage his presidency, Joe Lockhart will increasingly become the public face of a damaged administration, risking his own credibility in the process. During last week's trip to Russia and Ireland, Lockhart spoke briefly with the boss about his Lewinsky lie -- ""more nonverbal than verbal,"" he says -- and pronounced himself satisfied. ""I personally don't judge people by one factor in their life,"" Lockhart says. ""I judge people by the total of their character. I've known the president for two years now, and I'm still proud to work for him. Maybe I know more about him than the average person who reads the newspaper."" Although he regularly plays hearts with Clinton aboard Air Force One, Lockhart does not delude himself that he is the president's pal. ""I wouldn't describe the relationship as close,"" he says. ""I'm the hired help.""

Tapping on a computer in a wrinkled blue shirt, Todd has just finished updating a blog post on Arlen Specter when he asks a producer to find some videotape for his new program, ""The Daily Rundown.""

""Watching Eikenberry yesterday was like a hostage tape,"" he says, referring to a strained performance by the U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, Karl Eikenberry, when Todd and other reporters questioned him at the White House. ""Can we get the Eikenberry tape in here? I know it's late, sorry.""

Peering over the shoulder of his co-host, Savannah Guthrie, he bats around phrases for the opening script on Afghan President Hamid Karzai's visit to Washington. Moments later Guthrie, wearing a ruffled white blouse and thigh-high boots, raises her BlackBerry in triumph.

""I have the CIA soup of the day -- bacon corn chowder! Yes!"" Guthrie exclaims as if she has unearthed a state secret.

Covering the White House these days is no longer a matter of hanging around the briefing room and taking the occasional road trip. It is an all-consuming assignment in which reporters are expected to be multimedia performers, covering everything from soup -- the White House soup-du-jour feature on ""Rundown"" has been oddly popular -- to the nuts and bolts of foreign policy.

Todd, 38, is NBC's chief White House correspondent, the network's political director, an MSNBC anchor, a blogger on its ""First Read"" tip sheet and a prolific voice on Twitter. He and Guthrie, also 38, share the beat. When President Obama nominated Elena Kagan to the Supreme Court, Guthrie did the ""Today"" show while Todd appeared on ""Morning Joe""; they take turns sticking around for the evening news.

TV News's Restraint By Howard Kurtz

Washington Post Staff Writer

Saturday, September 12, 1998; Page E01 CBS reporter Sharyl Attkisson began to read a passage about Monica Lewinsky's navy blue dress when Dan Rather interrupted her. ""This is daytime television, and there are children in the audience,"" Rather cautioned. Attkisson retreated to euphemisms, saying the stains on the dress ""were in essence the president's bodily fluids."" CNN's Candy Crowley was far more explicit as she read from independent counsel Kenneth Starr's report on a computer screen. After warning viewers who are ""the least bit squeamish"" to tune out, Crowley began: ""According to Ms. Lewinsky, the president touched her breasts and genitalia."" The words could be seen on the screen. It was Watergate meets ""Lolita,"" a roller-coaster day of media melodrama in which journalists openly struggled both to absorb Starr's 453-page report and to describe its sexually explicit details. A channel-surfing viewer could watch tag teams of correspondents reading haltingly from sheaves of paper they had just been handed or scrolling up a computer version, mouse in hand. The marathon coverage underscored the immediacy of television but also its limitations in conveying anything more than the highlights of great reams of information. Seven out of 10 people polled overnight by USA Today said they did not want to know the sexual details of Clinton's relationship with Lewinsky. By yesterday, anyone in a home with electricity had little choice. For eight months, journalists had reported every leaked tidbit they could glean about the sex-and-lies probe. Now they were finally getting their hands on Starr's findings, a cornucopia of the incredibly lurid and the gravely serious, and were forced to reduce it to sound bites and lead sentences under minute-by-minute pressure. But the president's team grabbed some precious air time first. At 12:34 p.m., the White House spin machine disgorged a 78-page rebuttal to a report that no one in the White House had yet seen. Suddenly, NBC's David Bloom and CBS's Bob Schieffer and CNN's Wolf Blitzer were on camera, document in hand, describing the administration's preemptive strike. ""The president gave narrow answers to ambiguous questions,"" Bloom read, referring to Clinton's denial of a ""sexual affair"" with Lewinsky when he testified in the Paula Jones lawsuit. Clinton understood the definition of an affair ""to be a relationship involving sexual intercourse,"" Blitzer reported. He said White House lawyers were accusing Starr of trying ""to embarrass the president and titillate the public."" ""And they go on to ask, 'Where is Whitewater?'‚"" said Fox News Channel's Brian Wilson, referring to the report's failure to deal with the first four years of the Starr investigation, which generated so much media attention back in the pre-Lewinsky era. Punctuating the salacious reports, hour after hour, was footage of Clinton's emotional, soft-voiced admission to religious leaders yesterday morning that ""I have sinned,"" and his apology to Lewinsky and her family. Even before the Starr report on Clinton and Lewinsky was made public, Fox's Brit Hume said it would reveal that one encounter involved a cigar and that Lewinsky performed oral sex on Clinton ""while he was on the phone with members of Congress."" Fox anchor Rick Folbaum said all this made him ""blush."" Moments later, CNN's John King, citing a ""congressional source,"" said the report ""describes phone sex between the president and Monica Lewinsky."" ""How sordid does this get?"" asked CNN anchor Jeanne Meserve. At 1:54 p.m., all the major networks switched to Mike McCurry's daily press briefing, where this remarkable exchange took place: Bill Plante, CBS: ""Are you saying he's not seeking any kind of psychological counseling?"" McCurry: ""He is seeking pastoral support."" Just after 2 p.m., ABC's Linda Douglass appeared with Rep. James Rogan (R-Calif.), who had the first 38 pages of the report everyone was chasing after. ""What's in it so far, Congressman?"" Peter Jennings asked. ""This was just handed to me moments ago,"" said Rogan, adding that he'd barely reviewed the table of contents. Minutes later, Fox's Carl Cameron was reading from the report's 11 charges of impeachable offenses. And CBS's Schieffer was skimming and summarizing: ""More legal jargon here. I think I can skip through some of this. I'm just going through this as I get it, Dan."" ""Take a deep breath,"" Rather replied. NBC's Gwen Ifill said the report contained ""detail that makes you frown and wrinkle your nose in disgust."" ""Incredibly sordid . . . it made me feel sick,"" attorney Jonathan Turley told NBC's Tom Brokaw, who stayed on the air after the other broadcast networks had bailed out. If CNN was the most sexually explicit among the networks, CBS seemed the most reticent. Schieffer later paraphrased part of Lewinsky's testimony: ""He lifted my sweater and so forth, and they had sex of a kind."" At another point Schieffer said: ""I'm not going into the details."" Shortly before 5, the networks went live to a news conference by David Kendall, Clinton's lawyer, and White House counsel Charles Ruff. The atmosphere was so taut that NBC's Bloom and ABC's Sam Donaldson kept trying to talk over each other in their aggressive questioning. ""Essentially what you're saying is the president can mislead anyone he wants to as long as he literally doesn't lie,"" Bloom said. ""That's not what we're saying at all,"" Kendall replied. John Harris of The Washington Post, noting that Clinton had originally testified that he didn't remember being alone with Lewinsky, asked: ""How can that have been a truthful answer?"" ""It's all worked out in our rebuttal,"" Kendall said. The minute the session ended, pundits and anchors weighed in with harsh assessments. ""How can this president ever walk in front of another audience without their first thought bubble being of the mental image of the acts described in this report today?"" asked MSNBC anchor Brian Williams. ""He will always be stigmatized and stained by this sorry, sorry episode,"" replied Newsweek's Jonathan Alter. ""The American people watching this, and people around the world watching this, are not fools,"" declared CNN's Bernard Shaw, referring to the White House argument that Clinton misled the country but did not commit perjury. ""One of the key questions is  I hate to be tacky about this . . . whether oral sex is really sex,"" said Fox's Tony Snow. He added that some of the report ""is not fit for broadcast, candidly,"" but Fox and all the other networks took care of that by relentlessly plugging their Web sites. A particularly surreal moment unfolded at 6:13 p.m., when a beaming Hillary Rodham Clinton  the woman whose husband's infidelities had just been documented before the nation  addressed an Irish delegation as if it were just an ordinary day. By the time the 6:30 network newscasts carried the days' events to a broader audience, the anchors and reporters had had plenty of practice. ""Mr. Clinton's presidency may hang in the balance,"" Jennings said. NBC's Lisa Myers said that even after Clinton began a sexual relationship with the White House intern, ""the president still called her Kiddo. She wasn't sure he even knew her name."" CBS's Scott Pelley showed Clinton's finger-wagging denial of sexual relations with ""that woman"" before noting that Starr was accusing the president of ""lying again."" Constant promos added to the sense of drama: ""Can President Clinton survive? A two-hour 'Dateline' special."" If there was a smidgen of doubt as to how the Lewinsky scandal has shattered the old media boundaries, it was erased early in the morning on ""Leeza."" The National Enquirer's Mike Walker intoned that Clinton and Lewinsky ""played sex games that were bizarre in the extreme."" As the day wore on, the fare on the networks wasn't much different. © Copyright 1998 The Washington Post Company

Wednesday, March 9, 2005; Page C07

Jason Leopold got a journalistic black eye three years ago when Salon retracted a story the freelancer had written about a Bush administration official, saying it could not authenticate the piece.

Now the former Los Angeles Times and Dow Jones reporter has written a book, ""Off the Record,"" that criticizes journalists as lazy. Oh, and by the way, Leopold says he engaged in ""lying, cheating and backstabbing,"" is a former cocaine addict, served time for grand larceny, repeatedly tried to kill himself and has battled mental illness his whole life.

But the book's publisher, Rowman & Littlefield, has canceled ""Off the Record"" days before it was to go to press, despite having sent out news releases and listed the book on Amazon.com. The publisher acted after receiving a warning letter from one subject's lawyer.

""I'm devastated,"" Leopold said yesterday. ""I worked really hard these past two years to restore my credibility after the Salon fiasco. . . . I have a checkered past, and I was hoping that by coming clean about my own past, it would allow me to move forward.""

According to a lengthy press release on the book's publication from Rowman & Littlefield, a small publisher based in Lanham, Leopold says Steven Maviglio, a former spokesman for then-California Gov. Gray Davis, ""confided in me that he might have broken the law by investing in energy companies using inside information.""

Maviglio, who now works for the California legislature, says that Leopold ""just got it completely wrong"" and that he never ""confided"" in Leopold. He says his lawyer sent the publisher a letter demanding that the material Maviglio deems defamatory be removed.

Jon Sisk, publisher of Rowman & Littlefield, says only that the book has been dropped for ""business reasons.""

Maviglio says he bought Enron stock in 1996 and stock in a California energy firm in 2001 -- which he quickly sold -- and that federal and state regulators found no wrongdoing on his part. The ""Off the Record"" press release says Leopold leaked the information about the stock purchases to Davis's Republican critics, who leaked it to two California papers, creating a flap for the Democratic governor's press secretary at the height of the state's energy crisis.

""I wasn't worried about breaking the law,"" Maviglio says. ""I was worried about the perception."" He says that Sacramento reporters considered Leopold a ""laughingstock"" and that when he called to complain about the forthcoming book, Leopold said: ""I could use the publicity if you want to make something of it.""

Leopold is blaming the publisher. In recent e-mails to associates, he said he never wrote the offending language about Maviglio in his book. Instead, Leopold says, the company's publicist took that and other material from his book proposal, not the finished manuscript.

""If news of this controversy leaks out to the media, it will virtually destroy my writing career, both as a journalist and author, in my opinion,"" Leopold wrote in a Feb. 28 e-mail. ""I am already a lightning rod and the media will quickly eat this up and brand me as an untrustworthy writer."" The publisher, he added, should ""take full responsibility for this fiasco"" since the book had been ""vetted"" by lawyers.

The Salon debacle in 2002 involved a purported e-mail from then-Army secretary Thomas White, a former Enron executive, which White said he had no recollection of writing. Leopold reported that White, while at Enron, had written: ""Close a bigger deal. Hide the loss before the 1Q."" The online magazine initially said Leopold had plagiarized part of the story, then retracted it altogether.

Leopold told The Washington Post at the time that Salon was being ""wimpy,"" but a Salon executive said the source cited by Leopold as providing the e-mail insisted he had never spoken with Leopold. (In the book's press release, the author gloats that journalists, including this reporter, ""never bothered to check out my past"" while covering his mistakes.)

The press release says Leopold used his own criminal past to ingratiate himself with Enron executives, which is how he landed the first interview with former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling after the energy giant declared bankruptcy.

The release fleshes out a troubled career. Leopold says his grand larceny conviction in 1996 was for stealing compact discs from his employer, a New York music company, and reselling them to record stores. He says he was fired by the Los Angeles Times ""for threatening to rip a reporter's head off."" Leopold says he quit Dow Jones Newswires in a dispute over his beat but later learned the news service was planning to fire him because of a correction to one of his Enron stories: ""Seems I got all of the facts wrong.""",0,http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A18624-2005Mar8.html?noredirect=on
141,Kurtz,Howard,lifezette,"Some journalists are already touting Michael Cohen as the next John Dean, casting his upcoming congressional testimony as nothing short of historic.

But they are probably jacking up expectations too high.

While President Donald Trump’s former personal lawyer turning on him before a House committee will be a television spectacle, Cohen’s allies say he will testify under great constraints.

The larger story, they say, is how this man who tied himself so closely to Trump has been utterly devastated — and is, in a sense, seeking redemption.

Cohen is flat broke. His wife and family are under enormous emotional strain. He is getting surgery a week before his testimony for a bone spur in his shoulder that has left him unable to lift his arm.

The family is living in a hotel room with insurance payments following a flood at their home.

And a month after his February 7 Hill appearance, Cohen reports to prison for three years.

In short, these sources say, Cohen will offer compelling testimony, but those who expect him to be able to fire a silver bullet that would bring down the president are going to be sorely disappointed. Cohen may have important new information that he has disclosed to Robert Mueller in 70 hours of interviews with prosecutors, but if so, he won’t be able to reveal it.

The major limitation, as Cohen has said, is that he can’t discuss anything still under investigation by the special counsel. That means Cohen, who is still hoping for a reduction in his sentence, can’t answer questions about Russian collusion or the proposed real estate project in Moscow.

It also means he can’t address the 2016 Trump Tower meeting between Paul Manafort, Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner and a Russian lawyer (who was recently indicted on money-laundering charges).

“I expect Michael’s testimony will be personal, not partisan, and compelling,” Lanny Davis, again acting as Cohen’s attorney, told me. “He will describe what he did for Mr. Trump for 10 years that he now looks back on, as stated in court, with shame and regret. And he will explain what caused him, on July 2, 2018, to turn and put his family and country first, recognizing the dangers to the country in Mr. Trump’s misconduct and reckless behavior.”

In the interview, Davis implied a further reason for Cohen’s desire to testify.

Given the fraud and lying charges in the two Cohen guilty pleas, Davis said he “and many others believe the length of incarceration time, compared to others who committed far worse offenses, is disproportionately excessive and unjust. I hope someone in the Justice Department focuses on the word ‘justice’ when assessing the fairness of Michael’s three-year prison term. What they need to ask themselves is, would he have received this time if he had been someone who didn’t work for Donald Trump?”

The contours of the testimony are likely to frustrate Republican members of the oversight committee, now chaired by Democrat Elijah Cummings.

Some may ask why Cohen is there if he is unable to answer questions on such vital topics.

What’s more, they will point out that Cohen is an acknowledged liar and ask why he should still be viewed as credible.

The New York lawyer wants to explain why he went to work for Trump, why he is ashamed of having worked for Trump, and how he made the decision last July to turn on his longtime benefactor, who has called him a “weak person” and a “rat.”

Part of that explanation will focus on Cohen’s view that while certain behavior might be tolerable in a private businessman, the standards are very different when that person becomes president.

Cohen will offer personal anecdotes about his service to Trump and what he has termed his complicity in “dirty deeds,” the sources say. These would likely be unflattering blasts from the past but could have little to do with his record as president.

The one area in which Cohen may shed some light, since it’s part of the public record, is on the hush-money payments to former porn star Stormy Daniels and ex-Playboy model Karen McDougal.

Cohen has already said he was doing Trump’s bidding in both cases — the lawyer paid Daniels $130,000 and was reimbursed by the boss — but could fill in key details under questioning.

Dean, who was Richard Nixon’s White House counsel, broke open the Watergate coverup with his Senate testimony and wound up spending four months in jail.

But he knew that conspiracy from the inside because he was a willing participant before turning against Nixon.

Cohen, having never gotten the White House job he wanted, is not in a similar position, no matter how much media hype surrounds his testimony.

But like John Dean, he appears to view the appearance as a final chance to vindicate his reputation before heading off to prison.

“My heart goes out to Michael and his family,” Davis told me. “They are under great duress and strain.”

143,Kurtz,Howard,washingtonpost,"It was the sort of feel-good story that local television loves.

A Marine lieutenant calls his hometown station, saying he is coming home early from a combat tour of Iraq and Afghanistan and wants to surprise his wife -- with the cameras rolling.

But because Lt. Denver Edick's wife is a cheerleader for the Washington Redskins, the easy score turned into a turf battle in which ABC, the network that pitched the idea, wound up barred from FedEx Field, while the team handed the ball to the NBC station in town, which happens to be its broadcast partner.

And the Redskins formed a defensive line against any other coverage. A news executive involved in the discussions says a Redskins official told him that if Kristin Edick talked to anyone from WJLA, the ABC affiliate, she would be dismissed from her cheerleader's job.

""To threaten to fire his wife -- that is objectionable on so many levels that I couldn't even count them,"" said Bill Lord, station manager at WJLA (Channel 7). ""When we go to the PR department at any company and ask to do a story, the last thing you expect is that they'll take the story and give it to a competitor. That is just flat wrong. I'm always going to think that's unethical. It was hijacked.""

The team denies that the director of its cheerleading squad spoke of firing Kristin Edick. In a letter to Lord on Tuesday, Redskins owner Daniel Snyder offered a ""personal apology"" for the exclusion of WJLA.

""I do regret actions taken by our representatives that prevented your news organization from being able to report on the surprise early return of Lt. Denver Edick and his reunion with his wife Kristin, one of our cheerleaders,"" Snyder wrote. He said he is ""making many changes in personnel and policy"" that he hopes will ensure ""that the Redskins are respectful and fair to the journalists that are covering our team."" (Karl Swanson, senior vice president for public relations, resigned Monday but his departure had been in the works before this controversy.)

Lord said he welcomed Snyder's letter and wants to ""rebuild the relationship,"" but ""I also think he ought to apologize to the lieutenant and his wife"" for the pressure applied on them.

David Donovan, the Redskins' chief operating officer, said Edick initially contacted the team, which learned later about WJLA's involvement and alerted WRC (Channel 4), the NBC station in Washington. ""There have been times when our broadcast partners are afforded exclusive opportunities, but this should not have been one of them. . . . Apparently, this was an over-exuberant attempt to support one of our partners,"" Donovan said in an e-mail.

Edick, in full-dress uniform, surprised his wife Thursday evening at FedEx Field, where the cheerleaders were conveniently practicing. ""My legs turned to Jell-O,"" Kristin Edick told WRC after jumping up to embrace her husband. WRC aired the story that night, and the Redskins' official blog featured the video as well, saying: ""Not really much to add to this one besides Awwwwww.""

Edick said from Quantico, where he is now based, that he was pleased by the story but troubled by the dispute that developed. ""I hope none of this will get me or my wife in trouble,"" he said. ""The Redskins were absolutely awesome in everything they did.""

WRC spokesman Matt Glassman said in a statement: ""We went to FedEx Field to cover a story. We did not request that it be exclusive and have no knowledge why another station was denied access."" He declined to comment further.",0,http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/04/AR2010050403588.html
144,Kurtz,Howard,lifezette,"Exclusive: President Donald Trump has canceled the White House holiday party for the media, making the decades-old tradition a victim of his increasingly contentious relationship with major news organizations.

The annual Christmas-season gathering was a significant perk for those covering the White House, as well as other Washington reporters, anchors and commentators, and New York media executives would regularly fly in for the occasion. At its peak, the invitation-only soirees grew so large that there were two back-to-back events, one for broadcast outlets and one for print organizations.

Journalists who attended the events, which featured a catered buffet of lamb chops, crab claws and elaborate desserts, got to roam the decorated mansion with a spouse or other family member, a friend or a colleague, adding to the invitation’s allure.

But the biggest fringe benefit was the picture-taking sessions, in which the president and first lady would patiently pose with guests and briefly chat with them in front of a Christmas tree, with the White House sending out the photos — copies of which were invariably sent home to mom. This would take a couple of hours, with long lines snaking across the building’s first floor.

Bill Clinton even posed for pictures with journalists days after he was impeached.

The White House made no announcement that it was dropping the press party. The president and first lady threw such a gathering last December but did not pose for pictures. Trump made a brief appearance with his wife and offered a few welcoming remarks.

Top White House officials, especially the communications staff, routinely circulated at these media parties and often talked shop. Last year, chief of staff John Kelly held forth with reporters for at least 15 minutes, making informal remarks that turned into a mini-press conference.

The decision is hardly shocking, given Trump’s constant attacks on “fake news” and the overwhelmingly negative coverage of him and his administration. In recent weeks, the White House pulled the credentials of CNN’s Jim Acosta after he refused to give up the microphone at a news conference and restored his pass only after the network filed a lawsuit.

Trump has also twice refused to attend the White House Correspondents Dinner, a tony media awards dinner attended by every president since Richard Nixon.

While dropping the media party, the White House is in the midst of a full panoply of other parties this holiday season. Selected media people generally favorable to Trump, including a few Fox News hosts, have made those guest lists.

Some critics questioned whether those who cover or comment on the White House should engage in such socializing, but few turned down the invitations.

When Democrats have been in the White House, more liberal commentators have gotten invitations, while more conservative pundits have shown up during Republican administrations.

Some critics questioned whether those who cover or comment on the White House should engage in such socializing, but few turned down the invitations.

Many Trump supporters who view his coverage as unfairly harsh will undoubtedly welcome the president’s decision to exclude the media establishment, at least for this year.

And it’s clear he’s been stewing about the Mueller investigation, which just dropped its sentencing memo on Mike Flynn and [did] the same [on Friday] with Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort. “Without the phony Russia Witch Hunt, and with all that we have accomplished in the last almost two years (Tax & Regulation Cuts, Judge’s [sic], Military, Vets, etc.) my approval rating would be at 75% rather than the 50% just reported by Rasmussen.

First, Rasmussen tends to report higher numbers for Republicans; Reuters had Trump at 41 percent approval.

Second, there’s no question that the probe, and the constant media coverage of all the indictments, convictions and guilty pleas, has hurt Trump. But would he be 25 points higher in this deeply divided country?

Which brings me to the Democrats’ latest media darling, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

Trump’s third year will undoubtedly be defined by his battles with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. And his fourth year will definitely be defined by his campaign against one of the seemingly dozens of Dems trying to win the White House.

But the woman who, at the age of 29, knocked off a veteran congressman to win a seat representing Queens and the Bronx seems to be getting as much attention as her far more experienced colleagues.

Hats off to the dogged young candidate who pulled off this feat.

But she has really been struggling with the facts.

Ocasio-Cortez recently tweeted, “$21 TRILLION of Pentagon financial transactions ‘could not be traced, documented, or explained.’ $21T in Pentagon accounting errors. Medicare for All costs ~$32T. That means 66% of Medicare for All could have been funded already by the Pentagon. And that’s before our premiums.”

This was, I’ll simply say in the holiday spirit, spectacularly wrong.

She was off by, well, $21 trillion.

The Washington Post fact-checker gave her four Pinocchios.

The congresswoman-elect mangled a study cited in a Nation piece that was actually about Pentagon funds, between 1998 and 2015, that lacked adequate documentation.

In fact, the Defense Department hasn’t received $21 trillion in appropriations over all of American history.

Ocasio-Cortez did not apologize.

But The Federalist says her “mind-numbingly stupid” tweet shouldn’t mask her appeal. Writer Jesse Kelly says the politico class made “the exact same arguments” against Trump.

“It is critical for folks on the Right to avoid the mistakes made by the Left. We must learn from how they treated (and treat) President Trump and endeavor not to make the same mistakes.”

“Do not underestimate this woman, and do not think your savage mockery of her stupidity will be an effective tool to stop her. It won’t. It will instead be personalized by her supporters, creating an army that will lay down and die for her (or at least vote for her), just like the army Trump has. You should be afraid of Ocasio-Cortez. Be much more afraid than you are.”

I don’t know that Republicans need to be very afraid, but the piece is on to something.

The Federalist’s Emily Jashinsky made the same point last month after Ocasio-Cortez spoke of “all three chambers of Congress”: “Denigrating unpolished, less-than-flawless politicians who speak to the working class is not a great look.”

Of course it matters that Ocasio-Cortez is a democratic socialist (and a bit math-challenged). But she does seem to have a common touch — not surprisingly, since her last job was as a bartender and she worries about earning a living before her House salary kicks in.

When she showed up in Congress dressed professionally and pundit Eddie Scarry snarked “that jacket and coat don’t look like a girl who struggles,” he got buried under an avalanche of hostile tweets.

Ocasio-Cortez asked whether he thinks “he can delete his misogyny without an apology? I don’t think so. You’re a journalist — readers should know your bias.”

If you look at her Instagram, she’s seen hugging and high-fiving people and posing for selfies. She tweets photos of herself making mac and cheese.

As The Federalist says, “She’s pretty. She’s young enough to understand and take advantage of this current political world. Most importantly, her naiveté about the things of government make her more appealing to the common man, not less.”

The media are treating Ocasio-Cortez like a superstar. An Atlantic piece was headlined “How Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Plans to Wield Her Power.”

Power? She’s at the bottom of the seniority ladder. But the media spotlight gives her a different kind of power.

None of this changes her gaffes, her inexperience and her tenuous grasp of how government works.

The Hill ran this piece: “Ocasio-Cortez on Why Young People Need to Run for Congress.”

She’s taken on Amazon and made news the other day for saying she’d actually pay her interns.

None of this changes her gaffes, her inexperience and her tenuous grasp of how government works.

But as with Trump, the more her critics overreach, the more they build her up — maybe even to 75 percent approval.

146,Kurtz,Howard,lifezette,"Alan Dershowitz had an interesting take on the Ivanka email flap when he appeared on Fox News recently.

“It’s hypocrisy on parade,” the liberal lawyer said of Ivanka Trump’s team for defending her use of a private email address for some government-related correspondence after her dad had trashed Hillary Clinton on that issue.

But the Hillary supporter, who has regularly defended President Trump during the Mueller investigation, also said that everyone uses private email and that Ivanka’s practice was “a non-issue.”

Before diving into the similarities and differences in practice between the former first lady and the presidential daughter, let’s acknowledge the game here. Each side pounces on blunders by the other team and tries to blow them up into massive scandals, just as each side minimizes questionable conduct by its partisans as innocent mistakes.

As for the media, MSNBC and CNN seemed like they were running the Ivanka story every few minutes or so, while Mediaite noted that it was only a brief item on “Fox & Friends.”

“Why Does This Administration Think The Rules Don’t Apply to Them?” blared an MSNBC headline.

According to The Post, Ivanka “sent hundreds of emails last year to White House aides, Cabinet officials and her assistants using a personal account, many of them in violation of federal records rules.”

She began the practice in the early months of 2017 before she had joined the White House as a senior adviser.

But Ivanka Trump “used her personal account to discuss government policies and official business fewer than 100 times — often replying to other administration officials who contacted her through her private email.”

She used an address she shared with her husband Jared Kushner, who got dinged some time ago for his own private use of the email account for government business.

A statement from her attorney’s firm says that “while transitioning into government, after she was given an official account but until the White House provided her the same guidance they had given others who started before she did, Ms. Trump sometimes used her personal account, almost always for logistics and scheduling concerning her family.”

The statement noted some key differences with Hillary Clinton.

“Ms. Trump did not create a private server in her house or office, no classified information was ever included, the account was never transferred at Trump Organization, and no emails were ever deleted.”

So there’s a huge difference in scope.

Clinton created a private server for the express purpose of shielding her correspondence when she was secretary of state, used it for four full years, and famously deleted 33,000 emails she said were personal. An FBI investigation found that despite her denials, 110 emails did contain classified information (though some was classified after the fact).

MORE NEWS: Democrats Support Maxine Waters Even After She Incited Violence During Protest

The president, at a media availability, called the story — yes, “fake news.”

His daughter’s emails, he said, “weren’t classified like Hillary Clinton. They weren’t deleted like Hillary Clinton, who deleted 33,000. She wasn’t doing anything to hide her emails. I looked at it just very briefly today and the presidential records — they’re all in presidential records. There was no hiding.”

Clinton created a private server for the express purpose of shielding her correspondence when she was secretary of state, used it for four full years, and famously deleted 33,000 emails she said were personal. An FBI investigation found that despite her denials, 110 emails did contain classified information (though some was classified after the fact).

Many Democrats, and Hillary herself, believe the press wildly overplayed her email scandal. But keep in mind that she tried to dismiss it as irrelevant after The New York Times broke the story, it took her weeks to make a full-throated apology and she made claims (such as the one about classified info) that turned out to be untrue.

Also, she was running for president.

And yet, with some people at Trump rallies still chanting “lock her up,” this remains a sensitive issue.

That’s why, understandably, there’s widespread press skepticism of Ivanka’s explanation, as reported by The Post, that “she was not familiar with some details of the rules, according to people with knowledge of her reaction.”

But it’s just as true that those who felt Hillary got hosed by Jim Comey over her email mess are using the Ivanka revelation, in the time-honored tradition of politics, as payback.

Some House Democrats, you’ll be shocked to hear, are already planning an investigation.

147,Kurtz,Howard,washingtonpost,"The political finger-pointing over the Oklahoma City tragedy began even before all the victims had been buried.

It was 15 years ago, but I remember it vividly: The shock and horror over what was then the worst act of domestic terrorism in American history. The depressing reality that the suspects were American citizens. And the blame game that quickly followed.

I wrote this lead for a front-page Washington Post story:

""President Clinton yesterday denounced the 'loud and angry voices' that inflame the public debate and called on the American people to speak out against 'the purveyors of hatred and division.'

""Addressing last week's bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City, Clinton said the nation's airwaves are too often used 'to keep some people as paranoid as possible and the rest of us all torn up and upset with each other. They spread hate, they leave the impression that, by their very words, that violence is acceptable. . . . It is time we all stood up and spoke against that kind of reckless speech and behavior,' he said in Minneapolis.""

Rush Limbaugh, who everyone knew was a target of Clinton's broadside, accused liberals of trying to foment a ""national hysteria"" against the conservative movement: ""Make no mistake about it: Liberals intend to use this tragedy for their own political gain."" He blamed ""many in the mainstream media"" for ""irresponsible attempts to categorize and demonize those who had nothing to do with this.""

Now they're at it again.

The 42nd president is out there saying that the current climate reminds him of the period before the Oklahoma bombing. Limbaugh is accusing him (and Barack Obama) of libeling radio talk-show hosts. And the debate has broadened to include Sarah Palin and her ""reload"" rhetoric, as well as the Tea Party.

My feelings about this now are as mixed as they were in 1995. Inflammatory rhetoric can be dangerous. There is no shortage of nuts out there. And yet if we tar with too broad a brush, we unfairly taint those who stridently criticize the administration in power as being somehow responsible for violence. Why did that pilot, ticked off at the Internal Revenue Service, fly his plane into the IRS building in Austin? Is it fair to blame an incident like that on cable or radio talk shows?

There is no question that the Murrah Building bombing helped revive Clinton's political fortunes. He was down in the polls after the GOP takeover of Congress. The day before, he was reduced to proclaiming that the president was still ""relevant."" Clinton's skillful handling of that moment of national grief sparked the beginning of a turnaround. I don't believe he attacked those who ""spread hate"" just to score political points, but the benefits of going after right-wing talkers can't have escaped the White House.

Such assignation of blame has long been embedded in our political culture. Richard Nixon won on a law-and-order platform after the left's anti-Vietnam excesses in 1968. Shortly after the 1992 L.A. riots, George H.W. Bush blamed the failure of Great Society programs and Democrats blamed the GOP's inattention to urban problems.

Now Clinton has taken to the New York Times op-ed page to offer a lesson:",0,http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/20/AR2010042001456.html
148,Kurtz,Howard,washingtonpost,"Is Twitter no longer an ultra-hip refuge for the perpetually plugged-in?

Now that Time's cover has certified it as part of mass culture, the quirky little Web site can hardly be dismissed as a mere oddity. And the masses who have jumped from MySpace to Facebook to Twitter might at any moment decamp for some hot new hangout.

But the site is less important than the way its users are changing the media culture. They are exchanging more than just 140-character bursts of blather about their daily lives: They are guiding their friends and followers to the latest news, information, gossip, snark and a pulsating, real-time debate. Old-style news outlets would kill for that sense of belonging.

When I mentioned on my Twitter page that I would be talking on the air about Conan O'Brien taking over ""The Tonight Show,"" I got a flood of messages. Some called him a genius, others think he's a goofball. What I quickly learned is that O'Brien is a polarizing figure in the late-night world, loved and loathed with equal fervor.

The speed is often blinding as people tap updates from their phones. ""If you're looking for interesting articles or sites devoted to Kobe Bryant, you search Google,"" Time's Steven Johnson wrote. ""If you're looking for interesting comments from your extended social network about the three-pointer Kobe just made 30 seconds ago, you go to Twitter.""

Twitter's 17 million monthly visitors -- up from just over 1 million a year ago -- are shaping their environment, such as making discussions easily searchable by including the hashtag or pound (#) symbol. They create an echo-chamber effect by ""re-tweeting"" -- that is, repeating -- noteworthy observations or links. But as with Facebook, whose redesigned news feed now resembles Twitter, the ultimate appeal is forging connections. USA Today last week lamented the sheer banality of most status updates, but even these provide a sense of someone's routine, interests and sense of humor.

The guilty pleasure of peeking into another person's life is heightened when said person is prominent, whether it's a network anchor, a politician or the likes of Shaq, Oprah or Ashton Kutcher. Oh look, Chris Cuomo's daughter is sick. Hey, Bonnie Fuller got drenched while lugging bags around Central Park and her hair got mega-frizzy.

Not everyone buys the notion that this is a step forward for mankind. ""For celebrities, Twitter is a gigantic ego stroke,"" writes CBS Sports columnist Gregg Doyel. ""It's a game of narcissist strip poker, and you're the thong.""

Sure, the boldfaced names may provide carefully calibrated glimpses, but some actively engage with their fan base.

I became friendly with Mariel Hemingway when the actress began following me on Twitter. When I began checking out her page, I was struck by how often she shared the details of her life, from her hiking to her bedtime. Without any handlers or publicists, we agreed to meet for a CNN interview when I was in Los Angeles.

""I'm a very private person,"" Hemingway told me. ""But I find it wonderfully comforting to know that there's just people out there to connect with that -- yes, they don't know me, but . . . I think you feel a closeness with people, and it's a great way to kind of get what your message is out there."" In her case, that includes promoting her new cookbook.

The instant feedback is also having an impact on reporting. I asked my Twitter followers last week what they valued about the site, and was deluged with responses that would have taken days of calling to collect:",0,http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/15/AR2009061500963.html
149,Kurtz,Howard,washingtonpost,"On July 21, 2004, two pro-Israel lobbyists called Washington Post reporter Glenn Kessler to pass on information that they said was from ""an American intelligence source"" -- a source they declined to identify.

The two men assured Kessler that the mystery source was ""100 percent credible"" and had information about an Iranian plot to kill Americans and Israelis in Iraq.

What none of them knew was that federal investigators were wiretapping the call, or that it would figure in an indictment against the lobbyists, Steven J. Rosen and Keith Weissman, on charges of mishandling classified information -- even though no documents changed hands. In a city where secrets of varying import are whispered every day, the case has sparked a debate about whether prosecutors are attempting to criminalize conversations with journalists.

While the pending trial of the two former staffers for the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) has been overshadowed by the CIA leak investigation, media advocates fear it could have an equally negative impact on the flow of information.

""Journalists who cover national security and defense receive classified information all the time,"" said Lucy Dalglish, executive director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. ""It's virtually routine. If that were the standard for bringing an espionage case, we'd be locking up a lot of people in this town and there would be fewer sources of information.""

Abbe Lowell, Rosen's attorney, called the indictment ""devastating"" for journalists who try ""to make sure they're finding out what's really going on as opposed to what's said from the podium."" Lowell added: ""I'm absolutely amazed at the lack of media outrage.""

The case raises some of the same First Amendment issues as the Valerie Plame leak inquiry, and not just because of the involvement of Kessler, who testified under a waiver of confidentiality that former vice presidential aide I. Lewis ""Scooter"" Libby had not discussed the CIA operative with him. In both investigations, conversations with reporters are being treated not just as evidence but also as part of the alleged crimes.

Under a long-standing law enforcement practice, journalists have not been prosecuted for receiving classified information, putting them in an awkward position -- and making them potential witnesses -- if criminal charges are brought against their sources. Some press advocates are worried that journalists may even lose their protected status in such matters.

So far, prosecutors have secured one guilty plea. The unnamed source cited in the call to Kessler, Pentagon analyst Lawrence A. Franklin, admitted last month that he passed government secrets to Rosen and Weissman, as well as to an Israeli diplomat in Washington. Franklin said he relayed the information because he was ""frustrated"" with U.S. policy toward Iran and hoped to influence the administration.

Franklin's attorney, Plato Cacheris, said his client ""never got a dime"" and ""did this for patriotic reasons."" A spokesman for Paul J. McNulty, the U.S. attorney in Alexandria and President Bush's nominee to be deputy attorney general, declined to comment.

What makes this conspiracy case particularly unusual -- in addition to the fact that it involves a strong U.S. ally, Israel -- is that Rosen and Weissman are private citizens with no direct access to government secrets. They served as middlemen who passed what they could glean from Franklin to reporters, their bosses, officials and others.

""We are going to challenge the case vigorously, both factually and legally . . . and are confident that Keith Weissman will be vindicated,"" said John N. Nassikas, Weissman's attorney.",0,http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/11/AR2005111101649.html
150,Kurtz,Howard,washingtonpost,"The executive editor of the National Enquirer says he plans to enter his paper's work on the John Edwards scandal for a Pulitzer Prize.

Don't laugh.

""It's clear we should be a contender for this,"" Barry Levine said by phone Thursday, hours after the former presidential candidate admitted what the paper had been reporting all along: that he is the father of Rielle Hunter's baby. ""The National Enquirer, a supermarket tabloid, was able to publish this reporting.""

While the staff never doubted its reports that Edwards had fathered a daughter with his former campaign videographer, Levine said, ""there is vindication, finally. Mr. Edwards kept the story alive much longer than it needed to be kept alive with his denials. He has only himself to blame.""

While the Enquirer stories may or may not be prize-winning material -- the paper's most significant disclosures came in 2007 and 2008, and this year's Pulitzers will honor material published in 2009 -- there is no question that the tabloid scooped the rest of the media world.

When the Enquirer first reported in 2007 that Edwards had had an affair with Hunter, the former North Carolina senator dismissed the account as tabloid trash. The rest of the media, having no independent proof, steered clear of the story, even as Edwards, aided by his cancer-stricken wife Elizabeth, was mounting an aggressive campaign for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination.

In August 2008, after being knocked out of the campaign, Edwards admitted to ABC's ""Nightline"" that he had been lying about the affair. But he didn't come entirely clean. Asked about the Enquirer cover that showed him with the baby during a late-night visit to a Beverly Hills hotel, Edwards denied paternity, saying: ""Published in a supermarket tabloid. That is absolutely not true. . . . I know that it's not possible that this child could be mine because of the timing of events."" He claimed he wasn't sure if the man in the blurry photo was him.

Edwards acknowledged that Frances Quinn Hunter is in fact his child in a statement first aired Thursday by NBC's Lisa Myers. Once again, the Enquirer had been proved right.

Edwards's second admission was most likely forced by ABC's plans to air an interview next week with a former aide, Andrew Young, who originally claimed paternity in the case but is about to recant in a forthcoming book. In an excerpt released by the network, Young says Edwards told him: ""Get a doctor to fake the DNA results.""

Levine faulted the mainstream media's handling of the story, saying that even after Edwards's partial admission on ABC, news outlets ""still didn't dig into it to a great degree, the fact that he had fathered this child. The larger issue involving the love child was the cover-up.""

Some news organizations, including The Washington Post, did report that Edwards's former campaign finance chairman had steered payments to Hunter that enabled her to drop out of sight by relocating from North Carolina to a $3 million Santa Barbara home. A federal grand jury is investigating whether any campaign or personal payments made to Hunter were illegal.

While the Enquirer specializes in celebrity gossip, it has landed a series of exclusives that the rest of the press has wound up chasing. These range from its reporting on the O.J. Simpson case in the 1990s, to its 2001 disclosure that Jesse Jackson had fathered an out-of-wedlock child, to its 2003 report that Florida authorities were looking into prescription drug abuse by Rush Limbaugh.

Mainstream news organizations, unlike supermarket papers, do not pay for information. In the Edwards saga, Levine said, ""the fact that we practice checkbook journalism, and we make no bones about it, certainly helped. But we've had every aspect of reporting, from pursuing financial documents to stakeouts to cultivating sources. Along the way, there were times when some sources came out of the woodwork and, for a tip fee, would lead us in another direction and help with the story.""

He added that ""at the end of the day, it's great to see he's taking responsibility for this child, Frances Quinn. She needs to know who her father is."" That's right: a supermarket tabloid editor is now lecturing a former vice-presidential nominee on matters of morality.

153,Kurtz,Howard,washingtonpost,"Can Tom Daschle make it into the end zone with both feet inbounds?

Conservatives are on the offense after the belated disclosure that the former Senate minority leader had to repay $140,000 in back taxes for a car and driver provided by a corporate benefactor. But liberals aren't mounting much of a defense for the embattled HHS nominee, and one editor on the left has called for him to bow out.

In Daschle's favor, of course, is the clubby nature of a Senate that is going to be reluctant to reject one of its longtime members, especially after his apology yesterday.

As a lawmaker, Tom Daschle always struck me as a modest South Dakotan who was more interested in behind-the-scenes compromise than lining his pockets. I happened to see him at a Whole Foods a few weeks ago, shopping by himself, and that fit the image. Little did I know his car and driver might be waiting outside.

But after losing a reelection bid, Daschle decided to cash in, like so many Washington insiders before him. There was the at least $3 million a year from the companies that were paying him, the fat speaking fees from corporations, and the former telecommunications executive and Democratic donor, Leo Hindery, who provided the chauffeur services. But at 3 mil a year, why couldn't Daschle have paid for his own car and driver? And how much savvy does it take to figure out that such 'free' services would be considered taxable income?

Daschle wasn't technically a lobbyist, but does anyone really doubt why big law firms and companies were throwing money at him?

The media, which some expected to roll over for Obama, are not giving Daschle an easy time. His tax fiasco -- including his failure to reveal it to the Obama vetters until after the fact -- was the lead story in Sunday's Washington Post and also on the front page of the New York Times, and the Times had another front-pager yesterday detailing how a former senator in four years could ""live a lavish lifestyle by dint of his name, connections and knowledge of the town's inner workings."" Plus, the paper's editorial page says today that Daschle should pull out.

It doesn't help that Daschle's tax problem follows Tim Geithner's tax problem. And that presents the new president, who has talked up the need for an ethical administration free from special interests, with a dilemma. Obama, for his part, fielded a Daschle question yesterday with a one-word answer. Talk about staying on message.

""Congressional Democrats moved Monday to shore up Tom Daschle's nomination to become President Obama's secretary of Health and Human Services as the former senator apologized publicly for not paying more than $128,000 in income taxes,"" the L.A. Times reports.

"" 'The American people have high expectations for those of us who serve the public good. That's especially true when it comes to taxes. They pay their fair share and they expect all of us to do the same,' Daschle told reporters after meeting with the Senate Finance Committee to answer questions.""

""During almost two years on the campaign trail,"" says the NYT, ""Barack Obama vowed to slay the demons of Washington, bar lobbyists from his administration and usher in what he would later call in his Inaugural Address a 'new era of responsibility.' What he did not talk much about were the asterisks.

""The exceptions that went unmentioned now include a pair of cabinet nominees who did not pay all of their taxes. Then there is the lobbyist for a military contractor who is now slated to become the No. 2 official in the Pentagon. And there are the others brought into government from the influence industry even if not formally registered as lobbyists . . .",0,http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/03/AR2009020300682.html

155,Kurtz,Howard,washingtonpost,"He may be one of Washington's hottest young journalists, but Garrett Graff spent enough time as a campaign flack to learn the art of the politically adept reply.

Sitting in his neatly organized Washingtonian office in a sport coat and lavender tie, the preppy-looking 28-year-old is asked why the magazine he just took over doesn't run more cutting-edge reporting. He puts his finger to his lips and ponders the question, perhaps not wanting to offend his predecessor just down the hall.

""I would certainly agree that is the perception,"" Graff says. There is a need to ""freshen up"" the magazine, but ""service"" journalism -- ""Fall Weekends,"" ""Eat Cheap,"" ""Inside 10 Great Homes,"" ""26 Reasons to Love Living Here,"" to name some recent covers -- ""is what sells on the newsstands. I think the reader can tire of that if they don't make it past the cover.""

The soft-spoken Graff has eased his way up the ladder -- from presidential campaign speechwriter to media blogger, from Washingtonian freelancer to top dog -- with remarkable fluidity. And he managed to replace Jack Limpert, 75, who ran the place for four decades, without a trace of hard feelings.

""He was the brightest 23-year-old I'd ever seen in journalism when I hired him, and I think he's the brightest 28-year-old today,"" says Limpert, who has traded jobs with Graff. ""Very smart, lots of energy, and best of all, he understands the digital world in a way some of us old-timers don't.""

Catherine Merrill Williams, the publisher, says that when she took over Washingtonian, ""my biggest fear was, what if Jack was hit by a bus? Garrett is just a uniquely talented individual who is Web-savvy, print-savvy and just has journalism run through his blood.""

Williams is also part of the generational shift at the magazine long owned by her family. She took over in 2006 after her father, Philip Merrill, died of a self-inflicted shotgun wound while on a Chesapeake Bay sailing trip.

The question now is how much to tamper with the monthly's formula of safe, bland comfort food. While conceding that its most popular features are the restaurant reviews and front-of-the-book gossip items, Graff proclaims a passion for long-form journalism.

The October issue, his first as editor, features a richly detailed piece on a Washington couple charged with spying for Cuba. But the cover story is a puffy look at Fairfax's Thomas Jefferson High School. (Although it does have the unusually contrarian headline ""Why You Should Hate This School."" Answer: because it might be too good.) Washingtonian's default setting is upbeat; an August cover piece on a fire rescue in Bethesda is touted as ""The Inspiring Story.""

The monthly hasn't been immune to the recession, although Williams says it still makes money. Paid circulation is 137,000; Graff intends to focus equally on the Web site, which caters to younger readers and is drawing 340,000 unique monthly visitors. Five journalists have been cut from an editorial staff of 35 this year.

A relative newcomer to the Beltway, Graff grew up in the tiny Vermont capital of Montpelier. His dad ran the Associated Press's Vermont bureau; his mother was a children's book author and later editor of Vermont Life magazine; his father's stepfather had been drama critic for New York's Herald Tribune. At 14, Graff became a summer press aide for the state's Democratic governor, Howard Dean, staying on to write press releases after school and building Dean's first Web site in 1997.

Graff went to Harvard (there were also Washington internships at ABC and the Atlantic), where he devoted four years to the student paper. He and some colleagues at the Crimson scored the scoop that the university had tapped Larry Summers as its next president; the head of the search committee refused to confirm it, dismissively telling the Boston Globe the next day, ""Kids can get it wrong sometimes.""",0,http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/25/AR2009102502392.html

Going Weak in the Knees for Clinton By Howard Kurtz

Washington Post Staff Writer

Monday, July 6, 1998; Page C01 A former White House correspondent says she was ""quite willing to let myself be ravished"" by President Clinton after she felt he had admired her legs on Air Force One. Nina Burleigh, who covered the White House for Time, makes the confession in a Mirabella magazine essay on Clinton's attractiveness to women. It is a candid discussion of her feelings while playing hearts with the president and aide Bruce Lindsey in the plane's front cabin last year. ""The president's foot lightly, and presumably accidentally, brushed mine once under the table,"" Burleigh writes. ""His hand touched my wrist while he was dealing the cards. When I got up and shook his hand at the end of the game, his eyes wandered over to my bike-wrecked, naked legs. And slowly it dawned on me as I walked away: He found me attractive."" She adds: ""I probably wore the mesmerized look I have seen again and again in women after they have met him. The same silly hypnotized gleam was displayed on the cover of Time magazine in Monica Lewinsky's eyes."" In an interview, Burleigh, now a New York freelancer, said she in no way felt harassed or pressured by the president but that it was ""not unusual for women"" to swoon over him. What is unusual, for a journalist, is Burleigh's sexually charged declaration of support for Clinton. ""I'd be happy to give him [oral sex] just to thank him for keeping abortion legal,"" she said. But Burleigh says she was not ""going easy on him"" as a White House correspondent in 1993 and 1994, when she sometimes wrote about the Whitewater scandal, and never thought about his looks at the time. By last year she was a Time contract writer, filling in on the trip to Jasper, Ark. ""No doubt the president's lawyers and spin doctors would say I wishfully imagined that long, appreciative look,"" she writes. ""But we all know when we're being ogled. . . . I felt incandescent. It was riveting to know that the president had appreciated my legs, scarred as they were. If he had asked me to continue the game of hearts back in his room at the Jasper Holiday Inn, I would have been happy to go there and see what happened.""

Promise Kept — Jerusalem Embassy Opens for Business

by Nate Jackson: The U.S. embassy in Jerusalem officially opened today, coinciding with the 70th anniversary of the creation of the modern state of Israel and one day after “Jerusalem Day,” the 51st anniversary of Israel annexing east Jerusalem, which is home to holy sites for Jews, Christians and Muslims. President Donald Trump followed through on a promise first made by the U.S. in 1995. President after president signed waivers citing security concerns over moving the embassy from Tel Aviv, succumbing to fear that the Palestinians would respond with violence, thus undermining an already fictitious “peace” process.",0,http://teapartyorg.ning.com/profiles/blogs/tuesday-noon-thefrontpagecover-781

By Howard Kurtz

Washington Post Staff Writer

Saturday, February 13, 1999; Page C1 Sam Donaldson, who returned to his White House post just days before the Monica Lewinsky story broke, says he is relieved that President Clinton's impeachment trial is finally over. ""I won't miss it,"" he said. ""To let go of it is a joy."" But the ABC correspondent, who famously predicted that Clinton would be toast within days if the allegations against him were true, is still puzzled by the tepid reaction of most Americans. ""I really thought, if you commit felonies in the Oval Office, you have to go. Well, wrong! Not true."" His colleague in the cramped ABC booth, Ann Compton, says the Clinton saga has not played itself out. ""It will never be over,"" she said. ""My prediction is that it ends on Jan. 20, 2001, at 12:01 p.m."" As the Senate began voting to acquit Clinton yesterday, the network correspondents stood on the gravel stretch along the White House driveway, amid the tangle of lights and cables, waiting for their cues. A stiff wind blew down Donaldson's blue-and-white umbrella. The reporters expressed skepticism at the message conveyed moments earlier by Clinton spokesman Barry Toiv, who said the president was in the residence but not watching the televised proceedings. CNN's Wolf Blitzer sat in a director's chair, marking off the defecting Republicans on a legal pad. Minutes after the twin verdicts, the networks cut to the North Lawn, to a babble of voices describing the moment and Clinton's upcoming Rose Garden comments. ""You can expect some level of contrition and largely a look at where we go from here, Dan,"" said CBS's Scott Pelley. ""A chance for the White House, they hope, to turn a corner in this episode,"" said NBC's David Bloom. ""He delayed this matter by eight months by continuing to lie about it,"" said Fox's Jim Angle. ""Bill Clinton would be the first to say there are no winners,"" Donaldson said, adding: ""The press is sullied. No Woodward and Bernstein, no heroes here."" From behind the wrought-iron gates, a bystander shouted: ""Shame on the media!"" The Lewinsky scandal has consumed the fourth estate for nearly 13 months and has transformed the landscape in the process. Most Washington journalists can't quite remember what they did beforehand. Indeed, cable networks, news executives and ordinary reporters are busy making plans for the post-Monica era. Nowhere has the impact been greater than in the claustrophobic White House pressroom, the place where every rumor is tracked, every official pronouncement challenged, every hour a potential deadline. ""Look, it's been an ordeal, especially for the country, but also for us,"" said Bloom, who misses spending time with his 4-year-old twins. ""Everyone wants to get back to their life."" Still, he said, ""as a journalist you relish these moments, not relishing what the country's going through but the opportunity to be there at a historic time."" While Clinton called for ""reconciliation and renewal"" yesterday, there was grumbling in the CBS booth about his continued inaccessibility. There was no photo op this week with German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, no press session planned when Clinton visits Mexico on Monday, no full-scale news conference expected until March. ""There are so many questions this president hasn't answered,"" said CBS correspondent Mark Knoller. ""They're still sensitive about protecting him from our questions."" The pressroom atmosphere lacked the tension of previous scandal developments, since this was a huge and historic event in which the outcome had been known for weeks. The only debate around town was whether it was over, sort of over or just another chapter ending. ""I'm not convinced this all goes away, even though everyone's sick of it,"" said Bill Kristol, editor of the Weekly Standard, which has crusaded for the president's ouster. ""I may be wrong, but I think the Clinton controversy has cut deep, and I don't think it goes away after the vote."" Newsweek's Howard Fineman sees the action continuing into the next millennium. ""The whole Clinton story is going to turn into the Alger Hiss case,"" he said ominously. ""Partisans will be arguing over the years who was really guilty, did Ken Starr overstep his bounds, who among the Republicans screwed up getting Clinton."" The party may be over for the cable networks, which have covered the case with O.J. Simpson-like intensity. But at MSNBC, widely known as the all-Monica channel, Vice President Erik Sorenson was shedding no tears. ""I'm ecstatic,"" he said. ""My biggest fear is that the end isn't the end. Please, for MSNBC's sake, let's talk about something else. ABC led with a sex study the other night. Okay, let's talk about dissatisfaction with sex. ""Because we're so focused on being the network that covers the big story, we got tagged early on with the Clinton-obsession label, and in late summer we were joined by everyone else. Everyone's been completely obsessed with it in all the media."" In recent months, though, ratings for the NBC-Microsoft venture began to slip. ""When it was a whodunit last spring, it was a very good MSNBC story,"" Sorenson said. ""When it became a bipartisan, inside-the-Beltway political battle, it wasn't a good MSNBC story. It didn't play to our strengths. That's not what our brand is all about. ""As the general public got less and less interested in it, we were trapped by the process of impeachment. We had to cover it, and nothing else could break through and get much attention. The whole I-hate-Clinton/I-love-Clinton debate is really tiresome."" Frank Sesno, CNN's Washington bureau chief, has the opposite view of the Lewinsky trajectory. ""The story was most uncomfortable, most salacious in its early days,"" he said. ""It's ending on a high note, by making history. It went from being about the blue dress to being about the parchment of the Constitution."" Sesno also sees plenty of permutations in what he calls ""the post-impeachment story,"" but added: ""We'll have the air time to get back to some of the things we should be doing, whether it's the new economy or Y2K or Kosovo. The most important thing is to do good journalism. I'm of the belief that they'll watch. If the ratings adjust a little bit, so be it. That's life."" Brit Hume, Washington managing editor of Fox News, sounds resigned to a ratings dip. ""This story has been good to Fox News Channel in general,"" he said. ""This was a story that generated a lot of energy. I do a Washington show, and this was a Washington story of a most fascinating sort. It will leave a void of some kind. ""But we've tried hard on my broadcast and other broadcasts not to make it all Monica all the time,"" Hume said. This week, for example, his panelists discussed the death of King Hussein and whether Hillary Rodham Clinton might run for a Senate seat from New York. Donaldson, for his part, worries about the media's reputation. ""We come out tarnished, and the public hates us,"" he said. What will the gang chat about now on ABC's ""This Week""? Kristol offered this menu: ""Republicans are in total disarray; conservatives can't decide whether or not they're deeply distrustful of the American people; liberals are uncomfortable defending Clinton; feminism's contradictions have been exposed; the independent counsel law may not be renewed."" Gloria Borger, a U.S. News & World Report columnist, says the Lewinsky saga has changed her view of the news business. She didn't even know who Matt Drudge was before the scandal broke. ""I think we're going to start covering the issues again. Social Security looks pretty interesting,"" she said, laughing. ""It's been a long year. [Rep.] John Kasich is going to New Hampshire next week, and I've signed up for the press plane. Psychologically, I'm moving on."" When White House press secretary Joe Lockhart took the podium yesterday, it was clear not that everyone was moving on. CBS's Pelley asked whether Clinton felt the impeachment proceedings had been legitimate. Donaldson asked whether Clinton felt unfairly targeted by the investigation. Pelley asked how Clinton could convince Congress that he is trustworthy. Donaldson asked if the president was still in legal jeopardy from Starr. Donaldson also demanded to know why there would be no news conference before March. ""Don't get too greedy, Sam,"" Lockhart replied.

Farewell to the Mike McCurry show By Howard Kurtz

WASHINGTON (October 1) -- Mike McCurry gave his last daily briefing Thursday, winding up his four-year tour as presidential press secretary. But the affable McCurry leaves behind a lingering mystery: How can a man who denies, obfuscates and beats up on reporters be so popular with the White House press corps? He could be funny. ""Mr. Knoller of CBS News ... had a close encounter with a rat, here in the press briefing room. I know the feeling,"" McCurry once quipped. He could be combative. ""I'm not playing this game today,"" McCurry snapped. He could be evasive. ""Claire, I'm just not going to parse the statement for you,"" McCurry dismissed. He could be all three at once. ""My next move is to get off this podium as quick as possible,"" McCurry said, provoking laughter from a press core determined to get answers and information but sympathetic to the position of a sympathetic man. Mike McCurry gives his last press

briefing as White House Press

Secretary And he was an in-your-face critic of sloppy journalism. ""You know, I know, you're all going to have to run out and yak and yak and yak forever about this, but it's going to be based on very few facts,"" McCurry lectured. But still he remains one of the most popular White House press secretaries in recent history. ""Reporters perceived Mike McCurry as a good and a decent person, first of all, and that counts for a lot. He has never, at least that we know of, lied to us, that counts for a lot,"" explained NBC's John Palmer. McCurry has been the public face of the White House spin machine, the first spokesman to allow his daily briefings to be televised. He's bobbed and weaved his way through plenty of scandals. But when the Monica Lewinsky story broke, McCurry proudly proclaimed himself to be ""out of the loop."" He couldn't respond to questions about President Clinton and the intern -- in fact, he didn't want to know the answers. That's in part because McCurry once worked for former New Jersey Sen. Harrison Williams, who wound up being convicted in an FBI sting called Abscam. McCurry had to testify before the grand jury. He did not want to make the same mistake with Clinton. After succeeding Dee Dee Myers at the famous podium, McCurry tried to be an ambassador between a president, who disdained the press, and reporters, who didn't much trust the president. But his best efforts were overwhelmed by the Lewinsky scandal, leaving McCurry in the uncomfortable posture of President Richard Nixon's spokesman Ron Ziegler during the stonewalling of Watergate. By the time the country learned that Clinton had been lying for seven months, McCurry had already announced his departure, turning over the job to his deputy, Joe Lockhart. A final review for the Mike McCurry show? He was, of course, an unwitting participant in the Monica Lewinsky coverup, but he was far more helpful to reporters in private conversations, when the cameras were turned off. And he livened up an otherwise dreary pressroom. In one of the moments for which he will be long remembered, McCurry showed up in the White House briefing room with a large brown-paper bag over his head, proclaiming,""I'm briefing today as an anonymous source.""",0,http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1998/10/01/mccurry/

CBS News anchor Dan Rather apologized yesterday for a ""mistake in judgment"" in relying on apparently bogus documents for a ""60 Minutes"" report charging that President Bush received favorable treatment in the National Guard, ending a nearly two-week-long defense of the network's journalistic conduct that media analysts say has badly hurt its credibility.

CBS also acknowledged for the first time that its source was retired Texas National Guard official Bill Burkett, who Rather said in an interview had ""misled"" and ""lied to"" the network in describing how he obtained the purported 30-year-old memos said to have been signed by Bush's late squadron commander.

Dan Rather's Apology

A statement from Dan Rather of CBS News: Last week, amid increasing questions about the authenticity of documents used in support of a 60 MINUTES WEDNESDAY story about President Bush's time in the Texas Air National Guard, CBS News vowed to re-examine the documents in question -- and their source -- vigorously. And we promised that we would let the American public know what this examination turned up, whatever the outcome. Now, after extensive additional interviews, I no longer have the confidence in these documents that would allow us to continue vouching for them journalistically. I find we have been misled on the key question of how our source for the documents came into possession of these papers. That, combined with some of the questions that have been raised in public and in the press, leads me to a point where -- if I knew then what I know now -- I would not have gone ahead with the story as it was aired, and I certainly would not have used the documents in question. But we did use the documents. We made a mistake in judgment, and for that I am sorry. It was an error that was made, however, in good faith and in the spirit of trying to carry on a CBS News tradition of investigative reporting without fear or favoritism. Please know that nothing is more important to us than people's trust in our ability and our commitment to report fairly and truthfully. _____Document Controversy_____

""I deeply regret I wasn't as good on this story as I should have been,"" Rather said. Asked whether he felt tarnished, he replied: ""I have confidence that those people who don't have a specific partisan political or ideological agenda will understand what happened, how it happened, and I think they have confidence in CBS's credibility and my own. I do have a lifetime of reporting.""

Burkett told CBS in an interview aired last night that he ""threw out a name"" of a bogus source because Rather's producer, Mary Mapes, had ""pressured me to a point to reveal that source."" Burkett said he had ""insisted"" that the memos ""be authenticated"" by CBS.

Mapes also put Burkett in touch with a senior official in John F. Kerry's presidential campaign after telling him that Burkett had been ""helpful"" on what was then CBS's upcoming story about Bush and the National Guard. The Kerry campaign confirmed her unusual go-between role but said Burkett provided no information about Bush.

What remains unclear is who provided the documents to Burkett and whether the memos were forged in a calculated effort to discredit Bush in the final weeks of his reelection effort. Rather said Burkett previously told CBS that the source was a former Guardsman who was out of the country and could not be reached by the network, and that the new source Burkett named is ""one we cannot verify."" CBS is still not saying that the memos are forgeries, only that the network cannot confirm they are authentic.

CBS News President Andrew Heyward acknowledged that ""60 Minutes"" had rushed the story to air on Sept. 8 -- five days after Mapes obtained the memos -- despite warnings from some of its document analysts that the memos may not have been produced on a 1970s government typewriter. ""In retrospect, we shouldn't have used the documents, and we clearly should have spent more time and more effort to authenticate them,"" Heyward said.

CBS staff members, many of whom felt the apology was overdue, were relieved to discover that Burkett had admitted lying to the network, if only to spread the blame.

As Rather conceded, ""The question is, why didn't you do it sooner? The story is true. I believed in the story. . . . What kind of reporter would I be -- what kind of person would I be -- if I put something on the air that I believed and then didn't stand behind it? At the first sign of pressure, you run, you cave, you fold? I don't do that.""

At the same time, he said, ""The fact that copies of the documents could be true was not enough. We needed to be able to prove they were authentic.""

""Obviously,"" Rather added, ""I would like to get the original documents if they still exist.""

Heyward declined to say whether Rather or anyone else would be disciplined, or whether his news division would change its procedures, saying he wants to see the recommendations of outside investigators he plans to appoint.

Burkett once sued the Guard over medical benefits and previously contended that he had overheard Guard officials talking about sanitizing Bush's medical records -- a contention Texas Guard officials strongly dispute.",0,http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A35531-2004Sep20.html
163,Kurtz,Howard,washingtonpost,"Ken Silverstein says he lied, deceived and fabricated to get the story.

But it was worth it, he insists. Those on the receiving end don't agree.

As Washington editor of Harper's magazine, Silverstein posed as Kenneth Case, a London-based executive with the fictional Maldon Group, claiming to represent the government of Turkmenistan. He had fake business cards printed, bought a London cellphone number and created a bogus Web site -- all to persuade Beltway lobbying firms to pitch him on representing Turkmenistan.

""For me to deny, or try to shade the fact that I tricked them would be stupid,"" Silverstein says. ""Obviously we did. If our readers feel uncomfortable, they're free to dismiss the findings of the story.""

Says Harper's Editor Roger Hodge: ""The big question in our mind was whether anybody was going to fall for it.""

They did. According to Harper's, executives at the Washington firm APCO Worldwide laid out a communications plan that included lobbying policymakers -- possibly including a trip for members of Congress -- and generating ""news items."" Senior Vice President Barry Schumacher told Silverstein the firm could drum up positive op-ed pieces by utilizing certain think tank experts. The proposed fee: $40,000 a month.

There was no discussion of anything illegal. On human rights issues, Schumacher said there were bound to be ""isolated incidents that look bad, and it's up to the communications company to figure out a way to be honest about them, to react and put them in the proper perspective."" He told Silverstein that ""we live up to the spirit and letter of the law"" in registering as foreign agents, but would provide ""minimal information.""

APCO has written a letter of complaint to Harper's, and company spokesman B. Jay Cooper says Silverstein's approach was ""pretty amateurish."" The firm had not yet decided to represent Turkmenistan, and it was Silverstein who was ""being unethical,"" he says. But Silverstein says APCO pursued him hard and expressed disappointment at being turned down.

Another Washington firm, Cassidy & Associates, asked for at least $1.2 million a year and touted a proposed trip to Turkmenistan for journalists and think tank analysts. ""We are surprised that a reporter would go to such extraordinary lengths to gather information in such a deceptive way that really isn't all that new or interesting,"" the company says in a statement.

""What bothers me most,"" says APCO's Cooper about the story in the July issue, ""was there was never a moment where he unveiled himself and asked us to comment on anything we did wrong, because we didn't do anything wrong. They never called us to say, 'You got punked.' ""

Says Silverstein, noting the magazine's long lead time: ""These guys are professional spinners, and I didn't feel like giving them six weeks to lie their way out of the story."" He says his piece exposed how lobbying firms try to manipulate public opinion.

""If you want to weigh my ethics in making up a firm against the ethics of agreeing to represent and whitewash the record of a Stalinist dictatorship, I'm pretty comfortable with that comparison.""",0,http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/24/AR2007062401677.html

Sources, investigators, commentators: Lawyers Joseph diGenova and Victoria Toensing have become hot properties in the media since the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke. (By Michael Williamson  The Washington Post) The Power Couple at Scandal's Vortex By Howard Kurtz

Washington Post Staff Writer

Friday, February 27, 1998; Page D1

Geraldo Rivera served up the softball pitch: ""Joe, in the 30 seconds until the commercial break, are you another victim of the White House slander machine?"" Joe diGenova didn't discourage the notion that the Clintonites were targeting him for his televised criticism. He declared that he and his wife, Victoria Toensing, are ""going to continue to appear on your show as long as you will have us."" A decade after he was the city's top federal prosecutor in a high-stakes pursuit of D.C. Mayor Marion Barry, diGenova has become a white-hot media presence, politically connected lawyer and all-around agent provocateur. He and Toensing, also a battle-tested former prosecutor, keep popping up wherever there is trouble -- as commentators, as investigators, as unnamed sources for reporters. A classic Washington power couple, diGenova, 53, and Toensing, 56, occupy a strange, symbiotic nexus between the media and the law that boosts their stock in both worlds. They are clearly players, which gives them access to juicy information, which gets them on television, which generates legal business. ""Dozens of Washington lawyers are trying to get on these shows,"" diGenova says. ""I think it's very healthy. We can destroy myths and shoot down misunderstandings."" Toensing sees televised debate as a good way of sharpening the old legal skills. ""It's something that gets the body juices going,"" she says. The two law partners not only talk about the Monica Lewinsky investigation -- they've been quoted or on the tube more than 300 times in the month since the story broke -- but have been drawn into the vortex. Toensing was approached by an intermediary for a Secret Service agent who had supposedly seen something untoward involving President Clinton and the former intern. DiGenova was at the heart of a quickly retracted Dallas Morning News account of that matter. What's more, diGenova took to the airwaves Sunday to charge -- based on nothing more than one reporter's inquiry -- that private investigators ""with links to the White House"" were digging up ""dirt"" on him and his wife. Never exactly press-shy when he was U.S. attorney, diGenova is a trifle sensitive to the notion that he is a partisan publicity hound. Ensconced in a burgundy armchair in the living room of his ranch-style home in Bethesda's Kenwood section, he glances stealthily at a blue card -- the kind TV people use to jot down their sound bites -- before delivering his point. ""I have never made a single telephone call to get on a television show, and neither has Victoria,"" he says. ""We've never had an agent. . . . I've never been paid a dime for any of it."" The couple (pronounced de-GEN-uva and TUN-sing) are so firmly entrenched in the media culture that he is a member of the Gridiron Club and she once had Rivera accompany them to the club's annual dinner. ""I love him and I love his wife,"" the talk host and fellow lawyer says. ""They're the most honorable people inside the Beltway. . . . He's a strong, principled guy who doesn't back down. If I played any part in making him a media star, I gloat with pleasure."" A Wide Net Name a high-profile investigation in this city and chances are the prosecutorial pair is involved. Charges that Republican Rep. Dan Burton improperly demanded campaign contributions from a lobbyist for Pakistan? DiGenova and Toensing are the Indiana congressman's personal attorneys. Newt Gingrich's ethics problems? Toensing represents the speaker's wife, Marianne, to ensure her compliance with House ethics rules. A House committee investigation of the Teamsters and the union's links to improper Democratic fund-raising? DiGenova and Toensing are leading the probe as outside counsel. (And don't shortchange Toensing's role. When the newspaper Roll Call ran an unflattering piece about conflict-of-interest charges related to the couple's hiring, Toensing denounced the reporter as a sexist for leaving her out of the first few paragraphs. ""I'm just as big as he is!"" she shouted at an editor. Toensing says now that ""they pretended I didn't quite exist. They attributed my client to Joe. I've had to deal with this all my life as a woman."") The couple's Teamsters probe for the House Committee on Education and the Workforce has made them a lightning rod for Democratic criticism. First there was grumbling that their official role would conflict with their work for other clients, such as the American Hospital Association, for whom they are registered lobbyists. Then the Democrats charged that diGenova and Toensing couldn't be doing much on their $300,000-a-year contract -- which requires each lawyer to put in 80 hours a month -- since they spent so much time in television studios trashing President Clinton in the Lewinsky case. Their television advocacy is hardly a state secret. As former prosecutors, both diGenova and Toensing have largely defended the aggressive tactics of independent counsel Kenneth Starr and repeatedly challenged the president's veracity. ""They've become a public spectacle, which means they can't be impartial"" in the Teamsters probe, says Missouri Rep. William Clay, the committee's ranking Democrat. ""It's a payoff from Newt Gingrich and the Republican Party to both Victoria Toensing and Joe diGenova. . . . They have been on television over 200 times and not once have they been talking about an issue we're paying them $25,000 a month to handle for the Congress. It's a hell of a part-time job."" The committee's minority staff has even issued an official tally of comments and appearances by the attorneys since late January (34 in the Associated Press, 19 on CNBC's ""Rivera Live,"" 15 in The Washington Post, 11 in the New York Post, 2 in the Montreal Gazette). DiGenova and Toensing laugh off the attacks, saying it's hardly shocking that Republican committees hire Republican lawyers, or that former prosecutors appear on television. ""A smear tactic,"" says diGenova. They insist they have documented their work but can't turn in their time sheets because, says Toensing, ""they reveal witnesses that have to be protected."" Perhaps no recent incident has drawn as much interest and speculation as diGenova's role as an anonymous source for the Dallas Morning News. The melodrama began when Toensing was approached by an intermediary for a Secret Service agent who was said to be willing to testify that he saw Clinton and Lewinsky in a compromising situation. DiGenova passed this on to Morning News reporter David Jackson (""Joe and I exchanged a few words over that,"" Toensing says), and the paper published the story in its Internet edition, attributing the account to an unnamed lawyer ""familiar with the negotiations."" But by then the intermediary had told Toensing the agent was backing off. Hours later, the Morning News retracted the report, saying the ""longtime Washington lawyer"" had said the information was ""inaccurate."" The couple now say that Toensing, taking a call from Jackson hours before deadline, told the reporter: ""If Joe is your source, it's wrong."" ""The bottom line is, they were told not to print and they chose to print,"" diGenova says. ""I don't know how much more helpful you can be to a newspaper than to tell them not to print."" Carl Leubsdorf, the paper's Washington bureau chief, says: ""The reporter's recollection of that conversation is quite different. He was told that 'if Joe told you that, he shouldn't have.' If it had been the other way, the story of course would have been reassessed at that point."" The couple seem to have been at the periphery of the Monica Lewinsky case from the start. A go-between initially approached Toensing about representing Linda Tripp, the former Pentagon staffer who secretly taped Lewinsky. Toensing declined because the couple already had one high-profile case in the Teamsters probe. But the Tripp feeler, too, became a point of contention. When Toensing appeared on Charles Grodin's CNBC talk show, Richard Ben-Veniste, a Democratic lawyer and former Watergate prosecutor, asked when she first learned about Tripp and her tapes. Toensing said she was not at liberty to divulge that. After the program, she told Ben-Veniste of the feeler from Tripp. The next day, Toensing got several calls from reporters about her on-air remarks after they had been tipped to the possible controversy. She saw a Democratic plot. ""I decided to go on offense, I was so mad,"" she says. On NBC's ""Today"" the next morning, Toensing assailed what she called ""the anatomy of a lie. . . . That's how it works here, folks. It ain't pretty. . . . They put out just enough of a kernel of truth and then spin it, because what they want to do is make it look like all Republicans got together to go after the president."" Says Ben-Veniste: ""I'm not a Democratic spin-meister. I didn't even know she was going to be on the show. I feel put upon here. The only reason I turned to her is that she had interrupted me twice."" But that little dust-up paled compared with diGenova's performance Sunday on ""Meet the Press."" ""Last week,"" diGenova declared, wielding a blue card, ""I got a telephone call from a correspondent for a national weekly telling me that word had gotten around town that I and my wife, Victoria Toensing, were being investigated by a private investigator with links to the White House and the attorneys representing the president, and that investigator was either someone named Mr. Palladino or, perhaps, even from -- I've read in Time magazine -- Mr. Terry Lenzner. . . . Who is paying Mr. Palladino or Mr. Lenzner, and who is getting the dirt that they are digging up? Is the White House getting this stuff, are their lawyers?"" DiGenova later acknowledged he had no confirmation of any private-eye activity before making the charge on national television. White House spokesman Mike McCurry called diGenova's remarks ""outrageous."" Martin Garbus, a First Amendment lawyer, criticized diGenova in his favorite forum, ""Rivera Live."" ""I just thought it was irresponsible,"" Garbus says in an interview. ""He's far too sophisticated a lawyer for that. I thought there must be some other motive involved, like self-promotion."" Friends have a different take. ""Joe's understandably indignant reaction was driven by concern about his wife,"" says Charles Leeper, a former prosecutor who worked for diGenova. ""He does have thick skin. If this was just about gathering information on him, he would have laughed about it. But when you're told someone is trying to silence you by gathering information about your spouse, you react differently."" Of course even paranoids have enemies. The White House flatly denied that diGenova and Toensing were the subject of any inquiry. But two days later, Clinton lawyers David Kendall and Robert Bennett acknowledged that they had retained Lenzner's investigative firm. In a carefully worded statement, they said: ""There is public information available, which, of course, it is our duty as counsel to research and gather; but we have not investigated, and are not investigating, the personal lives of Ms. Toensing [or] Mr. diGenova."" Does that mean there is a shadowy probe of the couple -- that, as Rivera put it, they might be on some Clintonian ""enemies list""? ""All I know is what we've been told by reporters,"" Toensing says. But she questions the nature of the ""public information"" the private eyes are gathering: ""I got divorced. Are they going back into my divorce records?"" Says diGenova: ""I'm not worried. All they'll find is that I like to cook, my wife and I are madly in love with each other and we both smoke cigars."" Private Lives They launched their small law firm two years ago and seem to be reveling in their rapid success. One of Toensing's three children from her first marriage, Brady, is a senior associate. The couple retreat on weekends to their Fenwick Island, Del., beach house, hanging with such pals as Robert Novak and Bill Regardie. In town, diGenova likes to plant himself at his massive Wolf commercial stove, open a bottle of wine and cook veal chops in one of the cast-iron pans hanging from the ceiling. Is there a downside to being married to your law partner? Toensing says she tends to carry on about their cases during evenings and weekends. ""He had to teach me to shut up,"" she says. Both pride themselves on being moderate Republicans who occasionally contribute to Democratic candidates. They met at a rally for the Equal Rights Amendment at the 1980 Republican National Convention; he bought all the elephant pins she was selling. DiGenova, a trained opera singer, proposed on the second date. Toensing, who raised three kids on her own after law school, said yes. DiGenova was a top aide to then-Sen. Charles Mathias of Maryland. He helped his bride get a job with Senate intelligence committee investigator Fred Thompson. Soon the couple were rising stars in the Reagan administration: He was tapped as U.S. attorney, she became a deputy assistant attorney general. They worked on terrorism cases together. DiGenova loved the limelight, and while there was some grumbling that he was grabbing credit for cases developed by his assistants, he racked up an impressive record. Digging into city corruption, diGenova's office won convictions of 11 D.C. officials, including two deputy mayors. But his biggest case by far was his four-year drug investigation of Marion Barry. It's no surprise to hear diGenova defend Ken Starr against White House allegations of illegal leaks, for diGenova was accused of the same thing. Barry, claiming he was being ""lynched,"" sued diGenova and the Justice Department on charges of disclosing secret grand jury information; the suit was dismissed for lack of evidence. DiGenova stepped down in 1988 to enter private practice; his successor, Jay Stephens, prosecuted Barry. ""I was eventually vindicated when the mayor was caught at the Vista Hotel and convicted of drug use,"" diGenova says. Toensing, meanwhile, was no shrinking violet either. She posed for the cover of the New York Times Magazine for a story recounting her pursuit of a Palestinian terrorist: ""Today, because of Victoria Toensing, Mohammed Rashid sits in Athens's Korydallos Prison awaiting trial."" The two moved on to a couple of Washington law firms. DiGenova served as an independent counsel, finding no wrongdoing by Bush administration officials accused of pilfering Bill Clinton's passport files. When the O.J. Simpson case made telegenic lawyers a hot commodity, Toensing became a fixture on Rivera's show and others, and her husband followed suit. DiGenova says they make most of their appearances at night, ferried by chauffeured cars. Even returning reporters' calls doesn't detract from their practice. ""You've got to be out of your mind not to be helpful to people in the press,"" he says. Besides, the talk circuit pays tangible dividends. ""You do get business from it,"" diGenova says. ""In addition, your existing clients like it. They like seeing their lawyers commenting intelligently on TV. We get calls: Saw you on 'This Week,' 'Face the Nation,' thought you did a great job."" Toensing is less sanguine about the calls generated by her appearances: ""You get more kooks than you get reasonable people."" Others will ""call my office and ask who does my hair."" These days, on any channel, they can usually be counted on to defend Starr. Indeed, producers want them for their prosecutorial point of view. ""White-collar criminal investigations are not beanbag,"" diGenova says. ""It does get rough."" And this is a couple who know how to punch back. DiGenova says they don't mind a few scars. ""This is a political town,"" he says. ""People are going to take shots at you. If you can't take that, you shouldn't be in the business."" © Copyright 1998 The Washington Post Company

165,Kurtz,Howard,cnn,"Story highlights Howard Kurtz: We've seen media seize on a parade of trivial statements in campaign He cites ""binders full of women,"" ""horses and bayonets"" and Big Bird Kurtz says coverage of the substance of the campaign gets overshadowed by minor things He says media chasing an audience discard serious issues and focus on crowd-pleasing themes

Editor’s Note: Howard Kurtz is the host of CNN’s Reliable Sources and Newsweek’s Washington bureau chief. He is also a contributor to the website Daily Download.

(CNN) —

The media have been giving us binders full of blather.

In a campaign that is supposedly, allegedly and ostensibly about big and serious issues, we have been wallowing in what amounts to sideshow stuff.

It’s not just the focus on Mitt Romney saying at last week’s presidential debate that in looking for appointees in Massachusetts he received “binders full of women,” an admittedly funny phrase that exploded on cable news. The trending Twitter topic after this week’s face off was President Obama’s line about Romney hearkening back to a military backed by “horses and bayonets.” Journalists after the first debate flocked to that towering issue known as Big Bird.

CNN Howard Kurtz

Are the media trivializing the campaign?

We have, through the course of this endless campaign season, bounced from one ephemeral controversy to the next, from the dog on the roof to “oops!” from Etch A Sketch to Joe Biden’s laughter.

Journalists have pounced on botched phrases deemed to be gaffes:

“I like being able to fire people;” “You didn’t build that;” “Ann Romney never worked a day in her life;” “I’m not concerned about the very poor.”

Sometimes there are legitimate questions embedded in the choice of language, as with Romney’s apparent dismissal of 47% of America, but more often it’s just a chance to turn the candidate into a piñata.

’Binders full of women’ overshadows Presidential debate

Campaigns have always had their lighter side, of course, but this year we seem to be getting more empty calories than ever. That is not to slight the dogged reporters who have in fact delved into the issues and done the arduous work of fact-checking the candidates’ ads and utterances. But let’s face it: How often has their work been on the front pages or at the top of the newscasts?

Sure, in an age of on-demand information, you can gorge yourself on the candidates’ conflicting arguments on the auto bailout or trade with China. But the media create narratives by cranking up the volume, and you have to strain to hear the issues dissected in a way you didn’t when Donald Trump was throwing around his birtherism nonsense. Yes, the substantive pieces have run on inside newspaper pages, occasionally on home pages, and popped up on television, which has a harder time coping with complexity. So much easier for all of us to trumpet the latest poll.

More dual-screen users Tweeting during debates

In their debates, the candidates have clashed on tax cuts, health care, immigration, Libya and other vital questions. You might wonder: Is Romney suddenly moderating positions he has taken for the last two years? Why, on Monday night in Boca Raton, did he keep agreeing with Obama’s foreign policy? Does the president have a real second-term agenda? Yet the post-game chatter has zeroed in on zingers, body language, interruptions and attacks on the moderators themselves.

Don’t we deserve a better campaign? And aren’t the media partially responsible? Howard Kurtz

The foreign policy debate was sober and high-minded; does anyone actually believe the media will be exploring the exchanges on Afghanistan and Syria for more than 24 hours?

Some of this sustained superficiality has to do with today’s relentless news cycle and shrinking attention spans. “You can’t talk in 140 characters on Twitter about the complexities of the budget or taxes,” veteran journalist Steve Roberts told me on Reliable Sources. Maybe so, but does that mean we just punt?

Obama, Jon Stewart and 2012’s comedy factor

The burden falls on the candidates as well. If they speak in vague sound bites and duck hard choices, it’s more difficult (but hardly impossible) for news organizations to put substantive questions front and center.

What’s more, they are increasingly ignoring the media’s attempts to call them on exaggerations and falsehoods. “We’re not going (to) let our campaign be dictated by fact-checkers,” Romney pollster Neil Newhouse said at the GOP convention. Once upon a time, campaigns felt compelled to make adjustments when their distortions were spotlighted. These days they just double the ad buy.

Have you noticed how many times the media have declared that we are about to plunge into a dead-serious debate? First the campaign was going to be about the economy. When the Supreme Court upheld Obamacare, we were assured that health care would be a dominant issue.

When Romney picked Paul Ryan, the pundits agreed that this would be a big election about Medicare and budget-cutting. Instead we wound up with endless stories about Ryan’s P90X workout.

Hey, I get it. Everyone’s chasing clicks and eyeballs. Delving into the intricacies of how Obama and Romney would fix Medicare can be eye-glazing, while writing about Michelle and Ann on “The View” is fun.

But as the clock runs out on the 2012 race, I’m left with this nagging feeling: Don’t we deserve a better campaign? And aren’t the media partially responsible?

166,Kurtz,Howard,washingtonpost,"Veteran Baltimore Sun columnist Michael Olesker, who has been in a high-profile feud with Maryland Gov. Robert Ehrlich, was dismissed yesterday over several instances in which he used, without attribution, wording similar to that employed by other journalists.

Olesker, 60, who has been a Baltimore columnist for nearly three decades, appeared to borrow language from The Washington Post, New York Times and his own Sun colleagues, although in some cases this was routine information.

Olesker said yesterday he did not intentionally engage in plagiarism. ""Whether it was deadline pressure or a momentary blur or taking what unconsciously looked like ordinary language and not putting it in my own language, I screwed up. I made mistakes. Would I do it intentionally? My God, no. That would be professional suicide, unethical and immoral. I'm sick over what happened.""

Sun Editor Timothy Franklin called it ""a terrible, awful, gut-wrenching day"" to lose a journalist ""who has been provocative, colorful and taken readers to neighborhoods where others didn't go. But this was a case in which there was a distinct pattern of a lack of attribution in his columns. There were four separate instances we know about in the last year and a half. We're not out to get someone for one individual mistake."" Olesker resigned Tuesday after Franklin told him he could quit or be fired.

Tom Rosenstiel of the Project for Excellence in Journalism said that ""this does not seem like a clear-cut case"" of plagiarism, since most of the examples involve ""background factual material rather than descriptive narrative that is in the author's voice,"" and that Olesker's language was ""not identical."" He said it is ""not uncommon practice to take background material from clippings.""

Franklin acted after the Baltimore City Paper submitted questions about the similar language. That followed a Sun correction late last month about a Dec. 12 Olesker column on former senator Max Cleland that was similar to a 2003 Washington Post piece.

The Post's Peter Carlson had written: ""On one of his first trips out of the hospital, an old girlfriend pushed him around Washington in his wheelchair. Outside the White House, the chair hit a curb and Cleland pitched forward and fell out. He remembers flopping around helplessly in the dirt and cigarette butts in the gutter.""

Olesker wrote: ""On one of his first trips out, an old girlfriend pushed his wheelchair around Washington. Near the White House, the wheelchair hit a curb. Cleland pitched forward and fell out, flopping around in dirt and cigarette butts in a gutter."" Olesker said he mixed up his own work with notes he made from Carlson's story.

In another example, David Leonhardt wrote in the Times in 2004: ""But the disparity in incomes between the rich and poor grew after having fallen in 2002. Pay did not keep pace with inflation in the South, already the nation's poorest region, in cities, or among immigrants. And the wage gap between men and women widened for the first time in four years.""

Olesker wrote several weeks later: ""The disparity in incomes widened between the rich and the poor. Pay did not keep pace with inflation in the cities, among immigrants, or in the South, already the nation's poorest region. And the wage gap between men and women widened.""

Franklin said he asked the Sun's public editor, Paul Moore, to investigate past Olesker columns, and when Moore went on vacation City Editor Howard Libit picked up the task. But Franklin said Libit hadn't found the instances uncovered by City Paper media reporter Gadi Dechter, and that the Sun will make a full accounting of any other problems dating back to 2000.

Olesker got into a major battle with Ehrlich's office after writing in 2004 that the governor's communications director was ""struggling mightily to keep a straight face"" at a hearing where he dismissed the role of politics in Ehrlich's commercials for Maryland tourism. Olesker admitted he was not present when Paul E. Schurick spoke, but said he was just writing metaphorically.

The Sun sued Ehrlich when he directed state officials not to answer questions from Olesker and another Sun reporter, and the paper is appealing a judge's decision last year that the governor's action did not violate the law.

""Clearly, he had a bull's-eye on his back,"" Franklin said of Olesker. ""He's been quite outspoken in his assessment of the administration in Maryland.""

The columnist agreed that he was ""under the microscope,"" in part because of the lawsuit, and said Sun editors ""needed to show they're not going to allow even the slightest error.""

Olesker added that he had always aspired to be a columnist: ""You can't work in a town for 40 years the way I have if you don't have integrity. . . . I hope people will remember me for a 40-year career and not what happened in the last couple of days.""

Asked if the incident had hurt the Sun's reputation, Franklin said: ""I hope readers see we did deal with it quickly.""",0,http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/04/AR2006010402179.html
167,Kurtz,Howard,news,"THE centrepiece of a New Yorker story on Karen McDougal, who says she had an affair with a newly married Donald Trump, is scribbled notes kept by the former Playboy Playmate.

These notes, obtained by journalist Ronan Farrow, are presented as her personal reflections on the relationship — “later memorialised in an eight-page, handwritten document provided to the New Yorker”.

Readers could easily get the impression, as many journalists have, that Ms McDougal wrote these notes during what she describes as a consensual relationship that began in 2006. But that is not the case, Fox News reported.

A telltale marking on the entries, reproduced by the magazine, shows that Ms McDougal wrote these pages either during or since the 2016 campaign — relying on memories that were at least a decade old.

The New Yorker does not dispute that Ms McDougal’s notes were written many years after the alleged relationship.

Instead, the magazine attempted to tie them to Ms McDougal’s eventual deal with the National Enquirer’s parent company, American Media Inc.

“The article does not present Karen McDougal’s written account as being made simultaneously with the events themselves,” a New Yorker spokesman told Fox News.

“Rather, the article makes clear that the idea to sell her story to American Media Inc. first occurred in 2016. Furthermore, her written account is supported by additional sourcing and documentation referenced in the article.”

If that was suggested by the story, as the magazine maintains, the implication was rather subtle.

The more recent creation of the notes doesn’t mean that Ms McDougal isn’t telling the truth. The magazine’s view is that the timing has no material impact on her credibility.

But the timing of the notes is revealing about how Ms McDougal came to go public, as well as about the role of the National Enquirer.

The McDougal passages were written on a notebook marketed by fashion designer Izak Zenou, whose name appears at the bottom of one of the pages.

He got into the business of creating office supplies in 2016, and the notebook was not available for sale on Amazon until March 2016.

The timing is significant.

Farrow writes that “the interactions that Ms McDougal outlines in the document share striking similarities with the stories of other women who claim to have had sexual relationships with Trump, or who have accused him of propositioning them for sex or sexually harassing them”.

But in writing the notes in 2016 or 2017, the one-time Playmate of the Year did not foreshadow, by a decade, similar accusations by other women.

The notes say such things as: “I was into his intelligence + charm. Such a polite man. We talked for a couple of hours — then, it was ‘ON’! We got naked + had sex.”

After the New Yorker story was published last week, a White House spokesman said: “This is an old story that is just more fake news. The president says he never had a relationship with McDougal.”

The New Yorker expanded on what the Wall Street Journal had reported days before Mr Trump’s election: that the Enquirer’s parent company had paid Ms McDougal $US150,000 for limited life rights to her story about any romantic or physical relationship with a married man, and never published it.

The practice, in the tabloid world, is known as “catch and kill” — buying a story for the purpose of burying it.

American Media’s CEO, David Pecker, has acknowledged his friendship with Mr Trump.

The New Yorker quotes former two former AMI executives on the record as saying that buying and killing stories was a common practice under Mr Pecker.

Ms McDougal and her lawyer met with Dylan Howard, American Media’s chief content officer, to discuss a deal.

Ms McDougal told AMI that she had been offered more than $US1 million for her story, and also that she was in discussions with ABC News.

The Enquirer maintains that it didn’t publish Ms McDougal’s allegations about Mr Trump in 2016 because it couldn’t confirm them, and that she offered no documentation, texts, receipts or corroborating witnesses.

She was even told to search her storage for old phones or other evidence.

The supermarket tabloid also says she did not offer any handwritten notes, which suggests they hadn’t been written at the time.

During the discussions Ms McDougal appeared to change her view about going public with the alleged affair, saying, “I don’t want to be viewed as the next Monica Lewinsky.”

That makes the timing of the Enquirer’s $US150,000 deal with Ms McDougal, in August 2016, all the more suspicious, especially given the paper’s pro-Trump coverage under Mr Pecker. The contract, in addition to the limited life rights, called for her to appear on two AMI magazine covers and write a fitness column, but some of those goals have not been met.

So the company paid her big bucks even after concluding she couldn’t substantiate the affair, while making sure she couldn’t tell the story elsewhere.

Ms McDougal’s contract with American Media included a nondisclosure agreement, and that may explain the vital role of the handwritten notes.

The ex-Playmate spoke on the record to Farrow, but the piece says she declined to discuss details of her relationship with Mr Trump “for fear of violating the agreement”.

That obstacle, intentionally or not, was neatly circumvented by the handwritten notes.

Farrow writes that he obtained the document from John Crawford, a friend of Ms McDougal, and “she expressed surprise” that he had it but confirmed that the notes were in her handwriting.

Yet later in the piece, it became apparent that they are more than just friends.

Mr Crawford told Farrow “that selling McDougal’s story was his idea, and that he first raised it when she was living with him, in 2016”.

As they watched the presidential candidate on television, Mr Crawford said he told Ms McDougal that her past relationship with Mr Trump “could be worth something about now”.

In an interview with CNN, Farrow called Ms McDougal’s notes “written testimony” and said they exist because “in the course of selling the story, a friend of hers who coaxed her into selling it said sit down and write every detail”.

Two months after Ms McDougal signed the contract with American Media, Mr Trump’s personal lawyer Michael Cohen paid $US130,000 to Stormy Daniels, a former porn star who had claimed in an interview years earlier that she had an affair with Trump in 2006.

Since that transaction was accompanied by a nondisclosure agreement, the payment has been widely viewed as hush money. Mr Cohen recently told the New York Times that he paid Daniels out of his pocket and was not reimbursed by Mr Trump or his campaign.

American Media told the New Yorker in a letter last week that a post-election amendment to Ms McDougal’s contract allows her to respond to legitimate press inquiries about Mr Trump.

An AMI executive has now asked New Yorker editor David Remnick for a correction, saying he had an obligation to tell readers that Ms McDougal’s notes were written at least 10 years after the alleged affair.

The executive said the omission was intentionally misleading.

Remnick, a widely respected journalist and Pulitzer Prize-winning author who is also an ardent critic of Mr Trump, responded that his magazine stands by its story.

He said the story made clear the long time lapse between the alleged affair and the effort to sell the story. Remnick also said the New Yorker had disclosed Mr Crawford’s role and included AMI’s responses.

Farrow has gained enormous journalistic credibility for his meticulous New Yorker exposes of sexual misconduct allegations against Harvey Weinstein by numerous actresses and the movie mogul’s attempts to intimidate the press.

His detailed reporting on Ms McDougal and Mr Trump fits that pattern.

Still, some journalists reached the understandable conclusion that Ms McDougal’s notes were composed back in 2006. Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen wrote this week that Ms McDougal “handwrote a contemporaneous account of her alleged affair”.

Time, in a common formulation, said that “a former Playboy model kept handwritten notes about an alleged nine-month affair with President Donald Trump that began in 2006”.

The Week said that “McDougal’s friend John Crawford supplied Farrow with McDougal’s handwritten notes from the time, which detail the affair”.

The reality is that at least a decade had passed before Karen McDougal wrote those notes, after her friend and roommate urged her to peddle her story for money.

WHO IS KAREN MCDOUGAL?

The Playboy model claims she had a 10 month affair with Mr Trump.

A former teacher who was “discovered” during a swimsuit competition, she was plucked from Indiana and went on to become one of the most popular Playboy playmates in the ’90s.

It was rumoured she received more than $178,000 from The National Enquirer for a tell-all story about an alleged encounter with Mr Trump, The Sun reported.

She claims she had a consensual relationship with the property tycoon.

It is also claimed that the pair went to the Miss Universe Pageant at Mr Trump’s invitation.

If the allegations are true, Mr Trump was with her just a year after marrying his current wife, Melania.

169,Kurtz,Howard,premierecollectibles,"According to the media, Donald Trump could never become president. Now many are on a mission to prove he shouldn’t be president. The Trump administration and the press are at war―and as in any war, the first casualty has been truth. Bestselling author Howard Kurtz, host of Fox News’s Media Buzz and former Washington Post columnist, offers a stunning exposé of how supposedly objective journalists, alarmed by Trump’s success, have moved into the opposing camp.

Kurtz’s exclusive, in-depth, behind-the-scenes interviews with reporters, anchors, and insiders within the Trump White House reveal the unprecedented hostility between the media and the president they cover.

In Media Madness, you’ll learn:

• Why White House strategist Steve Bannon told Trump he is in danger of being impeached

• How the love-hate relationship between the president and Morning Joe hosts―Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski―turned entirely to hate

• How Kellyanne Conway felt betrayed by journalists who befriended her―and how she fought back

• How elite, mainstream news reporters―named and quoted―openly express their blatant contempt for Trump

• How Bannon tried to block short-lived Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci―and why Trump soured on him

• How Ivanka and Jared Kushner aren’t the liberals the pundits want them to be―and why Trump tried to discourage them from joining the White House

• Why Trump believes some journalists harbor hatred for him―and how some liberals despise his voters

• How Trump is a far more pragmatic politician than the press often acknowledges (and how the press dismisses his flip-flops when he flops their way)

• What Trump got wrong about Charlottesville―and how Steve Bannon predicted the debacle

• How the media consistently overreached on the Russian “collusion” scandal

• Why Trump actually likes journalists, secretly meets with them, and allows the press unprecedented access

• Why Reince Priebus couldn’t do his job―and the real reason he left the White House

• How Sean Spicer privately berated journalists for bad reporting―and why he and Kellyanne Conway were relentlessly attacked by the media

Never before has there been such an eye-opening, shocking look at what the White House and the media think about each other. It’s not pretty. But it also makes for the most important political book of the year.

Fox News analyst Howard Kurtz argues that press misjudgment has upended coverage of?the White House and boosted the president's agenda in this exclusive excerpt from his new book, 'Media Madness.'

On Jan. 8, 2017, days before Donald Trump was to assume the crushing burdens of the presidency, he faced a very different kind of problem: Meryl Streep.

The iconic actress slammed him in her speech accepting the Cecil B. DeMille lifetime achievement award at the Golden Globes, attacking him for, among other things, having allegedly mocked a disabled New York Times reporter during the campaign. The next morning, Hope Hicks, the president's loyal young assistant who was almost always by Trump's side, pulled out her phone to play footage of Kellyanne Conway on the CNN and Fox morning shows.

Kellyanne said that charge had been repeatedly refuted and added that if Streep were so concerned about the rights of the disabled, she should have spoken out about a disabled boy who had been badly beaten by young thugs shouting anti-Trump epithets in a video that had been posted on Facebook. Trump loved that answer and started venting about his media coverage.

Hicks retreated to a nearby desk, where she spoke to Times reporter Patrick Healy. He had called Trump's cellphone during the Globes and then quoted the president-elect as saying he wasn't surprised by criticisms from ""liberal movie people."" Hicks took Healy to task.

""I'm not a confrontational person, but calling the president-elect of the United States at midnight over an entertainment program is crossing the line."" If he wanted a comment from the president-elect, he should have called her. Hope ended on a conciliatory note: ""It's not the end of the world, we'll move on.""

It was a sneak preview of what would become a constant state of warfare between the new president, his closest aides and the media world — not just journalists and commentators but actors, singers, entertainers and pop-culture figures who often viewed him with outright scorn.

***

Donald Trump is staking his presidency, as he did his election, on nothing less than destroying the credibility of the news media; and the media are determined to do the same to him. This is not just a feud or a fight or a battle. It is scorched-earth warfare in which only one side can achieve victory. To a stunning degree, the press is falling into the president's trap. The country's top news organizations have targeted Trump with an unprecedented barrage of negative stories, with some no longer making much attempt to hide their contempt. Some stories are legitimate, some are not, and others are generated by the president's own falsehoods and exaggerations. But the mainstream media, subconsciously at first, has lurched into the opposition camp and is appealing to an anti-Trump base of viewers and readers, failing to grasp how deeply it is distrusted by a wide swath of the country.

These are not easy words for me to write. I am a lifelong journalist with ink in my veins. And for all my criticism of the media's errors and excesses, I have always believed in the mission of aggressive reporting and holding politicians accountable.

But the past two years have radicalized me. I am increasingly troubled by how many of my colleagues have decided to abandon any semblance of fairness out of a conviction that they must save the country from Trump.

I first got to know Donald Trump three decades ago and never made the blunder of underestimating him during the campaign. I saw all his weaknesses — the bluster, the bullying, the refusal to admit mistakes — but I also saw strengths that most of my colleagues missed, especially an ability to channel the anger of millions of voters who despise the press — including the old-guard conservative press — and other elite institutions.

This is, at bottom, a battle over the truth. Who owns it, who controls it, who can sell their version to a polarized public that increasingly cannot agree on basic facts. Everything you read, hear and see about Trump's veracity is filtered through a mainstream media prism that reflects a lying president — and virtually never considers the press' own baggage and biases. Everything you read, hear and see from the Trump team is premised on the view that media news is fake news, that journalists are too prejudiced, angry and ideological to fairly report on the president. Trump and his acolytes use these attacks on the Fourth Estate to neutralize their own untruths, evasions and exaggerations. What many journalists fail to grasp is that Trump's supporters love his street talk and view the media critiques as nonsense driven by negativity. They don't care if he makes mistakes. As paradoxical as it sounds, negative coverage helps Trump because it bonds him to people who also feel disrespected by the denizens of the mainstream press. The media take everything literally, and Trump pitches his arguments at a gut level. It is asymmetrical warfare.

Every president gets pounded by the press. But no president has ever been subjected to the kind of relentless ridicule, caustic commentary and insulting invective that has been heaped on Trump. I have a name for this half-crazed compulsion to furiously attack one man. It's called Trump Trauma.

***

Two days after Donald Trump was inaugurated, Kellyanne Conway dived into a media maelstrom with an appearance on Meet the Press. It did not go well.

She and Meet the Press host Chuck Todd had a history. NBC's goateed political junkie had texted her after 4 a.m. on election night, congratulating her on what he called the greatest upset in the history of American politics. Conway said she was ""euphoric."" But their relationship took a bad turn when she taped a Meet the Press interview in late November. When she got home that Sunday morning and told her husband, George, that it had gone smoothly, he said, ""What do you mean? You weren't on for even a minute."" Conway called Todd and asked what happened. The anchor — who had booked Conway under pressure from the Trump team — realized there had been a miscommunication. He explained that he had told a staffer the show was packed and the most they could do was run sound bites.

""I don't give sound bites. I don't speak in sound bites,"" she said. Todd asked how he could make amends. ""It's only 8 a.m. on the West Coast,"" Conway said. ""You can run the whole interview. You've done eight minutes with Ash Carter,"" Barack Obama's secretary of defense, ""and I'm falling asleep."" Conway was steamed. NBC News president Deborah Turness called to mend fences, but Conway did not respond.

Now Kellyanne was doing a live interview with Todd from the North Lawn of the White House. Todd demanded to know why Trump Press Secretary Sean Spicer had made a ""ridiculous"" statement that was ""a provable falsehood"" about Trump's inaugural crowd being bigger than Obama's. Things turned personal when Todd laughed at Conway's explanation that Spicer was providing ""alternative facts."" ""Your job is not to call things ridiculous that are said by our press secretary and our president,"" Conway said. ""You're supposed to be a newsperson. You're not an opinion columnist."" Conway was disgusted and knew her pushback against Todd would not get replayed on any network. Conway was sympathetic toward journalists, but here she was, trying to talk about Trump's policy agenda and getting ripped by a guy she had known for two decades. She thought it was ""symbolic"" of ""the way we're treated by the press."" Todd regretted letting his emotions show, but not the substance of his questions. He thought Kellyanne had simply run out of talking points, and he was laughing at the absurdity of the situation. The fact that it was a satellite interview, lacking the conversational cues provided by a face-to-face sit-down, made his interruptions look overly confrontational. The president called Conway to congratulate her on her performance against Todd. Vice president Mike Pence later joked to her: ""Does Chuck Todd have any teeth left?"" But the unfortunate phrase ""alternative facts"" stuck to her like tar paper. She had meant equally accurate explanations, like ""two plus two equals four"" and ""three plus one equals four,"" but it quickly became journalistic shorthand for White House exaggerations and falsehoods. One viewer, however, liked the phrase. ""In a way, that was genius,"" Trump told Conway. ""And in another way … ?"" she asked. The president was too busy sympathizing. ""They do that to me all the time, take one word,"" he said.

Two days later, Todd texted her with an offer: ""Would love to chat when you have time. I also think we should do a face to face sit-down on cam. Maybe something more extended for my cable show sometime next week. Just a thought. All about reminding folks we both prefer cordial back n forths."" Kellyanne happened to be meeting with the president. She asked him how to respond. ""Tell him I thought you were treated with great disrespect,"" Trump said. Conway tapped the words into her iPhone: ""President Trump said you treated me with great disrespect."" Todd quickly replied: ""I respectfully disagree. Of course, I've taken a lot more disrespect than most reporters and never make it public. I'm sorry this was your response."" Kellyanne texted, ""That was his response. I typed what he said."" ""Well. Let me know what YOU think of my pitch.""

Conway put the phone down. She was done with Todd. She eventually relented, and Turness came to see her and Hicks. Conway did not hide her disdain for how NBC and MSNBC were treating the administration. ""This is a side of me you never see,"" she said. ""I'm usually kind and gracious. Your networks are a hot mess."" Turness said that MSNBC was the province of its president, Phil Griffin. ""No, it's your stepchild,"" Conway said. ""And you've got SNL,"" Hicks added, the show on which Alec Baldwin was brutally mimicking Trump. Turness delivered an overall apology. NBC wanted to continue a 50-year tradition of spending a day trailing each new president with a camera crew. Fat chance, Conway thought, if this is how we're going to be covered. ""I let you guys into the White House and this is what happens.""

Monday, June 6, 2005; Page C01

Was Watergate bad for journalism?

On its face, the question seems absurd. The drama of two young metro reporters for The Washington Post helping to topple a corrupt president cast a golden glow over the news business in the mid-1970s.

Newspapermen became cinematic heroes, determined diggers who advanced the cause of truth by meeting shadowy sources in parking garages, and journalism schools were flooded with aspiring sleuths and crusaders.

But the media's reputation since then has sunk like a stone, and one reason is that some in the next generation of reporters pumped up many modest flaps into scandals ending in ""gate,"" sometimes using anonymous sources who turned out to be less than reliable. Journalism became a more confrontational, even prosecutorial business, with some of its practitioners automatically assuming that politicians in the post-Nixon era must be lying, dissembling or covering up.

The disclosure last week that Deep Throat, Bob Woodward's secret Watergate source, was former FBI official Mark Felt provided a needed reminder that sometimes reporters have no other way to ferret out vital information than by promising anonymity. In the war-against-its-enemies atmosphere of the Nixon administration, Felt not only would have lost his job had he gone public about White House skulduggery -- he was threatened with firing just as a suspected leaker -- but might well have been prosecuted for breaking the law.

The revelation also serves as a reminder that sources may have complicated motives for whispering to the press. Felt may have worried about the FBI's integrity but he also may have been resentful, as the bureau's No. 2 official, at being passed over for the top job, and according to Woodward he came to detest the Nixon White House. Inside sources rarely have clean hands.

Three decades later, the use and abuse of unnamed sources is rampant, especially in Washington, and the media all too often protect those with partisan agendas. It's a long road from Felt telling Woodward to ""follow the money"" to a Bush adviser telling the New York Times that John Kerry ""looks French."" But such potshots have become routine in daily reporting.

The public, understandably, has become increasingly suspicious of blind quotes, and sometimes unnamed sources are simply wrong. The Post recently relied on ""two senior federal officials"" in reporting that Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld had given the authorization to shoot down if necessary an errant Cessna that had strayed too close to the White House, but when Rumsfeld denied this, it turned out the sources did not have firsthand knowledge that he was involved.

Newsweek apologized and retracted a news item -- attributed to ""a senior U.S. government official"" -- saying military investigators had confirmed that U.S. guards at Guantanamo Bay had flushed a Koran down a toilet.

By the time the source backed off, riots in Afghanistan and elsewhere had killed 16 people.

Newsweek has now joined the Times and Post in vowing to curtail the use of unnamed sources and to better describe their motives -- although reporters at USA Today, which has cut the use of such sources by 75 percent, say it is harder for them to compete on investigative stories.

And columnist Robert Novak's Deep Throats -- two senior administration officials who revealed that Valerie Plame, the wife of Bush White House critic Joe Wilson, was a CIA operative -- are nobody's idea of heroes. Time's Matt Cooper and Judith Miller of the Times are now facing jail for refusing to disclose their sources to a prosecutor investigating the Plame leak.

That case has prompted some of President Bush's detractors -- including Vanity Fair Editor Graydon Carter, whose magazine carried Felt's confession -- to liken the administration's criticism of the press to that of the Nixon regime's war on journalists. The president and his deputies have been sharply critical of the media at times, most recently in the Newsweek case, even as the White House has continued to make top officials available to reporters on a not-for-attribution basis.

Bill Clinton and his lieutenants also fought bitterly with the press corps over what they saw as the hyping of the Whitewater, Travelgate and Filegate stories, along with a relentless focus on Clinton's personal life and the allegations of Paula Jones, Kathleen Willey, Monica Lewinsky and Juanita Broaddrick. At the same time, the Clinton White House was one of the leakiest in modern history. And longtime FBI chief J. Edgar Hoover notoriously tried to peddle to reporters surveillance information about Martin Luther King Jr.'s sexual activities. Whether leaks are good or bad for those in power often depends on who is dishing what. But both administrations paled compared with Nixon's men, who thought nothing of wiretapping reporters to uncover leaks, ordering tax audits of its detractors and, in the case of The Washington Post Co., threatening to yank its valuable television licenses.

One other effect of Watergate and the movie ""All the President's Men"" is that journalism became a more lucrative endeavor than it had been in the old ""Front Page"" days. While few became as wealthy as Woodward and Carl Bernstein, the advent of television contracts, book deals and movie rights boosted many practitioners into the upper middle class -- where critics say they are less in touch with the daily concerns of many readers and viewers. The lure of instant stardom also may have prompted the fabrications of Janet Cooke -- the Post reporter who conjured up an 8-year-old heroin addict in 1980 -- and later Stephen Glass, Jayson Blair and Jack Kelley. In one string of Times stories, Blair quoted unnamed law enforcement officials about the case of the Washington snipers -- sources it now appears he invented, along with many others. Despite the mythology, The Post didn't force Richard Nixon from office -- there were also two special prosecutors, a determined judge, bipartisan House and Senate committees, the belated honesty of John Dean and those infamous White House tapes.

Perhaps a better lesson for the press is the way that Woodward and Bernstein pored over phone lists and knocked on doors late at night, the kind of shoe leather reporting that seems less fashionable in an age of cable, blogs, Podcasts and the like. There is still a burning need for original reporting amid the cacophony of analysis, commentary and celebrity news.

Felt, now 91, was conflicted enough about his role to lie about it for 33 years, in part out of concern for what the FBI would think about a top official who spilled secrets. But it has taken about that long for source-addicted journalists to engage in some serious soul-searching about whether they have pushed too hard and gone too far in an effort to recapture some of that ancient Watergate glory.

Anonymous Attacks



Radar, the new magazine launched by former Talk editor Maer Roshan, has no qualms about unnamed sources. TV ""insiders"" are quoted anonymously in trashing top anchors and correspondents with such comments as ""She's so dumb she can't even read off a teleprompter""; ""He's a sociopath""; and ""Everything has to be scripted for her."" One woman said to report by ""flashing her cleavage."" Not exactly courageous journalism.

Brownstein's Disclosure



Los Angeles Times reporter Ron Brownstein told readers last week that he didn't intend to treat John McCain any differently, despite the fact that Brownstein's wife, former CNN producer Eileen McMenamin, has become the Arizona senator's communications director. ""I am confident that her new job will not affect my judgments,"" he wrote.

Times Washington Bureau Chief Doyle McManus says the couple is in Paris and ""we decided not to stop the honeymoon to have the argument"" about ""where the right boundaries are"" for Brownstein. ""We're all agreed that Ron can't cover McCain per se,"" but McManus sees no problem with Brownstein writing a story ""if McCain's name comes into it in a minor way. . . . We think Ron is the best political writer in the country and don't think it'd serve the nation or our readers to take him off politics.""",0,http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A49883-2005Jun6.html
173,Kurtz,Howard,washingtonpost,"Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent, said last night that he will not leave his television career to become the U.S. surgeon general and urged whoever gets the job to raise its profile as the nation grapples with how to reform health care.

Gupta, who had been described as the leading candidate for the public-health post, withdrew his name even as President Obama hosted a health-care summit at the White House that Gupta did not attend.

Speaking on ""Larry King Live"" hours after news of his decision broke, Gupta said he did not want to stop performing brain surgery, leave his television career or spend extended time away from his family.

""It really came down to a sense of timing more than anything else,"" Gupta told King on the show. ""This job that we have collectively takes us away from our children. . . . I just didn't feel like I should do that now.""

He said the surgeon general ""has to have a little bit of a higher profile. Whoever takes this job has to be out there really advocating the issues of public health. At no time is it probably more important than right now, as we're dealing with health-care reform. These issues really go hand in hand.""

The decision means that the often low-profile job will not get the mass-media jolt from the appointment of the television celebrity. Gupta, a journalist and neurosurgeon who continues to practice medicine, has become ubiquitous on CNN, where he hosts a half-hour show called ""House Call"" and appears on numerous other programs.

Gupta is the latest in a string of dropouts among likely candidates for top posts in Obama's administration. Also Thursday, two people who had been leading candidates for jobs at the Treasury Department withdrew abruptly.

Annette L. Nazareth took her name out of the running to be the deputy under Secretary Timothy F. Geithner. And Caroline Atkinson, the pick for undersecretary for international affairs, also withdrew her name.

After a rapid start, Obama's endeavor to fill out his government has stalled amid intense inquiries into the background of nominees and efforts to meet the president's strict rules against lobbyists.

Sources had confirmed weeks ago that Obama had offered the job to Gupta and that the neurosurgeon had intended to take it and would leave his network job. But no further progress was evident, especially after Obama's first choice for secretary of health and human services, former senator Thomas A. Daschle (D-S.D.), was derailed by tax problems.

An administration official said last night that Gupta ""was under serious consideration for the job of surgeon general. He has removed himself from consideration to focus more on his medical career and his family.""

Gupta, who was once named one of the ""sexiest men alive"" by People magazine, was never officially named to the post and continued to report for CNN. Sources said the medical journalist told CNN executives that he wanted to devote more time to his medical practice and to his duties at the network.",0,http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/05/AR2009030503310.html
174,Kurtz,Howard,hotair,"But the anti-Trump movement—of which Brooks is a “proud member”—”seems to be getting dumber. It seems to be settling into a smug, fairy tale version of reality that filters out discordant information” and views Trump as “a semiliterate madman surrounded by sycophants who are morally, intellectually and psychologically inferior to people like us.”

In perhaps the unkindest cut, Brooks says “the anti-Trump movement suffers from insularity. Most of the people who detest Trump don’t know anybody who works with him or supports him.”

That last point buttresses something I’ve been saying for a long time, that some of the opposition to the 45th president is not just ideological, not just stylistic, but cultural in nature.

177,Kurtz,Howard,washingtonpost,"Washington Post Magazine reporter Juan Williams said yesterday that the newspaper has disciplined him for what he called ""wrong"" and ""inappropriate"" verbal conduct toward women staffers and he apologized to his colleagues.

In an open letter to the newsroom, Williams said: ""It pained me to learn during the investigation that I had offended some of you. I have said so repeatedly in the last few weeks, and repeat here: some of my verbal conduct was wrong, I now know that, and I extend my sincerest apology to those whom I offended. I have committed to Post management, and I commit to you -- and to myself -- to change my ways.""

Williams's letter came several hours after about 50 female employees met with Executive Editor Leonard Downie Jr. and said they objected to The Post's refusal to say how the paper had resolved allegations of verbal sexual harassment against Williams. The newspaper's management has maintained that such personnel inquiries must remain confidential.

Downie said in a letter to the staff, which was posted in the newsroom with Williams's letter last evening, that ""the complaints about Juan's verbal conduct with a number of women in the newsroom were thoroughly investigated. The complaints were found to be serious, and, as Juan acknowledges, he was disciplined for his conduct and intends to apologize to women he offended."" Downie declined to answer questions about his statement.

The Post disclosed the internal inquiry involving Williams, 37, in an editor's note and news story Oct. 15.

The disclosure came five days after a Williams column on The Post's op-ed page in which he said that Anita Hill had ""no credible evidence"" for her allegations of sexual harassment by Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas, but that Hill was ""prompted"" to make her charges by Democratic Senate staffers. The Post's personnel inquiry had begun more than two weeks earlier, but the column angered many women in the newsroom, and several came forward to say that they had also had problems with Williams. Post editors say they decided to make a public statement after WRC-TV aired a report on the controversy.

Williams returned to the newsroom Monday after working away from the office for two weeks, and the controversy seemed to have died down. But emotions began running high again Wednesday when Williams was quoted in USA Today as saying the complaints stemmed from ""my attempts at being friendly"" and saying ""Hi. How are you? . . . Hey, did you have a date? How was your weekend?"" He also said The Post had ""said basically, 'Come back to work. We're sorry this happened.' ""

A letter to Downie signed by 116 newsroom employees yesterday said: ""We feel Juan's unrefuted false statements to the national media continue to cause anguish and professional harm to the women involved. They have also left many people inside and outside The Post with the impression that either the complaints were not serious or were not taken seriously . . . . The Post has an obligation to set the record straight by refuting such comments.""

In a letter to The Post, 11 female employees, including senior reporters and editors, dismissed the notion that ""the women bringing the complaints were victims of some sort of mass hysteria perpetrated by an identification with Anita Hill."" They said the recent complaints were made ""before the world ever heard the name 'Anita Hill.' ""

In his letter, Williams, a frequent television commentator, said that ""there was no suggestion that I ever engaged in offensive physical contact, or that I attempted to abuse my position at The Post, or that I discussed pornographic materials, or called women employees at home, or the like."" But, he wrote, ""I do not mean to belittle the inappropriateness of the verbal conduct which I have acknowledged.""

Williams expressed hope that his letter ""will be seen as the first step toward restoring those relationships.""

Seven women said in on-the-record interviews yesterday that Williams had repeatedly made hostile and sexually explicit comments to them, in some cases over a period of several years. All of them said they believed the comments were meant to embarrass them, not an attempt to date them, and most said that Williams persisted despite their protests.

Jo Ellen Murphy, art director of the Weekend section, said that ""he was obsessed with my sex life and that's all he wanted to talk to me about . . . . I raised my voice at him and said, 'Just don't talk to me again.' ""

After Williams made some ""hostile remarks"" in late September, Murphy said, a male co-worker reported it to an editor, which triggered the personnel inquiry.

Nancy McKeon, the magazine's features editor, said she told Williams that ""you've got a little problem here"" after she complained about a sexual remark he made to her. Karen Tanaka, an assistant photo editor, said Williams had been ""nothing but nasty to me."" Deborah Needleman, the magazine's photo editor, said that when she objected to Williams's ""demeaning"" comments, he said: ""What's wrong with a little flirting?""

In the Oct. 15 editor's note, The Post said that Downie and other top news editors ""mistakenly failed to inform"" Editorial Page Editor Meg Greenfield about the inquiry before Williams's column on Thomas was published. Downie said he regretted that he did not read the column before publication.

Williams, who was told about the allegations after he wrote the column but before it was published, said at the time that his view of the Thomas nomination was ""completely unconnected"" to the Post inquiry. He also called the allegations ""absolutely false.""

Downie said in his letter yesterday that ""we normally keep such newsroom disciplinary matters confidential,"" but that ""maintaining confidentiality does not mean that the seriousness of the charges is being minimized or that discipline is not being applied when warranted.""",0,http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/21/AR2010102102009.html
178,Kurtz,Howard,washingtonpost,"C-SPAN Strikes Flynt By Howard Kurtz

Washington Post Staff Writer

Wednesday, January 13, 1999; Page C1 Forty-five minutes before Larry Flynt began dishing the dirt at a news conference Monday night, C-SPAN blinked. Executives at the nonprofit network, which had been ballyhooing its intention to carry Flynt live, got nervous after watching the Hustler publisher on CNBC's ""Rivera Live"" and canceled the broadcast. C-SPAN did replay the Flynt event at 6 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. yesterday. ""It was just too bad,"" said C-SPAN Vice President Terry Murphy. ""It would have been great to be able to show."" But, he said, ""we went with the recommendation from our lawyer. It was not an editorial concern as much as a legal concern about defamation and libelous statements being made."" The question, said Bruce Collins, the network's general counsel, was ""what are the chances this thing would get out of control? We reached the conclusion that there was more of a chance than we'd earlier thought."" At the Los Angeles news conference at 11 p.m. EST, Flynt accused Rep. Robert Barr (R-Ga.) of hypocrisy for refusing to answer questions during a divorce from his second wife about his relationship with the woman who is now his third wife. Barr, one of the House prosecutors in the Senate impeachment trial, is a fierce critic of President Clinton's handling of his affair with Monica Lewinsky. In an affidavit, Barr's second wife, Gail Vogel Barr, said that the congressman, a staunch opponent of abortion, paid for her to have an abortion in 1983 after they had already had two children. Gail Barr, who was paid by Flynt for her information, said Bob Barr drove her to the medical clinic and picked her up. ""He said it was entirely my decision. . . . Bob never told me not to have the abortion, or that he was in any way against my having the abortion,"" Gail Barr said. Barr had testified during the proceeding that the abortion was ""against my wishes."" In a statement Monday night, Barr said: ""As a public official who has cast dozens of pro-life votes in the Congress, and a strong opponent of abortion, I have never suggested, urged, forced or encouraged anyone to have an abortion."" He did not address the specifics of his ex-wife's account. On CNN's ""Crossfire"" last night, Barr again denied committing perjury in the divorce case and said his former wife ""may choose to make money on telling these sorts of things as she sees it, or making things up."" During his unsuccessful 1992 campaign for the Senate, Barr told reporters he ""would do absolutely everything in my power to stop it"" if his wife or stepdaughter wanted to have an abortion, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Several hours before Flynt's news conference, Republican National Chairman Jim Nicholson fired off a fax to C-SPAN Chairman Brian Lamb. ""Larry Flynt's attempt to embarrass and intimidate his political enemies is hardly on the same level with the congressional hearings and political debates C-SPAN normally broadcasts,"" Nicholson said. ""Giving Larry Flynt this platform will, in effect, bridge what had been the considerable gap between your news organization on the one hand, and the worst tabloid and pornographic publications on the other."" Murphy said he had been unaware of the fax. While C-SPAN is dedicated to the idea of live, unfiltered coverage of public events, Collins said Flynt's ""casual"" demeanor on the Rivera show and ""sketchy information"" about the abortion caused him to worry about unfair attacks on Barr. In hindsight, Collins said, ""we could easily have aired it live, but we didn't have the confidence to do it just before air time."" Flynt told the 200 assembled reporters that he will be releasing sexual allegations against other Republicans, including one he described as a ""big fish,"" in the coming weeks. But Dan Moldea, a Washington journalist hired by Flynt to investigate the allegations, says charges against several of the smaller minnows will not be made public. ""Some Republicans on Capitol Hill should be sending us flowers and thank-you cards,"" Moldea said. ""They weren't going on TV talk shows shooting off their mouths [about Clinton], or going to the floor of Congress to seize the moral high ground. We've thrown them back in the river. We're not going to interfere with their lives. There has to be some higher purpose [in the disclosures] than tawdry sex."" Moldea said he had investigated the allegations against both Barr and Rep. Robert Livingston (R-La.), the former House speaker-designate, who announced his resignation from the House last month after confirming that he had had extramarital affairs. ""I'm the grunt crime reporter,"" Moldea said. Moldea is probably best known for his unsuccessful libel suit against the New York Times over a review of his book on organized crime that accused him of sloppy journalism. He also has written books on the death of Vincent Foster and the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy. A critic of independent counsel Kenneth Starr, he secretly recorded calls from two of Starr's deputies indicating that the office regularly briefed sympathetic reporters. Moldea's hiring was first reported by Newsweek. Asked about Flynt's approach of dribbling out the allegations, Moldea said: ""We don't want the perception that we're a bunch of terrorists and we're going to kill a hostage a week until they release the president."" But Moldea strongly defended his work for Flynt. ""If I worked for The Washington Post or the New York Times, I'd be up for a Pulitzer Prize for the way I handled the Livingston matter,"" he said. Rivera, meanwhile, was catching flak from one Washington critic. Larry Klayman, chairman of the conservative group Judicial Watch, said conservatives should boycott the show ""until Geraldo Rivera issues an apology"" for allowing Flynt to ""slander"" Barr. Klayman was an occasional ""Rivera Live"" guest but has not been invited back in recent months. CNBC spokesman John Brine said Flynt appeared on the show because ""the material he was presenting was relevant to what's happening in Washington"" and that ""we were persuaded by the documents we reviewed."" Flynt was interviewed yesterday on ""Good Morning America"" and ""CBS This Morning"" and was scheduled to appear on ""Larry King Live"" and ""20/20.""

Fox Threatens Matt Drudge With Lawsuit Over Walkout By Howard Kurtz

Washington Post Staff Writer

Wednesday, November 17, 1999; Page C01 Matt Drudge's public eruption at Fox News Channel is about to cost him his television career. In a letter, Fox News has threatened to sue the Internet columnist for refusing to tape his weekly talk show Saturday after being told that he could not brandish a picture of a 21-week-old fetus. Network sources say he is on the verge of being fired. Fox attorney Dianne Brandi wrote Drudge that ""you flatly refused to perform the services under your agreement. . . . You made disparaging, false and defamatory remarks about Fox News,"" calling his conduct ""completely unprofessional and unacceptable."" The letter says that ""it is necessary for you to apologize to Fox News"" to avoid the possibility of a ""breach of contract lawsuit."" But Drudge was not in an apologizing mood toward Rupert Murdoch's network yesterday. ""Over my dead Web site!"" he declared. ""Seems to me Murdoch has enough money, he doesn't need Drudge money. . . . Some of these overgrown fetuses at Fox hit the panic button."" Said Fox News President Roger Ailes, who hired Drudge: ""He wants to apply Internet standards, which are nonexistent, to journalism, and journalism has real standards. It can't work that way."" The Washington Post reported Monday that Drudge had refused to do the program after being told that he could not show a National Enquirer photo of a tiny hand emerging from the womb during a spina bifida operation on the fetus. Drudge, who opposes abortion, wanted to use the picture to talk about why the United States should not help finance U.N. population-control programs. Network executives vetoed the idea, saying that would amount to misrepresenting the photo. ""I apologize to Fox News for having an open mind,"" Drudge said. ""I've been spoiled on the Internet, I really have. The lack of ability to express my opinion on an issue that's important to me has left me believing the Internet is the future."" Officially, Fox was tight-lipped about Drudge's status. ""We were sorry that he did not live up to his contractual obligations,"" said spokesman Brian Lewis. The Fox attorney's letter reminded Drudge that his contract says he cannot talk about his services for Fox News ""without mutual consent,"" and that final editorial decisions are made by the network. Brit Hume, Fox's Washington managing editor, said he enjoyed Drudge's ""eccentric"" show and did not think the cyber-gossip hurt the network's credibility. But, he said, Drudge is now ""banging his rattle on the flats of his crib and raising hell. What he calls censorship is what the rest of us call editing."" Fox executives noted that Drudge's ratings had dropped 30 percent since last fall, from 230,000 to 162,000 households, although he is usually the network's highest-rated weekend show. Drudge notes he was moved from 9 p.m. to a more competitive 7 p.m. time slot when his show was expanded to an hour in June. Still, said one Fox insider, ""he hasn't broken news in some time. He might have outlived his 15 minutes of fame."" But Drudge was still milking those minutes yesterday, talking about the showdown on Rush Limbaugh's radio show. Drudge points out that Oprah Winfrey showed footage of the spina bifida operation on her syndicated program this week. Two Fox executives said Drudge may have precipitated the blowup to get out of the final year of his contract. Drudge has tired of the show and takes in far more in advertising revenue from his Internet site than under his Fox deal. He insists, however, that the photo flap is a matter of principle and that Fox was more permissive in allowing him to report on the Clinton White House scandals. The tantrum didn't take place in a vacuum. According to Fox staffers, Ailes told Drudge in a recent meeting that he was ""phoning it in"" and ""booking the same old people,"" leading to the ratings slide. In a second meeting with Ailes, Drudge says he asked to be let out of his contract but agreed to continue. ""He begged me to stay,"" said Drudge. ""He said, 'You're my top show, I need you.' "" But Fox staffers say Ailes simply reminded Drudge that he was legally obligated to complete his contract.

181,Kurtz,Howard,washingtonpost,"The New York Times Co. said last night that it is notifying federal authorities of its plans to shut down the Boston Globe, raising the possibility that New England's most storied newspaper could cease to exist within weeks.

After down-to-the-wire negotiations did not produce millions of dollars in union concessions, the Times Co. said that it will file today a required 60-day notice of the planned shutdown under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification law.

The move could amount to a negotiating ploy to extract further concessions from the Globe's unions, since the notice does not require the Times Co. to close the paper after 60 days. The deadline, however, would put the unions under fierce pressure to produce additional savings, and the Boston Newspaper Guild promptly called the step a ""bullying"" tactic by the company.

Some industry observers have expressed skepticism that Times Co. Chairman Arthur Sulzberger Jr. would want his legacy to include the shuttering of the Globe, which his company bought in 1993.

But the Times Co. itself is under strong financial pressure. It recently mortgaged its new Manhattan headquarters, borrowed $250 million from a Mexican billionaire at 14 percent interest, laid off 100 newsroom staffers and cut salaries by 5 percent.

Globe management said in a toughly worded statement: ""Filing the WARN notice is a difficult step that we would like to avoid. But, unfortunately, given the state of the negotiations, it is one we must be prepared to take.""

The paper's circulation dropped 14 percent in the most recent six-month period. The Globe is expected to lose $85 million this year, the company says.

Boston residents have long resented the takeover of the Globe by a company based in New York, with which the region competes in sports, banking and cultural bragging rights.

The notion that Boston, home to some of the country's top universities, could lose its major daily would have been unthinkable before the recent nationwide plunge in advertising revenue. That dive has triggered a wave of newspaper bankruptcies and the closing of the Rocky Mountain News and the Seattle Post-Intelligencer.

A Globe shutdown would leave the city with only one daily newspaper, the tabloid Boston Herald, which has just 10 news reporters and is battling its own financial difficulties.

""From the moment the Times Co. purchased The Globe in 1993, it has treated New England's largest newspaper like a cheap whore,"" former Globe columnist Eileen McNamara wrote last month in the Herald. ""It pimped her out for profit during the booming 1990s and then pillaged her when times got tough. It closed her foreign bureaus and cheapened her coverage of everything from the fine arts to the hard sciences.""

McNamara, who now teaches journalism at Brandeis University, ridiculed Sulzberger as ""the boy genius whose crack management skills have helped drive the parent company of two of journalism's most respected newspapers to the brink of bankruptcy.""

The Globe says the parent company is seeking $10 million in savings from the Newspaper Guild -- the paper's largest union -- as well as $5 million from the mailers, $2.5 million from the drivers and $2.2 million from the pressmen.

Negotiations were disrupted when the Times Co. acknowledged a $4 million accounting mistake in the talks, requiring the Guild, which represents 600 editorial, advertising and office workers, to dig even deeper for savings.

The Globe quoted the head of the Teamsters local, which represents the newspaper's drivers, as saying his union had come up with the $2.5 million in salary and benefit cuts demanded by the company. But the Times Co. is also said to be seeking to eliminate seniority rules and lifetime job guarantees for some union members.",0,http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/03/AR2009050300269.html

 From Salon Magazine: 'This Hypocrite Broke Up My Family' and Why We Ran the Henry Hyde Story

By Howard Kurtz

Washington Post Staff Writer

Thursday, September 17, 1998; Page A15 A bitter new sexual controversy erupted on Capitol Hill yesterday after House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.) acknowledged to a left-leaning magazine that he had a five-year affair with a married woman in the 1960s. Hyde made the admission after the online magazine Salon, which has relentlessly attacked independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr, told his office it was publishing details of his affair with a former beauty stylist named Cherie Snodgrass. Hyde, 74, who would head any inquiry into impeaching President Clinton, is the third Republican lawmaker in two weeks to acknowledge an affair after being confronted by a journalist. ""The statute of limitations has long since passed on my youthful indiscretions,"" Hyde said in a statement. ""Suffice it to say Cherie Snodgrass and I were good friends a long, long time ago. After Mr. Snodgrass confronted my wife, the friendship ended and my marriage remained intact. The only purpose for this being dredged up now is an obvious attempt to intimidate me and it won't work. I intend to fulfill my constitutional duty and deal judiciously with the serious felony allegations presented to Congress in the Starr report."" Both the White House and Salon flatly denied that any administration staffer was involved, and Clinton's deputy chief of staff, John D. Podesta, called Hyde with the same message. A Florida retiree confirmed last night that he had passed the allegation to Salon without the administration's involvement. But in an environment already made tense over the Monica S. Lewinsky investigation and Republican jitters about White House counterattacks, the 30-year-old affair quickly became a political flash point. ""The latest attack on Chairman Henry Hyde, launched by Salon -- a close ally of the Clinton White House -- is the most despicable, most disgraceful, most disgusting piece of rumormongering that I have ever seen,"" said House Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-Tex.). Replied White House press secretary Michael McCurry: ""Someone should explain to Mr. DeLay that statements like this only give the press further reason to report a story that should be buried to begin with."" David Talbot, Salon's editor and author of the piece, said he published it because ""the Starr report and enemies of President Clinton have rewritten the rules. Once Starr submitted a report filled with nothing but a sexual relationship, then his supporters -- people sitting in judgment of the president -- are fair game. Hyde has been built up so much in the press as this august figure, a great statesman."" Talbot, who last spring chatted with the president and Hillary Rodham Clinton at a White House party, said his Washington bureau chief, Jonathan Broder, refused to pursue the story months ago. Asked for comment, Broder said he had ""argued strenuously"" against publication. ""I objected to it on journalistic grounds, on grounds of fairness and because of the way Salon would be perceived,"" Broder said. Podesta said he told Hyde that if anyone at the White House had any involvement with the story, ""they'd be fired immediately."" Podesta added: ""We've been subjected to this ugliness ourselves and know how painful it is."" If a staff member was involved, he said, ""I will personally kick anyone's ass out the door."" White House aide Sidney Blumenthal and other officials denied during a senior staff meeting yesterday that they had worked with Salon on the Hyde story. ABC News reported last night that two unnamed journalists say a senior White House official had peddled to them a story that Hyde once had a girlfriend. McCurry said he had called ABC and ""violently objected"" when the network, citing confidential sources, refused to tell him the name of the White House official allegedly involved. Ironically, Hyde issued a memo to Judiciary Committee members Monday about news reports that Clinton's allies ""may be attempting to collect and disseminate derogatory personal information about members of Congress"" as part of a "" 'scorched earth' policy."" He said that ""efforts to intimidate members of Congress"" may be a violation of federal law and that the panel would refer such matters to the Justice Department if necessary. Salon recently reported that White House sources were targeting Hyde and other Republican lawmakers for possible leaks involving their personal lives. Talbot said Salon learned of the allegation from Norm Sommer, a Florida retiree and lifelong Democrat who is a friend of Snodgrass's ex-husband. Sommer did not disguise his partisan motivation, saying in an interview that he is outraged over the Lewinsky investigation and what he called ""a campaign to get this president."" ""There's no statute of limitations on Henry Hyde,"" Sommer said. ""He's the biggest phony in Washington, the icon of moral rectitude. Why should this guy be a de facto judge on whether there should be impeachment when he's guilty of an adulterous affair?"" Sommer said he had called 57 journalists over six months in an effort to publicize the story Snodgrass had told him. He said reporters for the Los Angeles Times and Boston Globe expressed interest but were overruled by editors. Sommer said that he also called the White House and Democratic National Committee for guidance but that ""nobody would speak to me."" According to Salon, Hyde's affair began in 1965, a year before he was elected to the Illinois House. Hyde, who was married, was 41, and Snodgrass was 29. Her ex-husband, Fred, gave Salon two photographs of Hyde with his ex-wife. One was inscribed, ""I love you Cherie!!!!"" and signed ""Hank, Dec. 30, 1966."" Fred Snodgrass, a former Chicago furniture salesman, said in an interview that Hyde is a ""super hypocrite"" who broke up his marriage. ""He had an affair with a young woman with three little children,"" said Snodgrass, 76. ""At least the president picked on a single woman."" Snodgrass said Hyde ""conned"" his ex-wife and later set her up in an apartment. ""He was a good-looking guy, spent a lot of money on her, took her places,"" Snodgrass said. But Snodgrass said he would not have gone public with the story because ""I'm not the type."" Cherie Snodgrass could not be located last night. Two leading Clinton critics, Reps. Dan Burton (R-Ind.) and Helen Chenoweth (R-Idaho), have acknowledged extramarital affairs in the last two weeks after being confronted by newspapers in their states. But the Salon story has struck a larger nerve. ""People at the very highest levels of the White House are involved in this,"" said Rep. Ray LaHood (R-Ill.), who offered no evidence. Democrats are worried about a backlash. ""It is totally despicable and in fact legitimizes everything we've been fighting against to use this kind of an issue against Chairman Hyde, much less anyone else in Congress,"" said former White House lawyer Lanny Davis. ""I think this Hyde thing is a big mistake,"" a congressional Democrat complained. Said a member of the House GOP leadership staff: ""No member is more respected by people on both sides of the aisle. Dragging Hyde through the mud just shows what these people are really about."" Staff writers John F. Harris and Susan Schmidt contributed to this report.

185,Kurtz,Howard,americanthinker,"In recent weeks, the Fox News Channel (FNC), considered the most friendly to President Trump, has lost the commanding ratings lead that it held for the past decade and a half. On most – but not all – weeknights now, FNC is coming in second or third to MSNBC in prime time when the preferred demographic or “the demo” (viewers between the ages of 25 and 54) is the metric. The other anti-Trump channel, CNN, has seen its ratings rise, too, and occasionally it wins an hour or two in prime time. With the future of FNC’s iconic conservative program Hannity in doubt, the outlook for Fox News is, at best, increasingly uncertain.

The Fake News-inspired perception that existential problems are enveloping the Trump Administration is expanding and deepening. As this questionable meme takes hold, it appears that the current toxic political climate is drawing more anti-Trump viewers to the partisan attack “resistance” programs that are playing out nightly on two of the three cable television news channels. Meanwhile, the new ratings war among the three 24/7 cable news outlets is settling into an ongoing war of attrition.

See also: Bill O’Reilly promises ‘stunning’ information about his firing by Fox News as litigation likely

The rewards for the winner of the cable news wars are substantial. According to a 2015 New York Times Magazine profile of Fox News anchor-star Megyn Kelly, who has since jumped to NBC, “During a 10-year span, Fox News’s profits grew six-fold to $1.2 billion in 2014, on total operating revenue of $2 billion, according to the financial analysis firm SNL Kagan.” On April 20, 2017, the Hollywood Reporter noted that 20 percent of the profits for 21st Century Fox in 2016 came from Fox News, “the biggest-earning division in the company.”

The unprecedented success of the Fox News Channel is accountable to billionaire international media mogul Rupert Murdoch, who bankrolled the effort, and Roger Ailes (1940-2017), the legendary TV producer, political consultant, and all around media genius. Ted Turner, the founder of CNN in 1980 and another larger than life personality, believed that “the news is the star.” Ailes discovered and nurtured personalities – attractive ones, at that – and made them the stars of his channel. (Ailes’s 1987 book on how to achieve success is titled You Are The Message: Secrets of the Mass Communicators.) This ethos had a profound impact on the other news channels, which, like FNC, are also now largely personality driven.

The success of FNC at the hands of Ailes was impossible for the hostile mainstream media to overlook, even the New York Times:

Ailes has long argued that Americans alienated by the sensibilities of the “New York-Hollywood elitists” are a valuable demographic, and the past two decades have proved him right. He started Fox News in 1996, led it to first place in the cable-news ratings in 2002 and has widened his lead ever since. At the point it surpassed CNN, Fox News had an average prime-time audience of 1.2 million, while CNN’s was 900,000 and MSNBC’s was around 400,000. By the end of 2012 – a presidential-election year, with higher-than-typical news viewership – its prime-time audience of more than two million was the third-biggest in all of basic cable and larger than those of MSNBC (905,000) and CNN (677,000) combined. By last year [2014], its share of that news pie had climbed to 61 percent, and it had moved to second place in the prime-time rankings for all of basic cable, behind ESPN.

Fox News’s standing actually went up from there. But that was then – 2015 and 2016 – and this is now.

The past year for FNC has witnessed simmering scandals, on-camera talent and executive staff upheavals, bad programming decisions, and a number of successful actions by FNC’s well-funded left wing adversaries – resulting in advertiser boycotts and an unending stream of negative reporting about Fox News by the mainstream media. All of these factors have taken an enormous toll on Fox News – and have upended the entire cable news status quo.

The Murdoch Boys

Many of the recent problems plaguing Fox News have been self-inflicted. With the forced departure of Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes in August 2016, followed by his deputy Bill Shine in May 2017, the control of Fox News officially came under the purview of the aging Rupert Murdoch, 86, and his two sons, Lachlan and James, who are in their 40s. Murdoch the elder, who has hedged his bets in the past by giving campaign contributions to both Democrats and Republicans, has enforced a reliably right of center editorial policy in the diverse news media properties that he controls on both sides of the Atlantic. That is not the case with the younger Murdochs, who are now wielding significant influence on every aspect of Fox News and its parent company. James Murdoch is the CEO of 21st Century Fox and the #1 heir apparent of his father, while Lachlan Murdoch is the executive co-chairman of News Corp (which manages Fox News) and 21st Century Fox.

The Murdochs L. to R. Lachlan, Rupert and James

A number of articles have described the changing landscape at the Murdochs’s businesses in light of the ascent to power of the Murdoch boys. One of them, “Here’s What to Expect with the Changing of the Guard at Fox News” in Fortune, appeared five days after the ouster of Bill O’Reilly, FNC's most popular host. O’Reilly’s firing represented a major victory for the enemies of Fox News. His unceremonious exit was reportedly facilitated by pressure instigated by James and Lachlan Murdoch.

Journalist Michael Wolff, who has written extensively about Fox News, wrote about James Murdoch on April 20, 2017:

It would be hard to imagine how James could have been regarded with more contempt by many of the people at Fox News. James was rather exhibit No. 1 of the liberal elite entitlement that Fox had so profitably programmed against.

For the past two decades as they ascended the ladder to power, the Murdoch boys cut their teeth in a variety of jobs at various levels of the far-flung Murdoch media and entertainment empire, which includes the Fox broadcast TV network, the Fox Business Channel, 21st Century Fox, The Wall Street Journal, Harper Collins publishers, the venerable National Geographic – it’s an incredibly lengthy list of businesses worth billions of dollars that could consume an entire article. In fact, it has: “What does Rupert Murdoch own? A little bit of everything,” published in USA Today in 2015.

James and Lachlan Murdoch are married to high profile professional women – both of whom are widely reported to be on the far left side of the political spectrum. James’s wife Kathryn was a marketing executive and is now a dedicated environmental activist. At the Web site of the foundation that she co-founded with her husband, Kathryn Murdoch’s profile notes: “Between 2007-2011, Ms. Murdoch served as Director of Strategy & Communications for the Clinton Climate Initiative (CCI) where she also managed CCI’s partnership with Microsoft in the development of a global greenhouse gas emissions tracking software.” She is also a trustee of the Environmental Defense Fund. Confirming Kathryn Murdoch’s left wing credentials, her personal Twitter account features frequent tweets like the one she posted on June 4, 2017: “I don't believe in Donald Trump. Will that make him go away?” On

July 27, 2016, Kathryn Murdoch tweeted: “This election is not about left or right. It’s about right or wrong. Reason or insanity. Backwards or forwards. #ImWithHer.” (“Her” being Hillary Clinton.)

Bill Clinton and Kathryn Murdoch

Lachlan Murdoch’s wife Sarah is a former super model who is reportedly a close confidante of her father-in-law, Rupert Murdoch. It was Sarah, according to the British press, who influenced her husband and father-in-law to fire Bill O’Reilly, the most successful host in the history of Fox News, after he was targeted as a sexual harasser following the publication of a New York Times hit piece on April 1, 2017. (O’Reilly has continued to deny the allegations leveled against him – none of which has been subjected to judicial proceedings – by the mainstream media.)

Sarah and Lachlan Murdoch

Since the reports of $13 million in payouts to five female Fox employees to hush up O’Reilly’s alleged bad behavior surfaced on April 1, there has been much debate about whether or not O’Reilly should have been forced to leave Fox News. A thoughtful, concise analysis about this topic was offered by Michael Wolff, writing in The Hollywood Reporter on April 12, 2017, exactly one week before O’Reilly’s ouster:

What has been revealed is not evidence nor an admission of guilt but details of payments settling complaints against O'Reilly – not a small distinction. You can assume maximal guilt, which the Times and other Fox haters do, or you can assume, as many lawyers do, that when there is money to be had, plaintiffs come out of the woodwork (“Coming out of the woodwork” is a virtual term of art in big settlement tort cases).

Michael Wolff weighed in again on April 20, 2017: The ouster of Roger Ailes in 2016 and Bill O’Reilly on April 19, 2017, he wrote, “means most of all that James [Murdoch] is in charge. And, most immediately, this means that Fox News, that constant irritant in James’ view of himself as a progressive and visionary television executive, will begin to change. Virtually overnight.”

An article in Vanity Fair on June 6, 2017 speculated about one possible change in the Fox News hierarchy:

Lachlan [Murdoch] is said to be recruiting possible leaders for the Fox News newsroom. One name that surfaces with regularity is David Rhodes, the president of CBS News, and a former V.P. at the network. Rhodes would appear, on some level, a perfect choice – a pedigreed newsperson with a history at Fox as well as deep connections in liberal political circles. (His brother, Ben Rhodes, was Barack Obama’s foreign policy guru.)

The Changes Begin

The firing of O’Reilly and the abrupt end to his number one show, The O’Reilly Factor, which was on for two decades Monday through Friday at 8 PM ET, upended FNC’s successful prime time schedule. The reassuring, articulate, conservative writer and talk show host Tucker Carlson was moved from his 9 PM time slot to O’Reilly’s former slot at 8 PM. Veteran iconic conservative broadcaster Sean Hannity remained at 10 PM. The weeknight prime time FNC schedule might have continued to work were it not for the program that was put on at 9 PM: The Five. Previously on at 5 PM, The Five is a less-than-heavyweight ensemble debate program that first went to air in July 2011 after Glenn Beck left the channel. It worked – sort of – at 5 PM, bridging the gap between daytime breaking news and prime time news and opinion programming. But in the opinion of many viewers, including this writer, The Five is totally inappropriate for the middle of prime time when an intelligent presentation and discussion of the day’s news should be the focus, rather than five predictable cackling commentators, one or more of them self-described comedians, loudly talking at and over each other.

The Five

The Five has helped to make stars of two veteran liberals, Bob Beckel and Juan Williams. Starting in late January 2017, Beckel, an ill-mannered Democratic Party operative, was in his second run at FNC after being fired in 2015 for taking too long to return from, and being uncooperative after, a lengthy stint in rehab. He was mercifully fired again on May 20, 2017, after reportedly using a racial slur to insult a Fox employee who is African-American.

Juan Williams is another figure who deserves closer scrutiny. Williams was associated with the 1987 six-part PBS series Eyes on the Prize, and he authored the series’s companion book of the same title. A comprehensive chronological review of the Civil Rights Era (1954-1965), the influential program, which continues to be replayed every year or two on PBS, and the book helped to establish the legitimacy, thanks to Williams’s hagiographic and revisionist narrative, of Malcolm X, Stokely Carmichael (aka Kwame Ture), H. Rap Brown, the Black Panthers, and other leftist radicals of the period.

On the crest of the success of Eyes on the Prize, Williams got himself hired by the Washington Post. Largely forgotten now is the scandal that engulfed him there. In October 1991, several score women employees at the Post complained to management about alleged verbal sexual harassment by Williams over a period of several years. An article by Howard Kurtz in the Post on November 2, 1991 reported the story. The article quoted a letter by the newspaper’s executive editor Leonard Downie, Jr., that was posted in the paper’s newsroom on November 1, 1991: “The complaints about Juan's verbal conduct with a number of women in the newsroom were thoroughly investigated. The complaints were found to be serious, and, as Juan acknowledges, he was disciplined for his conduct and intends to apologize to women he offended.”

Juan Williams

The 1991 Williams affair was largely forgotten until it emerged in 2010 in the wake of his firing by National Public Radio for a supposedly Islamophobic comment he made while appearing on Bill O’Reilly’s Fox News program. After NPR booted him, Williams was immediately rewarded by Roger Ailes with a $2 million, three year contract as a Fox News Contributor. Williams’s star has continued to rise at Fox News ever since then.

Sean Hannity: The Last Conservative/Ailes Loyalist Standing

Sean Hannity has been a mainstay on Fox News in prime time since the day the channel launched in 1996. The rest of the occupants of prime time on FNC – Martha McCallum at 7 PM, Tucker Carlson at 8, and The Five at 9 – are relative newbies to the evening schedule. In the wake of the current chaos at the channel, Hannity has been making on-camera references to his tenuous position at FNC. More than once, he has concluded his nightly program with a sign-off like this one on Monday June 5, 2017: “We’ll see you tomorrow if they’ll have me back.” On April 27, 2017, in response to a New York Magazine article that Fox News co-president Bill Shine, a conservative in the mold of his mentor Roger Ailes, might be on the way out, Hannity tweeted “i pray this is NOT true because if it is, that’s the total end of the FNC as we know it. Done.” Four days later, Shine was out.

Sean Hannity

Two weeks after Shine’s ouster, Hannity was the only host on Fox News who ran with the story of the unsolved Seth Rich murder case. Rich was an information technology specialist at the Democratic National Committee who was murdered in the street – shot in the back – by unknown assailants as he returned to his apartment in Washington, D.C. early in the morning of July 10, 2016. Some journalists, mainly in alternative media, have been attempting to investigate a possible link between Rich’s murder and the release by Wikileaks twelve days later of damaging internal emails purloined from the DNC – an embarrassing scandal that resulted in DNC Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Shultz (D-FL) being forced to quit her position on the eve of the Democratic National Convention that nominated Hillary Clinton.

Independent inquiries into the unsolved murder of Seth Rich started to gain momentum this spring when local media in Washington, D.C. – including Fox’s affiliate in the nation’s capital, Fox5 D.C., and Scott Taylor at ABC7 – as well as the One America News Network – began to look into the case. Articles in World Net Daily have also been instrumental in raising awareness of the story, more recently joined by Jerome Corsi’s three-part series at Infowars.

Lingering questions about Seth Rich’s murder represent a story that is complex and convoluted and the unsolved case, and its possible larger implications, deserves an article of its own. Suffice it to say that when Hannity did some probing reporting on the subject, including inviting retired D.C. homicide detective Rod Wheeler on his May 16 FNC program for a live interview about what he had uncovered, all hell started to break loose. A week after Wheeler’s appearance, Fox News took the unprecedented step of retracting the May 16 story about the Rich murder that quoted Wheeler, which Fox News had published at its Web site. Interestingly, the May 15 report by Fox’s local D.C. affiliate that the May 16 Fox News national story was based on has not been retracted and it is still online.

In the wake of his broadcast segments on the Rich case, most of the mainstream media immediately lined up to attack Hannity for spreading “conspiracy theories” about Rich’s murder, and a boycott of his program’s advertisers was attempted. This move proved to be largely unsuccessful, however, and as of mid-June, Hannity and his nightly program are still on Fox News, with relatively few advertiser defections. But that hasn’t stopped speculation that Hannity is no longer the right ideological fit for the new bosses of Fox News (and their wives).

On June 7, Raw Story, an online venue not exactly favorable to FNC, citing an anonymous source, reported that “The power players at the network are ‘rolling their eyes’ at Hannity. . . but they know that to lose him at this juncture would be ‘a disaster’ for the network.”

Douglas J. Hagmann

Douglas J. Hagmann, a multi-state licensed investigator and the co-host of the daily, three-hour prime time Internet program The Hagmann and Hagmann Report, has developed a confidential source inside of Fox News. In a telephone interview on June 10, 2017, Hagmann summarized what the contact at Fox News has told him.

My last conversation of substance that I had with my source is consistent with what you have said and is pretty much what the appearances are which is that there is an internal war taking place within Fox News where people have been forced to take sides. It’s a very uncomfortable place to work at the moment, whether you’re a secretary, a runner, or the on-camera talent. And there is a sense that Sean Hannity is on the chopping block and skating on thin ice. They – the Murdoch side as opposed to the Ailes loyalists – are attempting to mitigate the perception of adverse change or changing the mandate of Fox News from a conservative bastion of truth to more of a mainstream network. In the case of Hannity, they want to clean house and reformat the show. And Sean Hannity does not fit the new mold. Sean Hannity, in the words of my source, is a loose cannon that’s hard to control. He’s taking too many chances, he’s pushing the envelope, according to my source. In the words of my source, Hannity is “pissing a lot of people off who make the decisions and write the checks.”

If Hannity continues to be perceived as an embarrassment to Fox, his fate there is probably sealed.

Meanwhile, across the pond, the Murdochs are actively trying to buy the rest of Sky News in the UK to give them control of the valuable and influential news channel. According to Fortune:

[James Murdoch] and his father both want to merge the British broadcaster Sky – which they [sic] trying to acquire the rest of for $14 billion – with 21st Century Fox, to create a truly global media brand. Some Murdoch-watchers believe that the proposed acquisition of control of Sky, which requires approval from the British broadcast regulator, was one of the motivating factors behind the removal of both Ailes and O'Reilly. According to this theory, the family didn't want even the slightest hint of impropriety to affect the Sky bid – especially when there is enough attention already on the Murdochs’s history with News of the World and the hacking of private telephone accounts, an affair that caused them to drop an earlier bid for the company in 2011.

In 2011, Rupert and James Murdoch were hauled before the House of Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee in the UK for a hearing that was part of a lengthy and damaging investigation of their role in the infamous British criminal phone hacking scandal. The hearing was televised live around the world and was a low point for the Murdoch empire.

Commentary and Conclusion

I cautiously enter the realm of punditry here with some personal observations. I have been studying the media for most of my life and have paid close attention to the Fox News Channel since it launched in October 1996. FNC has never been perfect – what mainstream media source ever is? – but its “fair and balanced” approach to news and political coverage, including a comparatively fair representation of conservative points of view, provided compelling reasons to watch.

In recent years, alternative – and social – media have come into their own, thanks to the expansion of the Internet, the pervasive spread of smart phone technology, and the possibilities for citizen journalists and others who are not part of the mainstream media swamp to step forward and gain an audience. The most obvious example of success in that area is The Drudge Report, but there are thousands of other independent sources available to the public now and their number is growing. In addition, more and more people are relying on social media, including Facebook and Twitter, for their news.

As I said during my appearance on the Hagmann and Hagmann Report on June 6 to discuss my recent reporting about Fox News, the developments that we are seeing – the chaos at Fox News and the potential of its disappearance as a go-to source of news for conservatives – may represent a sign that we have finally achieved critical mass in the long overdue paradigm shift that is influencing how we access information. Finally, an undeniable, potential terminal crack in the MSM castle wall may be opening.

Those of us who follow the news obsessively or professionally have known for years that FNC and most other large mainstream media outlets are increasingly ancillary sources. Trusted and new online news sites, including video and podcast reporting – as well as insights obtained from monitoring previously hard to access international media – are now becoming the primary sources of information for understanding our times.

In terms of what might emerge if Fox News continues to falter, there are indications in a number of recent articles that people with large amounts of money to invest are eyeing the possibility of creating a new conservative news channel to challenge Fox News. Meanwhile, alternatives like One America News Network, available on some satellite TV systems and via Roku, are gaining subscribers. Sinclair Broadcast Group, which owns or operates 170 local television stations, most of them outside of the major media markets, recently completed a deal to buy Tribune Media, which would add Tribune’s 42 broadcast TV stations in 33 major markets to Sinclair’s portfolio. Sinclair currently provides Full Measure, a weekly news program to its affiliates, anchored by former CBS News correspondent Sharyl Attkisson who is one of the best investigative journalists in the country. NPR reported that in the expansion of Sinclair “There are what could be the stirrings of plans for a national platform – such as a cable television station. . . Speculation has centered on possible conversion of Tribune's WGN America as a possible conservative news and opinion channel.”

We are living in interesting times. Stay tuned for developments.

186,Kurtz,Howard,washingtonpost,"The Washington Post Co. is putting Newsweek up for sale because the company can foresee no path to profitability for the money-losing magazine, The Post Co. said Wednesday.

Though no buyer is imminent, company officials said, The Post Co. hopes to execute a ""rapid sale,"" Chairman Donald E. Graham told Newsweek employees during a Wednesday morning meeting at the magazine's office in New York.

The Post's magazine group, of which Newsweek is the biggest piece, lost $29.3 million last year after losing $16.1 million the previous year. Graham said he expects it to lose money this year.

Many newsweeklies have racked up similar losses as readers and advertisers abandon the magazines for the Internet's frequently updated news offerings. But even with the shift to the Web, online advertising revenue still represents pennies on the dollar compared with print advertising. Newsweek brought in only $8 million in online ad revenue last year, Graham said.

Newsweek, which was founded in 1933, has been part of The Post's DNA since the paper bought the magazine in 1961 at the urging of Newsweek's Washington bureau chief Benjamin C. Bradlee, who went on to a storied career as executive editor of The Post.

Bradlee said Wednesday that he hated to see any change because he was so deeply involved with Newsweek. ""I loved it. It gave me my first shot,"" he said. ""It was a great magazine. It is a great magazine."" But, he added, ""nobody says you have to keep a magazine that is costing an arm and a leg. I understand why Don put it on the market.""

Asked if it was a difficult call to sell the magazine bought by his father, Philip L. Graham, Donald Graham said: ""Yes. It was a hard decision for me, but it's a lot harder for the people who work here.""

Graham told Newsweek employees he accepted responsibility ""for not seeing early enough and reacting in the right way to the changes that have come to our industry.""

In addition to Newsweek, The Post Co. owns Kaplan education company, small cable company CableOne, six television stations, the flagship newspaper and other small print and online publications, including Slate.

The Post Co. hired boutique investment bank Allen & Co. to seek buyers for the magazine. The Post Co. would not reveal the price it hopes Newsweek will bring, but Bloomberg's purchase of BusinessWeek magazine last October may have set the market. Though terms were not disclosed by either side, reporting at the time pegged the sale price at between $2 million and $5 million.

Post Co. Vice President Ann McDaniel told Newsweek staffers: ""I suspect you might be asking yourself: What if there isn't a buyer? I believe there will be. The Philadelphia Inquirer just sold for tens of millions of dollars. But if you think my confidence is misplaced, know this: Every one of you will get a job offer"" from the new owners or severance benefits.

Newsweek has a staff of about 150, a figure that is down 30 percent over the past four years, as the magazine has cut staff to slash costs.",0,http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/05/AR2010050502285.html
187,Kurtz,Howard,washingtonpost,"For Chuck Todd, getting calls from Rahm Emanuel is a staple of covering the White House. But they dwell as much on what the NBC correspondent knows as what he can get the president's top aide to divulge.

For New York Times columnist David Brooks, it's an Emanuel invitation for a White House chat at which President Obama happens to drop by.

For Washington Post reporter Michael Shear, it's three calls to his car in a matter of minutes as he shushes his kids on the way to a Virginia restaurant.

""A conversation with Rahm can be as little as 30 seconds,"" says CNN commentator Paul Begala, who worked with Emanuel in the Clinton White House. ""He calls, drops a few F-bombs, makes his point and hangs up.""

Perhaps no White House chief of staff in modern history has worked the media as aggressively and relentlessly as Emanuel. Drawing on his long-standing relationships with journalists, Emanuel serves up on-the-record quotes, background spin and the sort of capital gossip that lubricates relationships. The former Chicago congressman also seeks their take on events and floats possible administration tactics.

And Emanuel is brusquely efficient. ""It's a no-nonsense relationship,"" Todd says. ""He's always trying to extract as much information as he's trying to give.""

""He thinks like a journalist,"" says Obama senior adviser David Axelrod, who marvels at his colleague making multiple calls and wolfing down lunch at the same time.

As chief of staff to the elder President Bush, James Baker was also masterful at working his media contacts, but usually from behind a curtain of anonymity. Many other predecessors, such as Andy Card, Mack McLarty and John Sununu, were less accessible to journalists.

Emanuel is regularly quoted in major newspapers, even in routine stories in which he is simply another administration voice. On Friday, The Post used Emanuel's remarks on the slow progress of health care reform in the 11th and 12th paragraphs of a news report; on June 7, he was quoted on the same subject in the eighth and ninth paragraphs of a Times story.

The allure is obvious: He is a colorful character who lends spice to most stories. And, some journalists say, Emanuel's accessibility serves to burnish his own reputation.

Emanuel's wife and three children are in the process of moving from Chicago, which might curtail his round-the-clock offensive, at least slightly.

Along with Axelrod, a onetime Chicago Tribune reporter, Emanuel has become a more prominent voice in print stories than press secretary Robert Gibbs, who focuses much of his energy on the daily briefing and whose on-the-record comments tend to be cautious. White House officials see Emanuel as an independent media center but are careful to coordinate strategy with him.",0,http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/22/AR2009062202913.html

189,Kurtz,Howard,washingtonpost,"Bill O'Reilly has signed up for another tour of duty at Fox News, saying that he decided ""to put myself through all the attacks and smears"" for several more years.

The pugnacious pundit said that he signed the contract despite what he sees as a constant assault on his reputation. ""I couldn't care less whether the establishment media respect me,"" he said yesterday in an interview. ""I feel they're corrupt. They, I'm sure, resent me feeling that way.""

Fox is expected to formally announce the four-year deal today, and the decision by O'Reilly -- who will be paid more than $10 million a year -- was not unexpected. After re-signing Sean Hannity and luring Glenn Beck from CNN's Headline News in the past two weeks, Fox has solidified a right-leaning lineup that has kept the channel's ratings well ahead of its rivals'.

""The O'Reilly Factor"" has been the top-rated program in cable news for nearly eight years, with the host's high-decibel commentary generating both loyal fans and fervent critics. The program has been averaging more than 4 million viewers nightly since last month -- an unheard-of figure in that corner of the cable world.

O'Reilly said he will probably give up his syndicated radio show, which has been far less successful than his television program. ""My duties at Fox are expanding,"" he said, adding: ""I just can't work 60 hours a week.""

Although O'Reilly, 59, openly disdains the mainstream media, they also provide him with a target that he delights in pummeling night after night. On Monday, for instance, he warned that ""fair-minded Americans might have something to fear if hard-core leftists gain control of the government in two weeks. They already control the [New York] Times, NBC News and other powerful media.""

Sen. Barack Obama recently told the New York Times Magazine that he would be two or three points higher in the polls were it not for Fox News, which, he said, portrays him as ""the latte-sipping, New York Times-reading, Volvo-driving, no-gun-owning, effete, politically correct, arrogant liberal.""

In a contentious interview with Obama last month, O'Reilly kept interrupting to challenge the Democratic nominee's tax plan, saying: ""You want 50 percent of my success. . . . That's class warfare."" But the Obama camp seemed pleased with the session, the first part of which aired on the night that John McCain gave his acceptance speech at the Republican convention.

Afterward, O'Reilly said, he told Obama that ""if you have a beef with Fox in the news coverage area, if you feel you're being treated unfairly, please call me directly."" He said that Obama's comments ""might be just to rev the base up.""

One Obama aide spoke with O'Reilly this week and expressed concern about Fox's heavy focus on the candidate's reported ties to onetime terrorist William Ayers and the organizing group ACORN, which has been accused of registering bogus voters in several states.

O'Reilly occasionally blows up on the air, whether at colleagues such as Geraldo Rivera or at politicians who enter the so-called No Spin Zone. This month, he repeatedly shouted at Rep. Barney Frank while arguing that the Massachusetts Democrat is partially responsible for the collapse of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and at one point demanded: ""Come on, you coward. Say the truth."" Frank shot back that the problem with going on the show was that ""you start ranting, and the only way to respond is almost to look as boorish as you.""

O'Reilly allowed yesterday that he might have gone too far, but he said he grew frustrated with Frank's answers. ""I could see how people could say it was over the line,"" O'Reilly said. He added that he hasn't had to pay for a meal since then because small-restaurant owners liked the assault on Frank so much that they keep treating him.

""Other people say I'm a barbarian,"" he admitted.

O'Reilly's outsize persona has become part of pop culture. His new memoir, ""A Bold Fresh Piece of Humanity,"" is No. 4 on the Times bestseller list, and O'Reilly said it could become the biggest of his five adult nonfiction books.

A video of an expletive-filled scolding of his staff when O'Reilly hosted ""Inside Edition"" has been viewed on YouTube more than 3.6 million times and has been set to rap music. O'Reilly contends that someone -- he would not say who -- was paid to leak the footage ""in an attempt to demean and diminish me. . . . It's a pretty nasty game.""

O'Reilly said that by early next year, he would probably give up his radio show, which is syndicated by Westwood One, but that he hopes to maintain a presence on radio -- perhaps by recording his ""talking points memo"" commentaries. ""The Radio Factor"" has had mixed ratings and was recently dropped in the Washington market.

Asked how long he would stay in the nightly cable wars, O'Reilly said: ""I'm not going to be Andy Rooney, much as I respect him. There comes a point where what you're doing isn't worth it anymore. I don't need any money.""",0,http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/21/AR2008102102522.html

191,Kurtz,Howard,washingtonpost,"The former editorial page editor of the Washington Times has filed a discrimination complaint against the paper, saying he was ""coerced"" into attending a Unification Church religious ceremony that culminated in a mass wedding conducted by the church's leader, the Rev. Sun Myung Moon.

Richard Miniter, who was also vice president of opinion, made the claim in a filing Tuesday with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that also disclosed he was fired last month. He said in an interview that he ""was made to feel there was no choice"" but to attend the ceremony if he wanted to keep his job, and that executives ""gave me examples of people whose careers at the Times had grown after they converted"" to the Unification Church. A Times spokesman said the paper would not comment.

Miniter, an Episcopalian who tried to avoid attending by saying he had to worship at his own church, said he found the religious weekend in New York last December to be ""creepy"" and that the Times had invited him to other such events. He said that Moon spoke for about an hour, that ceremonies were conducted in which water was poured from small urns into larger ones, and that Moon married 20 to 30 couples.

The Times paid for his travel, Miniter said, and he and other company executives, including church member Thomas P. McDevitt, then the Times' president and publisher, stayed at the church-owned New Yorker Hotel.

The Times, owned by Unification Church officials, has said since its 1982 founding that it is editorially independent of the church; numerous editors and reporters have said over the years that they encountered no interference from the ownership. Still, Miniter's complaint raises a sensitive issue for the newspaper.

The conservative commentator said he was ""stunned"" by the turn of events because no one at the Times gave him an explanation when he stopped receiving pay and benefits in September. ""Now I'm sad and angry,"" Miniter said. ""It's the strangest thing. . . . It was a chance to reinvent the most boring opinion section of any major paper. I thought it was a way to bring the paper more to the center and do good journalism.""

The Miniter filing follows a major shake-up at the Times. Three top executives, including McDevitt and chairman Dong Moon Joo, were ousted last week. Executive editor John Solomon, who like Miniter was hired by McDevitt, resigned and has offered no public explanation. The money-losing newspaper said it would assemble ""a market-based plan that supports the sustainability of the Washington Times.""

In the EEOC complaint, Miniter, 42, also charges the Times with discriminating against him on the basis of age and disability. He said Times executives expressed concern about the frequency of his medical appointments after a 10-day hospitalization for chest pains.

Miniter is a former Wall Street Journal editorial writer and author of such books as ""Disinformation: 22 Media Myths That Undermine the War on Terror."" He was hired as a Times consultant last October and tapped for the editorial page in March, and he remains on the masthead. Larry Klayman, Miniter's lawyer, said the Times is ""trading off his name. . . . but he's not being paid.""

Asked earlier this month about Miniter's lengthy absence, the Times issued a statement praising his ""insights and innovation"" and saying that the two sides ""are discussing his compensation.""

In May, the complaint says, Miniter refused to sign a ""fraudulent statement"" at the request of a Times vice president. As a result, the Times launched a ""background investigation"" and ""questioned everyone who worked for me"" but turned up nothing negative, the filing says. Miniter elaborated in an interview that the statement involved certifying his Arlington County address for a child of the vice president, who had moved to Maryland, so the child would be eligible to remain at an Arlington school.

The next month, Miniter alleges, the Times conducted a second investigation after he joked to his deputy about Moon's long, flowing garb in a church brochure. That probe was never concluded, Miniter said, and in July the company asked him to work from home. He said he was never given a reason for his termination.",0,http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/17/AR2009111703325.html

By Howard Kurtz

Sarah Palin, who regularly rips the media, is becoming a television pundit at a place where she's likely to feel at home.



A Fox News executive says the network will shortly announce that the former vice-presidential nominee is signing on as a contributor.



Palin, who resigned as governor of Alaska last summer, will appear as a commentator on various Fox shows. She will also host an occasional program that will examine inspirational tales involving ordinary Americans.



Palin will join Mike Huckabee as a Fox contributor who was also involved in the 2008 campaign. The exposure can only help Palin if she decides to pursue a 2012 presidential bid.



At the moment, Palin makes pronouncements mainly through her Facebook page. The Fox connection would give her a platform on the nation's top-rated cable news channel.



Palin is extremely popular with her conservative base, which has fueled the sales of her best-selling memoir. But she is a divisive political figure who not only draws the ire of liberals but some Republicans, including staffers who deal with her during her run as John McCain's running mate. Steve Schmidt, a top McCain strategist, said on ""60 Minutes"" last night that ""there were numerous instances that she said things that were -- that were not accurate that ultimately, the campaign had to deal with.""



Hiring Palin could further boost the popularity of Rupert Murdoch's network among conservative viewers. The network already employs former Bush White House aide Karl Rove and former House speaker Newt Gingrich as highly visible commentators.",0,http://voices.washingtonpost.com/44/2010/01/palin-signs-on-with-fox-news.html
194,Kurtz,Howard,washingtonpost,"President Obama declined to call on any reporters from the nation's top newspapers during last night's news conference but still faced far more aggressive questioning than in his first prime-time encounter with the media.

Breaking with tradition and using a prepared list, Obama did not recognize journalists with The Washington Post, the New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, the Chicago Tribune, the Wall Street Journal or USA Today -- the last four of which were not picked at last month's news conference, either. Instead, he called on reporters for Ebony magazine, Stars and Stripes, Univision, and Agence France-Presse.

The president did stick to the usual rotation in recognizing correspondents from ABC, CBS and NBC, along with CNN and Fox News. He also took questions from the Washington Times and Politico. The result was a nearly hour-long session focused almost entirely on domestic policy.

Obama made clear during the transition that he did not plan to follow the usual journalistic pecking order. As president, he has broken with precedent by having his press office notify correspondents that they will be called on at upcoming news conferences. The more unorthodox approach was highlighted at his first evening session, when he took a question from a correspondent for the Huffington Post, a liberal Web magazine.

Obama's selection process last night did not result in softball inquiries. Ebony's Kevin Chappell cited a report that one in 50 children in the United States is homeless and asked what Obama would say to their families. Kevin Baron of Stars and Stripes, a military newspaper, asked how the president would trim the Pentagon and Department of Veterans Affairs budgets ""when so many items that seem destined for the chopping block are politically untenable, perhaps.""

The ailing economy dominated the session, to no one's surprise, and only two questions were focused solely on foreign affairs. The Univision reporter asked whether violence in Mexico spilling into the United States should be considered a national security threat, and the Agence France-Presse reporter asked about the Middle East peace process.

The president was not asked about either of the nation's wars, despite his recent announcement that he is sending 17,000 additional troops to Afghanistan and plans to withdraw most U.S. combat forces from Iraq by the summer of 2010. Those subjects, and the battle against terrorism, often dominated President George W. Bush's face-offs with the media. But that probably reflected the degree to which the economy and the banking crisis have dominated the news in recent months, rather than the selection of the journalists.

Virtually every correspondent was granted a follow-up question, which was often more sharply worded than the first. Obama now has a budget to defend and has faced rising criticism for his handling of the banking bailout, giving journalists more specific targets for their queries.

Jennifer Loven of the Associated Press, the wire service that traditionally gets to pose the opening question, cited the administration's plan to seek authority over non-banking financial institutions and asked, ""Why should the public trust the government to handle that authority well?"" NBC's Chuck Todd said that ""some of your programs, whether for Main Street or Wall Street, have actually cushioned the blow for those that were irresponsible."" CBS's Chip Reid said that ""some Republicans called your budget, with all the spending on health care, education and environment, the most irresponsible budget in American history."" CNN's Ed Henry asked Obama whether he worried ""that your daughters, not to mention the next president, will be inheriting an even bigger fiscal mess if the spending goes out of control.""

Perhaps the sharpest exchange followed Henry's second question, when he pressed Obama on why it took days for him to publicly express outrage over the $165 million in bonuses granted to employees of American International Group.

""It took us a couple of days because I like to know what I'm talking about before I speak,"" the president shot back.

Jon Ward of the Washington Times, whose conservative editorial page has consistently criticized Obama, asked about the president's decision to allow federal funding of embryonic stem cell research, a subject that quickly faded from the mainstream media despite years of divisive debate. Ward asked ""how much you personally wrestled with the morality or ethics of federally funding this kind of research."" The president said it had been a difficult decision.

Fox's Major Garrett asked whether Obama, who as a candidate expressed concern about the nation's global image, was comfortable with objections to his economic policies by the Chinese government, ""run by communists,"" and European governments, ""some of them socialist.""

Despite casting a wider net at news conferences and appearing last week on ESPN and ""The Tonight Show With Jay Leno,"" Obama can hardly be accused of bypassing traditional news organizations. He has granted interviews to the network anchors, the New York Times, the Washington Post editorial board, groups of columnists and regional reporters, and black and Hispanic journalists. On Friday, he spent 90 minutes with Steve Kroft of ""60 Minutes.""",0,http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/24/AR2009032403926.html

198,Kurtz,Howard,washingtonpost,"Helen Thomas ended a storied career at the White House dating from the Kennedy era on Monday, days after making inflammatory remarks on Israel to a rabbi with a video camera.

""Frankly, I was shocked,"" said Rabbi David Nesenoff, who was at the White House for a Jewish heritage celebration on May 27 and simply asked the Hearst Newspapers columnist, ""Any comments on Israel?"" Her response -- that Israeli Jews should ""get the hell out of Palestine"" and ""go home"" to Germany, Poland and America -- triggered a wave of denunciations that a narrowly worded apology did little to quell.

""This was vile, a paradigm of hate talk,"" said Nesenoff, who was accompanied by his 17-year-old son and a friend. ""She felt comfortable saying this in front of two boys with yarmulkes on.""

While the 89-year-old Thomas is renowned as a trailblazer who aggressively questioned 10 presidents -- including President Obama, whom she pressed last month on Afghanistan -- her hostility toward Israel has been no secret within the Beltway. Though she gave up her correspondent's job a decade ago, she retained her front-row briefing-room seat, even as colleagues sometimes rolled their eyes at her obvious biases.

""She asked questions no hard-news reporter would ask, that carried an agenda and reflected her point of view, and there were some reporters who felt that was inappropriate,"" said CBS correspondent Mark Knoller. ""As a columnist she felt totally unbound from any of the normal policies of objectivity that every other reporter in the room felt compelled to abide by, and sometimes her questions were embarrassing to other reporters.""

But few called her out for such conduct -- until Nesenoff, who heads a Long Island synagogue, posted the video on his site RabbiLIVE.com. Commentators on the right and left quickly eviscerated Thomas.

""She's always said crazy stuff,"" said National Review Online columnist Jonah Goldberg. ""One reason she gets a pass is that there's an entrenched system of deference to seniority in the White House press corps. . . . This newfound horror and dismay that people are expressing about Helen Thomas are beyond a day late and a dollar short.""

Jeffrey Goldberg, an Atlantic reporter who specializes in the Middle East, said: ""Helen Thomas offered the official Hamas position, as far as I can tell. There's a level of insensitivity that's almost comical in what she said, to tell Jews to go back to Germany, where things worked out so well for them.""

Thomas told a Washington Post reporter Friday night that she was ""very sorry"" and had ""made a mistake,"" but did not address the substance of her comments. By Monday morning -- after her agent had dropped her, Hearst expressed deep regret over her remarks and White House press secretary Robert Gibbs called them ""offensive and reprehensible"" -- she decided to call it quits. Thomas, the daughter of Lebanese immigrants, said in a statement that her comments ""do not reflect my heartfelt belief that peace will come to the Middle East only when all parties recognize the need for mutual respect and tolerance.""

She is the most famous woman ever to cover 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. and served as the first female president of the White House Correspondents' Association, which on Monday called her comments ""indefensible."" Thomas has written several books about the White House and played herself in the movies ""Dave"" (1993) and ""The American President"" (1995).

In 2000, when Thomas resigned from United Press International after it was bought by News World Communications, a company controlled by officials of the Unification Church, Dan Rather called her ""a hero of journalism.""

During George W. Bush's administration, Thomas became an icon for some liberals who applauded her outspoken opposition to the Iraq invasion and cast her as tougher than the reporters who failed to skeptically question the march to war. Ari Fleischer, who was Bush's first press secretary, led the campaign for her ouster over the weekend, e-mailing journalists who might have missed her remarks.

""It's a tragic ending, but she did the right thing by announcing her resignation,"" Fleischer said Monday. He was joined in the effort by former Clinton White House aide Lanny Davis.

In 2002, Thomas asked Fleischer: ""Does the president think that the Palestinians have a right to resist 35 years of brutal military occupation and suppression?""

Four years later, Thomas told Fleischer's successor, Tony Snow, that the United States ""could have stopped the bombardment of Lebanon"" by Israel, but instead had ""gone for collective punishment against all of Lebanon and Palestine."" Snow tartly thanked her for ""the Hezbollah view.""

Mark Rabin, a former freelance cameraman for CNN, said that in a 2002 conversation at the White House, Thomas said ""thank God for Hezbollah"" for driving Israel out of Lebanon, adding that ""Israel is the cause for 99 percent of all this terrorism.""

The Daily Caller Web site noted that during a 2004 speech to the Al-Hewar Center, a Washington-based Arab organization, Thomas likened Palestinian protesters resisting the ""tyrannical occupation"" by Israel to ""those who resisted the Nazi occupation.""

A handful of journalists questioned her role over the years. In a 2006 New Republic piece, Jonathan Chait accused Thomas of ""unhinged rants,"" noting that she had asked such questions as: ""Why are we killing people in Iraq? Men, women, and children are being killed there. . . . It's outrageous.""

At Bethesda's Walt Whitman High School, where Thomas agreed to withdraw Sunday as a speaker at graduation, one student had created a Facebook page objecting to the choice. After the cancellation, other students started a group, which drew nearly 100 fans, titled ""Helen Thomas should have been our graduation speaker."" One of the creators of that group, Andrew Beehler, said that ""the vast majority of the school"" was in favor of the Thomas appearance, but that school leaders sided with a small group of vocal parents and students who threatened to protest at graduation.

The rabbi who triggered the controversy was deluged with e-mail and interview requests. After being told Monday that Thomas had retired, Nesenoff urged her to engage in a broader discussion about the Middle East. ""She can't retire from the human race,"" he said. ""May she live for many years, and use that time to make this moment an important moment."" (The rabbi explained the delay in posting the May 27 video this way: ""My son had finals, and he is my Webmaster."")

Sam Donaldson, a former White House correspondent for ABC, said Thomas was a ""pioneer"" for women, ""and no one can take that away from Helen."" While not defending her comments on Israel, he said they likely reflect the view of many people of Arab descent.

Donaldson, 76, who retired last year, was asked whether his friend, who started on the beat in 1960, had stayed too long.

""Her life was her work,"" Donaldson said. ""She didn't have other interests. The thought that she'd give it up never entered her mind.""

199,Kurtz,Howard,thedailybeast,"In the early 1970s, the most trusted man in America did a very untrustworthy thing.

Unbeknownst to the millions who tuned in religiously to the CBS Evening News, Walter Cronkite cut a deal with Pan Am to fly his family to vacation spots around the world. Together with a handful of friends, they roamed from the South Pacific to Haiti, with Cronkite snorkeling, swimming, and drinking, thanks to a friend at the airline. According to Douglas Brinkley’s sweeping and masterful biography Cronkite, the news division president, Dick Salant, was upset at what he deemed a blatant conflict of interest, but took no action against his star anchor.

This was not the Cronkite I grew up admiring from the time I watched his image flickering on a small black-and-white set, the voice of authority in an age when we still revered, without a trace of cynicism, those who spoon-fed us the news.

I got to know Cronkite after his anchoring days as a charming, hard-of-hearing, slightly stodgy spokesman for old-fashioned news values against the encroachment of tabloid entertainment. There was a certain sadness about him, an old warrior who sorely missed being in the trenches. He was a creature of a simpler time, telling me in 2002 that the network newscasts should be all headlines and no features, seemingly ignoring the rhythms of the Internet age.

In reading this first major biography of Cronkite, I came to realize that the man who once dominated television journalism was more complicated—and occasionally more unethical—than the legend that surrounds him. Had Cronkite engaged in some of the same questionable conduct today—he secretly bugged a committee room at the 1952 GOP convention—he would have been bashed by the blogs, pilloried by the pundits, and quite possibly ousted by his employer. That he endured and prospered, essentially unscathed, until his death in 2009 reminded me of how impervious the monopoly media were in those days, largely shielded from the scrutiny they inflicted on everyone else.

“Nobody wanted to go after Walter Cronkite,” Brinkley says. Within CBS “he became a force of nature. He could almost dictate anything he wanted. He was the franchise.”

The book, written with the cooperation of Cronkite and his family, recounts the remarkable career for which he is justly revered: the forging of a no-nonsense newscast that began as a mere 15 minutes; the tireless (bordering on worshipful) chronicling of the space program; the dogged reporting in Vietnam that helped turn the country against the war; the lengthy segments on Watergate that elevated the scandal to a national obsession. Cronkite was a rigorous newsman, trained at the venerable United Press and blessed with the ability to expound extemporaneously on television.

But he was far more liberal than the public believed, and he let it show in unacceptable ways. Had Cronkite pulled such stunts today, I would probably be among those calling for him to step down.

Barry Goldwater distrusted him from the start, and with good reason. On the day of John F. Kennedy’s assassination, Cronkite nodded his head in thinly veiled contempt when handed a note on air that the Arizona senator had said “no comment.” Goldwater was attending his mother-in-law’s funeral that day.

“Whether or not Senator Goldwater wins the nomination,” Cronkite told viewers another day, “he is going places, the first place being Germany.” Although Goldwater had merely accepted an invitation to visit a U.S. Army facility there, correspondent Daniel Schorr said he was launching his campaign in “the center of Germany’s right wing.” During Goldwater’s speech at the 1964 convention, some conservatives fed up with the networks gave Cronkite the finger.

Four years later, after Cronkite had belatedly turned against LBJ’s Vietnam War, he met privately with Robert Kennedy. “You must announce your intention to run against Johnson, to show people there will be a way out of this terrible war,” he said in Kennedy’s Senate office. Soon afterward, Cronkite got an exclusive interview in which Kennedy left the door open for a possible run—the very candidacy that the anchor had urged him to undertake. (Kennedy announced three days later.) I am shaking my head at the spectacle of a network anchor secretly urging a politician to mount a White House campaign—and then interviewing him about that very question. This was duplicitous, a major breach of trust.

Once Richard Nixon took office, his unscrupulous aide Chuck Colson launched an investigation of Cronkite’s record in hopes of exposing him as a Kennedy liberal. And he struck pay dirt in examining Cronkite’s CBS radio broadcasts, where the anchor was far more opinionated and regularly dished what Brinkley calls “over-the-top commentary full of pro-Democratic partisanship.” Cronkite asked, for example, why more Americans weren’t livid with the administration for covering up the My Lai massacre.

“I thought that some day the roof was going to fall in ... I don’t know why to this day I got away with it,” Cronkite is quoted as saying years later. But he often gave himself deniability with linguistic hedging. Cronkite once told me his liberalism “affected how I looked at the world” but not his reporting.

Cronkite denied charges that CBS brass ordered newscasters to “go soft on Nixon.” (CBS Photo Archive-Getty Images)

Cronkite’s public persona was that of a pipe-puffing family man. But after covering Nixon’s historic visit to China, he let loose with a night of partying in San Francisco. Cronkite and a colleague went to an infamous topless bar, and he was later spotted dining with a go-go dancer in a miniskirt and plunging neckline. Cronkite drew a bit of tabloid attention for his exploits; I can only imagine what TMZ would have done with the inevitable paparazzi shots.

There were more serious infractions as well. In what would likely be deemed a firing offense today, Cronkite blatantly manipulated an interview with LBJ shortly before Johnson died. According to Brinkley, his producer spliced the footage in unflattering ways, reshooting Cronkite asking the questions so it appeared that he was nodding or raising his eyebrows in disgust when Johnson talked about Vietnam. LBJ saw a rough cut and pronounced it “dirty pool”; I would call it a video version of lying. Under pressure from the former president’s team, CBS undid the misleading editing, so the public never learned of the deception.

It turns out that the most trusted man didn’t always tell the truth. In 1974 Cronkite got into a spat with the rebellious Schorr, flatly denying the charge that CBS executives had ordered the evening news to “go soft on Nixon” as the president was resigning. But Cronkite’s denial was misleading. As Salant later acknowledged, “we in CBS management ... telephoned the correspondents who would be covering the story that night to remind them that it was not a time, no matter how any of them felt ... for gloating remarks or for editorial attacks.” So Cronkite’s outrage was bogus.

If his reputation as the nation’s top-rated anchor was unassailable, that may be because he guarded it so fiercely. Back in 1962, he had agreed to narrate a Pentagon propaganda film called The Eagle’s Talon, warning that “an aggressive Communist tide has spread in Europe and Asia to engulf its neighbors” and that China “has plans to dominate Asia by mass murder.” As Brinkley writes, “There he was, a civilian broadcaster, dressed in the full uniform of a U.S. Marine colonel, narrating gobbledy-gook about the ‘Red Threat.’”

A decade later, Cronkite learned that his embarrassing role was going to be highlighted in a Roger Mudd documentary for CBS, The Selling of the Pentagon. He complained bitterly, demanding that the section about him be removed. But Salant, the news chief, refused, and he was right: the network would have been denounced as hypocritical for protecting one of its own.

Looking back, Cronkite’s virtual immunity as a public figure is troubling. But I see an upside as well: he wielded his enormous clout on behalf of muscular journalism. As Vietnam and Watergate eroded public confidence in government, Cronkite emerged as a new kind of authority figure, his public image unsullied by the grime of politics. What a stunning contrast to the corrosive distrust of the news business today.

As everyone from presidents to astronauts catered to him, Cronkite used that access to drive unflinching coverage of civil rights, corruption, and especially the morass of Vietnam—when his own reporting led him to declare that ill-fated conflict a stalemate. When LBJ said that “if I’ve lost Cronkite, I’ve lost the country,” he was acknowledging that a single newsman had the power to change a national narrative. Cronkite hadn’t gone further than many other commentators, but he alone had the standing to move public opinion.

That aura made him a player on the world stage. When Cronkite prodded Anwar Sadat into saying he was willing to visit Israel and Menachem Begin into saying he would welcome the Egyptian leader, he emerged as a Middle East power broker. When Cronkite asked Gerald Ford at the 1980 Republican convention whether there would be a “co-presidency” if he agreed to be Ronald Reagan’s running mate, Ford’s failure to challenge the characterization blew up any chance at a joint ticket. Cronkite even floated a trial balloon that year that he might run as independent candidate John Anderson’s running mate.

But at times his emboldened sense of importance made him a conduit for the establishment. I remember watching him with the newly elected Jimmy Carter near an Oval Office fireplace, serving as master of ceremonies as he fielded radio calls. It was very cozy; all that was missing were hard-hitting questions.

Cronkite came to regret handing the anchor reins to Dan Rather in 1981. “Rather and company shut me out from doing anything,” he complained. I remember listening to him rail against Rather in his Upper East Side apartment, his anger still palpable after so many years.

On the day that CBS chairman Les Moonves fired several people over Rather’s botched story on George W. Bush and the National Guard—having already deposed Rather as anchor—Cronkite barged into Moonves’s office and congratulated him on doing the right thing. Moonves was able to sleep that night, he recalled, because “Walter said it was OK.”

Cronkite, of course, had been ruthless when he needed to be. But unlike Rather, who was frequently savaged by an army of critics and bloggers, Cronkite was an unassailable icon, America’s Uncle Walter, his occasional misconduct and bouts of bias shielded from public view.

Brinkley’s book will undoubtedly tarnish the Cronkite legacy. But my admiration for the man is only partly diminished. Perhaps it is too easy to judge him by today’s standards, any more than we should condemn Thomas Jefferson for owning slaves. Perhaps he simply reflected his times, when some journalists and politicians quietly collaborated, when conflicts of interest were routinely tolerated, when a powerful media establishment could sweep its embarrassments under the rug. Cronkite thrived as television came of age, always protecting what we would now call his brand. That’s just the way it was.

Fade To black.

Cronkite retired with his reptutation intact, but some other TV journalists were not so lucky.

207,Kurtz,Howard,washingtonpost,"DES MOINES, Dec. 18 -- After weeks of bad news, Hillary Clinton and her strategists hoped that winning the endorsement of Iowa's largest newspaper last weekend might produce a modest bump in their media coverage.

But on Sunday morning, they awoke to upbeat headlines about their chief Democratic rival: ""Obama Showing New Confidence With Iowa Sprint,"" said the New York Times. ""Obama Is Hitting His Stride in Iowa,"" said the Los Angeles Times. And on Monday, Clinton aides were so upset about a contentious ""Today"" show interview that one complained to the show's producer.

Clinton's senior advisers have grown convinced that the media deck is stacked against them, that their candidate is drawing far harsher scrutiny than Barack Obama. And at least some journalists agree.

""She's just held to a different standard in every respect,"" says Mark Halperin, Time's editor at large. ""The press rooted for Obama to go negative, and when he did he was applauded. When she does it, it's treated as this huge violation of propriety."" While Clinton's mistakes deserve full coverage, Halperin says, ""the press's flaws -- wild swings, accentuating the negative -- are magnified 50 times when it comes to her. It's not a level playing field.""

Newsweek's Howard Fineman says Obama's coverage is the buzz of the presidential campaign. ""While they don't say so publicly because it's risky to complain, a lot of operatives from other campaigns say he's getting a free ride, that people aren't tough enough on Obama,"" Fineman says. ""There may be something to that. He's the new guy, an interesting guy, a pathbreaker and trendsetter perhaps.""

Obama spokesman Bill Burton says the accusation of softer treatment is untrue but ""the Clinton campaign whines about it so much, it becomes part of the chatter. No candidate in this race has undergone more investigations and examinations than Barack Obama has,"" he says, citing lengthy pieces in the Chicago Tribune and New York Times. ""As Obama says, running against the Clintons is not exactly a cakewalk. Their research operation has ensured that if there's any information about Obama to be had, it's been distributed to the media.""

The question, of course, is what journalists do with that information.

Asked for comment about the coverage of Clinton, her spokesman, Jay Carson, says: ""I'll just say that at the Clinton campaign, we do our best to live by the old adage that it's not wise to pick fights with people who buy ink by the barrel.""

For nearly a year, the New York senator was widely depicted as the inevitable nominee. But now many media accounts are casting her recent dip in the Iowa and New Hampshire polls as a disaster in the making.

""Slipping Away?"" said a headline on ABC's ""Good Morning America."" ""Hillary Clinton's campaign is teetering on the brink,"" Fineman wrote in Newsweek. CBS's Jim Axelrod said her operation is ""reeling."" The Los Angeles Times said she is facing her ""most serious crisis."" And a banner headline on the Drudge Report asked: ""Is It the End?""

When Clinton's New Hampshire co-chairman resigned last week after raising the issue of Obama's adolescent drug use, the issue itself received scant treatment in the media because Obama had disclosed it in his 1995 autobiography. ""He has been able, by luck or planning, to control his own story, because he wrote it first,"" Fineman says.

The Illinois senator's fundraising receives far less press attention than Clinton's. When The Washington Post reported last month that Obama used a political action committee to hand more than $180,000 to Democratic groups and candidates in the early-voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, the suggestion that he might be buying support received no attention on the network newscasts. The Clinton team is convinced that would have been a bigger story had it involved the former first lady.",0,http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/18/AR2007121802184.html

209,Kurtz,Howard,washingtonpost,"Colorado's oldest newspaper, the Rocky Mountain News, is shutting down today, and industry analysts say it won't be the last to be pulled under by a rising tide of financial woes.

E.W. Scripps announced yesterday that it is closing the 150-year-old Rocky, which has won four Pulitzer Prizes in the last decade, leaving Denver, like most American cities, a one-newspaper town.

These are dark days for the struggling news business. Hearst threatened this week to close the San Francisco Chronicle unless major budget cuts are imposed or a buyer is found, and is also prepared to close the Seattle Post-Intelligencer if it cannot be sold. The Philadelphia Inquirer and Daily News filed for bankruptcy protection this week, joining Chicago's Tribune Co. and the Minneapolis Star-Tribune in Chapter 11 status.

Industry analyst John Morton called the Rocky's failure to find a buyer unsurprising. ""The market is awash in newspapers for sale, and nobody is buying them,"" he said. ""This recession has so impacted advertising revenue, particularly classifieds, that it's driven into unprofitability those who are in a precarious position.""

Scripps said in a statement that the tabloid became ""a victim of changing times in our industry and huge economic challenges. The Rocky is one of America's very best examples of what local news organizations need to be in the future. Unfortunately, the partnership's business model is locked in the past.""

That model is a joint operating agreement, an eight-year-old arrangement blessed by the Justice Department, in which the Rocky has shared business and production costs with the rival Denver Post. Each has a daily circulation of 210,000. Scripps said in December that it would try to unload the Rocky.

As grim-faced staffers looked on yesterday, Editor John Temple introduced two Scripps executives, who said that Denver could no longer support two newspapers. They said there was only one potential buyer, who backed out.

""This is a really sad end to a beautiful thing,"" Temple told his staff, adding that the final edition was like ""being given the chance to play the music at your own funeral.""

In an online blog, the paper reported: ""The mood in the room is getting nastier and bitter, reporters wondering if the execs tried hard enough to save the paper or put pressure on the Rocky Mountain News.""

On Twitter, one staffer wrote: ""In news meeting, puffy-eyed Managing Editor is handing out assignments.""

Readers posted reactions on the Rocky's Web site: ""This is such a sad day."" ""It will leave a huge unfillable void in the Denver and Rocky Mountain region."" ""Bye old friend.""

M.E. Sprengelmeyer, who lost his job as Scripps's Washington correspondent for the Rocky, said the paper ""really was a scrappy little place. It had a little more bulldog in it than terrier. It's a place where you could pitch the wacky stuff,"" as he did by moving to Iowa for a year before last year's presidential caucuses.

The Denver Post, which reached an agreement with local unions this week to cut costs by 11.7 percent, is owned by William Dean Singleton's MediaNews Group. Singleton said in a statement that ""the Rocky will forever be remembered for its vital role in the city's history and the city's success. Although we competed intensely, the talented staff of the Rocky earned our respect with each morning's edition."" The Post said it will hire a number of Rocky reporters, columnists and editors, but this amounts to less than 5 percent of the paper's 200-person newsroom.",0,http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/26/AR2009022602108.html

Friday, October 29, 2004; Page C01

Bill O'Reilly settled a sexual harassment lawsuit by his former producer last night, ending what he called a ""brutal ordeal"" without an apology.

The Fox News talk show host also agreed to drop his extortion suit against Andrea Mackris and her attorney, Benedict Morelli, according to a statement by O'Reilly's lawyer. The deal likely involves payment of millions of dollars to Mackris, since the two sides were discussing an offer of well over $2 million when negotiations broke down, say sources close to O'Reilly. Both parties agreed to keep the details confidential, according to the statement.

O'Reilly told viewers, in language cleared by the lawyers, that there was ""no wrongdoing in the case whatsoever by anyone"" -- and appeared to dispute, without specifically doing so, some of the lurid details of what Mackris alleged were phone-sex conversations between them. ""Please do not believe everything you hear and read,"" he said on ""The O'Reilly Factor.""

The top-rated cable news host has said he was humiliated by the suit, which charged that he spoke to Mackris about sexual fantasies, masturbation and vibrators while sometimes seeming to pleasure himself. But for O'Reilly to strike a settlement without an expression of regret, which is often demanded in litigation against high-profile figures, is a partial victory that spares him further embarrassment.

Morelli did not respond to requests for comment last night.

Describing himself as an ""object of media scorn,"" O'Reilly told viewers: ""On a personal note, this matter has caused enormous pain, but I had to protect my family and I did. Some of the media hammered me relentlessly because, as you know, I am a huge target, as is Fox News. . . .

""The good news is that 'Factor' viewers and listeners seem to have given me the benefit of any doubt when some in the media did not. You guys looked out for me and I will never forget it. This brutal ordeal is now officially over, and I will never speak of it again.""

O'Reilly told The Washington Post two weeks ago that the day the suit was filed was ""the worst day of my life.""

Morelli had earlier predicted that O'Reilly was ""not going to get away with it"" and was ""going down."" He and his client, who also named Fox News as a defendant, did not dispute an accusation by O'Reilly that they had initially demanded $60 million to settle without going to court.

Much of the criticism of O'Reilly, 55, has centered on his role as a moralist who has lectured about too much sex in pop culture and has just published a children's book in which he warns boys against treating girls abusively. But he has had little to say on the subject since Mackris, 33, who is still employed by Fox, went public with her charges. O'Reilly even canceled several scheduled television interviews.

Fox believed Mackris had tape recordings of the long, highly detailed conversations alleged in the suit, but Morelli never confirmed that, saying only that they had concrete evidence. O'Reilly and his attorney, Ronald Green, never denied that the Fox commentator had used such language, but said he never broke the law and questioned whether Mackris was truly offended or was taking words and phrases out of context.

Questions swirled around Mackris's conduct as well, including why she didn't hang up on O'Reilly, why she never complained to Fox authorities and why she returned to work for him earlier this year after spending a few months at CNN. ""I was put in a position with a man that, whenever he would call me at work or at home, work-related, he would say jump and I'd say how high and I would jump,"" Mackris told CNN earlier this month. ""I'm not used to saying no to this man on any level. I had said no to him and no to him and no to him and no to him and no to him and no to him about his saucy language. . . . He had threatened that anybody who ever would speak of it would be raked through the mud. . . . I was absolutely threatened.""

Mackris has also drawn her share of negative coverage. The New York Post, which is owned by the same parent company as Fox, ran the headline "" 'Lunatic' O'Reilly Gal Went Nuts in Bar."" But she kept up the public pressure, telling the New York Daily News that her father wanted to challenge O'Reilly to a duel.",0,http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A7578-2004Oct28.html

212,Kurtz,Howard,washingtonpost,"A group of political strategists who have spent years firing heavy artillery at each other came together at the Hay-Adams Hotel yesterday, put aside their weapons, decried the polarized state of debate in America and vowed a new approach to peaceful coexistence.

Toward that end, they are launching a Web site that they hope will eventually reach 30 million opinion leaders, elevate public discussion on matters from politics to sports to culture and, in the process, make them some money.

Mark McKinnon and Matthew Dowd, who were senior advisers in President Bush's last two campaigns, are joining forces with Joe Lockhart, who served as a spokesman for President Bill Clinton, and Carter Eskew, a top strategist in Al Gore's presidential campaign, in creating what they have dubbed HotSoup.com.

""There is nobody who knows how broken the system is more than us. . . . Everyone in the room could say they contributed to the polarization,"" Lockhart said.

""The perceived polarization that exists in this country today is not a good thing,"" said Dowd, adding that people are tired of watching ""food fight"" debates on television.

But HotSoup -- a name chosen to evoke a tasteful mixing of ingredients -- faces a substantial challenge in a cluttered online marketplace. The most popular political Web sites and blogs are fiercely partisan on both the left and the right, which is precisely what attracts their fans. McKinnon, Lockhart and their partners, who are investing their own money while seeking outside financing, say they will be a regular presence on the site but will not be exchanging partisan blows.

They have hired Ron Fournier, former chief political writer for the Associated Press, as editor in chief. A key consultant is Allie Savarino, an Internet advertising specialist and president of Sisterwoman.com.

Speaking with a group of skeptical reporters, the partners struggled to describe just what the site -- its debut is planned for October -- will be and how it will reach the target audience.

Dowd described the 10 percent of the public he terms ""opinion drivers"" as people teaching Bible class, coaching Little League or volunteering in soup kitchens -- and very interested in news. ""We have a technology that can bring people back together in a town-hall format,"" he said.

At times, the strategists sounded as though they were doing penance for their roles in the 30-second attack ads and sound-bite skewering that have become staples in modern political campaigns. But they are not giving up their livelihood. McKinnon continues to represent political and corporate clients at Public Strategies. Dowd has his own consulting firm, and Lockhart, Eskew and two other HotSoup partners -- Michael Feldman and Chip Smith -- do the same at the Glover Park Group.

They envision a high-toned conversation on the site, buttressed by plenty of video and interactive message boards. But they had no ready answer for how to prevent the online debate from turning shrill and partisan. Savarino said users will be able to rank the quality of the postings, much like customer ratings on Amazon.com.

""The community will decide what issues are relevant,"" Lockhart said. ""We didn't want this to be seen as a tug of war between left and right.""

The partners say that they want to avoid an inside-the-Beltway focus and that some of those featured on HotSoup will be local community leaders. But they were not clear on how they would find these local folks, especially since participants will not be paid. What the venture hopes to emulate is the social networking appeal of such sites as MySpace.com, in part by including discussions of books and perhaps movies.

Attempts at building nonpartisan issue sites online have not been a smashing success. In 2000, former Clinton White House spokesman Mike McCurry teamed with such advisers as John H. Sununu, a chief of staff for President George H.W. Bush, and Tony Blankley, former spokesman for Newt Gingrich, in starting Grassroots.com. Today it is a low-profile site that works with a wide range of interest groups.

Dick Morris, a political consultant turned Fox News commentator, has a site called Vote.com on which users cast electronic ballots on various issues. It seems to draw mainly conservatives, such as the 89 percent who disagreed with the Supreme Court ruling that Bush overstepped his authority in ordering military tribunals for terrorism suspects.

Fournier, who just finished a book on the changing nature of public communication with Dowd and former Clinton aide Doug Sosnik, said the decline in trust of elite institutions gives HotSoup an opening.

213,Kurtz,Howard,cnn,"Story highlights Al Gore sold Current to al Jazeera and could net an estimated $70 million Howard Kurtz: Gore's Current network failed to gain an identity or viewers He says it's odd that the former vice president is selling to an oil-rich potentate Kurtz: Al Jazeera may have a tough time getting traction with U.S. viewers

Editor’s Note: Howard Kurtz is the host of CNN’s “Reliable Sources” and is Newsweek’s Washington bureau chief. He is also a contributor to the website Daily Download.

(CNN) —

So Al Gore starts a liberal cable network, which turns into a complete and utter flop, then sells it to a Middle East potentate in a deal that will bring him an estimated $70 million.

Is America a great country or what?

There is something highly unusual – OK, just plain weird – about a former vice president of the United States doing this deal with the emir of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani.

CNN Howard Kurtz

Al Jazeera, owned by said emir’s government, is trying to buy its way into the American television market by purchasing Current TV for a half billion dollars. The only thing stranger would be if Gore had sold Current to Glenn Beck – oh wait, Beck did try to buy it and was told no way within 15 minutes.

So the sale was in part about ideology, which opens the door to examining why Gore believes Al Jazeera gives “voice to those who are not typically heard” and speaks “truth to power.”

Bill O’Reilly, on Fox News, calls the network “anti-American.” Fox pundit Dick Morris says Gore has sold to a fount of “anti-Israel propaganda.” Such labels are rooted in the network’s role during the height of the war on terror, when it aired smuggled videos of Osama bin Laden and was denounced by Bush administration officials.

But Al Jazeera English, the spinoff channel launched in 2006, doesn’t have the same reputation. In fact, no less a figure than Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has praised it as “real news,” and the channel has won journalism awards for its reporting on the Arab Spring and other global events.

To be sure, the main Al Jazeera network gives a platform to such figures as Yusuf al-Qaradawi. He’s the Muslim cleric in Egypt who, The Washington Post gas reported, frequently appears on air to castigate Jews and America and has praised suicide bombings. But when I went to the home page of Al Jazeera English the other day, there was video of David Frost, the acclaimed British journalist who now works for the main network, interviewing Israeli President Shimon Peres.

That’s not to say Al Jazeera America, the working name for the new channel, won’t have its own biases. Al Jazeera English is sometimes determined to paint the U.S. in a negative light.

During a report on President Barack Obama signing a renewal of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which entails a legitimate controversy over civil liberties, the reporter said flatly that the law “violate(s) U.S. constitutional rights in the name of national security.”

Watch: Can Al Jazeera make it in the American market?

Dave Marash, the ABC News veteran who once worked for Al Jazeera English, told me the network has a “post-colonial” view of America and its stories can be infused with that attitude.

And there are real questions about how independent these channels are from the Qatar government that helps bankroll them. The director-general of Al Jazeera, Sheikh Ahmed bin Jassim al-Thani, is a member of the country’s royal family and has no background in journalism.

Such details add to the odd spectacle of the ex-veep, who would have been running Mideast policy had he won a few more votes in Florida, selling – and some say selling out – to the emir. Not to mention that the crusader against climate change is taking petrodollars from an empire built on oil, the bete noire of environmentalists.

Watch: Hey Fox, Hillary Clinton was sick after all

But what is Al Jazeera buying? The network is going to have a tough time cracking the American market.

Its earlier reputation makes the company highly controversial, and other cable carriers might follow the lead of Time Warner Cable (which is no longer owned by CNN’s parent company, Time Warner) in refusing to carry it. These carriers agreed to air Current TV, after all, and contracts generally require them to approve a major change in programming.

Global politics aside, it may just be bad business. There’s a reason Al Jazeera English, which will supply 40% of the content to the new channel, has barely gotten a foothold in the United States. Most Americans aren’t lusting for a steady diet of international news.

Watch: Did Nancy Pelosi go too far in photoshopping picture of congresswomen?

There’s no denying that Gore, a onetime newspaper reporter who had testy relations with the press during his 2000 campaign, presided over a lousy cable channel. No one quite knew what Current was during the years when it aired mostly low-rent entertainment fare and was famous mainly for North Korea taking two of its correspondents, including Lisa Ling’s sister Laura, into custody.

Then Gore tried to relaunch it as a talking head channel to the left of MSNBC, hiring Keith Olbermann – a relationship that ended with his firing and mutual lawsuits – along with the likes of Eliot Spitzer and Jennifer Granholm, former Michigan governor. Gore himself offered commentary during major political events.

It was the utter failure of that incarnation of Current that prompted Gore and co-founder Joel Hyatt to put the thing up for sale.

Some detractors have slammed Gore for hypocrisy because, while he has advocated higher taxes on the rich, he tried to get the Al Jazeera deal done by December 31 to avoid the Obama tax hike. (The sale didn’t close until January 2.) I don’t see a problem trying to legally take advantage of changes in the tax code, no matter what your political stance.

Nor do I want to prejudge Al Jazeera America. The marketplace will decide its fate.

But there is something unsettling about Gore making off with such a big payday from a government-subsidized channel after making such bad television. Nice work if you can get it.

214,Kurtz,Howard,politico,"In August, I reported on National Journal’s plan to put aside subscriptions fees in favor of a not-yet-decided flat membership fee. Now Fishbowl DC has gotten its hands on the initial number, and it’s steep: $25,000 for some, $15,000 for charter members. That’s quite a jump from the $7,000 subscription fee.

But it’s nothing that can’t be haggled over. Atlantic Media Chairman David Bradley explained in a memo outlining the change this summer, the membership fees are highly negotiable.

“Should we suggest a membership contribution higher than you find prudent or appropriate, we will lower our suggestion accordingly,” Bradley wrote. “Should you suffer a fiscal year when budgeting for us proves difficult, that is precisely the year we most want to serve. We are pleased to continue organization as members without any charge for as long as their budgets require.”

He emphasized that this new thinking is not a reaction to a tough market, noting that National Journal is making its second-highest income in 40 years, after the bonanza of 2007.

“Our purpose is to serve,” he wrote. “Full stop.”

215,Kurtz,Howard,politico,"Andy Rooney, whose “60 Minutes” personal essays became such a fixture of popular culture that they spawned one of the most recognized “Saturday Night Live” parodies of all time, is stepping down from his regular appearance on the show.

Rooney, who is 92, has been featured on the show for 33 years. He’ll get a send-off this Sunday from Morley Safer before his farewell segment.

“There’s nobody like Andy and there never will be. He’ll hate hearing this, but he’s an American original,” said Jeff Fager, the chairman CBS News and the executive producer of “60 Minutes.” “His contributions to 60 MINUTES are immeasurable; he’s also a great friend. It’s harder for him to do it every week, but he will always have the ability to speak his mind on 60 MINUTES when the urge hits him.”

Full announcement after the jump.

ANDY ROONEY TO STEP DOWN

FROM HIS “60 MINUTES” ROLE



Andy Rooney will announce on this Sunday’s 60 MINUTES that it will be his last regular appearance on the broadcast. Rooney, 92, has been featured on 60 MINUTES since 1978.



He will make the announcement in his regular essay at the end of the program, his 1097th original essay for 60 MINUTES. It will be preceded by a segment in which Rooney looks back on his career in an interview with Morley Safer.



“There’s nobody like Andy and there never will be. He’ll hate hearing this, but he’s an American original,” said Jeff Fager, chairman CBS News and the executive producer of 60 MINUTES. “His contributions to 60 MINUTES are immeasurable; he’s also a great friend. It’s harder for him to do it every week, but he will always have the ability to speak his mind on 60 MINUTES when the urge hits him.”



Rooney began his run on 60 MINUTES in July 1978 with an essay about the reporting of automobile fatalities on the Independence Day weekend. He became a regular feature that fall, alternating weeks with the dueling James J. Kilpatrick and Shana Alexander before getting the end slot all to himself in the fall of 1979. In Rooney’s first full season as the 60 MINUTES commentator, the broadcast was the number one program for the first time.



He had been a contributor to 60 MINUTES since the program’s inception. During the first season of the broadcast in 1968 he appeared a few times in silhouette with Palmer Williams, 60 MINUTES’ senior producer, in a short-lived segment called “Ipso and Facto.” It was one of many experiments the program’s creator, Don Hewitt, tried as an end for the program. Hewitt settled with the Point/Counterpoint segment that Kilpatrick and Alexander appeared in for a few years before finding the perfect coda for 60 MINUTES in Andy Rooney.



Rooney also produced 60 MINUTES segments for Harry Reasoner during the broadcast’s first few seasons.



He wrote his first television essay, a longer precursor of the type he does on 60 MINUTES, in 1964, “An Essay on Doors.” From 1962 to 1968, he collaborated with Reasoner, with Rooney writing and producing and Reasoner narrating, on such notable CBS News specials as “An Essay on Bridges” (1965), “An Essay on Hotels” (1966), “An Essay on Women” (1967), “An Essay on Chairs” (1968) and “The Strange Case of the English Language” (1968). That same year, he wrote two CBS News specials in the series “Of Black America.” His script for “Black History: Lost, Stolen or Strayed” won him the first of four Emmy awards.



“An Essay on War” (1971), done for PBS, was his first appearance on television as himself and won Rooney his third Writers Guild Award.



Later, he wrote, produced and narrated a series of broadcasts for CBS News on various aspects of American life, including “Mr. Rooney Goes to Washington,” for which he won a Peabody Award, “Andy Rooney Takes Off,” “Mr. Rooney Goes to Work” and “Mr. Rooney Goes to Dinner.” Beginning in 1979, he wrote a weekly syndicated newspaper column that was recognized by the National Society of Newspaper Columnists when he was presented with its Ernie Pyle Lifetime Achievement Award in June 2003. That September, he was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Emmy. The Overseas Press Club gave him its President’s Award in 2010 for his reporting in World War II for The Stars and Stripes.



Rooney joined CBS in 1949 as a writer for “Arthur Godfrey’s Talent Scouts,” a Top 10 hit that was number one in 1952. He also wrote for “The Garry Moore Show” (1959-65), helping it to achieve hit status as a Top 20 program. At the same time, he wrote for CBS News public-affairs broadcasts such as “The Twentieth Century,” “News of America,” “Adventure,” “Calendar” and “The Morning Show with Will Rogers, Jr.”



In addition to magazine articles he wrote earlier in his career, Rooney is the author of 16 books, most recently Andy Rooney: 60 Years of Wisdom and Wit, was published by PublicAffairs in 2009. Rooney’s other books are: Air Gunner; The Story of The Stars and Stripes; Conquerors’ Peace; The Fortunes of War; A Few Minutes with Andy Rooney; And More by Andy Rooney; Pieces of My Mind; Word for Word; Not That You Asked...; Sweet and Sour; My War; Sincerely, Andy Rooney; Common Nonsense, Years of Minutes and Out of My Mind.



Rooney was born Jan. 14, 1919, in Albany, N.Y. He attended Colgate University until he was drafted into the Army in 1941. In February 1943, he was one of six correspondents who flew with the Eighth Air Force on the first American bombing raid over Germany.



Rooney lives in New York. He has three daughters and a son.

216,Kurtz,Howard,washingtonpost,"Three days after calling health-care reform a debacle for Republicans, David Frum was forced out of his job at the American Enterprise Institute on Wednesday.

The ouster also came one day after a harsh Wall Street Journal editorial ripped the former speechwriter for President George W. Bush, saying he ""now makes his living as the media's go-to basher of fellow Republicans"" and accusing him of ""peddling bad revisionist history.""

Frum made clear, in a letter to AEI President Arthur C. Brooks, that his departure after seven years as a resident fellow at the conservative think tank was not voluntary. ""I have had many fruitful years at the American Enterprise Institute,"" he wrote, ""and I do regret this abrupt and unexpected conclusion of our relationship.""

In a brief interview, Frum said ""there was no suggestion by AEI"" that his sharp criticism of the GOP's health-care strategy was the reason for his dismissal. He declined to say what Brooks told him.

""They invited me to remain associated with AEI on a non-salaried basis,"" Frum said, and he declined.

On his Web site, FrumForum, he wrote Sunday that when Congress approved President Obama's overhaul, conservatives and Republicans ""suffered their most crushing legislative defeat since the 1960s.""

""A huge part of the blame for today's disaster attaches to conservatives and Republicans ourselves,"" Frum wrote. ""At the beginning of this process we made a strategic decision: unlike, say, Democrats in 2001 when President Bush proposed his first tax cut, we would make no deal with the administration. No negotiations, no compromise, nothing. We were going for all the marbles. This would be Obama's Waterloo -- just as healthcare was [Bill] Clinton's in 1994. . . .

""This time, when we went for all the marbles, we ended with none.""

Brooks said in a statement that while AEI will not discuss personnel matters, ""David Frum is a truly original thinker and we are proud to have been associated with him for the last seven years. His decision to leave in no way diminishes our respect for him.""

Bruce Bartlett, another conservative scholar who has been at odds with the right, wrote that Frum told him AEI staffers ""had been ordered not to speak to the media"" about health care ""because they agreed with too much of what Obama was trying to do. . . . The donor community is only interested in financing organizations that parrot the party line.""

While Frum was hanging his hat at AEI, the organization had to share his services with other outside ventures, including his Web site, his books, his frequent television appearances and his column for the Week magazine and Canada's National Post.

Frum's stint in the Bush White House is best remembered for his role in crafting the phrase ""axis of evil,"" which the former president used in his 2002 State of the Union speech to describe Iraq, Iran and North Korea.

Frum has long been a contrarian conservative. He emerged as a harsh critic of Sarah Palin during the 2008 campaign and resigned from the National Review after Obama was elected. ""I think a little more distance can help everybody do a better job of keeping their temper,"" he said then. ""I am really and truly frightened by the collapse of support for the Republican Party by the young and the educated.""

He has also been at war with much of the talk-radio right. Frum wrote a Newsweek cover story last year lambasting Rush Limbaugh, calling the host a ""walking stereotype of self-indulgence -- exactly the image that Barack Obama most wants to affix to our philosophy and our party.""",0,http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/25/AR2010032502336.html
217,Kurtz,Howard,washingtonpost,"Soon after Howell Raines was named executive editor of the New York Times, he got a small gift -- an antique sextant -- from columnist William Safire.

On the wooden case was an inscription: ""Steer it straight.""

Nearly everyone inside the Times's majestic tower here on West 43rd Street expects Raines to steer the journalistic ship of state strongly -- and, if the past is any guide, into occasionally turbulent waters. He is an intense, charismatic, sometimes polarizing figure who transformed the paper's editorial page into a pugnacious voice for liberal causes.

Yet the Alabama native, who took over yesterday, brings some highly opinionated baggage to a newsroom that is supposed to be free of partisan bias.

""I had been very rigorous in my political reporting in filtering out my views,"" says Raines, 58. ""To suggest you can't move back and forth between the two realms is to assume that political opinions, or ideology, overrides all the other synapses in the brain . . .

""In most cases we supported Democratic policies and usually, not always, Democratic candidates,"" says Raines, whose editorial page endorsed Bill Clinton's reelection and Al Gore over George W. Bush. But, he says, slipping off his glasses, ""I believe in vigorous journalism. I'm not a political partisan. Any time you start talking about something like that, it sounds like a civics lecture. That's just who I am.""

Who Raines is, in fact, may prove to be more important than his left-leaning views. A slow-drawling Southerner with steel-gray hair and a bulbous nose, Raines grew up in segregated Birmingham during the turmoil of the civil rights movement. Unlike his predecessors Joe Lelyveld (Harvard) and Max Frankel (Columbia), this graduate of Birmingham-Southern College did not have his rough edges sanded off at an Ivy League school. Nor did this son of an interior contractor have any journalistic connections.

When Raines was 10 -- ""a son of the hillbilly tribes,"" as he puts it -- his mother was sorting the mail and tossed a copy of Field & Stream on the dining room table. ""I remember the moment with cinematic quality. I said, 'Someday I'd like to work for a magazine like that.' And my mother said, 'I don't see any reason why you can't.' This was the most far-removed thing from my world.""

But Raines conquered that world, jokingly telling a friend that his ascent is a triumph for the ""Judeo-redneck conspiracy"" at the Times. Colleagues describe him as both inspiring and intimidating.

""He's the best editor I've ever worked for,"" says Gail Collins, who succeeded Raines as editorial page czar. ""When Howell's in a meeting, the meeting's more exciting. He tells jokes, there's a spark."" If a newsmaker tried to fudge a position with the editorial board, Collins recalls, Raines would say: ""You don't understand. Our position is X, your position is Y and we're not going to agree with you and we're going to keep saying it.""

Says another staffer who has worked with Raines: ""He's very, very demanding. He pushes people. That's what makes it exciting to work for him. I'm sure there will be some people who are scared of him.""

The magnitude of the task hit home when Publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. announced Raines's appointment in May. Standing atop a box to address the newsroom, Raines was struck by the sea of faces -- ""a very different scale of management than I've had in departments of 50 people.""

Still, Raines pronounces himself ""exhilarated"" by the opportunity that colleagues say he has been lusting after for years. Above all, he says, he wants to ""communicate a sense of excitement"" about journalism. And he'll have plenty of opportunity, deciding everything from what stories get front-page play to whether to beef up sports or financial coverage to who gets promoted (his new managing editor, Gerald Boyd, is the first African American to hold that post in Times history).

Raines has his share of newsroom detractors. Knowing full well that he was derided for fostering a star system as Washington bureau chief, when such writers as Maureen Dowd, Rick Berke, Michael Kelly and Michael Oreskes flourished, Raines chooses his words carefully:

""Every one of the 1,135 people here is a star,"" he says. He now has ""a more egalitarian view of the staff. . . . As I've gotten older and I hope wiser and I hope better at dealing with people, the collegial, collaborative, cooperative side has come more into focus.""

A State Department spokesman couldn't have put it more diplomatically.

The Paper Trail A reporter -- as opposed to, say, an opinion-monger on TV -- is supposed to set aside his beliefs and file straight-down-the-middle stories. But Republicans believe they saw hints long ago that Howell Raines had it in for them.

As a White House correspondent in the early 1980s, Raines so infuriated Ronald Reagan's administration that top officials repeatedly complained to his boss. ""The Reagan people really just hated to hear his name,"" says Phil Gailey, a former Times reporter who now runs the St. Petersburg Times editorial page.

Little wonder, in light of the anti-Reagan animus that Raines later revealed. He wrote in one of his books that ""reporting on Ronald Reagan's success in making life harder for citizens who were not born rich, white and healthy -- saddened me."" (On the other hand, Walter Mondale's 1984 campaign also grumbled to the Times about Raines's coverage.)

Raines had cordial relations with Reagan's successor -- he once went fly-fishing with George Bush the elder -- but didn't think much of him politically. Raines's verdict: ""If Bush had been as worried about the fact that he could see homeless people in Lafayette Park from his bedroom window as he was about lowering the capital-gains tax, he would still be President.""

And then there's Bob Dole, assailed by Raines as a ""churlish partisan"" who once ""groveled for Richard Nixon"" and was ""shilling for a corrupt status quo."" Dole was so upset by the Times editorials he declared on the Senate floor that he had been ""smeared.""

This long paper trail is drawing fire from such critics as Newsweek columnist Robert Samuelson, who wrote last week: ""Does anyone believe that, in his new job, Raines will instantly purge himself of these and other views? And because they are so public, Raines's positions compromise the Times's ability to act and appear fair-minded.""

But Raines points out that he was hardly easy on Bill Clinton. During the 1992 primaries, he scolded the press for ""an extraordinary burst of journalistic fawning"" over the candidate from Arkansas.

Once Clinton was elected, Raines's editorial page hammered him on Whitewater and improper fundraising, and during the Monica Lewinsky investigation said the president had ""embarrassed the nation"" and ""sent out federal employees to lie on his behalf."" Clinton was convinced that Raines, as a fellow Southerner, resented his success.

""It was very disappointing to the Clinton people that we were not uncritical cheerleaders,"" Raines says. But from the earliest days of scandal and screw-ups, ""I felt very strongly that it was important for us to show we measured both parties by the same yardstick -- and we were not going to put the reputation of the Times editorial page behind bad policy or questionable behavior.""

But Tom Rosenstiel, director of the Project for Excellence in Journalism, says there's no evidence that Raines's views affected him as a newsman, or that he's some kind of partisan warrior. ""Bill Clinton probably hated the Times editorial page under Howell Raines more than any other person in the United States,"" he says. ""This is not a lockstep Democrat we're talking about.""

Rich Lowry, editor of the conservative National Review, calls Raines's background a ""non-issue,"" saying: ""One of the foremost mistakes in contemporary journalism is the idea that you can create the totally objective person who is hermetically sealed from ever having an opinion. I'm sure the Times has had people in that chair before who had just as many opinions as Howell Raines has.""

But Bill Kovach, a former curator of Harvard's Nieman Foundation, cautions that ""a lot of people are going to be watching for the opinionated editor bleeding into the front page of the paper. I think that's something they have to be concerned about.""

After George W. Bush took office, Raines visited presidential counselor Karen Hughes at the White House and had dinner with senior adviser Karl Rove. ""Howell's a professional,"" says one administration official. ""It's not as though the Times news pages could get much tougher on the president and his approach to politics. We'll certainly keep a close eye on it.""

Early Riser Clarke Stallworth still remembers the day in 1964 when he first noticed the ""serious kid"" on the copy desk of the Birmingham Post-Herald, writing headlines with a No. 2 pencil. Raines didn't know how to type and had asked ""Miss Anna"" at the local library for a book on typing.

Stallworth, the city editor, needed a color piece on the upcoming Alabama-Auburn football game, and after failing to find volunteers, asked the new employee to take a crack at it.

""I come to work the next day and there on the spike was a masterpiece -- no erasures, no mark-outs, perfect copy,"" he says. ""It was like I was at the ballgame. Damnedest thing I ever saw."" Raines later turned a routine assignment on local statues into a textured series on the city's history.

""You could see him absorbing, absorbing, absorbing, learning. . . . It was obvious he was smart as hell,"" Stallworth says.

Raines was absorbing something else as well. He was deeply ashamed of George Wallace, who had stood in the schoolhouse door the year before, and other ""segregationist blowhards."" He felt Alabama was treating blacks as second-class citizens -- people like his family's maid, Grady Hutchinson, who had tutored him in what it was like to be black and poor.

But Raines was embarrassed as well by the performance of most Southern newspapers, which he felt suppressed civil rights news and ran columns preaching the Southern doctrine of ""massive resistance."" And he was embarrassed by his own timidity, since he was ""not brave enough to participate"" in civil rights protests.

""It left me with a strong conviction,"" he says. ""If my life delivered me to an intersection like that, I was going to do my best not to fail to meet the moral challenge.""

It was hard at first -- he had trouble getting a story about a secret school board meeting on desegregation into the Post-Herald -- and left after nine months to join a local television station. But he was able to write more freely about race at the Tuscaloosa News, Birmingham News, Atlanta Constitution (where he was the movie critic) and St. Petersburg Times, while also earning a master's degree at the University of Alabama. He joined the Times as an Atlanta correspondent in 1978, and by the mid-1980s he was the paper's chief political writer.

Kovach, who headed the Washington bureau at the time, praises Raines's work but calls him ""very reserved, not a glad-hander. He's not warm. He's a little standoffish. It's not shyness; maybe it's Alabama hill country. But he's got a great sense of humor and is a great storyteller.""

Another side of Raines's personality surfaced when he hit the road with fellow Southerner Phil Gailey. ""After drinking too much on Saturday night, we would wake up Sunday morning and the first one who could locate Jimmy Swaggart's program would call the other so we could get ourself redeemed,"" Gailey says. ""He was a source of entertainment when we were sobering up.""

Kovach eventually promoted Raines, whose first management experience was supervising construction crews for his dad, to serve as his deputy. ""Clearly, one reason he took the job was he saw it as a steppingstone and thought he would be my successor,"" Kovach says.

Raines did get the job, after a brief stint as London correspondent, and was ticketed for the fast track. He won a Pulitzer for a Times Magazine piece reminiscing about Grady Hutchinson. On a personal level, though, he was struggling, as he made clear in his book ""Fly Fishing Through the Midlife Crisis.""

""Men act wild because they are trying to run away from death,"" he wrote.

There was the divorce from his wife, Susan, and subsequent vacation on ""a tropical island with a voluptuous and passionate woman."" She was mystified, though, when Raines seemed more interested in standing on the balcony and gazing down at large Japanese carp called koi. There was the seven-year period when he wouldn't speak to his brother and barely saw his father because of a dispute over the sale of some beachfront property.

There was his fear of another Times editor, so unnerving that Raines put on his desk a slogan of Cheyenne Indian warriors: ""It is a good day to die.""

Once he took over the editorial page in 1993, Raines seemed to overcome his inner demons and find his voice. The job enabled him to broaden his foreign-policy knowledge and to work closely with Sulzberger (they started as Washington reporters at the same time), who everyone knew would be sizing up Raines for the editor's job. By the time Sulzberger picked him over Bill Keller, the managing editor favored by Lelyveld, no one was surprised.

Raines had banned eating at editorial board meetings, but on his last day, the staff flouted his will by bringing in big trays of salmon.

Times readers will see his imprint ""in a matter of months,"" Raines says, though he admits to being ""a little secretive"" about his plans, refusing even to suggest areas where the nation's largest metropolitan daily could stand improvement.

The new job will undoubtedly boost his visibility in the gossip columns, which often take note when the man dubbed ""Howell on the Prowl"" squires women around town. Raines doesn't enjoy the attention -- including what he says are false rumors -- but hasn't complained.

""Being written about ought to make you more sensitive to what it feels like to be written about by our own reporters,"" he says. ""It's definitely had that effect on me.""

""I believe in vigorous journalism. I'm not a political partisan,"" says Howell Raines as he moves from opinion to news at the Times.Howell Raines, new executive editor of the New York Times, walks though a hallway lined with the paper's Pulitzer Prize-winning work, including his own.",0,https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/2001/09/06/the-gray-ladys-colorful-chief/2e506688-a1c1-44e0-8c7b-19bb3aef461f/
218,Kurtz,Howard,washingtonpost,"NEW YORK -- Nick Denton is sitting amid the rows of screen-staring digital workers in the fourth-floor walkup that serves as Gawker headquarters, having neglected to build himself a private office.

""I would do it, but I don't want to be mocked by the blogs,"" says the company's founder, retreating to the loft's only semiprivate space -- a pair of old couches next to a table with boxes of canned soda piled underneath.

This is rather amusing: Gawker became a strangely addictive force on the Internet by ridiculing all manner of media people, often in bitingly harsh terms. But the site has evolved into a broader, less Manhattan-obsessed gossip emporium that now includes original reporting -- prompting a quick disclaimer from the sharp-tongued Brit.

Gawker hasn't exactly mellowed, not with such headlines as ""Bill Gates in Cambridge Slob Shocker"" and ""Moronic Conservative Visits Williamsburg, Loses His Mind."" New York magazine's Vanessa Grigoriadis began a 2007 story by recalling how the Web site mocked her wedding announcement and made her look ""idiotic."" But the site is increasingly strafing bigger national targets, rather than sliming minor functionaries in the Apple's incestuous media industry.

""It seemed really mean when you wrote about an assistant editor at a publishing company,"" says Choire Sicha, a former top Gawker editor. ""They're not accustomed to being on Page Six,"" the New York Post gossip page. ""When you write about someone on a reality show, everyone's mean to them.""

The culture has also shifted. When Denton, a former Financial Times reporter, launched Gawker.com in 2002, there was no other outfit quite like it. But such Gawker spinoffs as Wonkette (sold last year) and Jezebel, along with TMZ, Perez Hilton, the Huffington Post and countless other sites, have made sneering criticism a defining feature of the blogosphere. ""Even the mainstream media now knows that if it allows pompous or meaningless or bogus pronouncements, it will be ridiculed by us or 'The Daily Show,' "" Denton says.

The 42-year-old publisher goes so far as to declare himself bored with snark and appreciative of, yes, positive items. He has even created a new Gawker category, Things We Actually Like.

Gawker recently hired former Chicago Tribune reporter John Cook, who has scored several scoops through old-fashioned legwork. Cook unearthed an embarrassing memo from a publicist for radio host Erich ""Mancow"" Muller, saying that his plan to undergo an on-air waterboarding was a ""hoax."" (Mancow insisted the stunt was real and amounted to torture.)

After Freddie Mac's acting chief financial officer committed suicide in April, Cook obtained evidence through the Freedom of Information Act that investigators were looking into whether agency officials had concealed or misrepresented information related to the banking bailout. (The probe apparently went nowhere.)

Cook says he is still feeling his way: ""In my previous life, I could spend a week doing nothing but putting out calls and e-mails and tracking the right people down. . . . But Gawker's just not set up to work that way,"" he says, because of ""the velocity and pressures to keep posting"" and the ""need to feed the beast. . . . There's much less of a filter imposed on you, but it's easy to get carried away, just run and gun, and write something you might regret later.""

Denton's greatest innovation, in his view, is publicly posting the page views alongside each item. This serves as a neon popularity meter, reminding writers what sells and what, uh, doesn't.",0,http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/21/AR2009062101822.html

Brad Pitt was making the rounds, huddling with R.B. Brenner, a Metro editor, then Managing Editor Phil Bennett, and then Pentagon reporter Josh White. People stared. They gestured. They sauntered by and tried to look nonchalant. They whipped out cell phones and called their friends. Women poured in from other floors.

Pitt, wearing a gray cap, blue jeans and untucked white shirt, was researching just what a reporter does for an upcoming movie, a project on which Brenner has become an adviser. He looked serious, asked questions and seemed unconcerned by the commotion around him.

Full Coverage: Clinton Accused Livingston's Past Becomes Issue (Post, Dec. 18) Livingston Statement Hill Doesn't Rise To Flynt's Bait (Post, Oct. 7)

By Howard Kurtz

Washington Post Staff Writer

Saturday, December 19, 1998; Page C01 For a news business that has spent the year wallowing in the Monica Lewinsky quagmire, it has come to this: Larry Flynt is now setting the agenda. The Hustler publisher said yesterday he will release details in roughly two weeks about what he described as four extramarital affairs by incoming House Speaker Robert Livingston, along with sexual disclosures about other lawmakers or senior officials. It was Flynt's million-dollar reward offer that prompted the allegations that prompted Livingston to acknowledge his past affairs late Thursday. In short, at a moment of grave constitutional crisis, one of America's leading pornographers has inserted himself into the House debate over whether to impeach President Clinton for lying under oath about sex. ""I just wanted to expose hypocrisy,"" Flynt said in an interview. ""If these guys are going after the president, they shouldn't have any skeletons in their closet. This is only the beginning."" And that is what has both politicians and the journalists who cover them on edge. Flynt is merely the latest agent provocateur to make the media complicit in the sexual outing of prominent lawmakers, a role that most news organizations would resist under ordinary circumstances. Dan Burton, Helen Chenoweth and Henry Hyde, all House Republicans, have admitted infidelities in recent months after being faced with media exposure. In a further sign of Washington's supercharged atmosphere, reporters were deluged yesterday with sexual rumors and allegations against prominent politicians of both parties, in some cases by sources seeking cash. And some journalists were essentially trying to scoop Hustler by learning the identity of Livingston's paramours. ""The source of this gutter journalism, Larry Flynt, is paying for dirt on people,"" said National Review Editor Rich Lowry. ""It has a smell about it."" ""We've been tabloid-launderers for years,"" said Time columnist Margaret Carlson. ""Now we're Flynt-launderers. Maybe we're reaching the point where we're so sickened by all this that we stop. It's beginning to look like a bad Italian opera where at the end everyone is dead."" Flynt, for his part, says the allegations are being checked out by an unspecified Washington private detective firm comprised of ""former CIA and FBI operatives."" He said he is gathering affidavits from the women involved. ""I felt I had to employ a very high standard of journalistic proof for this investigation,"" Flynt said from Los Angeles. ""I didn't want to be dismissed by someone saying, 'Consider the source.' "" Several GOP lawmakers have charged, without evidence, that the White House is behind the disclosures about Livingston, a Louisiana Republican. Said Flynt: ""I can assure you I've had no contact with the White House. I don't get my marching orders from them. I'm just adamantly opposed to the impeachment process and want to do anything I can to derail it."" It is still unclear why Livingston, who has been married for 33 years, acknowledged the affairs Thursday, since publication was not imminent. ""Obviously he knew that we had the goods on him,"" Flynt said. He said Livingston's affairs took place over the last decade and that one was within the last three or four years. Livingston said Thursday that he had occasionally ""strayed from my marriage"" and sought forgiveness, and he vowed not to be ""intimidated"" by media investigations. He had no further comment yesterday. Flynt's role began in October when he bought a full-page ad in The Washington Post, announcing a reward of up to $1 million for anyone who could prove having had ""an adulterous sexual encounter with a current member of the United States Congress or a high-ranking government official."" More than 2,000 calls came in. Hustler Editor Allan McDonell said that disclosures about Livingston and two other lawmakers or officials will likely be made public around New Year's Day. He said the information would be released at a news conference and on the Internet, and perhaps in a special issue of Hustler, since the earliest available issue will not be published until March. All told, Flynt said Hustler is investigating about a dozen officials, including at least one senator. ""There's only one Democrat in the whole slew of them,"" he said. But Flynt, a self-described ""partisan Democrat,"" said he is not sure he will out the Democratic official. And then there is the monetary question. While Flynt says he has already paid $500,000 to some of the women involved, he said that ""some junior congressman from a remote state"" is clearly worth a lesser sum. McDonell said the Livingston story has been delayed as ""we started haggling with people over the money."" And Flynt may not pay the women at all in the wake of Livingston's admission. ""Since he broke the story himself, I'm really not quite sure what our legal position is,"" Flynt said. At a news conference at Hustler's offices, in front of sculptures of copulating couples, the wheelchair-bound, cigar-chomping publisher dribbled out additional details. He said some of the politicians had lied in divorce proceedings. He said two of the cases -- one involving a member of Congress and one a Republican Party official -- involved phone sex, and that he had some audiotapes. And, to tantalize his audience, he said one Republican involved is ""a really, really big fish."" Staff writer Sharon Waxman in Los Angeles contributed to this report.

221,Kurtz,Howard,washingtonpost,"The ""news,"" such as it was, quickly hit the media echo chamber.

""SUSPICIOUS VESSEL IN DC/Coast Guard fires on boat on Potomac River,"" said CNN's ""breaking news"" headline at 10:05 a.m. Friday.

Six minutes later, an ""URGENT"" bulletin flashed from Reuters, which attributed the information to CNN.

That prompted Fox News to report that shots had been fired, citing Reuters as its source. ""Report: Coast Guard Fires on Suspicious Boat in Potomac,"" Fox News's headline said.

At 10:29, the ""crisis"" began to evaporate as CNN quoted two unidentified sources as saying the incident had been a ""possible"" Coast Guard training exercise. That is precisely what it was. No shots were ever fired; they had merely been described on a radio scanner.

Thus it was that on the eighth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who's often grilled by journalists, got to turn the tables. The information was not ""verified,"" he told reporters, adding that the Coast Guard was going to hold a news conference and that ""hopefully CNN will go. My only caution would be that before we report things like this, checking would be good.""

But David Bohrman, CNN's Washington bureau chief, said his network had an obligation to report the information after an experienced staffer heard the urgent words on a scanner, with no warning that a drill was being conducted and, as his reporters made calls, they watched footage of armed boats maneuvering in the river.

""This was an event we saw and heard playing out a few hundred yards from where the president of the United States was commemorating 9/11, and the Coast Guard did not wave us off this story,"" Bohrman said. ""We didn't just leap onto the air. . . . After 20 minutes of trying to get some confirmation from the Coast Guard and being told nothing was going on, it would have been wrong for us not to report this was happening. I'm surprised they would have done a training exercise like this and not let other government agencies know and not let us know.""

Vice Adm. John P. Currier, the Coast Guard's chief of staff, refused to apologize for not issuing an alert, saying that ""even though it's unfortunate that it escalated to this level, what you're seeing here is a result of a normal training exercise.""

""A routine, low-profile"" drill is conducted about four times a week in the same part of the Potomac, Currier said, involving as many as four 25-foot ""response boats,"" each armed with a bow-mounted, .762-caliber machine gun. He said the training is so ""low tempo"" and carried out so often that the Coast Guard does not give notice to other agencies or the community.

But Friday was Sept. 11, 2009, and terrorism was on many people's minds. Currier conceded that ""in retrospect, of course, we're going to look at the sensitivity"" of conducting such an exercise on the anniversary of the terrorist attacks.

Gibbs rejected comparisons to an unannounced Air Force flyover in New York earlier this year that scared many residents and led to an administration apology. But Rep. Peter T. King (N.Y.), the ranking Republican on the Homeland Security Committee, called the drill's timing ""questionable"" and said he would ask the Coast Guard for a report.",0,http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/11/AR2009091103842.html
222,Kurtz,Howard,washingtonpost,"In case there was any doubt, using a prostitution metaphor for the daughter of a presidential candidate is not a good career move.

MSNBC suspended correspondent David Shuster yesterday for an undetermined period for making a disparaging on-air remark about Chelsea Clinton. Meanwhile, officials in her mother's campaign raised the possibility of punishing the news channel by boycotting future debates.

While filling in as a host Thursday, Shuster was discussing the 27-year-old's role in Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign with two guests when he asked: ""Doesn't it seem as if Chelsea is sort of being pimped out in some weird sort of way?""

Howard Wolfson, the campaign's communications director, called Shuster's remark ""disgusting,"" ""beneath contempt"" and ""the kind of thing that should never be said on a national news network."" Wolfson appeared to suggest that Clinton is reconsidering an agreement this week to participate in an MSNBC debate Feb. 26 in Cleveland, saying: ""I at this point can't envision doing another debate on that network.""

Shuster, who plays a prominent role in MSNBC's political coverage, told viewers last night that his words were ""inappropriate. . . . I apologize to the Clinton family, the Clinton campaign, and all of you who were justifiably offended. . . . I am particularly sorry that my language diminished the regard and respect she has earned from all of us and the respect her parents have earned in how they raised her.""

In a statement, MSNBC spokesman Jeremy Gaines called Shuster's language ""irresponsible. . . . NBC News takes these matters seriously and offers our sincere regrets to the Clintons for the remarks."" As for the scheduled debate between Clinton and Barack Obama, Gaines said network executives were talking to the Clinton camp ""and we are hopeful that the event will take place as planned.""

After Shuster made the remark on ""Tucker,"" Clinton spokesman Philippe Reines contacted him and said the reference was offensive. Shuster e-mailed back that he was referring to the fact that Chelsea Clinton is making calls to convention superdelegates but refusing to talk to the press. After Shuster continued to defend himself, Phil Griffin, MSNBC's top executive, called Reines yesterday to apologize.

Wolfson noted that MSNBC's Chris Matthews expressed regret last month for suggesting that Hillary Clinton's political success can be traced to sympathy stemming from her husband's affair with Monica Lewinsky. ""At some point you have to question whether there is a pattern at this particular network,"" Wolfson said.",0,http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/08/AR2008020803756.html
223,Kurtz,Howard,washingtonpost,"The fledgling Fox Business Network has stolen a big name from CNBC.

Charlie Gasparino, who has a knack for breaking financial stories and sometimes talking himself into trouble, used a window in his unexpired contract with the much bigger business network to join the upstart operation.

""I always wanted to work for Fox,"" Gasparino says. ""I don't take chances with stories. I do take entrepreneurial chances with my career.""

While Gasparino is said to have felt underappreciated at CNBC, he says he is leaving on ""very amicable"" terms and ""going to a place that, if you can make it work, I'll be part of a team that builds something. And that's very appealing to me.""

Kevin Magee, the Fox executive who runs the business channel, calls Gasparino ""a big get for us. Charlie Gasparino is a terrific reporter. He's also a great television character. He's got a great command of the screen. We're determined not to have a channel with nothing but bland people.""

A former Wall Street Journal and Newsweek reporter, Gasparino was the first to report that the federal government was considering a bailout of the insurance giant American International Group. He is the author of several books, including ""The Sellout: How Three Decades of Wall Street Greed and Government Mismanagement Destroyed the Global Financial System."" Gasparino has occasionally gotten into on-air spats with his CNBC colleagues and once phoned in for a live interview while battling a hangover.

Gasparino denies that tensions at CNBC were a factor in his decision, saying ""newsrooms are generally seething places"" and he tends to ""wear my heart on my sleeve."" But he did issue a warning to his former employer: ""My job is to rip the lungs out of the competition for Fox Business Network.""

Fox Business reaches 50 million homes, about half as many as CNBC. In recent weeks the Fox channel has averaged between 50,000 and 80,000 viewers. CNBC drew 236,000 last month, a 24 percent drop over the previous year but still several times larger than Fox's audience.

224,Kurtz,Howard,washingtonpost,"Days after Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards decided against firing two liberal bloggers with a history of inflammatory writing, one resigned last night with a blast at ""right wing shills"" for driving her out of the campaign.

Amanda Marcotte, whose writings were assailed as anti-Catholic, wrote yesterday on her blog that the Edwards camp had accepted her resignation. She blamed her most vocal critic, Bill Donohoe, president of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights, writing that he ""and his calvacade of right wing shills don't respect that a mere woman like me could be hired for my skills, and pretended that John Edwards had to be held accountable for some of my personal, non-mainstream views on religious influence on politics,"" which Marcotte described as being ""anti-theocracy.""

Marcotte charged that Donohoe had been running a ""scorched earth campaign"" against her and that he ""made no bones about the fact that his intent is to 'silence' me. . . . It was creating a situation where I felt that every time I coughed, I was risking the Edwards campaign. . . . Bill Donohue doesn't speak for Catholics, he speaks for the right wing noise machine.""

After days of indecision, Edwards said in a statement last week that he was ""personally offended"" by the writing of Marcotte and a second blogger, Melissa McEwan, but that he was keeping them on in the interest of giving everyone ""a fair shake."" The statement was coupled with carefully worded apologies from the two women toward anyone who may have been offended.

The former North Carolina senator was caught between conflicting pressures. On one hand, Marcotte and McEwan, like many writers in the freewheeling blogosphere, had written profane and offensive attacks on their detractors, using language that no presidential candidate would be comfortable defending. On the other, liberal bloggers were embracing their cause, depicting them as victims of an orchestrated conservative campaign to discredit them.

Every major presidential candidate has hired one or more bloggers as a way to tap into the network of online activists who can generate considerable buzz, and donations, in a campaign. But many of these bloggers have a long cybertrail that leaves them vulnerable to criticism in the more buttoned-down environment of national politics.

Among other things, Marcotte had written: ""The Catholic church is not about to let something like compassion for girls get in the way of using the state as an instrument to force women to bear more tithing Catholics."" She also questioned, in explicit language, what would have happened if the Virgin Mary had taken the emergency contraceptive called Plan B.

Last month, Marcotte wrote of the Duke University rape case: ""Can't a few white boys sexually assault a black woman anymore without people getting all wound up about it? So unfair.""

McEwan, whose status with the Edwards campaign is apparently unchanged, has referred to President Bush's conservative Christian supporters as his ""wingnut Christofascist base.""

In a statement last week, Donohoe said: ""John Edwards is a decent man who has had his campaign tarnished by two anti-Catholic vulgar trash-talking bigots.""

On her blog, Pandagon, Marcotte posted a letter from a group called Catholics for Free Choice, assailing Donohoe as, among other things, anti-woman and anti-gay.

Word of Marcotte's resignation came as Fox News Channel commentator Bill O'Reilly was leading his program with a full-throated attack on the two bloggers.

A conservative blogger, Michelle Malkin, wrote recently: ""Seems that everyone but the Edwards campaign has tracked Marcotte's foul-mouthed nutroots diatribes. Or perhaps the Edwards team is well aware of her lunatic blogging and can't wait for her to unleash her unbridled anger on their spiffy website to give him a gritty, 'progressive' edge.""

But a liberal blogger, Chris Bowers of MyDD.com, wrote that ""Republican attempts to make Democrats look bad though guilt by association with us crazy bloggers were a miserable failure.""

225,Kurtz,Howard,washingtonpost,"Ask members of the press whether Rush Limbaugh and Bob Woodward are journalists and the answers are somewhat predictable.

But the public has a different view. About the same percentage considers the radio talk show host and the author and Washington Post editor to be journalists, says a survey by the Annenberg Public Policy Center released yesterday.

The numbers: 27 percent say Limbaugh is a journalist, 55 percent say he's not and 18 percent don't know. Woodward may lag in the name-ID department: 30 percent say he's a journalist, 17 percent say he's not and 53 percent don't know. The survey of 1,500 adults was completed before the recent revelation of Deep Throat's identity.

A separate survey of 673 journalists produced very different results. For Woodward, 72 percent say he's ""very close"" to a journalist and 21 percent ""somewhat close."" For Limbaugh, 1 percent say he's ""very close"" to a journalist, 2 percent ""somewhat close"" and 82 percent ""not close at all.""

Kathleen Hall Jamieson, the center's director, said the findings provide ""disturbing evidence that the public defines the word very differently from the way that most journalists do, a conclusion buttressed by the fact that 40 percent said Bill O'Reilly . . . was a journalist and only 19 percent said that George Will, the columnist and commentator, was one.""

Limbaugh said he was ""not really surprised"" by the survey. ""I am America's anchorman, doing news play-by-play 15 hours a week for nearly 17 years now, and this is just more evidence that the old media's monopoly-like dominance is finished. I think the 'mainstream' media should heed Ms. Jamieson's warning and seriously examine how they appear to their readers and viewers.""

Television stars tended to score the highest, suggesting that name recognition may be a factor in the results. Peter Jennings is deemed a journalist by 79 percent of the respondents, followed by Mike Wallace (64 percent), Katie Couric (48 percent), Brian Williams (42 percent), O'Reilly, Larry King (37 percent), Chris Matthews (33 percent), Woodward, Limbaugh and Will.

The Annenberg poll also found a split on the perceived goals of big media corporations. While 48 percent of the public said their first priority is to generate high profits for the owners, 46 percent said it is to deliver high-quality news coverage. Among journalists, only 12 percent said the top priority of corporate owners is to provide factual and timely coverage. Forty-nine percent say that the owners do try to provide quality coverage but that business realities sometimes prevent this from happening.",0,http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/13/AR2005061301520.html
226,Kurtz,Howard,politico,"Nancy Pelosi is not exactly what you’d call a loose cannon.

So it was big news this morning when a quote attributed to the House Minority Leader began circulating around the blogosphere, in which she appeared to tell Newsweek's Howard Kurtz, “I think you need to talk about how poorly they [the White House] do on message. They can’t see around corners; they anticipate nothing.”

The quote fit into broader criticisms of the Obama White House and was quickly snapped up by the Republican National Committee and posted on Eric Cantor’s blog.

Just one problem: She never said it, according to both her office and sources at Newsweek.

Newsweek has retracted the quote, and put an editor’s note on the piece.

Editor’s Note; An earlier version of this story included a comment erroneously attributed to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, criticizing the White House’s efforts at political messaging. Newsweek and The Daily Beast regret the error.



This might seem like one of those classic cases of an “off the record” comment being accidentally put on the record, but Drew Hammill, Pelosi’s spokesman, forcefully denies that claim.

“She never uttered those words, on the record, off the record or on background, nor did our office,” Hammill told POLITICO.

Several sources at Newsweek/The Daily Beast confirm that’s true.

A series of mistakes led it to appear to come from her mouth to Kurtz’s ear in the story.

In fact, Kurtz never interviewed Pelosi for the story, but was the lead writer on a story pulling together reporting from a group of reporters that included Lois Romano, who had interviewed Pelosi earlier for a profile that ran in Newsweek/The Daily Beast on September 25th. During that interview, Pelosi said some things that fit the theme of today’s story – about Obama’s return to populism – and so Romano turned over some of her unused quotes to Kurtz for his piece.

Somewhere in the hand-off, however, there was a miscommunication, according to several Newsweek sources. Notes that framed the interview were misinterpreted as part of the transcript.

While the story itself lists the contributing reporters at the bottom and does not imply that Kurtz talked to Pelosi, the deck head – presumably written by another editor – makes it seem like Kurtz interviewed Pelosi, further compounding the confusion.

It’s an unfortunate moment for Kurtz, who got caught in another misunderstanding in March after he reported a conversation he had had with Rep. Darrell Issa’s then-spokesman, Kurt Bardella, as having taken place with Issa himself. He corrected the error.

I’ve reached out to Kurtz and Daily Beast spokesman Andrew Kirk for comment.

Kurtz tweeted a correction to today’s story this afternoon, saying, “That Nancy Pelosi comment in Newsweek criticizing the White House on messaging was erroneously attributed to her. We regret the error.""

UPDATE; Kirk responds with a statement:

The article, Behind Obama’s Populist Makeover, included a comment erroneously attributed to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, criticizing the administration’s political messaging. The writer misread notes of an interview conducted by a colleague. The error has been corrected, and we’ve apologized to Nancy Pelosi’s office.

227,Kurtz,Howard,washingtonpost,"After decades of digging into the Church of Scientology, reporters and editors at the St. Petersburg Times are accustomed to being denounced by its leaders.

But they find it unsettling that three veteran journalists -- a Pulitzer Prize winner, a former ""60 Minutes"" producer, and the former executive director of Investigative Reporters and Editors -- are taking the church's money to examine the paper's conduct.

While the journalists have promised an independent review, the Times has refused to cooperate, saying their work will be used to fuel the church's ongoing campaign against the Florida paper.

""I ultimately couldn't take this request very seriously because it's a study bought and paid for by the Church of Scientology,"" says Executive Editor Neil Brown. ""Candidly,"" he adds, ""I was surprised and disappointed that journalists who I understand to have an extensive background in investigative reporting would think it's appropriate to ask me or our news organization to talk about that reporting while (a) it's ongoing, and (b) while they're being paid to ask these questions by the very subjects of our reporting.""

Steve Weinberg, the former IRE executive, who has taught at the University of Missouri's journalism school for a quarter-century, says he was paid $5,000 to edit the study and ""tried to make sure it's a good piece of journalism criticism, just like I've written a gazillion times. . . . For me it's kind of like editing a Columbia Journalism Review piece.""

He says their agreement requires that the church publish the study in full, if it decides to make it public, but that ""the contract says the church has the right to do nothing with it except put it in a drawer."" That means Scientology leaders have an out if the recently completed study isn't to their liking.

Weinberg acknowledges that the ""unusual situation"" gave him pause, saying: ""It certainly wouldn't be something just any reporter would do. My role was more limited, and I can certainly use the money these days.""

Church spokesman Tommy Davis says that he recently received the approximately 20-page study and that it will not necessarily be made public. It was commissioned, he says, because ""we wanted to get an outside view"" of the situation. Davis, who would not disclose how much the reporters were paid, calls the report highly critical of the Times stories on the church.

Asked about Brown's view that the study could not possibly be objective, Davis says: ""It's easy for the St. Pete Times to pop off and say that, but oh, please. It's a normal thing. It's done all the time."" He likened the effort to CBS hiring an outside panel to investigate Dan Rather's 2004 story on George W. Bush and the National Guard, which the network later retracted. That report was a self-examination, however, and was made public.

The reporters hired for the study are Russell Carollo, who won a 1998 Pulitzer for Dayton, Ohio's Daily News for a series on medical malpractice in the U.S. military, and Christopher Szechenyi, an Emmy-winning former television producer who has worked for the Boston Globe's Web site.

Asked about taking on the assignment, the two chose to respond in a joint statement Sunday. ""We were hesitant,"" they said. ""That's why we insisted on being paid in full before we started our work, total editorial independence and having someone with the reputation of Steve Weinberg involved. Every entity has the right to receive fair treatment in the press.""

As for accepting payment from the church, they said: ""We were as objective in doing this job as we were in pursuing all the other assignments we've done for news organizations during the past 25 years.""",0,http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/21/AR2010022103692.html

Her confirmation hearing represents an opportunity for Republicans, so the first question is, when will it be held? Obama says he wants her confirmed “promptly.” No doubt! Pat Leahy–speaking of hyper-partisans–will run the Judiciary Committee until January, when the Republicans, led by Charles Grassley, will take over. Mitch McConnell said today that he thinks confirmation should be addressed by the new congress, following “regular order.” I don’t see how he can bring that about, however. Maybe I am missing some procedural wrinkle, but I would think the Democrats will be able to expedite her hearing and get her confirmed during the lame duck session.

But Republicans will still be able to ask questions, and there are many important ones to be posed. Eric Holder politicized the Department of Justice to a degree that has not been seen in our modern history, if ever. Holder appointed Lynch to the Attorney General’s Advisory Committee in 2010, and she has served as Chairman of that committee since 2013. Maybe the Advisory Committee is merely an honorary appointment. But Republicans should ask what input she has had over the last four years. Has she given advice to Holder on policy matters? Has the Advisory Committee been involved in any of Holder’s many controversies? Did Lynch ever try to dissuade Holder from his partisan misuse of DOJ? This seems like an important avenue of investigation.

Beyond that, Republicans should be able to wring some assurances from Ms. Lynch. Holder has disgracefully stonewalled Congressional investigators trying to get to the bottom of the Fast and Furious scandal for years. Will Lynch promise to stop the stonewalling and give Congressional investigators the materials–the remarkably limited materials–they are asking for?

Eric Holder has also been notorious for racial favoritism. He has addressed voting rights issues, for example, only where blacks have ostensibly been aggrieved. His dismissal of charges against the New Black Panthers–after they had already defaulted in DOJ’s action against them!–is the most famous, but by no means the only such instance. Republicans should extract a promise from Lynch to enforce the laws equally as to all races, and not favor her own race as Holder did.

Eric Holder also carried on a vicious campaign in favor of voter fraud. He aggressively persecuted states that took even the most modest measures to protect ballot integrity. Will Lynch do the same, or will she declare herself opposed to voter fraud?

Then of course there is immigration.",0,http://pjmedia.com/instapundit/198014/

241,Kurtz,Howard,pjmedia,"OBAMA’S LAST TWO YEARS: WATCH THE COURTS.

Only twice in the post-Civil War era has a President presented with a Supreme Court vacancy failed to fill it before leaving office.2 The most recent instance was nearly half a century ago, in 1968, when Chief Justice of the United States Earl Warren announced his intention to retire upon the confirmation of his successor. Outgoing President Lyndon B. Johnson nominated Justice Abe Fortas, his longtime friend and confidante whom he had appointed to the court in 1965, to replace Warren as Chief Justice. The Democratic-controlled Senate refused to confirm him, though, and Johnson withdrew his nomination in October 1968, along with the nomination of Homer Thornberry, a Federal appellate judge Johnson had nominated to replace Fortas. Warren stayed on as Chief Justice, and it fell to Johnson’s successor, President Richard Nixon, to fill the seat. Nixon picked Warren Burger as Chief Justice.

Prior to that, one has to go back to 1881 to find a court vacancy that was filled not by the sitting President but by his successor. President Rutherford B. Hayes made the controversial nomination of Stanley Matthews in 1881. The nomination came near the end of Hayes’s term, so the Senate did not act. New President James A. Garfield renominated Matthews, and he passed through the Senate by a slim 24–23 vote.

Despite the lack of any recent precedent for such a power play, nothing but public pressure and historical norms would stop the GOP from running out the clock until the end of Obama’s term on a Supreme Court nomination, potentially preserving the court opening for a Republican President, should one be elected in 2016.",0,http://pjmedia.com/instapundit/197850/

That’s true, but the rest of the article is mostly crap. Obama’s problem isn’t that he’s a “realist,” or that he sees the world in gray instead of black and white. It’s that he only cares about domestic political advantage — and sees that world very much in black and white — and he’s thin-skinned, egotistical, aloof, and maladroit when it comes to dealing with both political allies and political enemies.

That’s why he’s a lousy politician. So forget this conclusion:

That may be Obama’s ultimate legacy—more technician than tactician, and a man who, perhaps, had more faith in the American public’s ability to discern substance from style than was warranted. But another legacy was assured Tuesday night: The man who promised to fix politics was instead buried by them.

A 2010 email from Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack says his department was “waiting for the go-ahead” from the White House before accepting the resignation of employee Shirley Sherrod, according to newly released documents, despite Obama administration assertions that her ouster was Vilsack’s decision alone.

The email, which was made public Friday in an ongoing federal court case over the matter, shed more light on the evening of July 19, 2010, when the USDA hastily asked Sherrod to resign after a video showing her making supposed racist remarks surfaced on a conservative website. Her dismissal turned into a racial firestorm after it became clear that the video had been edited and her remarks were meant to tell a story of reconciliation.

Both the White House and Vilsack have repeatedly said the agriculture secretary made the decision to ask for Sherrod’s resignation without White House input. The emails, along with earlier emails obtained by The Associated Press under the Freedom of Information Act in 2010 and 2012, make it apparent that Vilsack wanted Sherrod to leave the department and ordered her resignation.

As Roxane Gay tweeted, ‘The racial politics of the video are fucked up. Like, she didn’t walk through any white neighborhoods?'”

Maybe she did.

UPDATE: Catcalls And The Death Of Chivalry.

After a brief search on social media, the video was being shared by several flamboyantly contrite men and enraged women. “Wow! I guess men still don’t get it.” “Men are disgusting animals.” “All you men should be ashamed of yourselves.” I didn’t have the slightest shame watching the video, nor should any male with whom I associate. We don’t catcall. Of course some guys are boors as are some women. I don’t need a video to prove that human nature is a thing. In the young woman’s 10-hour stroll through New York City, the video shows 20 incidents of harassment (two per hour), while text at the conclusion alleges more than 100. Some of the behavior is downright creepy while much isn’t disturbing at all. Apologies to the video editor, but “how you doing today,” “how are you this morning,” and “have a nice evening” hardly count as harassment. If they do, I’m violated by polite tourists, panhandlers, and assertive shopkeepers every time I stroll along a busy city street. All gentlemen agree that catcalling is a bad thing. In fact patriarchal Victorians were so disgusted by such rudeness, they enforced an elaborate public morality that elevated women with a higher level of respect. Thank goodness feminism and secularism drove a stake through chivalry’s heart.

Chivalry was a system, which imposed behavioral obligations on both women and men. Women found those obligations too onerous, but still expect men to shoulder them.

And let’s be honest. What makes these catcalls offensive isn’t that they come from men. It’s that they come from low-status men. Like an unconsented kiss from President Obama, if the catcalls came from George Clooney there’d be much less female outrage.

In fact, maybe these catcalls are a way of striking back at privilege. Any grievance-studies major should be able to flesh out this line of thought . . . .",0,http://pjmedia.com/instapundit/197470/

The lie that props up our Big Education regime is that the GI Bill, which paid for World War II veterans to attend college, produced the upward mobility and economic boom of the postwar period. It’s a heartwarming story, the veteran who would have been a dust farmer but for the grace of government generosity. But it just isn’t true. Only one out of every eight returning veterans attended college. The rest, the vast majority, benefited from something even more egalitarian: aptitude testing. The format favors raw talent above all else, allowing companies to hire high-potential candidates from any background and groom them to fit the company’s needs.

These tactics came to commerce from a familiar source.The armed services were forced to process hundreds of thousands of recruits during the war, and in order to filter and assign soldiers, the government developed aptitude tests. Businesses witnessed the U.S. defeat the two most efficient peoples known to man, thought there must be something to this whole testing thing, and followed suit. The chief hiring metric in the postwar era was not whether someone had a degree, but whether he had the aptitude that would enable him to succeed. Every industry from blue-blooded high finance to immigrant-heavy manufacturing employed testing to determine who would rise through the ranks, regardless of lineage, heritage, or education. Testing enabled men who set out to be blue-collar workers to ascend based solely on their ability. . . .

Two years ago I interviewed Den Black, a former automotive engineer at GM supplier Delphi whose pension was slashed to speed up the auto bailout. His backstory interested me nearly as much as his grievance with the Obama administration. A few years before the Supreme Court issued the Griggs decision, he set out to join his brother as a line-worker at General Motors. He hadn’t been the best student, didn’t care much for school, but submitted to the hiring exam. The test revealed that he had an advanced understanding of physics and mathematics. Within a few years, he was given the opportunity to take the entrance exam to General Motors University. After two years at GMU, where he combined shiftwork with education, he emerged an engineer in management. It’s no bachelor’s degree, but judging by the patents he helped generate, it was a worthy investment.

The Griggs decision has made that organic rise through the ranks impossible, as disparate impact left businesses liable for those who failed to pass hiring tests.

“Most legitimate job selection practices, including those that predict productivity better than alternatives, will routinely trigger liability under the current rule,” Wax wrote in a 2011 paper titled “Disparate Impact Realism.”

The solution for businesses post-Griggs was obvious: outsource screening to colleges, which are allowed to weed out poor candidates based on test scores. The bachelor’s degree, previously reserved for academics, doctors, and lawyers, became the de facto credential required for any white-collar job.",0,http://pjmedia.com/instapundit/197138/

As Nigeria heaves a collective sigh of relief after being declared free of Ebola, one woman is being widely praised for helping to ensure a more devastating outbreak was avoided.

Dr Stella Ameyo Adadevoh raised a red flag when attending to a Liberian patient at the First Consultant Hospital in Nigeria’s main city, Lagos, in July.

Patrick Sawyer had just flown into the country, already sick – he should never have been allowed on the plane.

Nigeria had never had an Ebola case before so it was an impressive piece of diagnostic work.

Whilst caring for Mr Sawyer and protecting the nation from the virus, Dr Adadevoh and her colleagues were themselves at great risk.

“From the day the index patient arrived in Nigeria, my father and I were constantly asking my mother and making sure she was OK. We were aware of what could come,” says Bankole Cardoso, Dr Adadevoh’s only son. . . .

During those early days caring for Mr Sawyer whilst awaiting the result of the blood test, Dr Adadevo came under intense pressure to let him leave – a move that could have had catastrophic consequences.

“The Liberian ambassador started calling Dr Adadevo, putting pressure on her and the institution. He felt we were kidnapping the gentleman and said it was a denial of his fundamental rights and we could face further actions,” says Dr Ohiaeri, adding that the hospital trusted Dr Adadevo’s judgment.",0,http://pjmedia.com/instapundit/197180/

Some of President Obama’s most ardent supporters have accused Republicans of “politicizing” the Ebola crisis. It’s not a terribly serious accusation; a public health emergency requires the response of many government agencies, so how could politics not be involved? There’s nothing wrong with that.

One specific charge, though, deserves an answer. The Ebola scare has made many Americans aware that there is no U.S. surgeon general. (The post is filled by an acting official who is not in line for the job.)

There is, however, an Obama nominee for surgeon general, Dr. Vivek Murthy, who has not been confirmed by the Senate after more than a year of waiting. Why hasn’t Murthy won Senate approval in all that time?

To hear some of the president’s advocates tell it, it’s the Republicans’ fault. “GOP blocks Surgeon General nominee,” tweeted Eric Boehlert of the pro-Obama group Media Matters. “After blocking surgeon general nominee, Republican blames Obama for surgeon general vacancy,” added another pro-Obama group, ThinkProgress. . . .

In February, the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee voted along party lines to send Murthy’s nomination to the full Senate. It has sat there ever since.

It would take just 51 of the Senate’s 55 Democrats to confirm Murthy. But that confirmation has not happened. “There is bipartisan opposition, so Sen. Reid hasn’t even tried to bring him to a vote,” says another senior Senate GOP aide.

By the way, Reid, who has never been shy about criticizing Republicans, is not among those publicly blaming the GOP for inaction on Murthy. A Reid spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.",0,http://pjmedia.com/instapundit/197055/

280,Kurtz,Howard,pjmedia,"FRANK BRUNI: I’m beginning to think this Obama chap isn’t as competent as we were told.

WE have no clue at this point how far Ebola could spread in the United States — and no reason for panic.

But one dimension of the disease’s toll is clear. It’s ravaging Americans’ already tenuous faith in the competence of our government and its bureaucracies.

Before President Obama’s election, we had Iraq, Katrina and the meltdown of banks supposedly under Washington’s watch. Since he came along to tidy things up, we’ve had the staggeringly messy rollout of Obamacare, the damnable negligence of the Department of Veterans Affairs and the baffling somnambulism of the Secret Service.

Now this. Although months of a raging Ebola epidemic in West Africa gave the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sufficient warning and ample time to get ready for any cases here, it was caught flat-footed, as its director, Tom Frieden, is being forced bit by bit to acknowledge. Weeks ago he assured us: “We are stopping Ebola in its tracks in this country.” Over recent days he updated that assessment, saying that “in retrospect, with 20/20 hindsight,” federal officials could and should have done more at the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas.

President Obama made his own assurances and then corrections. He said back in mid-September that “in the unlikely event that someone with Ebola does reach our shores, we’ve taken new measures so that we’re prepared here at home.”

Well, we weren’t wholly prepared, and the event was never unlikely: This country is a potent magnet for travelers, with a proudly (and rightly) open posture toward the world.",0,http://pjmedia.com/instapundit/196939/
281,Kurtz,Howard,pjmedia,"GOVERNMENT IS JUST ANOTHER WORD FOR THE THINGS WE CHOOSE TO DO TOGETHER: How the feds block Ebola cures.

We have technology to potentially control Ebola and other viral outbreaks today. But the federal bureaucracy refuses to catch up with 21st-century science.

For example, diagnostic startup Nanobiosym has an iPhone-sized device that can accurately detect Ebola and other infectious diseases in less than an hour.

Two other companies, Synthetic Genomics and Novartis, have the capacity to create synthetic vaccine viruses for influenza and other infectious diseases in only four days. Both firms can also share data about outbreaks instantaneously and make real-time, geographically specific diagnosis and vaccine production possible.

These companies could start producing Ebola vaccine/treatments tomorrow — except that the Food and Drug Administration’s insistence on randomized studies and endless demands for more data means firms have to spend millions on paperwork instead of producing medicines.

And for every small company drained by such tactics, many others conclude it’s not even worth trying.

These advances aren’t available because the FDA is using 19th-century science to decide which medical technologies should be used in the 21st century. . . . Part of the problem: FDA scientists receive no reward for approving breakthroughs, but suffer public anger if but one person dies because a drug is misused. The price we pay for this culture of caution rises every day.",0,http://pjmedia.com/instapundit/196911/

285,Kurtz,Howard,washingtonpost,"A 24-year-old conservative blogger hired by The Washington Post Co.'s Web site resigned yesterday, three days after his debut, amid a flurry of allegations of plagiarism.

Ben Domenech, an editor with Regnery Publishing, relinquished the part-time position hours after a liberal Web site posted evidence that he had plagiarized part of a movie review he wrote for National Review Online. Previous allegations of plagiarism in Domenech's writing for the College of William & Mary student newspaper surfaced Wednesday, but the 2001 review was the first instance found since he attended the college.

While liberal bloggers objected to the fact of Domenech's hiring and his inflammatory language, such as calling Coretta Scott King a ""communist,"" it was not until they gathered evidence showing he had repeatedly used material without attribution that some conservative bloggers joined in calls for his firing.

Jim Brady, executive editor of Washingtonpost.com, which operates independently from the newspaper, said he would have dismissed Domenech if the former Bush administration aide and Republican Senate staffer had not offered to quit first. He said there was ""enough smoke"" in the allegations of plagiarism ""that we needed to sever the relationship.""

Brady said his staff did ""a fair amount of checking"" into Domenech's background before the hiring but that ""we could have and should have done a better job.""

On liberal blogs and Web sites -- Salon's lead story yesterday was ""A Portrait of the Blogger as a Young Plagiarist"" -- many commentators said there was no equivalence between a Republican activist who co-founded the site RedState.com and Post.com journalists who are viewed as leaning to the left. Brady said that was a ""fair criticism"" and one he will keep in mind in looking for another conservative blogger. ""We're certainly likely to look for someone with a more traditional journalism background,"" he said.

Domenech said yesterday he resigned because ""if the firestorm gets past a certain level, there's nothing you can ever say that will be taken seriously. . . . It's reached the point where there's nothing I can really do to defend myself.""

Despite the pattern of plagiarized articles, Domenech still maintains that he did not knowingly use other people's writing without attribution. He said most of the allegations, from his time at the William & Mary student paper, were from his freshman year, and that while he believes the unattributed material was inserted by his editor, he cannot prove it. ""When I was 17, I was certainly sloppy,"" said Domenech, who did not graduate from college. ""If I had paid more attention, none of these problems would have happened.""

The liberal blogger Atrios (Duncan Black) found that one Domenech article at the student paper, the Flat Hat, lifted large portions of a 1999 Washington Post story on the federal investigation of the Waco siege.

Daily Kos, a Web site edited by liberal activist Markos Moulitsas, posted a comparison of Domenech's National Review piece on the film ""Final Fantasy"" and a review by Steve Murray of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

Murray had written:

""Translucent and glowing, they ooze up from the ground and float through solid walls, wriggling countless tentacles and snapping their jaws. They're known as the Phantoms, alien thingies that, for three decades, have been sucking the life out of the earthlings of 'Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within.' ""

Domenech wrote:

""Translucent and glowing, they ooze up from the ground and float through solid walls, splaying their tentacles and snapping their jaws, dripping a discomfiting acidic ooze. They're known as the Phantoms, otherworldly beings who, for three decades, have been literally sucking the life out of the earthlings of the human.""

Domenech said he thought his piece appeared first, but a database review found that Murray's review was published three days earlier.

Michelle Malkin, a prominent conservative blogger, wrote before the resignation that Domenech had edited one of her books and she had been cheering for him. ""But now the determined moonbat hordes have exposed multiple instances of what clearly appear to me to be blatant lifting of entire, unique passages by Ben from other writers."" That, Malkin said, is ""unacceptable. . . . And, painfully, Domenech's detractors are right. He should own up to it and step down. Then, the Left should cease its sick gloating and leave him and his family alone.""

Rick Moran, who runs the site Right Wing Nuthouse, wrote on the American Thinker blog: ""The plagiarism of Mr. Domenech cannot be chalked up to youthful indiscretion nor to some kind of unconscious parroting of something he read before putting words to paper. . . . Ben Domenech is not the kind of writer we want representing the conservative viewpoint at The Washington Post or anywhere else.""",0,http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/24/AR2006032401206.html

This country is in the midst of a quirky wave election, one that is hard to define and doesn’t want to be labeled. The electorate is moving separately toward the middle of each party and away from the political red meat that pundits and strategists use to drive up wedge issues and voter turnout.

Fading on the right is the control once exercised by such groups as Heritage Action, Club for Growth, FreedomWorks and anything with “tea party” attached to its name.

Same for the left: MoveOn and Organizing for America are not the influencers they once were with Democrats, who largely feel their support of President Obama has not gotten them what they expected.

They were told by these progressive groups that they would get an efficient, engaged, compassionate, transparent leader who would stand up for the little guy. Instead, they got a dispassionate, disengaged figurehead who has divided the country by race, gender and equity, who mouths all the right phrases to get elected but displays no leadership when things get tough.

If Pennsylvania truly is a bellwether state that gives political scientists a way to gauge what is happening in coming elections, then pay attention to what it is telling them after last week’s primary. A restless electorate, weary of strident ideology and class warfare, longs for effective, responsible and transparent governing — and to hell with the political hell-raisers.

People want leadership to be outraged by the scandals that rip apart lives (such as the mishandling of patients by Veterans Affairs) or that pick political winners and losers (as in the IRS targeting of conservatives).

311,Kurtz,Howard,pjmedia,"TODD ZYWICKI on “Operation Choke Point.”

The Justice Department’s “Operation Choke Point” initiative has been shrouded in secrecy, but now it is starting to come to light. I first heard about the program in January through this article and since then it has been difficult to discover details about it. It is so named because through strangling the providers of financial services to the targeted industries, the government can “choke off” the oxygen (money) needed for these industries to survive. Without an ability to process payments, the businesses – especially online vendors — cannot survive.

The general outline is the DOJ and bank regulators are putting the screws to banks and other third-party payment processors to refuse banking services to companies and industries that are deemed to pose a “reputation risk” to the bank. Most controversially, the list of dubious industries is populated by enterprises that are entirely, or at least generally, legal. Tom Blumer’s extremely informative post summarizing what is known to date about Operation Choke Point reproduces the list, which includes things such as ammunition sales, escort services, get-quick-rich schemes, on-line gambling, “racist materials” and payday loans. Quite obviously, some of these things are not like the other; moreover, just because there are some bad apples within a legal industry doesn’t justify effectively destroying a legal industry through secret executive fiat.

Especially ironic, of course, is that while the DOJ and bank regulators are choking off financial services to legal industries, they are also encouraging banks to provide banking services to illegal marijuana sales. . . . The larger legal and regulatory issue here is the expansive use of the vague and subjective standard of “reputation risk” to target these industries. In a letter to Janet Yellen, the chair of the Federal Reserve, last week, House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling expressed concern over the growing use of “reputation risk” as a vehicle for attacking legal businesses. Is there any discernible principle as to why, for example, a payday lender or firearms dealer poses a “reputation risk” and an abortion provider does not?",0,http://pjmedia.com/instapundit/189216/

UPDATE: A contrary take. “It’s an absolutely ridiculous charge. What Amazon is actually doing is refusing to continue its extreme discounting on the artificially high retail price of books. Castalia House has no issue with Amazon, and Amazon doesn’t discount its prices on our ebooks much because they are already in the price range that Amazon expects: 2.99 to 4.99. But publishers that price their ebooks at $15.99 are in trouble, because no one wants to pay actual retail price for them on Amazon. . . . No wonder Amazon is unwilling to continue this arrangement. Amazon can only sell its books up to a certain price, depending upon the format and length. Due to the distribution discount system, a higher retail price means a higher distribution price, so Amazon makes half the margin on the more expensive, more steeply discounted books from the major publishers. Amazon is not only perfectly within its rights, but logically needs to stop discounting the book from what is, after all, the publisher’s suggested retail price; Hatchette’s complaint is rooted in the fact that Amazon is now selling its books for the price that Hatchette itself suggests!”",0,http://pjmedia.com/instapundit/189205/

Eight percent of the population now holds Master’s degrees, the same percentage that held bachelor’s degrees (or higher) in the 1960s, reports Vox.

319,Kurtz,Howard,washingtonpost,"Dean Baquet, who was ousted as editor of the Los Angeles Times last fall after refusing to make sweeping budget cuts demanded by his corporate bosses, is coming to Washington.

Baquet is rejoining the New York Times, where he worked for a decade, and will take over the paper's Washington bureau, ending speculation that he might try to regain his old job if the Tribune Co. sells the Los Angeles paper.

""I know this will make some people at the L.A. Times sad, and leaving the L.A. Times was a sad experience for me,"" Baquet said yesterday. But he said he is excited to come to Washington ""while there is a debate over the war, and an election that will be the most exciting since 1968.""

Asked about Baquet's public defiance of Tribune executives, New York Times Executive Editor Bill Keller said: ""I admire Dean's stance tremendously. I think he'll find the business side at the New York Times much more in tune with his values. . . . What Dean brings to everything he does is infectious enthusiasm and aggressive intelligence.""

Baquet said he had no ""inside knowledge"" whether Tribune, which has accepted bids for a possible sale of the company, might spin off the California paper. He said he had ""some casual conversations"" with two billionaires, Eli Broad and Ron Burkle, who have submitted a bid to purchase Tribune, and that ""obviously, I thought there was a chance I could go back"" as editor if they bought the paper.

""But it became clearer and clearer that wasn't likely to happen on a timetable that works for me, and the New York Times was clearer in telling me they wanted me back. . . . I hope and pray things work out really well at the L.A. Times.""

The news was greeted with disappointment in Los Angeles, where many Times staffers are furious with Tribune for driving out Baquet and the former publisher, Jeffrey Johnson, who had also battled the Chicago-based company over budget cuts.

""It's a stunning loss for us, and people here are really, really disappointed,"" said Vernon Loeb, the paper's investigations editor. ""We've all been clinging to a slender reed of hope that he would come back. . . . But now that the inevitable has happened, Dean's loss -- once and for all -- is like a punch in the stomach.""

But Doyle McManus, who runs the Los Angeles Times bureau here, was more pugnacious, saying in a memo that his team would kick the rival bureau's butt. ""To be low-minded about it,"" McManus wrote, ""well, it will still be the NY Times, still encumbered by that paper's institutional weaknesses and still, even with Dean on the premises, an often unpleasant place to work.""

Baquet, who takes over March 5, will replace Philip Taubman, who will receive the title of associate editor and a reporting assignment involving national security, based in California. His wife, New York Times environmental reporter Felicity Barringer, will cover her beat from there.

Taubman said he is looking forward to resuming a ""writerly life,"" adding: ""I'll be leaving the bureau in great hands and with a sense of great satisfaction about the stories the Times has broken in Washington on my watch,"" including the disclosure of President Bush's domestic eavesdropping program.

Baquet, 50, a New Orleans native, is a smooth-talking editor with a blunt style, a passion for investigative reporting and a knack for inspiring loyalty among his troops. He won a Pulitzer Prize at the Chicago Tribune in 1988, and was national editor of the New York Times when he left to become managing editor of the Los Angeles Times in 2000.

Five years later, when John Carroll, the L.A. Times' top editor, quit, in part out of frustration with Tribune budget-cutting, Baquet became the first black editor in the paper's history. The paper won 14 Pulitzer Prizes during Baquet's tenure as editor and managing editor.

But like many big-city papers, the L.A. Times has suffered from declining circulation and revenue. In September, Baquet threatened to quit if the Tribune didn't scale back its plan for another round of deep newsroom reductions. The newsroom staff of the Times had declined from 1,200 to 940 over five years, and the newspaper said Tribune executives wanted to shrink the staff to about 800.

Word leaked on Election Day that Baquet had been fired. He was replaced by the Chicago Tribune's managing editor, James O'Shea.

""We'd made significant cuts at the paper,"" Baquet said yesterday. ""I understand the economics of newspapers. We just got to the point where continued cutting was going to significantly damage the paper. I didn't feel it was my job to make a paper worse. I have no regrets. I couldn't live with myself if I had done it.""

Keller said he and other editors stayed in touch with Baquet but ""didn't do what you'd call active recruiting until his final weeks in L.A."" Baquet said he has read most of Philip Roth's novels and is eager to get back in the game.

Asked whether becoming a bureau chief is a step down, Baquet said: ""My favorite thing to do at newspapers is to sit down with reporters and talk about stories, to shape coverage, and I'll get to do a million times more of that than I did as editor of a paper.""",0,http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/30/AR2007013001804.html

The curious thing about September 11, 2012 — the day of the Benghazhi attack — is that for some reason it marks the decline of the Obama presidency as clearly as a milepost. We are told by the papers that nothing much happened on that day. A riot in a far-away country. A few people killed. And yet … it may be coincidental, but from that day the administration’s foreign policy seemed inexplicably hexed. The Arab Spring ground to a halt. The Secretary of State ‘resigned’. The CIA Director was cast out in disgrace. Not long after, Obama had to withdraw his Red Line in Syria. Al-Qaeda, whose eulogy he had pronounced appeared with disturbing force throughout Africa, South Asia and the Arabian Peninsula. Almost as if on cue, Russia made an unexpected return to the world stage, first in Syria, then in the Iranian nuclear negotiations.

Worse was to follow. America’s premier intelligence organization, the National Security Agency, was taken apart in public and the man who took its secrets, Edward Snowden, decamped to Moscow with a laptop full of secrets.

326,Kurtz,Howard,pjmedia,"THE WISCONSIN GESTAPO: George Will’s latest column is a terrific condemnation of the Gestapo tactics used by the prosecutors pursuing a “John Doe” investigation of conservative issue advocacy groups in Wisconsin:

Wisconsin’s sordid episode began, appropriately, with a sound of tyranny — fists pounding on the doors of private citizens in pre-dawn raids. While sheriff’s deputies used floodlights to illuminate the citizens’ homes, armed raiders seized documents, computers, cellphones and other devices. . . .

Liberals inveighing against “dark money” in politics mean money contributed anonymously to finance political advocacy. Donors’ anonymity thwarts liberals’ efforts to injure the livelihoods of identifiable conservatives by punishing them for their political participation and thereby deterring others from participating.

O’Keefe’s persecution illustrates the problem his lawyer David Rivkin calls “dark power” — government power wielded secretively for vengeance and intimidation.

There is literally no reason to treat conservative groups who engage in “issue advocacy”– i.e., talking about issues they believe are important–as common criminals, busting down their doors in the middle of the night with battering rams and scaring their families. There was no reason any searches of computers or papers could not have been conducted in daylight, when the kids were at school. The only reason to use these tactics was to intimidate. This fact alone reveals the true purpose of this investigation: to use a special Wisconsin law, allowing secretive and broad investigatory power to intimidate vocal conservative groups in the state and chill/stop them from exercising their First Amendment rights. This is a disgusting abuse of power and I hope, once this civil rights action is adjudicated on the merits, that the prosecutors are forced to pay for their abuse of power, not only financially, but with a loss of their licenses to practice law.",0,http://pjmedia.com/instapundit/188512/

Saturday, January 8, 2005; Page A01

The Education Department paid commentator Armstrong Williams $241,000 to help promote President Bush's No Child Left Behind law on the air, an arrangement that Williams acknowledged yesterday involved ""bad judgment"" on his part.

In taking the money, funneled through the Ketchum Inc. public relations firm, Williams produced and aired a commercial on his syndicated television and radio shows featuring Education Secretary Roderick R. Paige, touted Bush's education policy, and urged other programs to interview Paige. He did not disclose the contract when talking about the law during cable television appearances or writing about it in his newspaper column.





_____Live Discussion_____

 Live, Monday, Jan. 10, noon ET: Armstrong Williams will be online to discuss the controversy surrounding his payment by the Education Department to promote No Child Left Behind.





Congressional Democrats immediately accused the administration of trying to bribe journalists. Williams's newspaper syndicate, Tribune Media Services, yesterday canceled his column. And one television network dropped his program pending an investigation.

Williams, one of the most prominent black conservatives in the media, said he understands ""why some people think it's unethical."" Asked if people would be justified in thinking he sold his opinions to the government for cash, he said: ""It's fair for someone to make that assessment.""

The Education Department contract, first reported yesterday by USA Today, increased criticism of the administration's aggressive approach to news management. The department already has paid Ketchum $700,000 to rate journalists on how positively or negatively they report on No Child Left Behind, and to produce a video release on the law that was used by some television stations as if it were real news. Other government agencies -- including the Census Bureau and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- also have distributed such prepackaged videos, a practice that congressional auditors have described as illegal in some cases.

The Williams incident follows a series of other media embarrassments in the past 18 months involving such high-profile outlets as the New York Times, USA Today and CBS News that have further eroded the credibility of the news business.

Rep. George Miller (Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the House education committee, said the Williams contract ""is propaganda, it's unethical, it's dangerous and it's illegal"" and called it ""worthy of Pravda."" Committee Chairman John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) agreed to join Miller in requesting an inspector general's investigation, a spokesman said.

Miller cited two Government Accountability Office opinions that the administration violated federal law with video news releases. In May, the GAO criticized the Department of Health and Human Services for using the technique to promote Medicare's new prescription drug benefit. This week, it criticized the Office of National Drug Control Policy for distributing similar reports with a contractor posing as a journalist, including a ""suggested live intro"" for anchors to read.

Miller, joined by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and other Democrats, asked Bush in a letter to put an end to ""covert propaganda.""

In a separate letter, Senate Minority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) and Sens. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.) and Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) asked the president to recover the money paid to Williams. ""We believe that the act of bribing journalists to bias their news in favor of government policies undermines the integrity of our democracy,"" they wrote.

The Education Department defended the contract, which Paige knew about in advance, as a minority outreach effort through Williams's syndicated program, ""The Right Side.""

""Our contract was for advertising,"" said department spokesman John Gibbons. ""Our intent was to reach out to minority audiences. Armstrong went out and talked about it -- we didn't have anything to do with that.""

But the contract also required Williams to ""utilize his long term working relationship"" with black producers to ""encourage"" them to ""periodically address the No Child Left Behind Act.""",0,http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A56330-2005Jan7.html

This is going to happen: sooner or later, some CEO or sports team owner or similar is going to get ousted because he or she supports a woman’s right to an abortion, or the cause of Palestinian statehood, or opposes the death penalty. It’s inevitable. I can easily see someone suggesting that, say, Israel is an apartheid state, and watching as the media whips itself into a frenzy. And when that happens, the notion that there is no such thing as a violation of free speech that isn’t the government literally sending men with guns to arrest you will be just as powerful, and powerfully destructive, as it is now. So what will these people say? I don’t have the slightest idea how they will be able to defend the right of people to hold controversial, left-wing political ideas when they have come up with a thousand arguments for why the right to free expression doesn’t apply in any actual existing case. How will Isquith write a piece defending a CEO’s right to oppose Israeli apartheid? A sports owner’s right to do the same? I can’t see how he could– unless it really is just all about teams, and not about principle at all.

To follow up on Sarah’s link to this post earlier, the left’s PC round-up of the last few years will quickly be forgotten once there’s a Republican in the White House — and in any case, all attempts at ousting someone for his leftwing views are easily explained away by those 60 year old catch-all words: McCarthyism and Blacklisting.

339,Kurtz,Howard,washingtonpost,"David Bradley had been trying to lure Jeffrey Goldberg to the Atlantic for more than two years.

Bradley, the magazine's owner, wrote flattering letters. He courted Goldberg at a McDonald's on Wisconsin Avenue. He proffered a hefty signing bonus. And when the New Yorker's Washington correspondent finally seemed receptive to making the move, Bradley sent in the ponies.

""He's incredibly persistent and makes you feel like you're God's gift to journalism,"" says Goldberg, who had turned Bradley down once before. But that was before the horses showed up at his home to entertain his children. ""The charm is incredibly disarming,"" says Goldberg, who joined the Atlantic last month.

Bradley excelled at hiring top talent long before he got into the media business. But since moving the Atlantic from Boston to Washington two years ago (after vowing not to), he has sought out -- with an open checkbook -- some of the Beltway's best and brightest.

""Everyone has particular gifts,"" says Bradley, a soft-spoken man who exudes self-effacement. ""George Will can write 800 words on anything. Mine is seeing gifts in other people and recruiting them.""

Bradley made his millions at corporate research firms he founded, sifting through 50,000 applicants a year, before buying such media properties as National Journal and the Hotline.

""In this business, the talent is that much more unique,"" he says. ""It's so much more ephemeral what makes a good writer.""

James Bennet was a New York Times correspondent, and was excited about moving to the Beijing bureau, when Bradley approached him. He wanted Bennet to become editor of the Atlantic.

""He just sat me down for a couple of long conversations about what I was in journalism for, before I realized I was a candidate for the job,"" Bennet says. ""He kind of interviews you about your life. He is a tremendously persuasive guy."" Bennet took the job last year.

Part of what Bradley is selling is a commitment to long-form journalism, at a time when there are few quality outlets for those who believe in the power of nonfiction narrative. But what Goldberg calls ""smart-bomb flattery"" doesn't hurt, and neither do salaries for top journalists ranging as high as $350,000.

""Money is a factor in every situation,"" Bradley says. ""I don't want people taking salary cuts to come write for us. But it doesn't get you across the finish line."" The big salaries have stirred some jealousy among the rank and file, tempered by gratitude that the owner isn't cutting back during a tough time for the news business.

Bradley also uses his wallet in the political arena. At a time when many news organizations ban contributions by journalists, he has given $4,300 to Hillary Clinton, $2,300 to Barack Obama and $2,300 to Mitt Romney in the presidential race.",0,http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/05/AR2007080501576.html
340,Kurtz,Howard,washingtonpost,"A Running Start? Sen. John McCain, the Media's Man of the Hour A McCain presidential bid in 2000? Many in the media think the idea isn't far-fetched. (Reuters)

By Howard Kurtz

Washington Post Staff Writer

Monday, June 8, 1998; Page D01 MANCHESTER, N.H.John McCain didn't get to his 10th-floor Holiday Inn room until 1 a.m., but six hours later he's knotting his elephant-studded tie, picking up the phone and greeting two local radio hosts like old friends. The Arizona senator recites his litany on the evils of teenage smoking, then abruptly invokes his daughter. ""Like every other 13-year-old in America, she's in love with Leonardo DiCaprio, who I think is an androgynous wimp,"" he barks. ""You know what he does throughout the whole movie 'Titanic'? He smokes."" In an era of carefully marketed candidates serving up carefully tailored rhetoric, it's little wonder that McCain is a media magnet. He is a blunt-spoken war hero who doesn't blink at castigating his fellow Republicans. ""A lot of times I say things that get me in trouble,"" McCain admits. On this foray last week to the hallowed ground of the first presidential primary, NBC's Gwen Ifill is trailing McCain for a ""Today"" show segment. Reporter Edwin Chen is profiling him for the Philadelphia Inquirer's magazine. C-SPAN's cameras record his remarks to a women's luncheon. Carl Bernstein couldn't make the trip, but he's working on a major Vanity Fair piece. Esquire has already weighed in with this headline: ""JOHN McCAIN WALKS ON WATER."" The media's fascination with McCain transcends his maverick style. Nor can it be fully explained by his cheerful accessibility (he recently got up at 3 a.m. to appear on ""Face the Nation"" while in Hawaii celebrating his 18th wedding anniversary). The plain truth is that a growing number of journalists want John McCain to run for president. The fact that he's just flirting with the idea makes him all the more desirable. Mike Wallace, who turned down the chance to be Richard Nixon's press secretary, says of McCain: ""I'm thinking I may quit my job if he gets the nomination. . . . I'm impressed by his independence, by his willingness to take on the tough ones. By his honesty about himself. As I look at the current crop, there's something authentic about this man."" David Nyhan, a Boston Globe columnist, has introduced McCain at luncheons attended by his colleagues and other movers and shakers. While he is a liberal and McCain a conservative, Nyhan says, ""I like him because he's gutsy. I like him because he's an interesting person. I like what he did on campaign finance. I like what he's done on tobacco. I like his war record. . . . There's an army out there waiting for this guy."" Al Hunt has written in his Wall Street Journal column that McCain ""is the most courageous and one of the most admirable men I've ever known in American politics."" Columnist Mark Shields has touted the appeal of ""McCain's against-the-grain leadership coupled with his riveting personal history."" Esquire's Charles Pierce put it this way: ""If John McCain doesn't run, the mandarins of the chattering class may throw [an] ensemble hissy fit."" The journalistic chorus for McCain has grown loud enough that South Carolina's State newspaper reported that some Republicans ""already are grumbling that he is a creation of the 'liberal' Washington media."" But conservative news outlets also seem to admire the man. ""This senator bends, but he never breaks,"" said a front-page Washington Times headline. As the flavor of the month, McCain is the latest beneficiary of a tradition in which much of the press swoons over a favorite presidential contender. In 1988, it was another Arizonan, long-shot Bruce Babbitt. In '92, before he was battered by womanizing and draft-dodging charges, Bill Clinton was winning rave reviews; later on, journalists became enamored of war hero Bob Kerrey. In the run up to '96, some leading pundits were practically begging Colin Powell to get into the race. It is an article of faith among journalists that anyone who lusts after the presidency is too consumed by ambition to be fully trusted. McCain, however, is running for president by not quite running. Unlike, say, Lamar Alexander, who seems to have been pursuing the job since kindergarten, McCain gives the appearance of only casually dipping his toe in the campaign waters. But the early embrace of the press only goes so far. After giving a candidate the big buildup, journalists are the first to tear him down in the blistering heat of the primary season. Previously endearing qualities are written off as political amateurism. Many reporters were attracted to Gary Hart's Young Turk image in 1984; three years later they were savaging him over his relationship with Donna Rice. ""After the first flush of romance, things have a way of fading,"" Ifill says. ""You have to answer a lot of dumb questions from a lot of dumb reporters before you can get elected."" At a news conference in nearby Windham, McCain told local reporters that he won't think about 2000 until after he wins a third term this fall. He said he wants to fully discuss the matter with his wife and four children back in Phoenix, and to make sure he could be ""truly competitive"" in a White House bid. But in a conversation during a ride between stops, McCain suggests it would simply be impolitic for him to voice his presidential ambitions out loud. ""One way to jeopardize my reelection would be to run for both offices at the same time,"" he says. Former New Hampshire senator Warren Rudman, McCain's host for the day, makes clear he is ready to run his old friend's Granite State campaign. And he says McCain is smart to pick his spots. ""Don't come up here every other week like Lamar,"" he says. ""People are sick of that."" As chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, McCain is getting plenty of ink and air time as the point man on Washington's biggest battles. It is McCain who has taken on his party by joining with Wisconsin Democrat Russ Feingold in the uphill struggle for campaign finance reform. It is McCain, a former smoker, who has joined with the Clinton White House in trying to fashion a tobacco bill that can both impose harsh measures on the industry and win congressional approval. He wants to close more military bases (unpopular in New Hampshire) and end ethanol subsidies (heresy in Iowa). ""John McCain intrigues reporters because he seems to be a maverick,"" says Ifill. ""He takes on popular issues that can't necessarily pass, and we like that. Plus he's a war hero, and we're kind of desperate for heroes."" But McCain also must play to other constituencies. He serves up a bit of red meat to the New Hampshire Federation of Republican Women, attacking the White House for scandalous behavior. ""Are you proud of an administration that sells its principles to the highest bidder? Are you proud when the bedroom of our greatest president is rented by the night, and the president of the United States serves as the bellboy?"" But he muddies the message by saying he is ""ashamed"" of a big-bucks political culture crying out for campaign finance reform  the very reform that many Republican leaders are resisting. The senator is a sound-bite machine, saying again and again that 3,000 kids a day start smoking, 1,000 will die early and declaring, without qualification, that stiffer tobacco taxes will deter them. He also speaks with authority on foreign policy, decrying the nuclear arms race between India and Pakistan on ABC's ""This Week"" and repeating his warnings, sometimes verbatim, in every New Hampshire interview. All this translates into sky-high visibility. On this day, McCain's press secretary, Nancy Ives, shows him the day's haul: A front-page New York Times story quotes him on boxing regulation. A front-page Washington Post story quotes his talk show remarks on India and Pakistan. Newsweek uses a line from his tribute to the late Barry Goldwater, which he wrote for The Post. McCain says the two things he offers reporters  candor and accessibility  pay dividends. ""At least 50 of those Republican women said to me, 'I see you on television all the time,' "" McCain says. ""It kind of enhances your status with them if they think you're a national figure."" The reaction is even greater, he says, after he chews the fat with morning man Don Imus. But McCain is more than a political entertainer. The admiral's son has the unmistakable aura of the decorated pilot who was cruelly beaten during 5 1/2 years in what he calls ""the slammer,"" a North Vietnamese prison camp. What's more, he refused an offer of early release until his comrades were set free as well. McCain doesn't talk much about those days, but he doesn't have to. He even dispenses with a line in his speech about the tobacco negotiations. ""I don't think I had that much fun since my last prison interrogation,"" the text said. For all his walking-on-water publicity, McCain knows what it's like to be submerged in bad publicity. He took some knocks for fooling around on his disabled first wife, who had waited for him during his POW internment, and then divorcing her. Media coverage, he says, ""can change in a New York minute."" McCain recalls being on ""Face the Nation"" in the late 1980s when moderator Lesley Stahl looked at the day's papers and said, ""You're everywhere."" ""I puffed up a little bit,"" he says. Hours later, his spokeswoman told him there was a story naming him as one of the Keating Five  a group of senators who had pressured federal regulators over their treatment of savings and loan kingpin Charles Keating, who had given, in McCain's case, $112,000 in contributions. ""That began three of the most difficult years of my life,"" McCain says. ""Not the most difficult, but among the most difficult."" He does not need to elaborate. A day with McCain gradually makes clear why he courts journalists and values what he calls his ""credibility with the media."" An unorthodox Republican who often infuriates his own party, he is in the end selling himself, and he needs reporters to deliver that message. ""If people think you're liked by some in the media because you're liberal, then it's a great political risk,"" he says. ""But if people in and out of the media admire you because you stand up for what you believe in . . . it's a very fine line."" Still, McCain can't resist departing from the script. Waiting for his flight home at the Boston airport, he recalls once making a ""smartass remark"" about Newt Gingrich  to wit, that the House speaker's approval ratings were lower than Jeffrey Dahmer's. McCain sent Gingrich a letter of apology; his press secretary winces when he resurrects the matter. Such wisecracks could damage McCain in the heat of a presidential campaign, if the journalists' dreams come true and he jumps into the race. But the alternative, he says, is ""not being myself, not using humor, which would make life even more boring. At age 61, I'm not going to change.""

By Howard Kurtz

Washington Post Staff Writer

Thursday, February 25, 1999; Page A15 Juanita Broaddrick told her story to a national television audience last night, saying she did not tell authorities 21 years ago of her contention that Bill Clinton sexually assaulted her because ""I just don't think anyone would have believed me."" In a gripping account punctuated by sobs, the Arkansas woman told ""Dateline NBC"" that in her Little Rock hotel room, Clinton suddenly ""turned me around and started kissing me, and that was a real shock. I first pushed him away. I just told him 'no.' . . . He tries to kiss me again. He starts biting on my lip. . . . And then he forced me down on the bed. I just was very frightened. I tried to get away from him. I told him 'no.' . . . He wouldn't listen to me."" But Broaddrick could not remember the date, even the month, of the alleged 1978 incident. And NBC's Lisa Myers reported that Broaddrick, a volunteer in Clinton's first gubernatorial campaign, attended a Clinton fund-raiser three weeks later. ""I think I was still in denial,"" Broaddrick said. ""I still felt very guilty at that time, that it was my fault. By letting him come to the room, I had given him the wrong idea."" Asked about Broaddrick's allegation at a news conference earlier in the day, President Clinton said: ""Well, my counsel has made a statement about the . . . issue, and I have nothing to add to it."" Attorney David E. Kendall's statement called the charge ""absolutely false."" The nursing home operator, previously known as Jane Doe No. 5, told Myers that she felt ""violated"" but finally stopped resisting Clinton's sexual advances because ""it was a real panicky situation."" She said that ""he was just a vicious, awful person."" Pressed by Myers as to whether she was raped, Broaddrick said she had been. ""It was not consensual,"" she insisted. As for her feelings now toward the president, Broaddrick said: ""My hatred for him is overwhelming."" NBC's decision to broadcast the Jan. 20 interview after a month of heated internal debate dramatically boosts the visibility of Clinton's latest accuser, since ""Dateline"" normally draws an audience of more than 10 million households. Broaddrick has already given her account of the alleged 1978 incident, when Clinton was Arkansas attorney general, to the Wall Street Journal editorial page, The Washington Post and, in an article published yesterday, the New York Times. Had NBC aired the interview during the Senate impeachment trial and the furor over Monica S. Lewinsky, it might have had a significant impact on the political climate. Whether the story has any lasting significance now, outside the context of any legal or impeachment proceeding, is unclear. NBC executives say the Myers report needed further checking and corroboration before it could be broadcast. Broaddrick was dubbed Jane Doe No. 5 in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit against Clinton early last year, when Jones's attorneys cited her in court papers and she filed an affidavit calling the allegation of sexual assault ""untrue."" In the interview, Broaddrick, 56, said: ""I didn't want to be forced to testify about the most horrific event of my life."" Broaddrick later recanted that affidavit when questioned by FBI agents working for independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr, who found her account inconclusive. Two of the House impeachment ""managers"" spoke to Broaddrick but did not pursue her allegation. Broaddrick told NBC she considered coming forward last year, after Kathleen E. Willey accused the president of groping her in the Oval Office. But, she said, ""I just wasn't brave enough to do it."" Dabbing at her eye with a tissue, Broaddrick said she agreed to go on camera because ""I just couldn't hold it in any longer."" She said she did not want her grandchildren to ask: ""Why didn't you tell what this man did to you?"" NBC interviewed four friends who say Broaddrick told them about the alleged assault soon afterward, including Norma Kelsey, who said she saw Broaddrick's swollen lip and torn pantyhose that day. But the man Broaddrick was married to at the time, Gary Hickey, told NBC he did not remember the injury or her attempt to blame it on an accident. Myers said divorce records show Broaddrick's claim of an altercation in which she says Hickey hit her in the mouth. But she said this was a one-time incident. As she has in her newspaper interviews, Broaddrick recounted how Clinton tried to apologize to her in 1991 and said he was a changed man. ""I told him to go to hell, and I walked off,"" she said. Broaddrick said she is pursuing no book deal or lawsuit, but that ""all of these stories are floating around . . . and I was tired of everybody putting their own spin on it."" Myers asked: ""What is the purpose? Do you want to destroy the president?"" ""No, I don't want to do anything,"" Broaddrick said. ""I do not have an agenda. I want to put all of these rumors to rest."" NBC said the White House would not answer questions about Clinton's whereabouts on April 25, 1978, the day records show Broaddrick attended a nursing home conference at Little Rock's now-defunct Camelot Hotel. But the network said Arkansas newspaper accounts suggest Clinton was in Little Rock that day – he had no public schedule during the period of the alleged assault – and attended a fund-raiser in a nearby town that evening. Lanny J. Davis, former White House special counsel, assailed the Broaddrick story before the broadcast, saying: ""Is journalism about reporting facts or not? Where have we gone when an unsubstantiated allegation becomes a fact if others report it? It is not corroborated because her girlfriend saw her with a swollen lip. That doesn't make the charge of rape a fact."" Saying that ""proving a negative"" is impossible for the White House, Davis added: ""How do we know she didn't lie to all her friends? We know that, voluntarily, without anyone influencing her, she swore out an affidavit that she now says she lied about."" David P. Schippers, chief investigator for the House Judiciary Committee Republicans during the impeachment proceedings, said Tuesday that his staffers interviewed Broaddrick more than once and ""have assured me that she is the most credible witness that either one of them have ever talked to."" Appearing on MSNBC's ""Hockenberry,"" Schippers said he concluded that no one connected with the White House had suggested that Broaddrick file a false affidavit. ""I think it would have been folly for us to have attempted to just poison the water with this story, when it really had no specific bearing on the impeachable offenses,"" he said.

342,Kurtz,Howard,washingtonpost,"The Washington Post has brought down the curtain on ""Mouthpiece Theater.""

Executive Editor Marcus Brauchli killed the satirical video series Wednesday after harsh criticism of a joke about Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, which prompted him to pull the latest episode from the paper's Web site Friday night. The Post staffers who appeared in the videos, Dana Milbank and Chris Cillizza, agreed with the decision and apologized in separate interviews.

""I don't think the series worked as they intended,"" Brauchli said. ""It was meant to be funny and insightful and translate the superb journalism Chris and Dana do in print and online into a new format.""

""Mouthpiece Theater"" was designed as a sendup of pompous punditry, with Milbank, the paper's Washington Sketch columnist, and Cillizza, a White House correspondent who writes The Fix blog, appearing with oversized pipes and smoking jackets. But its comedic style drew catcalls from online critics, which intensified after Friday's episode about the kind of beer various politicians might drink. Milbank said he couldn't reveal to whom President Obama would serve a brew called Mad Bitch Beer, which was followed by a brief shot of Clinton.

""I regret that we put up that image,"" Milbank said Wednesday, ""and while I highly doubt the secretary of state has seen 'Mouthpiece Theater,' I would be honored to have the opportunity to apologize to her over a beer.""

As for the dozen videos they have made in what was designed as a summer tryout, ""it's clear there was an audience for it out there, but not large enough to justify all the grief,"" Milbank said. ""My strength is in observational, in-the-field stuff, and that's what I should do. I'm sorry about the reaction it's caused, but I think it's important to experiment. The real risk to newspapers is not that they take too many risks, but that they don't take enough risks.""

Cillizza agreed that the plug should be pulled, saying: ""We'd hoped the self-deprecating humor of me and the irreverent humor of Dana would combine to make something funny and interesting and on the news. It wound up not working. . . . Ultimately it wasn't funny.""

The Clinton joke, Cillizza said, ""was inappropriate, over the line and highlighted the broader problems with the show. I'm personally apologizing on The Fix. It's not consistent with the Post brand, but more important to me, it's not consistent with the Fix brand I've worked to cultivate -- insider, straight-dope journalism that tries to shoot down the middle.""

Brauchli called the Clinton joke ""a serious lapse. . . . . It's really beneath us and not something we should engage in.""

In a letter to Brauchli on Tuesday that was signed by 32 women, the organization Women, Action and the Media demanded an explanation for what it called ""the video's patently sexist -- and otherwise tasteless -- content,"" which the writers said displayed ""misogyny"" and ""utter contempt for women"" as well as racial insensitivity.

Although the scripts for ""Mouthpiece Theater"" were approved by editors, Milbank and Cillizza often ad-libbed parts of it, as was the case with the inclusion of Clinton's photo. ""We did not have an effective system for vetting videos and other multimedia content,"" Brauchli said, insisting that will change. He said the paper will keep experimenting with new media but that ""we need to hold ourselves to our standards to deliver that.""

The withering and often personal criticism of Milbank and Cillizza exploded Friday afternoon after the liberal Web site Talking Points Memo posted and criticized the latest video. Both men, who frequently appear on television, became high-profile targets, particularly among left-leaning bloggers but also on such outlets as Twitter.

""It's a brutal world out there in the blogosphere,"" Milbank said. ""I'm often surprised by the ferocity out there, but I probably shouldn't be.""

Cillizza said that ""people have every right to be offended. . . . I am a big believer in experimenting with journalism and finding different ways to convey information. This was a failed experiment in doing that.""

Signaling that their standing at The Post remains unaffected, Brauchli praised both reporters. He called Cillizza ""an enormous talent and someone who is closely followed and admired by a lot of journalists and people in politics. . . . . Dana writes a terrific, very funny and usually very popular column on Page 2. He's an equal-opportunity offender, and from time to time everyone's mad at him.""",0,http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/05/AR2009080502394.html
343,Kurtz,Howard,cnn,"The era of free online news is coming to an end as newsgathering operations slip behind the paywall, Howard Kurtz says.

Story highlights Howard Kurtz: Washington Post, other news outlets, may soon charge for online access He says news organizations erred in giving news away free for so long to keep up He says Post needs revenue but digital ads don' t bring as much as those from print circulation Kurtz: News organizations' cuts have diminished newsgathering -- it's time to pay for journalism

Editor’s Note: Howard Kurtz is the host of CNN’s “Reliable Sources” and is Newsweek’s Washington bureau chief. He is also a contributor to the website Daily Download.

(CNN) —

It’s time to pay up, America.

The era of free news is rapidly coming to a close.

The Washington Post, one of the last holdouts among major newspapers, will probably begin charging for online access next year. And the Philadelphia Inquirer and Philadelphia Daily News announced Monday that they will launch separate paywall sites early next year.

We’re all spoiled by the illusion that we can get whatever we want on the interwebs without having to pay a dime. Fire up the Google, troll the Twitter, see who’s got the most tantalizing links. We all do it, and we all take it for granted.

CNN Howard Kurtz

But you can’t have a media ecosystem in which everyone is aggregating, summarizing and retweeting content from everyone else. At some point there have to be actual human beings making phone calls and attending events and pawing through public documents.

And these people – known as “reporters” – need to put food on the table. Newspapers and magazines are partially to blame for this state of affairs. For many years they gave away their wares to anyone with a modem, anxious to avoid being left out of the burgeoning world of online commerce. Readers thought nothing of subscribing to a paper that landed on their doorstep but balked at paying for news on their computer screens and mobile phones.

The result, as we all know, has been widespread carnage in American newsrooms. Some papers, such as the Rocky Mountain News and Seattle Post-Intelligencer, have folded. Others, such as The New Orleans Times-Picayune, have cut back to three times a week. The Cleveland Plain Dealer just announced it is slashing a third of its newsroom. Even The New York Times, which has made fewer cuts than most papers, said last week that 30 jobs will be lost to buyouts.

Watch: Karl Rove benched: When gasbags get it wrong

There were several rounds of buyouts when I worked at The Washington Post, where the newsroom has shrunk significantly and the new editor, Marty Baron, warns that more cuts are in store. In an overdue move, the paper now says it will likely move to a metered paywall, charging readers after they get a certain number of free articles each month. The Times was among the pioneers of this movement in March 2011 and now has nearly 600,000 digital subscribers. It also helps to have an affluent expense-account crowd, which is why The Wall Street Journal’s pay site has always thrived.

The Post has a unique problem in that it is a national brand online, but a local newspaper in terms of circulation. So the out-of-towners who might want to read political analysis by Dan Balz and Chris Cillizza don’t have the option of subscribing to the ink-on-paper version. Yet the lucrative print ads that reach consumers in D.C., Maryland and Virginia are worth far more than the modest rates that can be charged for digital ads. So the paper badly needs another source of revenue.

Watch: Did Bob Costas go too far in pushing gun control?

The Daily Beast, where I work, is also considering a metered paywall, now that the parent company is folding the print edition of Newsweek, which led to substantial layoffs last week.

Of course, readers have no august responsibility to pay for anything. And Big Media got too fat and happy in the days of easy money. The Google era is all about disaggregation – that is, you can search for only the information you want about Medicare or Meryl Streep or Miami without the packaging of a publication. You can get your fix from Facebook friends. With new apps you can be your own editor, selecting the stories that suit your needs.

So this is not a plea for charitable support. Increasingly, the name of the game online is providing something that is so unique or compelling that readers feel it’s worth reaching for their credit card.

But it is a reminder that we are hollowing out the business of newsgathering. This is a particular problem at the local level, where no one else is going to investigate decaying schools or the mayor steering contracts to his cronies. Sadly, the shriveled staffs of many local papers are less able to do this kind of distinctive reporting, and will have a hard time persuading readers to pay for meager coverage with an overlay of local sports.

It’s also true that there is less original reporting nationally on the environment, health care, criminal justice, finance and other vital areas. The Washington Post, where I was once New York bureau chief, has shut down its bureaus around the country.

The slow stampede toward paywalls will prompt a shakeout in which some publications survive by proving their worth and others head for the graveyard. Some early signs are discouraging: Rupert Murdoch’s iPad magazine The Daily, which never had a clear identity, folded last week, and Arianna Huffington’s hugely successful site couldn’t get people to pay a modest fee for a monthly digital magazine.

Hey, if folks don’t think a paper or magazine or online venture is worth the weekly equivalent of a frappuccino, that’s their choice. But man does not live by buzz alone. In the end, we get the journalism we deserve.

Story highlights Howard Kurtz: TV coverage of storms is sometimes overblown, designed to goose ratings He says TV news can jump gun, get facts wrong, but in weather disaster it's understandable Viewers ravenous for details, he says. Storm brought unifying moment in midst of campaign Kurtz: After Katrina, media cover every storm like it's huge; in this case that was justified

(CNN) —

A confession: I usually have a knee-jerk reaction when television goes into its extreme-weather mode.

All too often, I’ve seen the machinery clank into action – team coverage, breathless anchors, intrepid correspondents getting soaked in the rain – only to watch the heavily hyped storms peter out. What used to be the province of local eyewitless news, gearing up at the merest threat of thunderstorms or snowfall, long ago became a cable news specialty. It’s a surefire way to goose the ratings.

When I was in Tampa for the Republican convention in August, the saturation coverage of Hurricane Isaac helped force organizers to cancel the first night. Then Isaac turned out to be a bust, but the storm coverage continued to compete with the convention right up until Clint Eastwood argued with his chair.

Hurricane Sandy was different. And I found myself grateful for the television coverage, as messy and chaotic as it often is. That is because the weaknesses of live, breaking news can sometimes be its strength.

When news organizations jump the gun in reporting, for example, a Supreme Court decision, or an ailing person’s death, it’s hard to understand why they couldn’t wait a few more minutes to get it right – why the rush to get it first can trump all else.

Watch: Why Do Crazy Reporters Stand Out in the Rain?

But when a monster storm is devastating the East Coast, the fragmentary reports and incremental information are both riveting and necessary. Even a mistake becomes more understandable in this context.

Lauren Ashburn and Howard Kurtz in the rain.

(A CNN meteorologist cited an erroneous posting from a National Weather Service bulletin board Monday night that the New York Stock Exchange was filled with three feet of water; the network quickly issued an on-air correction.)

The correspondents braving the elements seemed less like grandstanders and more like dogged fact-finders. Each development – “Landfall near Atlantic City!” “Crane down in Manhattan!” “Flooding in Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel!” – became part of a shared community experience. At least for those who still had power.

Watch: Is Hurricane Sandy’s Dominant Coverage Hurting Mitt Romney?

And that, even in this age of media fragmentation, may be cable TV’s greatest service. We watch and experience the highs and lows together, even those in parts of the country that are unaffected. It is the polar opposite of a presidential campaign, with its relentless hyper-partisanship. In fact, by upending the final week of the campaign, the hurricane and the media attention surrounding it provided a uniquely unifying moment.

Hurricane Hotties in D.C.: Still Stripping During Sandy

Social media played a key role as well. On Instagram, the photo-sharing app, users were posting 10 Sandy photos every second – more than 244,000 tagged #sandy by Monday afternoon. No news organization could beat that. Twitter exploded with messages and updates about the hurricane, along with expressions of concern. For the 140-character generation, it was the online equivalent of gathering around the TV set in the pre-Internet days.

But the vulnerability of social media, with its lack of editors or grownup supervision, was on display as well. The web, especially Tumblr and Twitter, also were flooded with fake photos – stock images that had been altered or were misrepresented as having been taken during Sandy. One picture, carried by the Washington Post, Daily Beast and NPR, showed sentinels guarding the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier; it turned out to be have been taken last month. Editors at London’s Guardian asked readers to help them spot the bogus shots by using the Twitter hashtag #FakeSandy.

Watch: Many Americans Think Obama Is Jewish? Oy.

Journalism, to be sure, is better at quick snapshots than long-term probing. Since the candidates have scarcely talked about climate change, it has almost disappeared from the media radar screen. But the violent storms of recent years – the Snowmaggeddon, the derecho, now the most far-ranging hurricane in modern memory – suggest that we have plunged into a new and more dangerous era. Reporters need to be more aggressive in examining the role of environmental change in these superstorms.

I still think there is a tendency, in the wake of Katrina, to cast every storm as a potential Category 5 killer. But given the magnitude of Hurricane Sandy, which killed at least 33 people in the United States and knocked out power to more than 7.5 million, the media hype was more than justified.

Days before the Iraq war began, veteran Washington Post reporter Walter Pincus put together a story questioning whether the Bush administration had proof that Saddam Hussein was hiding weapons of mass destruction.

But he ran into resistance from the paper's editors, and his piece ran only after assistant managing editor Bob Woodward, who was researching a book about the drive toward war, ""helped sell the story,"" Pincus recalled. ""Without him, it would have had a tough time getting into the paper."" Even so, the article was relegated to Page A17.

""We did our job but we didn't do enough, and I blame myself mightily for not pushing harder,"" Woodward said in an interview. ""We should have warned readers we had information that the basis for this was shakier"" than widely believed. ""Those are exactly the kind of statements that should be published on the front page.""

As violence continues in postwar Iraq and U.S. forces have yet to discover any WMDs, some critics say the media, including The Washington Post, failed the country by not reporting more skeptically on President Bush's contentions during the run-up to war.

An examination of the paper's coverage, and interviews with more than a dozen of the editors and reporters involved, shows that The Post published a number of pieces challenging the White House, but rarely on the front page. Some reporters who were lobbying for greater prominence for stories that questioned the administration's evidence complained to senior editors who, in the view of those reporters, were unenthusiastic about such pieces. The result was coverage that, despite flashes of groundbreaking reporting, in hindsight looks strikingly one-sided at times.

""The paper was not front-paging stuff,"" said Pentagon correspondent Thomas Ricks. ""Administration assertions were on the front page. Things that challenged the administration were on A18 on Sunday or A24 on Monday. There was an attitude among editors: Look, we're going to war, why do we even worry about all this contrary stuff?""

In retrospect, said Executive Editor Leonard Downie Jr., ""we were so focused on trying to figure out what the administration was doing that we were not giving the same play to people who said it wouldn't be a good idea to go to war and were questioning the administration's rationale. Not enough of those stories were put on the front page. That was a mistake on my part.""

Across the country, ""the voices raising questions about the war were lonely ones,"" Downie said. ""We didn't pay enough attention to the minority.""

When national security reporter Dana Priest was addressing a group of intelligence officers recently, she said, she was peppered with questions: ""Why didn't The Post do a more aggressive job? Why didn't The Post ask more questions? Why didn't The Post dig harder?""

Several news organizations have cast a withering eye on their earlier work. The New York Times said in a May editor's note about stories that claimed progress in the hunt for WMDs that editors ""were perhaps too intent on rushing scoops into the paper."" Separately, the Times editorial page and the New Republic magazine expressed regret for some prewar arguments.

Michael Massing, a New York Review of Books contributor and author of the forthcoming book ""Now They Tell Us,"" on the press and Iraq, said: ""In covering the run-up to the war, The Post did better than most other news organizations, featuring a number of solid articles about the Bush administration's policies. But on the key issue of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, the paper was generally napping along with everyone else. It gave readers little hint of the doubts that a number of intelligence analysts had about the administration's claims regarding Iraq's arsenal.""

The front page is a newspaper's billboard, its way of making a statement about what is important, and stories trumpeted there are often picked up by other news outlets. Editors begin pitching stories at a 2 p.m. news meeting with Downie and Managing Editor Steve Coll and, along with some reporters, lobby throughout the day. But there is limited space on Page 1 -- usually six or seven stories -- and Downie said he likes to feature a broad range of subjects, including education, health, science, sports and business.

Woodward, for his part, said it was risky for journalists to write anything that might look silly if weapons were ultimately found in Iraq. Alluding to the finding of the Sept. 11 commission of a ""groupthink"" among intelligence officials, Woodward said of the weapons coverage: ""I think I was part of the groupthink.""",0,http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A58127-2004Aug11.html
346,Kurtz,Howard,washingtonpost,"Tensions between journalists and military officials are nothing new. But a bitter series of clashes between a top Navy spokesman and a Miami Herald military reporter reached a new, eye-opening level this week.

In a letter to the paper's editor, Cmdr. Jeffrey Gordon accused Carol Rosenberg of ""multiple incidents of abusive and degrading comments of an explicitly sexual nature."" Gordon, who deals primarily with the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, prison, said in the letter that this was a ""formal sexual harassment complaint"" and asked the Herald for a ""thorough investigation.""

""Her behavior has been so atrocious over the years,"" Gordon said in an interview. ""I've been abused worse than the detainees have been abused.""

Herald Executive Editor Anders Gyllenhaal said Friday that ""obviously we're trying to sort this out. We're not going to talk about a personnel matter like this until we figure out what it's all about."" Rosenberg, who declined to comment Friday, is described by other journalists as a seasoned reporter who pushes hard for access and answers.

The extraordinary complaint shines a light on the sometimes bruising battles between journalists, who sometimes must scratch and claw for information, and government officials, who attempt just as tenaciously to control information provided to news organizations. This cultural clash can be especially stark on military matters.

Gordon, 41, detailed a number of ""vile and repulsive comments"" he attributed to Rosenberg, stretching back to last summer. In the July 22 letter, Gordon alleges that:

-- While watching Sept. 11, 2001, co-defendant Mustafa al-Hawsawi seated on a pillow in court last year, Rosenberg told Gordon: ""Have you ever had a red hot poker shoved up your [butt]? Have you ever had a broomstick shoved up your [butt]? . . . How would you know how it feels if it never happened to you? Admit it, you liked it.""

-- When Gordon emerged from a shower facility in shorts and a towel last year, Rosenberg said to him and more than a dozen journalists and soldiers nearby: ""Seeing him topless in tent city was the most repulsive sight I've ever seen in my life. I wanted to vomit.""

-- After dealing with a Gordon intern whom she described as ""your little chick with the hot pants,"" Rosenberg told Gordon, earlier this month, in the presence of others: ""I know you're hot for your interns and bring them down as your 'companions,' but seriously, if I'm going to do their work anyway, what purpose do they serve? (Carol knows my intern last year was a male, therefore another inference that I was gay.)""

In addition, the letter alleged, Rosenberg ""routinely labeled my colleagues in the Office of the Secretary of Defense and Justice Department, as well as her peers in the press, as 'bitches,' 'stupid,' 'lazy,' 'incompetent,' 'Nazis,' 'Saddam Hussein-like,' etc."" Gordon works for Defense Secretary Robert Gates and said he consulted department lawyers in drafting the letter.

One friend, Los Angeles Times reporter Carol Williams, dismissed the letter, saying, ""This is an attempt to discredit a journalist who has managed to transcend incredible odds to cover a story of tremendous significance to the American public.""

Rosenberg's coverage of Guantanamo, its terrorism trials and its suicides has been sustained and highly detailed. She has written about a prisoner so afraid of returning to his native Tajikistan that he is asking to stay at the prison in Cuba. She has written about how bottled water there is kept chilled in a 3,470-pound shipping refrigerator meant for the dead. And last year she wrote about one general attacking another as ""abusive, bullying, unprofessional"" in a dispute over trial tactics at the war court.

Jamie McIntyre, a former CNN Pentagon correspondent, said of Rosenberg's interactions with Gordon: ""I didn't think there was any sort of sexual abuse, unless you're telling me a naval officer, a sailor, isn't used to hearing anatomical references in anger. It sounds like an overreaction on everybody's part."" He said Rosenberg ""was always professional in her demeanor when I was around her.""

In the letter, Gordon said Rosenberg told him, in reference to housing for McIntyre and other journalists during a Gitmo trip: ""You're kissing his [butt] so much that I can't believe you're letting him stay with the rest of us. Do you love him?"" McIntyre said he did not hear the comments, but that others later repeated them to him.

Jerry Markon, a Washington Post reporter who spent a month at Guantanamo last year, said he saw ""some fairly heated arguments"" between Rosenberg and Gordon: ""The tension between them was palpable. Carol is a very good reporter and she's very aggressive. She's constantly pushing the envelope, pushing the military to get as much access as possible. . . . Gordon seemed very frustrated by her approach, thought she was obstinate, thought she was difficult.""

Josh White, a Post reporter who previously covered the Pentagon, said that Rosenberg ""would treat [Gordon] and others in an aggressive, sometimes demeaning way. It's hard for me to say whether it was abusive or harassment.""

Another Pentagon official, who declined to be identified describing his dealings with the press, said that Rosenberg complained at Gitmo that the U.S. military escorts dealing with reporters reminded her of Iraqi minders in Baghdad. ""She said we were no different than Nazis,"" this official said.

Rosenberg, who graduated from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst in 1982, reported from the Middle East and from Washington in the 1980s and 1990s. Now based in Miami, she has been a Knight journalism fellow at Stanford University and has appeared on PBS's ""NewsHour.""

In his letter this week, Gordon said he appreciated Gyllenhaal's efforts last July, after a previous complaint to the Herald, ""to correct Carol Rosenberg's patently offensive conduct,"" but was ""disappointed that the results were merely temporary.""

Gordon said in the interview that he spoke to Gyllenhaal by phone for 30 minutes Friday and is ""satisfied"" that the editor will look into his complaint. Gordon, a career officer who joined the secretary's office under Donald Rumsfeld in 2005, is retiring early next year, an exit date that may help explain the unusually harsh nature of his complaint against a journalist.",0,http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/24/AR2009072403664.html
347,Kurtz,Howard,washingtonpost,"The Washington Post, in a significant retrenchment, is closing its remaining domestic bureaus around the country.

The six correspondents who work in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago will be offered reassignments in Washington, while three news assistants will be let go.

The money-saving move, coming on the heels of four rounds of early-retirement buyouts and the closing or merging of several sections, is the clearest sign yet of the newspaper's shrinking horizons in an era of diminished resources.

""The fact is we can effectively cover the rest of the country from Washington,"" Executive Editor Marcus Brauchli said Tuesday from New York, where he was delivering the news in person to the Post bureau there. ""We have for years been able to cover issues around the country for our readers with a corps of traveling reporters. It's more possible than it's ever been to cover the issues that matter to our readers from a Washington perspective.""

What is lost, however, is the knowledge and experience of reporters who come to understand the local issues, personalities and culture of other regions by living there.

Brauchli, a former foreign correspondent for the Wall Street Journal, acknowledged that ""unquestionably there are advantages to having someone on the ground at times."" But, he said, ""We are not a national news organization of record serving a general audience. Nor are we a wire service or cable channel."" Maintaining that The Post's strength is to report issues through a ""Washington prism,"" Brauchli cited recent examples of education and economic reporters filing major dispatches from other cities to illustrate national trends.

Brauchli is under pressure to cut costs because The Post Co.'s newspaper division, which includes several smaller papers, lost $166.7 million in the first three quarters of this year.

The journalists being offered reassignment are Keith B. Richburg, Barton Gellman and Tomoeh Murakami Tse in New York; Peter Slevin in Chicago, and Karl Vick and television columnist Lisa deMoraes in Los Angeles. Over the past decade, The Post has shuttered bureaus it once maintained in Austin, Denver and Miami.",0,http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/24/AR2009112403014.html

349,Stuart,Hyria,allsides,"In terms of foreign policy, there are misleading stereotypes of Democrats and Republicans. Supposedly, Democrats are strongly supportive of international cooperation, while Republicans are nationalistic, wanting to focus on America before other countries.

Yet surveys of Republicans generally show strong support for international cooperation. While it is true that Democrats are often more supportive, differences tend to be relatively modest. In many cases, 80% or more of Americans support joint international efforts, with strong support from those across the political spectrum.

In select cases, majorities of Democrats support policies that may be considered more hawkish, or at least prioritizing the interests of Americans over those in other countries. These include support for sufficient nuclear weapons for retaliation if needed, an interest in keeping superpower status, and a belief that protecting jobs of American workers should be a goal of U.S. foreign policy.
