0,Baleria,Gina,poynter,"Objectivity and journalism — over the last century, these two words have become inextricably linked. But striving for objectivity has actually hindered us from adequately covering truth, giving context and achieving equity.

As educators, it is our role and responsibility to teach a journalistic approach based not on objectivity, but on seeking truth, providing context, and including voices and perspectives left behind by the adherence to objectivity.

At the dawn of the 20th century, as the scientific method emerged, journalists recognized that some sort of objective process might lead to stronger coverage of important stories, keep biases in check, help get to the truth and better inform the public.

Objectivity became the gold standard of news reporting, but the word “objective” came to be applied not to the process of newsgathering, but to journalists themselves. To convey objectivity, some journalists refrained from voting to keep from appearing biased. Many adopted the detached, safe tone originally developed by the Associated Press and other wire services to appear more neutral and thus marketable across news markets. And many began to seek sources from “both sides” of an issue, to illustrate that they were giving every side a voice (no matter how valid or how absurd).

The “facts” and “truth” that have generally been deemed objective are actually centered on a mainstream, white, male, able-bodied, cis-gendered perspective — not actually objective or neutral at all.

“The views and inclinations of whiteness are accepted as the objective neutral,” wrote Wes Lowery in a recent New York Times opinion piece. “Those selective truths have been calibrated to avoid offending the sensibilities of white readers.” The dangers of this, he wrote, are that ”instead of telling hard truths in this polarized environment, America’s newsrooms too often deprive their readers of plainly stated facts that could expose reporters to accusations of partiality or imbalance.”

When we teach our students how to do good journalism, it is incumbent upon us to challenge the idea of journalistic objectivity and point out how it manifests.

One example is climate change coverage. Instead of contextualizing that nearly 100% of climate scientists have reached consensus about the implications of climate change and humans’ role in its hastening, news outlets often give equal time to the 1-2% who disagree. Climate and other stories told in a detached tone remove urgency, which does not help contextualize or inform. Rather, it confuses, misleads and alienates audiences seeking to understand.

As Lowery wrote, a reckoning over objectivity has been a long time coming. In the wake of a deadly pandemic, an uprising over Black lives lost to police brutality and a recognition that many groups within communities are being covered as outsiders, that reckoning is now critical as we teach students to be more effective journalists. In turn, they can better contribute to preserving and strengthening our democracy.

For example, as Black Lives Matter protests filled U.S. streets after the police killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and others, a Black reporter at the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette was taken off protest coverage after she pointed out that a photo of trash and vandalism was taken not at the protests, but at a Kenny Chesney concert. She was told she violated social media policy and could not be objective. A white male reporter who also violated this social media policy around the same time was given a warning and allowed to continue his work. The implication here is that his violation was an anomaly, while hers was inherent to her being.

What reporter Alexis Johnson was actually doing was pointing out an important truth and giving context to an important story. She was illustrating how the same behavior is condoned when perpetrated by white mainstream society and vilified when undertaken by people of color. Her perspective is actually needed as we navigate coverage of this important and ongoing story — her personal objectivity isn’t.

The concept of objectivity “leads to a fundamental misunderstanding of what journalism is,” said New York Times Magazine reporter Nikole Hannah-Jones on the 1A Podcast. “Journalism is not stenography. We don’t simply say, ‘Donald Trump said this. Nancy Pelosi said this.’ That should not be our role. Our role should actually be at getting at the truth and providing context and analysis so people understand what this means.”

All journalists bring their own biases to the table — no matter their race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, ability or other factor. We must teach our students that this can be an advantage and not a hindrance, that our identities and experiences can inform the journalism we do, the interviews we get, the access we have to communities and the stories we tell.

Thus, instead of objectivity, PBS public editor Ricardo Sandoval-Palos advocates for accuracy and transparency. “You can take a position, but you need to be right,” he said on 1A. This shows your audience that “you took the time to be introspective about your own work and presented it in the fairest possible fashion.”

Reporter Alexis Johnson took a position, one that her background, ethnicity and experience made her uniquely qualified to explore and contextualize. And she was right; she was accurate; and she was transparent. She was practicing solid journalism. Objectivity was represented in her process — of vetting the photo, assessing the story and providing information to help increase understanding.

In truth, we have never actually prized individual objectivity. Think of the journalists we look to as examples when we measure our own work. When legendary journalists Walter Cronkite and Edward R. Murrow are remembered, the moments we hold up are the moments when they set objectivity aside to speak truth and give context to the American people — Cronkite when he took a stand against the Vietnam War, and Murrow when he took on Sen. Joseph McCarthy. We applaud the truths they told, the context they provided, and the transparency they offered to us in those important stories.

We need journalists not to be scared to bring a bit of activism to their work, as Johnson, Cronkite, Murrow and others have done. Experiencing sexual harassment can lead a reporter to pursue stories that bring suspected harassers and assaulters to justice. Being looked over or made to feel stupid in elementary school can lead a journalist to uncover systemic racism in a school district.

Effective journalists tap into passion, tenacity, curiosity, and of course accuracy and transparency — as they utilize an objective process to ensure their story is well documented, well-sourced and carefully told. As effective educators, it’s our job to give our student journalists the foundation to do this well.

1,Baleria,Gina,allsides,"Recent conversations and controversies surrounding the venerable op-ed pages at the New York Times and Wall Street Journal have been framed in various ways, with commentators using phrases such as cancel culture, an attack on freedom of speech, an example of poor fact checking, and other buzzwords of the moment.

But instead of helping us have a nuanced conversation, this discourse pigeonholes us into simplistic definitions, echo chamber shorthand, and ultimately into ideological camps that further divide us.

While it’s tempting to simplify, vilify, and take sides, we must resist this siren call and instead embrace the complexity of this important conversation and put it into context. Conversations around freedom of speech, the importance of fact checking, and the toxicity of cancel culture are all important. But the other important truth is that they are all nuanced and multi-faceted, and we must grapple with them together to help our society move forward.

First, let’s discuss the role of op-ed sections at news outlets.

A primary principle or duty of a free press, according to Bill Kovach and Tom Rosenstiel, authors of The Elements of Journalism, is that “journalism must provide a forum for public criticism and compromise” — and op-ed sections serve this role. But, Kovach and Rosenstiel’s assertion comes with a warning that the forum can bring “an increased power to distort, mislead, and overwhelm the other functions of a free press” (p. 197), especially in our digital age.

Op-ed sections and newsrooms are traditionally vigorously separate — independent of and from one another. This is a benefit to both sides, because reporters are not in the business of peddling opinion, and opinion editors are not in the business of covering news stories. Rather, op-ed sections provide analysis and context to the news of the day. Thus, these two elements of journalism each contribute to the public discourse. This tradition of independence from each other clearly continues, because much of the criticism of the opinion editors at the WSJ and NYT came from newsroom staff.

Depending on your camp along the political spectrum, you may see the recent criticisms of the WSJ and NYT op-eds as cancel culture at work, or you may see them as an appeal to journalistic principles of verification. Op-ed sections, while separate from newsrooms, are still part of the journalistic landscape and thus should seek to adhere to journalistic principles, including presenting a diversity of sources or viewpoints; rigorously fact checking; and gatekeeping with an eye toward addressing the biggest and most impactful stories of the current moment. This ensures that citizens have the information they need to govern themselves and tackle community and societal challenges.

Given this important role, Rosenstiel and Kovach outline a tenet that op-ed sections must adhere to as journalistic entities. We all “have every right to be opinionated. But if the authors of this intelligence want to call their work journalism, then it follows that they should not misrepresent the facts - that they should hold to the highest standards of truthfulness and allegiance to public interest…. A forum without regard for facts fails to inform” (p. 199).

Opinion editors often face a challenge of seeking to represent diverse viewpoints with strong opinions and perspectives, which sometimes come with assertions that may not hold up against scrutiny. They must decide whether it’s appropriate to publish such content for the sake of public discourse, or whether such content may only cause harm by disseminating inaccurate information. This is their First Amendment right — and responsibility.

Given that op-ed sections are critical to our ability to self-govern, we must hold them to a high standard. They must not be censored, but editors must also demonstrate that they are fact checking and verifying the information they choose to publish. It is this tenet that newsroom staffers at the NYT and WSJ called out in their letters to their respective opinion editors.

But opinion editors must also challenge viewpoints by ensuring the inclusion of diverse voices. When conservative opinion writer Bari Weiss resigned from the NYT this month, she expressed concerns that diverse viewpoints were not welcome and that she was bullied for expressing hers.

To preserve our First Amendment rights to freedom of speech, we must all fight to retain our ability to express our views. But freedom of speech does not mean freedom from criticism. As the Supreme Court wrote in its 1964 NYT v. Sullivan decision, “debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open, and that… may well include vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials.” The court later added public figures to this list.

In the journalistic context, freedom of speech does not mean freedom from fact checking and verification. The NYT and WSJ newsroom staffs used their voices and First Amendment rights to criticize their respective opinion sections based primarily on concerns about fact checking and safety. Such dissent is part of our American tradition. Opinion editors defended their choices by appealing to the importance of representing diverse viewpoints. However, at least one editor, James Bennet of the NYT, resigned in the wake of criticism after publishing an op-ed by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) that contained factual inaccuracies.

We can continue to approach this conversation with the simplistic tone heard among the extremes of public opinion. Or we can grapple with the nuances and use our constitutional right to free speech — and all of the responsibilities that come with it — to address concerns across differences and come to deeper understanding.

We must all rise to the challenge, resist the temptation to gravitate toward our usual camps, and engage with each other and each other’s perspectives, while holding ourselves to a standard of verifying the information we believe is true. This does not mean we have to agree. Challenge is part of our beautiful, messy, First Amendment. But, for the sake of our democracy, let’s have the conversation.

JUDGE NAPOLITANO: Troublesome questions for President Trump by conservativeinstitute.org

. Nunes Moving Quickly This Week to Hold AG Sessions in Contempt by rickwells.us { rickwells.us } ~ Intelligence Committee chairman Devin Nunes (R-CA) mentions the recent actions by Judge TS Ellis in rebuking the Mueller Inquisition attorneys... saying that it looks like the whole investigation has gone off the rails. That’s an understatement but Nunes knows he and the American people are best served when he chooses his words carefully. He’s moves on to the issue of the FISA investigation, which Nunes explains is conducted in a secret manner with only a very few people’s knowledge. He says the abuse of that process is a component of what brought us to where we are today and reveals, “Two weeks ago we sent a letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a classified letter. Per usual it was ignored and not acknowledged, just completely ignored.” AG “AWOL General” Sessions is running out of time and won’t be able to simply ignore the next action that will follow. Nunes continued, “So last week we sent a subpoena, and then on Thursday we discovered that they’re not going to comply with our subpoena on very important information that we need.” Asked what he’s going to do now, Nunes replies, “The only thing left that we can do is we have to move quickly to hold the Attorney General of the United States in contempt and that’s what I’m going to press for this week.”...

The FBI Shouldn’t Be Above the Law Either by David Harsanyi { dailysignal.com } ~ These days, a number of people seem to be under the impression that investigating President Donald Trump is the most vital project undertaken by this nation since its founding... Perhaps. But their feelings shouldn’t override the Constitution, because for all the principles allegedly being whittled away by this administration, its antagonists seem to be doing everything they can to keep pace. For instance, while it might come as a surprise to many, the Justice Department is not an “independent” entity. Presumably, those who work for the DOJ have fealty to law and justice first, yes. But they are ultimately subordinates of the president of the United States, who was elected legally and has powers identical to those of former Presidents Barack liar-nObama or George W. Bush. In other words, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein doesn’t work for CNN personalities or Vox explainer writers.

Episcopal Iconoclasts Come for Washington

by Thomas Gallatin: Historic Christ Church in Old Town Alexandria, Virginia, suddenly found itself in the national news after its leaders’ recent decision to remove plaques honoring its most famous parishioners, George Washington and Robert E. Lee. “The plaques in our sanctuary make some in our presence feel unsafe or unwelcome,” the church’s leaders explained. “Some visitors and guests who worship with us choose not to return because they receive an unintended message from the prominent presence of the plaques.”

Since it’s all the rage today to take down monuments honoring Confederate leaders, the church’s decision to remove Lee’s plaque, while regrettable, is at least somewhat understandable. But why also take down Washington’s plaque? Were Church leaders fearful that an unhealthy degree of idolizing of the plaque had taken hold of the congregation to venerate Washington over Christ? If fear for the health of members’ souls was the impetus, then by all means remove these stumbling stones. Of course, that was far from the reason. Instead, the decision was made out of deference to the vacillating opinions of mere mortals. Christ Church leadership was afraid of offending someone because of the historic fact that George Washington owned slaves — the unforgivable sin of today .

T o be clear, Christ Church has every right to remove this plaque honoring its past members, even when one of those members just happens to be the first president of the United States. But Christ Church’s rationale for removing the plaques speaks more about a troubling spirit of our modern age, where those individuals of the past who accomplished great achievements are condemned for accepting that which was culturally common within their own day. Our inability as a modern culture to judge with a nuanced understanding those from the past says more about our own prejudice than it does our forefathers .

And of all places a Christian church is built upon the foundation of recognizing that people are sinners who are saved by faith in the only perfect sinless individual, the God-man Jesus Christ. The parable of the woman caught in adultery comes to mind. The leaders of Jesus’ day brought the guilty woman before him saying that according to the law she deserved to be stoned. Jesus didn’t deny her guilt but made a simple and yet profound statement: “Let him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her.” Beware of overstating the sins of those in the past while ignoring the sins of the present.

7,Beck,Glenn,quebec,"Ce billet fait partie d'une série de blogues célébrant les 10 ans du HuffPost, série pour laquelle nous avons invité des experts à réfléchir sur la prochaine décennie dans leurs domaines respectifs. Pour découvrir leurs blogues, visitez notre section Le monde en 2025.

Il fut une époque où l'arrivée à la station-service faisait retentir une cloche. Le conducteur n'avait qu'à rester assis pendant qu'une douzaine de préposés en uniforme remplissaient le réservoir du véhicule, prenaient la pression des pneus, jaugeaient l'huile, nettoyaient le pare-brise et frottaient les chromes jusqu'à ce qu'on puisse les utiliser comme miroirs. Avant son départ, le conducteur recevait souvent une carte routière tandis que ses enfants héritaient d'un animal en peluche.

La qualité du service était spectaculaire, considérant que le seul bien requis était un plein d'essence.

C'est l'image qui m'est venue en tête lorsque j'ai été invité à une émission de télé qui m'avait inexplicablement classé parmi les personnes les plus intéressantes de l'année. (Il faut croire que l'année n'avait pas été des plus intéressantes.)

Les préparatifs de cette émission étaient à la mesure du traitement qu'on recevait jadis dans les stations-service. Mon entrevue avec Barbara Walters ne devait durer que deux minutes, mais près de 50 personnes ont envahi mon bureau et se sont relayées durant des heures pour l'aménager. Elles y ont installé une telle quantité d'équipement que le plancher aurait très bien pu céder. Des manutentionnaires et des traiteurs ont fait place à une autre équipe de techniciens et de traiteurs. Une partie de la Sixième Avenue a même été fermée temporairement. Au final, plus de gens ont été mobilisés pour ce segment que je ne comptais d'employés dans ma propre compagnie.

Cet exemple illustre bien le chemin parcouru en quelques années. Le monde ne change pas, il a déjà changé. Les dirigeants des médias traditionnels ne font que commencer à s'en rendre compte.

Si vous vous cramponnez encore aux attributs du passé, il est temps de lâcher prise. Les nombreuses couches d'équipement qui séparaient les créateurs de contenu de leur auditoire ont tout simplement disparu. Elles ne reviendront jamais et vous avez manqué leurs funérailles. L'entrepôt où toute cette quincaillerie a fini ses jours a déjà été rasé pour faire place au siège social d'une entreprise technologique dont vous n'avez pas encore entendu parler.

Les médias de l'avenir sont agiles, vifs et intimes. Ils font peu de cas de leurs prédécesseurs et des méthodes de travail d'autrefois. Il y a un véritable pouvoir à aller chercher dans la compréhension de ce phénomène. Ceux qui s'accrochent au pouvoir des médias traditionnels vont presque certainement le perdre.

Les chefs de file de ce nouvel environnement sont ceux qui réussissent à valoriser l'apport de leurs lecteurs, de leurs auditeurs et de leurs spectateurs. Le public d'aujourd'hui est en quête d'authenticité. L'Américain moyen préfère YouTube à Geraldo Rivera, car il fait davantage confiance à son voisin qu'aux grands médias. (Bien entendu, dans ces deux cas, il faudra toujours quelqu'un pour départager symboliquement le contenu de qualité des « selfies » pris dans la salle de bain.)

Nul ne peut prédire quel sera l'impact des technologies dans dix ans. La plupart de nos hypothèses seront considérées farfelues en fin de compte. Ceux qui tireront leur épingle du jeu ne seront pas nécessairement les partisans de l'application vidéo Periscope ou Meerkat. Le mode de diffusion du contenu sera important, mais secondaire. En revanche, les principes de base d'interaction humaine et de respect demeureront essentiels. Ils seront toujours aussi efficaces, peu importe la technologie employée.

Faites rire les gens, faites-les réfléchir et faites-leur ressentir des émotions. Soyez sincère et dites la vérité telle que vous la percevez. Accordez plus d'importance à vos principes qu'à vos intérêts. Vous n'êtes plus un acteur de scène, mais une voix qui doit percer la rumeur de la foule. Laissez votre public enrichir et amplifier votre contenu, et soyez assez humble pour être à l'écoute de leurs intuitions. Ces quelques principes vous garantiront un succès monstre. Appliquez-les à la lettre et vous pourrez changer le monde.

Ceci étant dit, je tiens à féliciter le Huffington Post pour ses 10 ans d'innovation et de succès. Plusieurs s'en sont moqués lorsqu'il est devenu le premier média non traditionnel à pouvoir poser une question au président des États-Unis. Il était impensable qu'Internet joue un si grand rôle. Une décennie plus tard, nous nous demandons maintenant si les médias traditionnels ont encore la moindre importance.

Le jour où les médias traditionnels seront relégués aux oubliettes et iront rejoindre les commis de station-service des années 1950 n'est pas si lointain. J'ai déjà hâte de voir ce que le Huffington Post écrira à leur sujet.

8,Steinem,Gloria,variety,"The fact that we have an International Women’s Day means we are still in trouble. There is no International Men’s Day. Only less powerful people or forgotten historical events need “A Day” to be part of the present. Yet it’s an important step because any notice is better than no notice.

On this International Women’s Day, we might start by admitting why women are subordinated in the first place. We have the one thing that men don’t have — wombs — and they can’t perpetuate themselves or differences of race and class without controlling or influencing us.

Until the 1960s, interracial marriage was illegal in some parts of this country, and children not “owned” by a man were “illegitimate.” Even now, right-wing groups object to abortion or clinics that teach contraception, mostly because white women have been choosing to have fewer children on average than women of color.

But the first condition of democracy is being able to make decisions about our own bodies, and that has consistently been taken away from women. We’re beginning to have some control over giving birth, but the rates of sexual assault and rape have increased. The good news is that sexual assault and harassment are illegal and reported now, instead of people saying “Why did you have that dress on?” or “Why were you in that neighborhood,” which is where we started.

There has been big progress thanks to Anita Hill and the MeToo movement — they educated the whole country. But there are still groups out there that disbelieve women, or try to force women to give birth, even after a rape, by saying that “life” begins at the moment of conception, and fetal life counts more than a woman’s life.

We have made a huge step forward with equal pay legislation yet we still don’t have equal pay. The last estimate I saw was that just equal pay for women of all races — equal to what men in similar jobs are earning — would put nearly $500 billion more a year into the economy. But, right now, jobs themselves are often valued according to who does them. For instance, in New York, the last time I looked, a guy who was a parking attendant was making more money than a woman who was a child care attendant. We don’t value our cars more than our children, but an almost all- male profession is valued and paid more than a mostly female profession.

Change is slow. Like a tree, it grows from the bottom up, and we still have a long way to go. But we just need to keep going and to celebrate how far we’ve come. We also have fun doing it. Supporting each other and finding new ways to work is the source of day-to-day change, and also of joy and community.

The women who have had the deepest, most continuing influence on me are probably Florynce Kennedy and Alice Walker. Flo was a lawyer when that was very rare for a Black woman. Later, she became an activist instead, because, as she said, “The law is a one-ass-at-a-time proposition, and what you have to do is stop the wringer.” We traveled and spoke together as a team in the ‘70s and ’80s. She was almost twenty years older. She was my first and most important teacher.

Alice Walker, who is younger than I, has been an inspiration, too. Her writing, her understanding, her use of how country people talk have made her stories travel around the world.

Accidentally, I met a woman from Japan, and then later a woman from China, both of whom had translated Alice’s novel, “The Color Purple.” Both used the language of their own country people, just as Alice had here, and that was a first in a work of high art.

If you do one true thing, it will make change wherever it goes.

Excerpted from a conversation with Claudia Eller, Variety Editor-in-Chief



Gloria Steinem, co-founder of Ms. magazine, is a celebrated feminist, journalist and social activist who became a national leader of the women’s movement in the late 1960s and early ’70s. She is also a co-founder of the Women’s Media Center, which “works to make women visible and powerful in media.”",-2,https://variety.com/2021/biz/news/gloria-steinem-international-womens-day-2021-1234923533/

Don’t Become Invisible

“Vision is the art of seeing what is invisible to others.” – Jonathan Swift

2020 was a challenging year and you had to distance yourself from others. This Friday Flashback Post stresses visibility.

Also, just because it is tax season, it doesn’t mean you are permitted to forget about visibility. During this time of year, CPAs are the heroes – you are working very hard to help others. Stress that theme on your website and other social media sites.",-2,https://ritakeller.com/blog/2021/02/dont-become-invisible.html?platform=hootsuite
10,Steinem,Gloria,msmagazine,"Out of sight should not mean out of mind—and heart. But the tragedy for women in prison is that it often does.

For the rest of us, this invisibility keeps us from realizing how much women in prison may resemble you and me. For example:

Eighty percent are mothers.

About five percent are pregnant and give birth in prison.

And in 28 states, women give birth in chains because we have not yet succeeded in even passing anti-shackling laws.

Most women in prison are not a danger to society. About 82 percent have been convicted of non-violent crimes. Often, they are suffering unfairly harsh consequences even for nonviolent crimes, like possessing or selling illegal drugs. And many of the women convicted of so-called murder have actually killed a violent partner in self-defense, yet not been allowed to plead self-defense. This real motive that would have been allowed in a non “domestic” setting.

This is part of the reason women and girls are the fastest growing incarcerated population in the United States today. Over the course of the past four decades, women’s state prison populations have grown more than 834 percent—more than doubling the rate of growth in men’s prisons. And the incarceration rates for women of color outpace their white counterparts by 100 percent: Black women are twice as likely as white women to be incarcerated.

Once in prison, women also suffer significantly higher rates of sexual victimization and violence by the staff who are supposed to protect them. At the less visible end of the spectrum, prisoners’ mental and physical health often deteriorates, and their most basic hygiene and reproductive needs—even access to tampons or pads—are ignored.

Knowledge is power. Learning such facts is a first step to action for us, and feeling seen is a first step toward hope and sanity for those inside. We at Ms. want women in prison to know they are seen and valued. And because domestic violence shelters can be almost as isolating as prisons—and often lack even libraries or any reading material, just as many prisons do—we decided to include women in those shelters in this program too.

That’s why we started the Ms. Prison and Domestic Violence Shelter Program. It is funded by charitable contributions earmarked for this purpose, and also by Ms. Community Members who buy an extra membership and subscription for a friend they don’t know.

And now, we send Ms. to 5,096 federal, state and county prisoners. That’s a fraction of the total, but it’s a number we’re very proud of and hope to keep growing.

We also send magazines to hundreds of domestic violence shelters. This year during the pandemic, we’ve done our best to increase the number of shelters we send magazines to.

That’s because domestic violence shelters across the nation have reported increasing numbers of women and their children showing up at their doors during the crisis. As a shelter in San Luis Obispo, Calif., where we send magazines explains:

“…domestic violence is spiking as folks are being forced to shelter at home with an abusive partner, they’ve lost support systems like their schools, and they are experiencing new stressors related to job insecurity and health fears. Violence is escalating and the need for our services is greater than ever before.”

Over the sixteen years since this program’s birth, we’ve discovered that even this small gesture of recognition, support and information means a lot. Women in prison often spend 17 hours a day isolated in their cells, with no reading material except The Bible, or with only books and magazines they must share with hundreds of other women.

Here’s what Deenna Smith wrote to us from prison in Chillicothe, Miss.:

“I read your article … about female inmates learning to code as part of The Last Mile [Fall 2019] … I wish we could receive training such as this. I once ordered a book on coding, but most computer books are banned in this facility. There are so many opportunities that we women miss out on because of the strict guidelines that are in place. In men’s facilities, the rules are more lenient.”

Deenna went on to write that when she is released, she wants to start her own magazine … to help other women in prison.

“I know I can make a big difference in the world,” she wrote. “And my inspiration comes from this magazine.”

It’s stories like Deenna’s that inspire us to build our Prison and Domestic Violence Program bigger, to reach even more women. And to reflect their reality in our pages.

For instance, Ms. has been reporting on one of the driving forces behind increasing incarceration rates among women: the cash bail system. Sixty percent of jailed women—often primary caregivers for their families—remain locked up before their trial simply because they cannot afford to pay bail (a median cost of $11,700 in the U.S.). This is a form of the debtor’s prisons that were eliminated in the 19th century.

Also data has shown that when a woman is unable to afford bail, she is more likely to be convicted, more likely to receive a longer sentence and more likely to end up with a lifelong criminal record. Many women also tend not to benefit from plea-bargaining simply because they cannot afford a lawyer. That’s exactly what happened to Deborah Burlingham, of Las Vegas, who wrote to us after receiving Ms. in prison:

“I recently read your Summer issue and thoroughly enjoyed every article. I especially was impressed with ‘Held for Ransom’ by Sarah Willets. I too was a victim of this practice. I am currently incarcerated for a DUI—no injuries, no property damage. My bail was set at $100,000 cash only! I remained there until my initial court date 33 days later. I was then transferred to prison. Reading and working out are my two periods of sanity every day. Keep up the good work of informing women about important issues.”

The Ms. Prison and Domestic Violence Shelter Program lets women on the inside know they are not alone. Every American should be ashamed that this country puts a greater proportion of its citizens in prison than any other nation on earth, because of racism, sexism and also because in many states, the Prison Industrial Complex allows corporations to build and run prisons for profit.

And our Program lets survivors of domestic violence who are now in shelters know it’s unfair for them to be deprived of home while the criminal is free. We must all work together against notions of “masculinity” and “femininity” that have turned the home into the single most dangerous place for women and children in this country.

Nothing can replace systematic remedies, and nothing can replace reaching out to women in prisons and shelters right now. If you would like the deep satisfaction of knowing you’re part of letting women know they’re not alone, please make a tax-deductible contribution to the Ms . Prison and Domestic Violence Shelter Program.

Nine-year-old Anabel, from Los Angeles, explains it best:

“I am nine and my daddy got me a subscription (in my name) to Ms. magazine. I read my copy once I get it. My daddy and I have enclosed $12, $2 from me and the rest from my daddy. I think it’s sad that women go to jail for no reason and I want to help. Please enjoy the picture I’ve drawn.”

Art from nine-year-old Anabel from Los Angeles.

If you send a friend you don’t know a copy of Ms., it will have her name on it, and be something she knows will keep coming—hundreds of pages of words and images that link her to the world of women.

On the outside, the women’s movement brings us support, facts, creativity, humor and a sense of community. Pass it on.

The coronavirus pandemic and the response by federal, state and local authorities is fast-moving. During this time, Ms. is keeping a focus on aspects of the crisis—especially as it impacts women and their families—often not reported by mainstream media.

Película no recomendada a menores de 13 años

Ruth Bader Ginsburg, nacida en el seno de una familia judía norteamericana de primera generación en marzo de 1933 (Brooklyn), jamás imaginó el lugar que ocuparía en la memoria del sistema legal de Estados Unidos y de la cultura pop a nivel mundial. Egresada de la Universidad de Cornell, donde conocería a su esposo Martin, Rtuh fue una abogada y profesora de derecho que abogó y luchó en los primeros casos de discriminación de género ante la Corte Suprema de su país. Ruth representó a mujeres que enfrentaban prejuicios en todos los ámbitos, en la Fuerza Aérea, en el Seguro Social, en la violencia doméstica, logrando ser nominada, por el presidente Carter, al Tribunal de Apelaciones del Distrito de Columbia. Convertida en juez de la Suprema Corte, designada por el presidente Bill Clinton, la figura de RGB ha dejado un legado en las leyes y se ha convertido en un ícono de la cultura; sin embargo, su vida no estuvo carente de controversias y decisiones erróneas, incluso para sorpresa de sus miles de seguidores.",-2,https://www.sensacine.com.mx/peliculas/pelicula-262109/

First, a few key terms. Patriarchy is not, at the end of the day, defined by the gender of one’s leaders. It’s a societal model based on the rigid binaries and hierarchies necessary to divide, conquer, and control—e.g., men over women, men over nature, straight and cis over queer and trans, rich over poor, and, often, white over Black and Brown. Magic is energy moved with the intention of transforming reality. Therefore, for our purposes, #HexingThePatriarchy is channeling energy to dismantle this hierarchical world order and then cast a new, freer world.

In An American Covenant, I set out to do my own small part in this large-scale quest by telling the stories of five powerful feminist mystics over three centuries who helped transform America—though by and large we’ve forgotten their names. It’s a story about resistance. It’s a story about power, control, and freedom. It’s also a story about a slight blonde lesbian in her mid-30s seeking transcendence while navigating personal and cosmic chaos—me.

In most American mystic traditions, the natural world, including each and every one of us, stands as divine as anything on high in the sky. This belief has long beget radical notions of the equal right of all to a decent life here on earth—regardless of race, gender, profession, etc. This, of course, has the bonus of dovetailing nicely with our nation’s founding words. However, this alternate spiritual basis for the American experiment threatens the patriarchal powers that be by empowering all those they seek to control. And so, once we could no longer acceptably burn (or hang) feminist mystics, we were taught to mock them and their oft mainstream traditions into a spectral historical footnote. This book aims to help #HexThePatriarchy by pulling five of our feminist mystic leaders back into the direct light of herstory and their rightful place as American (s)heroes.

Below, I’ve included eight other books that aim to stick a flaming pebble in the spokes of the patriarchal machine—as eight connotes new beginnings and new societal orders. Some of the books are fiction, some non-fiction. Many emerged during, and are evocative of, a major wave of American feminism. Others explore a mystic or mystic tradition discussed in my book. All can help us recognize and touch the divine, mystic spark deep within so we can keep up the fight for however long it takes to win it.

Mules and Men by Zora Neal Hurston

In the late 1920s, Zora Neal Hurston, then a leading light of the Harlem Renaissance, headed South to New Orleans and her “native village” of Eatonville, Florida, on a mission to create the first great anthology of African American myths, rituals, and songs. The result was Mules and Men—a book chock full of poetic resistance to the patriarchal powers that be.

In my personal favorite section, Zora meets Luke Turner, who attests he is the nephew of New Orleans greatest Voodoo Queen, Marie Laveau. Zora then apprentices with Luke, learning his and Marie’s Hoodoo ways. She also learns of Marie Laveau’s true legacy, nearly lost to history—that she served as a symbol of liberation to people of color throughout New Orleans, both in life and after her 1881 death. Or as Luke put it:

“Time went around pointing out what God had already made. Moses had seen the Burning Bush. Solomon by magic knowed all wisdom. And Marie Laveau was a woman in New Orleans.”

Radical Spirits by Ann Braude

In the late 1850s, up to 10% of the American free adult populace adhered to Spiritualism in some form or fashion. This mystic movement is rooted in ideals of equality and spiritual autonomy, eschewing biblically ordained hierarchies of gender, race, and class. Many early suffragists were Spiritualists—and nearly all Spiritualists supported women’s suffrage. Spiritualism’s popularity, therefore, helped fuel the spread of this “radical” notion, that women deserved the vote, across the nation. Plus, more oft than not, women served as mediums and the de facto heads of this largely headless movement. Braude’s book, which came out in 1989, was among the—if not the—first to chronicle Spiritualism’s pivotal role in giving 19th-century women a public political and social voice. It’s a fascinating read that lends a new mystic lens to American progressive culture and politics.

The Illness Lesson by Clare Beams

In the late 1800s, the American male medical establishment coined the term “mediomania,” in an effort to link insanity to Spiritualism, and cut down the threat to the patriarchal order. They then redefined insanity’s symptoms as the most common side effects of entrancement—rigidity, seizure, ecstasy. Eventually, they settled on the more widely employed “hysteria,” derived from the Greek hystera, meaning uterus.

Beams riveting slow burn of a novel tells a story of “teenage hysteria” set in 1871 in New England. The prose is so thick with mystic symbols and smoldering repression that it reads like a startlingly lucid dream or nightmare—one that explores how, even when well meaning, the male medical and philosophical establishments can hex a woman by convincing her that her flawed, weak body, not the strict limits society puts on her, are responsible for her ills. It also poignantly expresses the power of pulling back that curtain and seeing the truth: you are strong.

The Spiral Dance by Starhawk

In this second-wave feminist mystic classic, Starhawk codifies her nature-loving withcraft tradition, called Reclaiming, and her ideas on how the Craft can realign energy towards social justice. She also presents a potent book of spells, all helpful for dismantling the patriarchy, and her own take on the feminist legend that, circa 3,000 BCE, war and its Gods emerged to snuff out ancient matriarchies. Humanity, the story goes, then replaced that matriarchal order based on equality and personal autonomy with one of rigid hierarchical control. I’d say she stands as the high theologian of the Feminist Craft (though she’d probably not like my hierarchical terminology).

Circe by Madeline Miller

One’s cultural myths should reflect the values one holds most sacred, as our myths shape our psyches and life choices—even if we don’t think they do. However, most Western myths, told only from the perspective of white men, do not reflect the values I hold most sacred. And many of these myths began with the Greeks. In Circe, Madeline Miller recasts these archetypal tales through the gaze of the witch Circe, revealing the bombastic brittleness that always undergirded the patriarchal originals equating brutality with valor and narcissism with honor.

The Fifth Season by N.K. Jemisin

In addition to recasting old myths, forging new but equally resonant ones can help shift how we perceive and therefore construct our world. In this, the first book in her Broken Earth trilogy, N.K. Jemisin reflects our own more lamentable values back to us via her mythic land, called the Stillness, where the earth is a violent father, not a nurturing mother, and the only way to survive seems to be to cling to a rigid cast system. By the end of the book, this belief is not just revealed as an illusion, but something far more sinister in this tale of how, exactly, the Stillness came to seem bent on destroying itself.

Revolution from Within by Gloria Steinem

In the 1970s, many “second”-wave feminists believed if they changed the laws limiting women’s standing in society, the revolution would follow. By the 1990s and the “third” wave of American feminism, it had grown clarion it was a much longer game. In this incredibly well-researched book published in 1992, Gloria Steinem, the most famous of second-wavers, chronicles how to dismantle the carefully constructed muzzle the patriarchy puts on all of our “inner voices”—be we men, women, or in-between and beyond. She then provides historic and personal anecdotes demonstrating that, so freed, this inner-voice—often mystically referred to as a light—alters a person, makes them far less willing to accept powerlessness and near-impossible to control.

Wide Sargasso Sea by Jean Rhys

After I finished writing An American Covenant and pondering mystic journeys through my unconscious mind, I took a deep dive into French feminist psychoanalytic theory. From these thinkers, I learned how “the phallic order” employs many tools to dominate our minds. A clutch one is an over-reliance on highly linear narrative structures that confine our thinking to strictly prescribed, rationale boxes—cutting off access to all that lies beneath this mental veneer.

Wide Sargasso Sea undermines that “phallic order” through its meandering impressionistic narrative style redolent with natural imagery and inner emotional states. It also undermines it via the plot itself. Rhys recasts Jane Eyre’s crazy woman in the attic into her protagonist and that classic 19th-century British novel into a mid-20th century anti-colonial, feminist treatise. The madwoman, Antoinette, is, in Rhys’ telling, a young Creole heiress married off to a broke but British—and therefore socially desirable—Mr. Rochester. From the early days of her Jamaican youth, Antoinette’s life is defined by the patriarchy’s urge to violently expunge in others all its been told is abject in itself. They may call you insane. They may call you uncivilized. They may call you Satanic. But you can, in turn, tell stories that hex them right back—and free us all in the process.",-2,https://electricliterature.com/8-books-about-hexing-the-patriarchy/
16,Steinem,Gloria,scotusblog,"“What would Ruth do?”: A feminist pioneer on what Justice Ginsburg meant to her

By Gloria Steinem

at 5:48 pm

Gloria Steinem by Beowulf Sheehan

This tribute is the last in a series on the life and work of the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

Gloria Steinem is a writer, lecturer, political activist and feminist organizer.

Because Ruth Bader Ginsburg and I are pretty much age peers, I think that I have some perspective on this extraordinary woman long before she became known to many of us as the Notorious RBG – and long before she ended the gender divide that had been the norm in Supreme Court rulings.

Ruth and I got to know each other decades ago when she was creating the Women’s Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union. From the onset, she was clear that reproductive freedom included the right to have, as well as not to have, children. I say this now because much has been said about Ruth’s support for women’s right to a safe and legal abortion, but less about her belief that reproductive justice must also include the right to bear children. At that time, some Black women were being sterilized by economic coercion or legal conditions of state aid. Sterilization of poor Black women had become a practice so common that it was sometimes called “a Mississippi appendectomy.” Yet white women often had to have two or more children, plus their husbands’ written permission, before a doctor would perform a tubal ligation that freed them from the dangers of multiple pregnancies or artificial birth control. What could be more clearly racist than that?

Ruth took on an early case defending two teenage girls against sterilization as a condition of receiving state aid. To help her build a case, she asked me and her co-director, Brenda Feigen, to interview Fannie Lou Hamer, the great Mississippi civil rights worker, who had been sterilized in a hospital when she entered for an entirely different reason. Ultimately, Fannie Lou’s courageous testimony helped Ruth to defend the reproductive rights of those two young Black girls who otherwise would have been sterilized as a condition of receiving state aid.

These are just some of the reasons I know Ruth always understood that racism and sexism are intertwined, and thus must be uprooted together. She knew that in the long run, the visible signs of race are only perpetuated by influencing who has children with whom, and how many children they have. We must continue to learn this from her. She will remain the standard of courage and intellect and kindness and heart that all of us should strive for. Even as I write this, news stories are reporting allegations of unwanted hysterectomies and other sterilizing procedures being performed on migrant women, without their permission, while detained at the detention centers at our borders. Ruth would have known and opposed this. We must oppose it, too.

In 1971, I got an improbable invitation from the Harvard Law Review to be the first female speaker at its annual banquet. I told them that made no sense whatsoever — they should ask Ruth Ginsburg, among the very first women to go there. However, I soon discovered from women students that the law review didn’t want to ask Ruth because she knew too well how entrenched sexism was at Harvard Law School. I accepted, and thanks to the honesty of the still few women who were enrolled, I too discovered how dependent it was on its white male elitist history. For example, Harvard had courses in whaling law, yet none on women and the law. Also, bathrooms intended for men were just marked “Faculty,” so sure were the architects that women would never be lawyers. I argued, or “instructed” as those covering my speech reported, that admittance based on gender should be as much a priority as geographical distribution was already considered.

Not only was I the first woman, but also the only speaker at a Harvard Law Review banquet that was protested by faculty members. My reward: a cheerful call from Ruth. Among other things, we discussed the absence of women’s bathrooms near the floor of Congress, a problem for women lawmakers. When we added the decades of bathrooms labeled “White” and “Colored,” we considered an academic course called, “The Politics of Peeing.” Meanwhile, the Harvard Law Record covered my speech with a front-page headline: “Steinem Criticizes HLS Sexism.”

Many profiles of Ruth have commented on the legendary sense of humor possessed by her husband, Marty, but to be with them was to realize they both knew the truth of the adage: Laughing is a proof of freedom. She also used humor to make a point. I remember when the Dalton School called her with some question about her son, James, and she said, “You know, he does have two parents.” Hopefully, the school then called Marty. Her understanding of fairness could be seen in her cases and decisions and in such daily and seemingly minor ways of standing up for herself, an important lesson because too many of us find it easier to fight for others than for ourselves. Likewise, Ruth didn’t just argue for equality; she practiced it personally. For instance, while she supported marriage equality on paper or on the court, she also personally performed the marriage ceremony of two men who were her friends.

Through Ms. magazine, I got to know more about Ruth through her then-teenage daughter, Jane, who came to volunteer with us after school, as if the visibility of what we were doing weren’t far exceeded by the depth of what Ruth was doing. She understood that daughters need to go out on their own, even if their mothers are way further out than anyone else.

Years later she invited me to give a speech with her about the importance of the Equal Rights Amendment at a conference held by the judges of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit. Ruth calmed my nerves by stating the obvious: “Don’t worry,” she said. “They are more nervous than you are. Lawyers have to be respectful, as if the law were always related to justice. You don’t have to pretend.”

Once she was on the Supreme Court, I no longer saw her very often. The rare occasions were at the New York Bar Association, where she sponsored lectures and came all the way from Washington to introduce each one of us she had invited to speak. It was only then that I became aware of the security forces that traveled with her. I assumed the same was true for all Supreme Court justices, but I was told that her positions on reproductive and religious freedom put her even more in danger. Suddenly, she seemed so fragile, all the more so because of her later struggles with illness, yet with each passing one, I was somehow more persuaded that she was invulnerable.

The image of Ruth I cherish the most is an earlier one I didn’t see for myself, but was described to me: Ruth riding horseback in Colorado with a western saddle, even though she was used to an eastern one, galloping wildly, hair flying, loving it. Ruth was always a whole person. It was really saying something when friends pointed out that her heart was as great as her mind.

Looking back, I realize that when others on the court issued an opinion, we said to each other: Did he or she vote right? Ruth is the one person about whom so many felt: If Ruth voted that way, then it is right.

Being so close to the same age, I thought I would never have to live in a world without Ruth in it. Now, I can only think of one answer to the heartbreak and tragedy of her loss: Whenever we face a question or a challenge, we can ask ourselves: What would Ruth do?

As long as this answer guides our acts, she will be with us still.",-2,https://www.scotusblog.com/2020/09/what-would-ruth-do-a-feminist-pioneer-on-what-justice-ginsburg-meant-to-her/
17,Steinem,Gloria,crfashionbook,"Take a note from the most iconic stars of yesterday-quite literally. Words to Live By is a compilation of the most memorable quotes from Old Hollywood on love, style, life, and more.

Mother Teresa, also known as Saint Teresa of Calcutta, was born Anjezë Gonxhe Bojaxhiu on August 26, 1910 in Skopje, North Macedonia. By age 12, the Albanian-Indian Roman Catholic nun and missionary knew she wanted to devote herself to religious life. At 18, she moved to Ireland to learn English and join the Sisters of Loreto. She moved to India the next year, where she would spend the rest of her life caring for the poor. She founded the Missions of Charity in 1950, which managed homes for those dying of HIV/AIDS, leprosy, and tuberculosis, as well as provided food, medical assistance, and counseling to those in need. She received many honors for her charity work throughout her lifetime, including the Nobel Peace Prize and Pacem in Terris award. At the time of her death in 1997, the Missions of Charity had over 4,000 sisters and 300 associated brothers running 610 missions in 123 countries. Almost 20 years later, she was canonized as a saint by Pope Francis for her virtuous work and miracles of healing.

18,Steinem,Gloria,speakingtree,"Q: You speak a lot about interdependence and the need to connect with each other. Are you influenced by Buddhism?

A: Well, no, I wouldn’t say I’m Buddhist or that I follow any particular religion – in fact i am more spiritual than religious. It is not about me being influenced by Buddhism -- in my case i belatedly went to Bhutan and discovered that the Bon faith that preceded Buddhism was much more powerful and respected women a great deal more and Buddhism that came later was more patriarchal. I will find out more!

To be aware of the fact that we are interdependent is very helpful for one big reason: To organise ourselves in groups and support each other. Equity is not about one person and how that one person functions. It is about everyone and when we acknowledge that we are all connected, it makes sense to work toward equity in all respects, whether with reference to gender issues or otherwise.

Take the media, for instance, it is generally thought that only conflict is newsworthy. There is debate, pros and cons, and we forget that there is another aspect that does not necessarily fall under pro or con. We need a leap of consciousness that will take us to the next step, to interdependence; that we are all part of nature and together we need to help each other.

19,Steinem,Gloria,crfashionbook,"Barack Obama is a dynamic and inspiring political figure. Born in Honolulu, Hawaii on August 4, 1961, the former U.S. President began his career in politics after graduating from Harvard Law School, first serving as a representative of the Illinois Senate and eventually graduating to the United States senate. Upon his 2008 presidential nomination and subsequent win, Obama was sworn in as the 44th president of the United States in 2009, the first Black man to ever hold the position. Aside from being a trailblazing political candidate, the former POTUS is a multi-talented public figure, from secret basketball skills to multiple book deals.

I read the scripts and discovered that the whole premise was very wrong. Phyllis Schlafly and her followers were credited with stopping the ERA, rather than the insurance industry and other economic interests that stood to lose billions if the ERA passed. So I wrote back: “I respectfully decline. Yes, it’s good about Schlafly and her interest in military policy, but it comes off as a catfight among women rather than a battle between the ERA and economic interests.” I also sent these coproducers to Ellie Smeal, who, as president of the National Organization for Women during six years of struggle in state legislatures, had learned firsthand that Schlafly was only window dressing. The anti-ERA fix was already in.

Two years ago, I, Ellie, became alarmed by the false premise of the sample “Mrs. America” scripts, and asked my colleague, Kathy Spillar, to reach out to the producers about our concerns. Public opinion polls had always proved that a big majority of American women supported the ERA, yet state legislators also knew it was opposed by the insurance industry, chambers of commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers and other corporate lobbyists. Health insurance interests alone stood to lose billions if the ERA forced it to stop charging women more for less coverage, and since that industry was largely state-regulated, it had lobbyists in every state capital. Phyllis Schlafly and her antifeminist homemakers had been brought in to cover for legislators who were voting against the ERA anyway.

Of course, Hollywood can tell any story, regardless of history, but this one is being presented as fact, and has arrived in a perfect storm of circumstance. Months of COVID-19 lockdown have given the nine episodes of “Mrs. America” a captive-at-home audience, and reviews have focused on women’s hairstyles and individual rivalries, not the real reason state legislators voted against the ERA. And while “Mrs. America” depicts pro-ERA forces as slightly more diverse than Schlafly’s lily-white followers, and does introduce viewers to such black feminists as Shirley Chisholm, Florynce Kennedy, Audrey Rowe Colom and Margaret Sloan, it ignores a bigger reality. In the 1972 first-ever national poll about the women’s liberation movement, 67% of black women approved of it, and only 35% of white women did.

Indeed, the plot of “Mrs. America” seems to depend on a trivialization of women of all races. Would a national legislative failure of the civil rights movement be attributed to a rivalry between followers of Martin Luther King Jr. and followers of Malcolm X? Somehow, we don’t think so.

The bottom line is this: “Mrs. America” has described deck chairs on the Titanic but lied about why the Titanic went down. Instead, it has given us the Catfight Theory of History. Of course, women may disagree with each other on all sorts of topics, but the obvious truth is that we don’t have the power to be our own worst enemies. That superlative belongs to the corporate forces that are still making an extra $400 billion a year from paying women of all races less than white men for doing comparable work. And we haven’t even started on unequal parenting, or the real costs of domestic abuse and sexualized violence.

Thanks to the Affordable Care Act and its federal regulation of the insurance industry, the ERA today has a better chance against powerful economic lobbies. And several states have seized the opportunity; Nevada, Illinois and Virginia have all ratified the amendment in recent years. But as Virginia delegate Jennifer Carroll Foy said this year when her vote and the Democratic majority made her state the 38th to ratify the ERA, “Passage of the Equal Rights Amendment today is a result of women coming together over decades, refusing to suffer in silence as we are discriminated against, paid less and subjected to gender-based violence.” Of course, even that crucial 38th ratification doesn’t mean the ERA is now law; the U.S. Congress must vote to remove the timeline for ratification, which was initially set for 1979 and which Congress later extended to 1982, or the federal courts must recognize its ratification.

In “Mrs. America’s” final moments, a series of title cards describes these recent developments; the last ones note that while the House has passed a resolution eradicating the old deadline, the “Republican-controlled Senate is unlikely to take up the measure.” But “Mrs. America” fails to examine why that might be so, and fails to update viewers on the fact that the ERA is again opposed for economic reasons. Republicans want to keep profiteering off inequality. Like pretty much everything else, the fate of the ERA depends on the next election.

We write now because we fear the good actors who play Schlafly and her followers may lead viewers to believe that Schlafly actually changed any votes, or that her anti-ERA campaign was larger or more popular than the campaign for the ERA. Quite the contrary: The pro-ERA majority campaign was larger than anything Schlafly ever produced, with marches and rallies and Lobby Days supported by the endorsements and participation of over 450 major women’s, civil rights and labor organizations representing more than 50 million Americans, including teachers, librarians, nurses, homemakers, garment workers, sports figures, celebrities, artists and workers of all kinds. Thousands of volunteers in unratified states visited state legislators and delivered millions of letters and telegrams to them. The show does acknowledge the broad popular support for the ERA in a later episode, but the time spent with Schlafly and her crew onscreen leaves viewers thinking that she was crucial.

We are not writing because of any personal gripes with “Mrs. America.” I, Gloria, have had to explain to outraged viewers that I, like anyone categorized as a public figure, can bring legal action only if I can prove that my ability to support myself has been damaged. Thus, so what if this show gets my haircut right and my character wrong? And I, Ellie, consider myself super lucky not to be portrayed in this at all. Both of us can live with the result.

But as you watch “Mrs. America,” which was just nominated for 10 Emmys by the Television Academy, we do ask that you think about the false history in this show and its negative impact on the present and future. First, its Catfight Theory not only lies about the past but doesn’t prepare women or men to battle the economic forces that are still opposed to the ERA. Second, viewers don’t learn that in ratified states, coalitions are now working to pass state-level ERAs that are crucial to our lives. Third, “Mrs. America” has exported this Catfight Theory to England, Australia and India, thus misrepresenting history here and depressing even more women. And finally, this series has profiteered off all of the above, without even the courtesy of contributing some of its profits to campaigning for a removal of the deadline, and thus a final ERA victory. Exactly how much are FX and Hulu making? Indeed, how much are the show’s producers, showrunners and stars making?

I don’t think viewers would be unreasonable in expecting that, say, 10% of all profits from “Mrs. America” be contributed to the ERA Coalition (I, Gloria, am an unpaid board member). The group unites more than 100 national and local organizations still struggling to join every other democracy in the world by including in our Constitution the equality of girls and women, boys and men.

It’s worth checking out the ERA Coalition, which offers information about how to join the 96% of women and 90% of men who support the ERA, and how to contribute to its final passage. It will help make up for the misinformation of “Mrs. America.”

Feminism takes centre stage in the US drama Mrs America, offering a nostalgia trip and a history lesson to viewers when it debuts on BBC Two on Wednesday night.

The nine-part drama takes us back to the 1970s and the political movement to pass the Equal Rights Amendment in the US – with several big names bringing prominent women from the era to life on the small screen.

The cast’s led by Oscar-winner Cate Blanchett, but who else stars, and what time should you tune in?

Here’s what you need to know…

What time is Mrs America on BBC Two tonight?

Mrs America kicks off on BBC Two at 9pm.

The series kicks off with a double bill of episodes, with the second following at 9.45pm.

If you miss any instalments you’ll be able to catch up with them on BBC iPlayer.

Who is in the cast of Mrs America?

As well as Blanchett, there are some pretty big names filling out the cast of this one.

Australian actress Rose Byrne stars as feminist and activist Gloria Steinem, while Orange Is The New Black’s Uzo Aduba plays politician Shirley Chisholm, who was the first black woman ever to be elected to the United States Congress.

Orange Is The New Black’s Uzo Aduba also features as Shirley Chisholm (Picture: BBC)

Meanwhile Elizabeth Banks stars as another famous activist of the era, former White House special assistant Jill Ruckelshaus.

Other cast members we’ll be seeing in coming episodes include Melanie Lynskey, Jeanne Tripplehorn, Sarah Paulson and Tracey Ullman.

Is Cate Blanchett’s character based on a real person?

The drama features some pretty major names (Picture: BBC)

All of the main characters are or were real people – and Cate’s character Phyllis Schlafly is no exception.

Phyllis, a movement conservative and author, was opposed to feminism and abortion, and campaigned against the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment to the US Constitution – which was ultimately narrowly defeated in the wake of her campaign.

Her opposition to the amendment came in the form of the STOP ERA campaign, with Schlafly arguing that the amendment would see an end to gender-specific privileges for women such as separate male and female restrooms, as well as women being exempt from the military draft.

Schlafly also founded conservative political interest group the Eagle Forum, remaining as its chair and CEO until her death in 2016.

23,Steinem,Gloria,standard,"A t the dawn of the Seventies, America’s Equal Rights Amendment seemed like a guaranteed win for feminists.

It was even endorsed by President Nixon. But decades later this legislation, which guarantees equal rights regardless of sex, is yet to be ratified. Yes, you read that right. And the campaign against it was led by a woman.

Mrs America, BBC Two’s terrifyingly timely new miniseries, grapples with the complex legacy of Phyllis Schlafly, the proudly anti-feminist activist who mobilised legions of housewives to take a stand against gender equality just as Second Wave feminism was at its zenith. Along with Schlafly, we meet an all-star feminist gang led by Gloria Steinem (Rose Byrne), who are battling not just for the ERA but also for the right to legal, safe abortion. Sound familiar?

With her pastel twinsets and unwavering belief in retro gender roles, it’d be easy to dismiss Schlafly, played by Cate Blanchett in her first major TV role, as a Right-wing relic, a Stepfordian throwback to a less enlightened era. Except that the show’s creator, Davhi Waller (Mad Men, Halt) has written a period piece that couldn’t be more relevant. Schlafly, who got thousands of American women to object to their own agency through her endless campaigning, arguably paved the way for Trump.

Nearly four years into his presidency, women’s rights (and their agency over their own bodies) are increasingly precarious in the US — and the fault lines lead back to Schlafly. Her campaigning (done while her sister looked after her six kids — so much for the champion of homemakers) opened up the Republican Party to the religious far Right, the driving force behind the recent spate of attempts to ban or limit abortion in several states. Her willingness to play fast and loose with facts while spitting out polemic is a reminder that fake news is nothing new.

Watching Blanchett’s nuanced portrayal, it’s hardly a surprise Schlafly endorsed Trump before her death in 2016 (he spoke at her funeral, honouring “a true patriot” and noting, oddly: “Phyllis was there for me when it was not at all fashionable.”), nor that so many white women voted him in.

As Mrs America kicks off with a double bill on BBC Two tonight, here’s a primer on the real women whose ceaseless campaigning inspired the series.

Phyllis Schlafly - Cate Blanchett

Getty Images / BBC

What she said: “A woman should have the right to be in the home as a wife and mother”

“A right-wing nut from Illinois.” That’s how Phyllis Schlafly (Blanchett) is dismissively referred to by one feminist activist in the first episode of Mrs America. Schlafly, who spearheaded the movement against the Equal Rights Amendment and eventually helped Christian fundamentalists establish themselves at the core of the Republican Party, was certainly right-wing - but the series presents her in a far more nuanced light.

After an unsuccessful congressional run in 1970, Schlafly switched her focus to grassroots campaigning and managed to drum up formidable support for her STOP ERA movement, arguing that the amendment meant women could lose social security benefits, gender-specific bathrooms and their exemption from the draft.

Though she positioned herself in direct opposition to the likes of Steinem and Friedan, Schlafly was a contradictory figure. A staunch defender of traditional gender roles - she’d even infuriate her feminist counterparts by thanking her husband at the start of each speech - she still enjoyed many of the freedoms and benefits her adversaries supported, travelling around the country and enjoying a successful career herself.

Gloria Steinem - Rose Byrne

Getty Images / FX / BBC

What she said: “Women have two choices: either she’s a feminist or a masochist”

Gloria Steinem surely needs no introduction - but her paparazzi-flanked debut in Mrs America is a reminder of her status as the undisputed rock star of second-wave feminism.

Rose Byrne’s take on the iconic campaigning journalist is rarely without her pale blue aviators and boasts a flowing, dip-dyed Seventies mane, a more groomed version of the un-style many of us have inadvertently acquired during lockdown - though she’s painfully aware that her ‘pretty face’ makes her more acceptable to the media, while also giving opponents an easy way to dismiss her politics.

Episode two charts her struggle to place abortion at the top of the political agenda at a time when most politicians would not dare to even say the word on the House floor. It’s a battle that feels especially resonant as reproductive rights seem ever more precarious for American women.

Shirley Chisholm - Uzo Aduba

Getty / BBC / FX

What she said: “I am and always will be a catalyst for change”

“Unbought and unbossed” - that was Shirley Chisholm’s campaign slogan when she became the first black woman to seek the presidential nomination for a major party in 1972. Played by Orange Is The New Black’s Uzo Aduba in the series, Chisholm had previously made history just four years before, as the first black woman to be elected to the US Congress.

Chisholm was known as ‘Fighting Shirley’ thanks to her relentless campaigning - she introduced more than 50 pieces of legislation during her political career - and the third episode of Mrs America focuses on her battle to win the Democratic nomination. Scenes showing leading ‘libbers’ like Bella Abzug encouraging her to cede to the more ‘electable’ (white, male) George McGovern are a damning reminder of just why intersectional feminism is so important.

Betty Friedan - Tracey Ullman

Shutterstock / FX / BBC

What she said: “No woman gets an orgasm from shining the kitchen floor”

As the author of The Feminine Mystique, the groundbreaking survey of female dissatisfaction in 50s and early 60s America, Betty Friedan (played by Tracey Ullman) is widely credited with jump-starting feminism’s second wave.

Released in 1963, her book gave voice to women who felt stifled by their lot in life and yearned to be seen as more than just homemakers and mothers. It became a bestseller, and Friedan went on to become a leading light of the women’s movement, co-founding and leading the National Organisation for Women.

By the 70s, though, Friedan was often out of step with her more progressive fellow feminists - she famously did not welcome lesbians into the movement, referring to them as the ‘lavender menace’ - and could be something of a loose cannon, especially when it came to her rivalry with Steinem, who she seemed to view as a more glamorous and media-friendly usurper.

Flo Kennedy - Niecy Nash

BBC/FX/Sabrina Lantos

What she said: “Don’t agonise, organise”

“The biggest, the loudest and indisputably the rudest mouth on the battleground” is how People magazine described lawyer, civil rights advocate and feminist activist Flo Kennedy, played in the series by Niecy Nash, back in 1974.

Kennedy was a crucial mentor for Steinem, joining her on speaking tours around America (the pair were in a car together when, so the story goes, the old lady driving told them that “If men could get pregnant, abortion would be a sacrament” - a slogan they’d both go on to use while campaigning).

She represented the Black Panthers in court - as well as defending Valerie Solanas when she was tried for the attempted murder of Andy Warhol - and took part in early class action attempts to repeal New York’s strict abortion laws. Her idiosyncratic sense of style was legendary, instantly recognisable in her pink sunglasses, cowboy hat and ‘Daffy Duck’ eyelashes.

Bella Abzug - Margo Martindale

Getty / FX / BBC

What she said: “Women have been trained to speak softly and carry a lipstick. Those days are over.”

“This woman’s place is in the house - the House of Representatives” might sound like the sort of slogan you saw at the women’s marches a few years back, but it was first uttered by ‘Battling’ Bella Abzug in the 70s.

An indefatigable campaigner for feminist issues and civil rights, Abzug, played on Mrs America by veteran character actress Margo Martindale, started her legal career in the 40s, famously defending Willie McGee, a black man accused of raping a white woman, in a much-publicised case. She went on to become an outspoken critic of the Vietnam War, and was one of the first members of Congress to support gay rights.

On screen, Abzug is portrayed as a no-nonsense and often irascible elder stateswoman of the feminist movement, rarely without one of her trademark huge hats - which she first started wearing as a young lawyer in a bid to be taken seriously by her male colleagues.

Jill Ruckelshaus - Elizabeth Banks

Shutterstock / FX / BBC

What she said: “No one should have to dance backward all their lives”

Elizabeth Banks’ Jill Ruckelshaus doesn’t get as much airtime as her more radical counterparts in the early episodes of Mrs America but, as a pro-choice Republican feminist, she’s proof that the women’s movement contained multitudes.

Sometimes disparagingly referred to as ‘the Gloria Steinem of the Republican Party,’ Ruckelshaus co-founded the National Women’s Political Caucus (a grassroots organisation dedicated to increasing female participation in government) along with the more liberal likes of Kennedy, Chisholm, Friedan, Abzug and of course Steinem.

Her pro-abortion stance and unapologetic feminism made her an anomalous - not to mention controversial - figure in her party in real life. Ruckelshaus (who goes head to head with Schlafly in a later episode) opposed the infiltration of the Republicans by hyper-conservative and fundamental Christian fringe groups, attempting to stop her party veering off to the far-right.",-2,https://www.standard.co.uk/stayingin/tvfilm/mrs-america-characters-real-life-phyllis-schlafly-shirley-chisholm-gloria-steinem-a4491006.html

25,Steinem,Gloria,crfashionbook,"While the upcoming presidential race has everyone’s attention, Irresistible asks viewers to take a look at another election. Making its release on VOD platforms today, the Jon Stewart-written and directed satire follows Democratic strategist Gary Zimmer (Steve Carell) to Deerlaken, Wisconsin where he hopes to bolster a retired Marine colonel (Chris Cooper) to win its mayoral election and turn the right-wing town blue. The political battleground is set when the Republican National Committee sends in Rose Byrne’s Faith Brewster, a bleached and polished pundit, to foil his plans. What ensues is a comedically punctuated rivalry that pushes a local election into the national conversation as Faith and Gary’s antics take over Deerlaken. Faith’s unscrupulous campaigning panders to the locals with branded beer koozies and billboards, while Gary attempts to stay one step ahead with his team of analysts and polling maps. As the political machine devours the town, it becomes clear that the conflict isn’t so much between red and blue rather than the D.C. elites and the folks that will still be there after they move onto the next election to be won.

After playing Gloria Steinem in Hulu's Mrs. America, this marks Byrne's second political role this year. Just as she transformed into the feminist icon, she seamlessly channels the blondes–namely Kellyanne Conway and Kayleigh McEnany–that conservatives love to put on camera. The actress takes on her character with zeal, as Faith revels in the competition and corruption. While Gary's fish-out-of-water schtick attempts to ingratiate him to the locals, Faith remains a shiny instrument for political agenda. Byrne's performance matches Carrell's exasperation with dry precision. ""Crushing the last piece of hope in your eyes really gets me off,"" Faith tells Gary. The personalities at play border on caricatures, but their motivations are driven by the very real system that turns politics into an economy.

Here, CR speaks with Byrne about working with Stewart, what it was like playing roles on both sides of the aisle this year, and getting a crash course in American politics.

The relationship between your character and Steve Carrell's is very comedic and exaggerated. How did you tap into that? Did Jon encourage you to make it over-the-top?

“The characters are so exaggerated. It's almost impossible to parody them because it's [the type] done so well on SNL. The idea of doing it with Jon Stewart was just so interesting to me. Nobody is safe in the film. Everybody is made fun of in this movie, whether it be the democratic consultants and strategists, the townspeople, or the republican pundits and consultants like Faith. It's really an examination of the systems in place to get people elected and how money corrupts everything, and how it has to be overhauled in order to have a pure voting system. Jon has just been a singular voice and has been for so long. He has such a sophisticated understanding of political science. He's so effortless with it, because he's so funny, so there's an access to it that people can get, which you can't always.”

Were there any political figures you looked at to inform your character?

“There's so many great political documentaries, but I started with the famous [D.A.] Pennebaker documentary, The War Room, about the Clinton campaign in the '90s. There's a great relationship examined between James Carville, who's campaign manager, and Mary Matalin, who’s a republican strategist. They have this relationship and dynamic, and a kind of sexiness between them, so that was a good, fun starting point. Then, trying to look at all these characters–whether they're republican pundits or whether it's Kellyanne Conway–and the inspiration behind them. It was a fun thing to research and examine from both sides, the democratic, too.”



Faith is unapologetically part of the political machine, whereas Gary is made out to be the protagonist. How did Jon help you and Steve create that dynamic?

“Jon is so clear about that. He's making fun of all sides, whether it's Steve Carell's character striving for the truth–yet he's just as much part of the system, the corruption, the monetary cycles that feed the voting system and campaigning, and I think that's what's really refreshing about the piece. It's about the problem as a whole, not making people pick sides. Which is great coming from someone like Jon Stewart. Only he can achieve that, because he's got such a sophisticated understanding of it. But Faith is a political animal, she thrives on it, it's a blood sport. She totally gets off on it, that's her drug, she's built for that kind of boxing match.”

The movie shows what it's like when D.C. politics descends on small town America. What was it like being a part of a film crew that was essentially doing the same to the town you were filming in?

“We'd be on set and say, ‘this is just like the movie.’ It's East Coast, West Coast elitists coming into a small rural town in Georgia, it's very much Trump country, and here are all these Hollywood people taking it over. What does that look like and feel like? It did very much reflect that, but it was a great experience. It was this very small town just outside of Roan Georgia, and it had been greatly affected by the economy. There were a lot of boarded up shops, people out of work, economic downturn. It was very reflective of the actual experience we were having.”

You also played Gloria Steinem in Mrs. America this year. Given the political and personality differences between her and Faith, what was it like taking on two very distinct characters?

“Mrs. America hadn't come up yet when shooting Irresistible, but they're quite good companion pieces–and also to reverse engineer. Mrs. America is a historical piece that reverse engineers how we got to today in our political system and how divided it is, and how politics is so divisive. Back then, it was a lot more collaborative, there was more bipartisanship. Now, it’s interesting for me to look back on how they really are companion pieces in this political arena. Hollywood, like anywhere else, has this sort of collective consciousness in projects. I've started to see more of these political pieces come up that are being made or developed, so it was really interesting going straight from Irresistible to Mrs. America.”

Since you're originally from Australia, what was it like for you to take on these roles in American politics and learn about how the system operates?

“I thought I did know a bit about American politics. Like yeah, I understand second wave feminism and stuff–but I don't. I was always asking questions, constantly trying to educate myself and read, constantly talking to Jon and trying to really understand and fine-tune all the details. It's science, political strategy. It was very much a crash course, particularly with Mrs. America, because that's a real examination of how it works. But even trying to understand the electoral college, which I hadn't been taught my whole life, and I'm still educating myself on things like that.”",-2,https://www.crfashionbook.com/culture/a32961027/rose-byrne-irresistible-movie-jon-stewart/
26,Steinem,Gloria,lesinrocks,"L’activiste et journaliste féministe Gloria Steinem, incarnée par Rose Byrne dans Mrs America, a trouvé regrettable l’angle choisi par la série qui dénature, pour elle, le réel débat.

Mrs. America de Dahvi Waller est la série qui nous a accompagné·es pendant le confinement. Elle retrace un moment crucial des années 1970 : la ratification de l’Equal Rights Amendment, pour inscrire l’égalité des droits entre les sexes dans la Constitution des États-Unis. Dès lors, plusieurs groupes s’affrontent : les femmes aux foyers conservatrices dirigées par Phyllis Schlafly, incarnée par Cate Blanchett, et les féministes radicales notamment représentées par la célèbre activiste Gloria Steinem, jouée par Rose Byrne.

Inspirée de la réalité, la série à gros budget développe nombre d’intrigues parallèles et autres personnages importants, dans une mise en scène virtuose. Elle met également en vedette par exemple Uzo Aduba dans le rôle de Shirley Chisholm, la première femme noire élue au Congrès, et Tracey Ullman dans le rôle de Betty Friedan, l’auteur de La Femme mystifiée.

Une série « dégradante »

Pourtant si l’on en croit The Guardian, la série n’a pas fait l’unanimité. Pour l’activiste et autrice féministe Gloria Steinem, la série est « ridicule, dégradante et tout simplement pas très bonne » a-t-elle affirmé lors de l’édition virtuelle du Hay festival. Pour Steinem, la série se trompe d’adversaire : « Elle vous donne l’impression que [Phyllis Schlafly] est la cause du rejet de la ratification de l’amendement. En réalité, je ne pense pas qu’elle ait changé le vote. Personne ne peut affirmer qu’elle a eu un quelconque impact sur les votes. C’est le secteur de l’assurance qui s’est fortement opposé à l’amendement sur l’égalité des droits car ça lui aurait coûté des millions et des millions de dollars de ne plus séparer ses tables de mortalité« .

>> À lire aussi : On a rencontré Gloria Steinem, l’icône féministe américaine

« La série donne l’impression que les femmes sont nos pires ennemis »

En effet pour elle, l’importance donnée à ce personnage dénature la réalité des enjeux de l’époque : « Schlafly était quelqu’un ‘amené à la dernière minute’ pour faire croire que les femmes s’opposaient à l’égalité des droits alors que la vérité était ‘la grande majorité’ la soutenait toujours« , a déclaré Steinem. « La série donne l’impression que les femmes sont nos pires ennemis, ce qui nous empêche de reconnaître qui sont nos pires ennemis. Non pas que nous ne soyons pas en conflit, oui nous sommes en conflit, mais dans l’ensemble, nous ne sommes pas nos pires ennemis. »

Gloria Steinem ne remet pas en cause la mise en scène ou le casting de la série mais l’angle d’attaque choisi qui lui paraît malheureux. Elle a tout de même tenu à rappeler ensuite l’importance pour les féministes de tous âges de travailler ensemble : « La ségrégation par âge est aussi ridicule et destructrice que la ségrégation par race ou classe ou par sexe ou toute autre chose. Nous apprenons les uns·es des autres. Nous avons besoin les uns·es des autres. »",-2,https://www.lesinrocks.com/2020/05/29/series/series/que-pense-gloria-steinem-de-la-serie-mrs-america/

Fiction by Mark Strand

I think of the innocent lives

Of people in novels who know they'll die

But not that the novel will end. How different they are

From us. Here, the moon stares dumbly down,

Through scattered clouds, onto the sleeping town,

And the wind rounds up the fallen leaves,

And somebody—namely me—deep in his chair,

Riffles the pages left, knowing there's not

Much time for the man and woman in the rented room,

For the red light over the door, for the iris

Tossing its shadow against the wall; not much time

For the soldiers under the trees that line

The river, for the wounded being hauled away

To the cities of the interior where they will stay;

The war that raged for years will come to a close,

And so will everything else, except for a presence

Hard to define, a trace, like the scent of grass

After a night of rain or the remains of a voice

That lets us know without spelling it out

Not to despair; if the end is come, it too will pass.

It's the birthday of Gloria Steinem, (books by this author) born in Toledo, Ohio (1934). Her father was an antique dealer and a summer resort operator who traveled all over the country in a trailer, looking for new business ventures. Steinem said, ""He was always going to make a movie, or cut a record, or start a new hotel, or come up with a new orange drink."" She traveled around the country, never attending school, until her parents separated, and she moved in with her mother. But her mother's mental health began to break down, and Steinem had to take over all the cooking and cleaning and shopping. She said that her mother was ""an invalid who lay in bed with eyes closed and lips moving in occasional response to voices only she could hear; a woman to whom I brought an endless stream of toast and coffee, bologna sandwiches and dime pies."" Young Gloria became obsessed with Shirley Temple movies, hoping to be rescued miraculously from poverty, just like the little girl on the screen. She managed to get into Smith College because she scored so well on her entrance examinations. After college, she went to work as a journalist. She wrote celebrity journalism for a while, but she became more interested in feminism after she wrote an article about the prevalence of illegal abortions, and all her male colleagues tried to persuade her not to publish it. She was a founder of Ms. magazine, whose first issue came out in January 1972. Gloria Steinem said, ""Writing is the only thing that, when I do it, I don't feel I should be doing something else.""

It's the birthday of Flannery O'Connor, (books by this author) born in Savannah, Georgia (1925). She wrote two novels and many short stories, including ""A Good Man Is Hard to Find."" She is the subject of Brad Gooch's Flannery (2009), a new biography. In it we learn about her regular correspondence with a young credit bureau clerk named Betty Hester, a semi-reclusive woman. Flannery wrote Betty 274 letters, and in one of them she wrote to her: ""I am afraid that if I tell you your writing to me is a kindness, you will lay this to some more of my guile or feel obliged to write me when you don't feel like it. Don't do that, but do be assured that these letters from you are something in my life."" She wrote to Betty about her stories as she was writing them. In one letter, she wrote, ""I have a sentence in mind to end some story that I am going to write. The character all through it will have been hungry and at the end, he is so hungry that 'he could have eaten all the loaves and fishes, after they were multiplied.'"" And in fact, that sentence was in the closing pages of her novel The Violent Bear It Away (1960). Five years before she died of lupus at the age of 39, she sent a letter to her friends Sally and Robert Fitzgerald, along with a manuscript of The Violent Bear It Away. In the letter, she wrote about her novel: ""I am 100% pure sick of it. I cannot see it any longer and the only thing I can determine about it is that nobody else would have wanted to write it but me.""

29,Steinem,Gloria,meaww,"Spoilers for 'Mrs America' Episodes 1,2 and 3

If there's one thing 'Mrs America' has got right, it is the beyond perfect casting. With Cate Blanchett playing controversial women's rights and liberation movement opposer Phyllis Schlafly, and Margo Martindale as driven and seasoned Bella Abzug, the list of all the things the FX on Hulu miniseries gets right goes on and on. But even with Uzo Aduba as Representative Shirley Chisholm, Elizabeth Banks as women's rights activist Jill Ruckelshaus, and Tracey Ullman as Betty Friedan, the one portrayal that seems to have gelled with fans the most, is Rose Byrne having imbibed Gloria Steinem's mannerism to the T.

Rocking that bohemian look with long tresses flowing down to her lower back and the signature oversized glasses, Byrne is fierce and fearless as the American feminist movement spokeswoman who soared to great accolades in the 60s and 70s. We meet Byrne's Steinem as she struts and sashays through the press before heading into the launch party of a recent issue of Ms Magazine.

She walks the walk, and talks the talk like a dauntless activist and staunch feminist - offering her insights on abortion rights, why she chose a teary-eyed version of the Hindu goddess Kali for her album cover, and of course, dissing the Playboy magazine.

Byrne's Steinem is not only similar in their appearances, but she also insists on how she doesn't want people to listen to her just because she's a pretty face. She maintains that she is more than that and wants people to fully acknowledge it - even though most of them are drawn by her gorgeousness and celebrity status. Of course, the series is yet to document Byrne's Steinem climbing the ladder towards being considered a serious face of activism, but from whatever they have seen so far, fans are certain it couldn't have gotten any better.

Taking it to Twitter, viewers poured in with tweets applauding the casting of Byrne as Steinem, as one of them wrote, ""The casting is beyond on point, whoever did it is a genius."" And while due credit should go to the casting calls, others gushed about Byrne's appearance as Steinem writing, ""Rose Byrne as Gloria Steinem. How perfect is this?"" A third fan commented, ""Seriously Rose Byrne is brilliant as Gloria Steinem.""

Another agreed saying, ""Rose Byrne as Gloria Steinem is one of my favorite things in Mrs America!"" Cue the applause!

'Mrs America' premiered on Wednesday, April 15, with the first three episodes on Hulu.

30,Steinem,Gloria,penguin,"If Mothering Sunday feels like pouring a mountain of salt on a complex and unresolved wound, you are not alone. In fact, I don’t believe anyone has an entirely straightforward relationship with their mother - that’s why they’ve been subject to scrutiny from everyone from the ancient Greeks to Phillip Larkin, in his famously concise summary. Mothers may have inspired mythological symbolism, but they can also be painfully real forces that fundamentally shape us. It’s not surprising that Mother’s Day can prove a bit of a challenge.

For some, Mother’s Day means the unmistakable agony of missing one. If that’s you, look for words that are warm and kind. Those of Kim Addonizio, in her poem ‘To The Woman Crying Uncontrollably In The Next Stall’, recently caught the attention of Twitter after journalist Agnes Frimston posted them on the social network, revealing she read them through the door of a loo cubicle to a woman who was mourning the loss of her mother. Addonizio’s words have long provided solace:

‘If you have ... moved against / a pillow in the dark stood miserably on a beach / seaweed clinging to your ankles paid / good money for a bad haircut ... Listen I love you joy is coming.'

Writers rarely have a precise ETA for joy, but they have long attested that, with time, painful memories lose their bite. As Joan Didion wrote in Slouching Towards Bethlehem, in 1968: ‘We forget all too soon the things we thought we could never forget’.",-2,https://www.penguin.co.uk/articles/2020/mar/books-about-mothers-relationship-mothers-day
31,Steinem,Gloria,time,"In the half-century since I wrote the essay below, as part of a cover story on “The Politics of Sex,” there has been some definite progress. “Women’s issues” are no longer in a silo but are understood as fundamental to everything. For instance, the single biggest determinant of whether a country is violent, or will use military violence against another country, is not poverty, natural resources, religion or even degree of democracy; it is violence against women. And since racial separation can’t be perpetuated in the long run without controlling reproduction—and thus women’s bodies—racism and sexism are intertwined and can only be uprooted together.

A belief in equality, without division by sex or race, is now held by a huge majority in public–opinion polls. But a stubborn minority of Americans feel deprived of the unearned privilege of that old hierarchy and are in revolt. The time of greatest danger comes after a victory, and that’s where we are now. Many of the predictions of my 50-year-old essay about the future hold up, but there are a few lessons I’ve learned since then (including to negotiate a writing fee beforehand, since my agent later told me I was paid less than male contributors).

What It Would Be Like If Women Win

By Gloria Steinem

Originally published: Aug. 31, 1970

Seldom do utopias pass from dream to reality, but it is often an illuminating exercise to predict what could happen if they did. The following very personal and partisan speculations on how the world might be different if Women’s Lib had its way were written for TIME by Gloria Steinem, a contributing editor of New York magazine, whose journalistic curiosity ranges from show business to Democratic politics. Miss Steinem admits to being not only a critical observer but a concerned advocate of the feminist revolt.

Any change is fearful, especially one affecting both politics and sex roles, so let me begin these utopian speculations with a fact. To break the ice.

Women don’t want to exchange places with men. Male chauvinists, science-fiction writers and comedians may favor that idea for its shock value, but psychologists say it is a fantasy based on ruling-class ego and guilt. Men assume that women want to imitate them, which is just what white people assumed about blacks. An assumption so strong that it may convince the second-class group of the need to imitate, but for both women and blacks that stage has passed. Guilt produces the question: What if they could treat us as we have treated them?

That is not our goal. But we do want to change the economic system to one more based on merit. In Women’s Lib Utopia, there will be free access to good jobs — and decent pay for the bad ones women have been performing all along, including housework. *Increased skilled labor might lead to a four-hour workday, and higher wages would encourage further mechanization of repetitive jobs now kept alive by cheap labor.

*Gloria Steinem in 2020: As people look at screens more than at one another, the opposite has happened; the workday never ends

*With women as half the country’s elected representatives, and a woman President once in a while, the country’s machismo problems would be greatly reduced. The old-fashioned idea that manhood depends on violence and victory is, after all, an important part of our troubles in the streets, and in Viet Nam. I’m not saying that women leaders would eliminate violence. We are not more moral than men; we are only uncorrupted by power so far. When we do acquire power, we might turn out to have an equal impulse toward aggression. Even now, Margaret Mead believes that women fight less often but more fiercely than men, because women are not taught the rules of the war game and fight only when cornered. But for the next 50 years or so, women in politics will be very valuable by tempering the idea of manhood into something less aggressive and better suited to this crowded, post-atomic planet. Consumer protection and children’s rights, for instance, might get more legislative attention.

*Gloria Steinem in 2020: With Trump as a backlash to Obama, almost any woman President would be a relief

Men will have to give up ruling-class privileges, but in return they will no longer be the only ones to support the family, get drafted, bear the strain of power and responsibility. Freud to the contrary, anatomy is not destiny, at least not for more than nine months at a time. In Israel, women are drafted, and some have gone to war. In England, more men type and run switchboards. In India and Israel, a woman rules. In Sweden, both parents take care of the children. In this country, come Utopia, men and women won’t reverse roles; they will be free to choose according to individual talents and preferences.

If role reform sounds sexually unsettling, think how it will change the sexual hypocrisy we have now. No more sex arranged on the barter system, with women pretending interest, and men never sure whether they are loved for themselves or for the security few women can get any other way. (Married or not, for sexual reasons or social ones, most women still find it second nature to Uncle-Tom.) No more men who are encouraged to spend a lifetime living with inferiors; with housekeepers, or dependent creatures who are still children. No more domineering wives, emasculating women, and “Jewish mothers,” all of whom are simply human beings with all their normal ambition and drive confined to the home. No more unequal partnerships that eventually doom love and sex.

In order to produce that kind of confidence and individuality, child rearing will train according to talent. Little girls will no longer be surrounded by air-tight, self-fulfilling prophecies of natural passivity, lack of ambition and objectivity, inability to exercise power, and dexterity (so long as special aptitude for jobs requiring patience and dexterity is confined to poorly paid jobs; brain surgery is for males).

Schools and universities will help to break down traditional sex roles, even when parents will not. *Half the teachers will be men, a rarity now at preschool and elementary levels; girls will not necessarily serve cookies or boys hoist up the flag. Athletic teams will be picked only by strength and skill. Sexually segregated courses like auto mechanics and home economics will be taken by boys and girls together. New courses in sexual politics will explore female subjugation as the model for political oppression, and women’s history will be an academic staple, along with black history, at least until the white-male-oriented textbooks are integrated and rewritten.

*Gloria Steinem in 2020: Not until we start paying public-school teachers as much as every other democracy does

As for the American child’s classic problem—too much mother, too little father—that would be cured by an equalization of parental responsibility. Free nurseries, school lunches, family cafeterias built into every housing complex, service companies that will do household cleaning chores in a regular, businesslike way, and more responsibility by the entire community for the children: all these will make it possible for both mother and father to work, and to have equal leisure time with the children at home. For parents of very young children, however, a special job category, created by Government and unions, would allow such parents a shorter work day.

The revolution would not take away the option of being a housewife. A woman who prefers to be her husband’s housekeeper and/or hostess would receive a percentage of his pay determined by the domestic relations courts. If divorced, she might be eligible for a pension fund, and for a job-training allowance. *Or a divorce could be treated the same way that the dissolution of a business partnership is now.

*Gloria Steinem in 2020: Once domestic labor is accorded the same value as salaried work

If these proposals seem farfetched, consider Sweden, where most of them are already in effect. Sweden is not yet a working Women’s Lib model; most of the role-reform programs began less than a decade ago, and are just beginning to take hold. But that country is so far ahead of us in recognizing the problem that Swedish statements on sex and equality sound like bulletins from the moon.

Our marriage laws, for instance, are so reactionary that Women’s Lib groups want couples to take a compulsory written exam on the law, as for a driver’s license, before going through with the wedding. A man has alimony and wifely debts to worry about, but a woman may lose so many of her civil rights that in the U.S. now, in important legal ways, she becomes a child again. In some states, she cannot sign credit agreements, use her maiden name, incorporate a business, or establish a legal residence of her own. Being a wife, according to most social and legal definitions, is still a 19th century thing.

Assuming, however, that these blatantly sexist laws are abolished or reformed, that job discrimination is forbidden, that parents share financial responsibility for each other and the children, and that sexual relationships become partnerships of equal adults (some pretty big assumptions), then marriage will probably go right on. Men and women are, after all, physically complementary. When society stops encouraging men to be exploiters and women to be parasites, they may turn out to be more complementary in emotion as well. Women’s Lib is not trying to destroy the American family. A look at the statistics on divorce—plus the way in which old people are farmed out with strangers and young people flee the home—shows the destruction that has already been done. Liberated women are just trying to point out the disaster, and build compassionate and practical alternatives from the ruins.

What will exist is a variety of alternative life-styles. Since the population explosion dictates that childbearing be kept to a minimum, parents-and-children will be only one of many “families”: couples, age groups, working groups, mixed communes, blood-related clans, class groups, creative groups. Single women will have the right to stay single without ridicule, without the attitudes now betrayed by “spinster” and “bachelor.” Lesbians or homosexuals will no longer be denied legally binding marriages, complete with mutual-support agreements and inheritance rights. Paradoxically, the number of homosexuals may get smaller. With fewer overpossessive mothers and fewer fathers who hold up an impossibly cruel or perfectionist idea of manhood, boys will be less likely to be denied or reject their identity as males.

*Gloria Steinem in 2020: I would cut this line, since it’s now more clear that we are born whoever we are.

Changes that now seem small may get bigger:

MEN’S LIB. Men now suffer from more diseases due to stress, heart attacks, ulcers, a higher suicide rate, greater difficulty living alone, less adaptability to change and, in general, a shorter life span than women. There is some scientific evidence that what produces physical problems is not work itself, but the inability to choose which work, and how much. With women bearing half the financial responsibility, and with the idea of “masculine” jobs gone, men might well feel freer and live longer.

RELIGION. Protestant women are already becoming ordained ministers; radical nuns are carrying out liturgical functions that were once the exclusive property of priests; Jewish women are rewriting prayers—particularly those that Orthodox Jews recite every morning thanking God they are not female. In the future, the church will become an area of equal participation by women. This means, of course, that organized religion will have to give up one of its great historical weapons: sexual repression. In most structured faiths, from Hinduism through Roman Catholicism, the status of women went down as the position of priests ascended. Male clergy implied, if they did not teach, that women were unclean, unworthy and sources of ungodly temptation, in order to remove them as rivals for the emotional forces of men. Full participation of women in ecclesiastical life might involve certain changes in theology, such as, for instance, a radical redefinition of sin.

LITERARY PROBLEMS. Revised sex roles will outdate more children’s books than civil rights ever did. Only a few children had the problem of a Little Black Sambo, but most have the male-female stereotypes of “Dick and Jane.” A boomlet of children’s books about mothers who work has already begun, and liberated parents and editors are beginning to pressure for change in the textbook industry. Fiction writing will change more gradually, but romantic novels with wilting heroines and swashbuckling heroes will be reduced to historical value. Or perhaps to the sadomasochist trade. (Marjorie Morningstar, a romantic novel that took the ’50s by storm, has already begun to seem as unreal as its ’20s predecessor, The Sheik.) As for the literary plots that turn on forced marriages or horrific abortions, they will seem as dated as Prohibition stories. Free legal abortions and free birth control will force writers to give up pregnancy as the deus ex machina.

MANNERS AND FASHION. Dress will be more androgynous, with class symbols becoming more important than sexual ones. Pro-or anti-Establishment styles may already be more vital than who is wearing them. Hardhats are just as likely to rough up antiwar girls as antiwar men in the street, and police understand that women are just as likely to be pushers or bombers. Dances haven’t required that one partner lead the other for years, anyway. Chivalry will transfer itself to those who need it, or deserve respect: old people, admired people, anyone with an armload of packages. Women with normal work identities will be less likely to attach their whole sense of self to youth and appearance; thus there will be fewer nervous breakdowns when the first wrinkles appear. Lighting cigarettes and other treasured niceties will become gestures of mutual affection. “I like to be helped on with my coat,” says one Women’s Lib worker, “but not if it costs me $2,000 a year in salary.”

For those with nostalgia for a simpler past, here is a word of comfort. Anthropologist Geoffrey Gorer studied the few peaceful human tribes and discovered one common characteristic: sex roles were not polarized. Differences of dress and occupation were at a minimum. Society, in other words, was not using sexual blackmail as a way of getting women to do cheap labor, or men to be aggressive.

*Thus Women’s Lib may achieve a more peaceful society on the way toward its other goals. That is why the Swedish government considers reform to bring about greater equality in the sex roles one of its most important concerns. As Prime Minister Olof Palme explained in a widely ignored speech delivered in Washington this spring: “It is human beings we shall emancipate. In Sweden today, if a politician should declare that the woman ought to have a different role from man’s, he would be regarded as something from the Stone Age.” In other words, the most radical goal of the movement is egalitarianism.

If Women’s Lib wins, perhaps we all do.

32,Steinem,Gloria,crfashionbook,"Whether you love them, hate them, or dressed up as one for Halloween, there's no escaping the Playboy bunny. The bunny ears, bow ties, and bust-accentuating corsets of Hugh Hefner's legacy symbolize many things, and over the past 70 years they have constructed an iconic empire that changed media and culture forever. The first Playboy magazine was published in 1953, and by 1960 the first Playboy Club opened in Chicago. Since then, over 25,000 corset-clad bunnies have waited tables and poured drinks to A-list patrons and tourists alike. While they're often condemned as a caricature of the male fantasy, the earliest Playboy bunnies were little more than waitresses tempted by flexible hours and heavy-handed tips. For many of those bunnies, haunting the halls of Playboy was little more than a side job—especially those who went on to make it big in their own right.

33,Steinem,Gloria,hollywoodreporter,"'The Glorias': Film Review | Sundance 2020

Julie Taymor directs Julianne Moore and Alicia Vikander in this sprawling bio-drama about trailblazing women's rights movement leader Gloria Steinem.

Covering 80 years in the life and work of one of the key figures of the American feminist movement, whose influence has stretched across generations, Julie Taymor's nontraditional biopic The Glorias certainly can't be faulted for lack of ambition. But sometimes breadth comes at the expense of intimacy, which factors only intermittently in this deeply admiring but frustratingly choppy encapsulation of the legacy of Gloria Steinem. Threaded throughout with stylistic extravagances that can feel intrusive, the film is most exciting when its dramatic scenes are intercut with archival footage to celebrate inspirational milestones in the history of women's rights in this country.

That archive material includes powerful images of the 2017 Women's March, both in Washington and around the world, with extensive excerpts from Steinem's characteristically optimistic speech offering hope at the dawn of a new dark age. The resurgence of energy in the debate around gender parity, reproductive rights and other issues for which Steinem has been fighting since the late '60s gives the film timeliness and urgency.

What it could have used more of is cohesion. The script by Taymor and playwright Sarah Ruhl hurtles from one incident to another in a shuffled chronology that is never difficult to follow but too infrequently gives events room to resonate. It's consistently absorbing, as is to be expected from any account of such a remarkable life of activism and passionate social engagement. But structurally, The Glorias blurs the line between freewheeling collage and mess, its directorial flourishes sometimes smacking of self-indulgence.

Based on Steinem's 2015 memoir My Life on the Road, the movie is conceived as a road trip through memory, built around an overused narrative device Taymor calls a ""Bus Out of Time."" This Greyhound coach — shot by cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto in black and white, while the world passing by outside the windows is in vibrant color — allows the fragmented Steinem to interact with herself at different ages, expressing uncertainty and regret as much as wisdom and self-assurance.

She is played as a child by Ryan Kiera Armstrong, as a young teenager by Lulu Wilson, in her twenties and thirties by Alicia Vikander and from her forties to the present by Julianne Moore. All four have lovely moments, and while Taymor's film overall lacks fluidity, their performances do fit with surprising neatness into a single, steadily evolving characterization.

The road motif is established early on when Gloria's adored happy-go-lucky salesman father Leo (Timothy Hutton) tells her, ""Travel is the best education."" But the example of her mother Ruth (Enid Graham), a former journalist who had been forced to write under a male pseudonym, and a chronic sufferer of depression and anxiety, informs young Gloria's earliest impressions of the odds stacked against women.

She sees more extreme cases of that injustice during a two-year fellowship in India, where she travels from village to village and sits in on listening circles, in which lower caste women recount episodes of violence and abuse they have endured. The excellent Vikander does key grounding work in these scenes in establishing the sensitivity and intelligence with which Steinem absorbed the problems keeping women of all cultures down, making intersectionality an important aspect of her development as a feminist organizer.

Back in New York, getting her feet wet in the still male-dominated field of journalism, Gloria encounters blatant sexism at every turn from editors who hit on her or try to limit her to fluffy fashion pieces and male colleagues who treat her like a secretary. She makes a name for herself with her famous 1963 article for Show magazine, ""A Bunny's Tale,"" in which she went undercover to expose appalling working conditions for waitresses at the Playboy Club. But even after honing her skills writing profiles for New York Magazine, her requests to cover the nascent women's movement meet resistance. That leads her to co-found the liberal feminist magazine Ms. in 1972.

Other women who help shape and expand Steinem's social activism and drive the movement forward figure as characters drifting in and out of the story. The most vivid of them are Congresswoman Bella Abzug, played with amusing firecracker chutzpah by Bette Midler, and activist lawyer Flo Kennedy, who has the saltiness of a brilliant stand-up comic in Lorraine Toussaint's flavorful performance — not to mention the wardrobe of a cool hippie cowboy, courtesy of costumer Sandy Powell. Indelible impressions also are made by Janelle Monáe as Dorothy Pitman Hughes, who helps Steinem conquer her fear of public speaking, and Kimberly Guerrero as Wilma Mankiller, the first woman elected as Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation.

The focus on Gloria's loving friendships and sharing of knowledge with these women makes the film as much about Steinem's humanity as her politics. Easily the most emotionally affecting scene is her loving farewell with Mankiller as the latter is dying of pancreatic cancer in 2010, beautifully played by Moore and Guerrero.

The movie's centerpiece is the 1977 National Women's Conference, with editor Sabine Hoffman deftly intercutting footage from the actual event with Moore's Steinem watching from backstage and Midler's Abzug giving her historic address. There's poignancy in the euphoric crowd's rallying behind the Equal Rights Amendment, only to see it subsequently defeated after Phyllis Schlafly mobilized conservatives in opposition.

Taymor restages panel discussions and TV interviews in which Steinem was hounded by those who either claimed she was getting attention solely because of her looks or fixated on her apparent disinterest in marriage.

The patronizing treatment still shocks, without need for embellishment. However, the director can't resist a fussy curlicue — in this case having all four Glorias become powerful witches while the sexist interviewer is sucked out of the studio by a giant red Wizard of Oz-style tornado. Other such moments include an animated spin on the first Ms. cover, depicting an eight-armed Indian goddess brandishing the tools of the housewife and an Escher-like maze of highway treadmills, with the Glorias ceaselessly trudging onward.

These show-offy sequences act as distractions rather than adding to our understanding of Steinem. So it's a testament to the complexity of the subject and her positivity even in the face of the most culturally entrenched caveman attitudes that we come away from this flawed, chaotic film with a warm appreciation for her achievements and her indestructible generosity of spirit.

37,Steinem,Gloria,bostonglobe,"As the United States weighs its response to Iran for attacks on oil facilities in Saudi Arabia and more, President Trump has said that he wants to “ avoid” war , yet he has failed even to mention the dissidents, journalists, and human rights defenders imprisoned for speaking truth to power, and neither he nor Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has demanded that these prisoners of conscience be released as a condition of any negotiations with Iran.

Women leaders in Iran courageously resisted the tyranny that followed their country’s revolution in 1979. In the 40 years since, Iran’s theocrats have been vindictive toward women who dare to challenge their authority. Female artists, novelists, journalists, academics, and political activists — including Shirin Ebadi , a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, and Mehrangiz Kar , recipient of the National Endowment for Democracy’s Democracy Award — have been forced into exile. They were the lucky ones. Those still in Iran have been imprisoned, tortured, and even executed.

In the four decades prior to Trump’s presidency, human rights was a pillar of US foreign policy. While not always consistent in addressing human rights, the issue was always on the table with friend and foe alike. That diplomatic table has now been overturned, and foreign policy is conducted via threats and flattery on Twitter. Dictators carry out their thuggery with no reason to believe they will be penalized or shamed by the world’s leading democracy.

So it falls to us, citizens who believe in rights, equality, and justice, to stand up for those who are silenced, and isolated behind barbed wire and prison walls. Our power lies in naming both those being tortured and their torturers.

Today, we are shining a light on the women human rights defenders who are imprisoned in Iran, a regime that is operating a modern-day gulag. The Islamic Republic of Iran not only rebuffs any criticism, it also uses it as ammunition against the accused, twisting it into proof that they are foreign spies. This cruel tactic has discouraged foreign diplomats from raising concerns, yet networks of freedom fighters who are in touch with those prisoners tell us that we must not be intimidated.

We have seen the power of focusing a bright light on human rights atrocities. We know the impact of sending the message to courageous human rights defenders that we care and we remember them. We are sending a message to the women human rights defenders in Iran that their fight for liberty and equality is neither invisible nor in vain.

We stand with:

Nasrin Sotoudeh, Nargess Mohammadi, Sepideh Gholyan, Atena Daemi, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, Fariba Adelkhah, Aras Amiri, and the hundreds of others who have been falsely accused and imprisoned.

We stand with their lawyers, who are themselves often charged and arrested for defending the accused.

And we call on President Trump to stand with Iran’s women activists or go down in history as a collaborator. President Trump must demand the release of these women and other prisoners of conscience before agreeing to any negotiations with the Islamic Republic of Iran.

One of the tragic consequences of the current rise of populism in the United States and globally has been the loss of moral authority. We can regain that authority by defeating indifference and by advancing the very values that the world community embraced after the scourge resulting from the rise of populism in the last century.

The courage to stand with human rights defenders is what makes us a great nation.

It is also the best assurance we have that others will stand up for us.

The car was my father’s travelling kingdom.

39,Steinem,Gloria,theguardian,"It's hard to travel or send words out of the US now. How can any American expect to be welcomed in the rest of the world when we have imposed the narcissistic and disastrous George Bush on it? I could explain that almost none of his policies has majority support here. Even among those who voted for him, a poll showed that 60% to 80% thought they were voting for the opposite of his actual positions: they supported the comprehensive test ban treaty (he didn't); they supported the Kyoto treaty on global warming (he didn't); they supported the international criminal court (he threatened to sanction any nation that did); and so on. This tells you a lot about the level of information in mass media that prefer celebrities, yelling matches and advertising to investigating what is and isn't accurate.

But never fear, Americans are being punished. Having re-elected Bush as a wartime president, we have to watch him alienating more allies and inspiring more people to join the war against us every day.

Still, I have hope. I have hope because majority opinion has turned against the invasion of Iraq in far less time that it took to wake up to Vietnam. I have hope because Bush's selling-off of the US government, one function at a time, has stumbled on the privatisation of social security. I have hope because Americans are finally connecting, via the internet, with what the rest of the world thinks. I have hope because the only long-term solution to rightwing extremism was visible in the last election; I've seen people willing to vote before, but for the first time I saw people fighting to vote. Only an end to our status as one of the lowest-voting democracies in the world can keep a focused and financed minority from cutting through the majority like a hot knife through butter.

Hard times have made me realise that hope might be the most American of qualities, the reason why many immigrants come here and our best export by far. When I've lived in other countries, it's what I've been most homesick for. After all, unless we make a place in our imaginations for what could be, there's not much point in believing in anything. You might say I'm a hopeaholic.

I owe this not only to being born here, but to working as a feminist organiser. Terminal hopefulness is an occupational hazard. None the less, I've come to feel that hope is natural, a necessity of human evolution - and hopelessness has to be carefully taught by those who benefit from the status quo. Here's why.

I had the good luck of missing school until I was 12 or so. My parents thought that seeing the country from a trailer or caravan was as educational as a classroom, so I escaped the discouragement that, especially in my generation, came with it. I wasn't taught that boys and girls were practically different species, that America was ""discovered"" when the first white guy set foot on it, or that Europe deserved more space in my textbooks than Asia and Africa combined. I didn't even learn that people at the top were smarter than people at the bottom.

Instead I grew up seeing with my own eyes, following my curiosity, falling in love with books and learning mostly from being around grown-ups - which, except for the books, was the way kids had been raised for most of human history. With no one to tell me that some people were born to poverty or that women weren't leaders, but married or gave birth to them, I just assumed that hope could lead anyone anywhere.

Needless to say, school hit me like a ton of bricks. I wasn't prepared for gender obsession, race and class complexities or the new-to-me idea that war, male leadership and a God who mysteriously resembled the ruling class were inevitable. Soon I gave in and became an adolescent trying to fit in, pretending I didn't know what I knew, and keeping my hopes to myself - a stage that lasted through college. I owe the beginnings of rebirth to living in India for a couple of years and falling in with a group of Gandhians, then coming home to the Kennedys, the civil rights movement and protests against the war in Vietnam.

But most women, me included, stayed in our traditional places until we began to gather, listen to each other's stories and learn that the subordinate roles we played, even in otherwise admirable movements, weren't just or inevitable. Soon a national and international feminist movement was challenging the notion that what happened to men was political, but what happened to women was cultural; that the first could be changed, but the second could not. I had the feeling of coming home, of waking from an inauthentic life. I didn't think this refound self-authority was more important than external authority, but it wasn't less important either.

Since then, I've spent decades listening to kids before and after social roles hit. Faced with some inequality, the younger ones say ""It's not fair!"" - as if some primordial expectation of empathy and cooperation helps the species survive. By the time they are teenagers, social pressures have nourished or starved this hope. I suspect that a natural need for fairness, or any whisper of it that survives, is the root from which social justice movements grow.

So hope is contagious. With that in mind, I offer you a few of my hopes from early and late in life.

I hope we learn that whatever is done to children, they are likely to do to soc-iety. If we can raise even one generation without violence, we have no idea what might be possible on Spaceship Earth.

I hope that spirituality overwhelms religion. I say this because spirituality links, religion ranks; spirituality sees God in all living things, religion rations out God to some more than others; spirituality celebrates life, religion celebrates life after death.

I hope we choose self-authority over hierarchy. We will have to, because the purpose of the latter is to undermine the former.

I hope we learn that the end doesn't justify the means; on the contrary, the means create the ends.

I hope that racism is finally seen as a fiction invented to justify the taking over of land and power. This remains true whether its objects are Africans or Arabs, Jews or the Kwei/San people.

I hope the female half of the world takes back control of the means of reproduction: our own bodies. After all, women are in the original secondary spot because some men wanted to control reproduction, establish paternity and ownership of children and force the bearing of more workers, more soldiers. That's how we got into this mess. Reversing it is the only way to get out.

I hope that men break out of the masculine prison that: a) justifies males dominating females; b) separates men from the full circle of their human qualities; and c) cons the many men at the bottom into endangering their lives to protect the few men at the top.

All these hopes become much more practical when you consider that either/or thinking, patriarchy, hierarchy, nationalism and monotheism, and much more that we've wrongly been sold as inevitable, have been confined to less than 5% of human history. We won't be the first to strive toward such hopes.

Will this fragile Spaceship Earth survive long enough? Only if we act on our hopes every day.

41,Steinem,Gloria,theguardian,"It is one thing for a political leader to come to power in his country by exploiting the darkest nationalistic instincts of its electorate. It is quite another thing for such a man to be awarded an international prize and embraced as a statesman by the most powerful and influential country in the world. The former reflects a familiar and vexing paradox of democracy – its deliberate subversion from within. The latter is entirely gratuitous and speaks to the collapse of any sense of international political morality.

The Gates Foundation has announced it is bestowing a prestigious annual award on prime minister Narendra Modi of India. And in advance of the UN general assembly meeting in New York, Donald Trump flew down to Houston, Texas, to welcome him at an event charmingly dubbed the “Howdy Modi” rally.

The Gates Foundation’s award to Modi for starting a sanitation scheme in India seems rather like giving a prize to Mussolini for making the trains run on time

Yet it was less than 15 years ago that Modi was denied a visa to the US, the only person in the world ever to have been banned under the International Religious Freedom Act. That’s because in 2002, when he was chief minister of Gujarat, Modi helped create the conditions for a three-day anti-Muslim riot that resulted in rape, murder and the burning of homes. It has been widely described as state terrorism and ethnic cleansing.

Now, as prime minister of India, Modi presides over a culture where acts of hate against Muslims occur daily across the nation, and also against Dalits, the lowest group in the Hindu caste system. There is a massive record of their humiliation, including repeated sexualised violence against women and young girls from those groups, and frequent lynchings of men, echoing a dark period in the history of the US. Not only are these barbarities rarely prosecuted, but those who attempt to intervene to stop them are often punished.

India has historically had a robust free press, but now Modi’s government harasses and closes down media that are critical of his regime. The same goes for unions, human rights law firms and academics.

His perverse demonetisation scheme has deprived the poor and middle class of savings, and in addition to selling off natural resources to global businesses, he is all set to privatise the railways and public transport on which average citizens depend.

Most recently, Modi has defied the constitution of India by revoking the autonomy it afforded Jammu and Kashmir. Why? Because the incessant violence of its military occupation of that region, 70% of whose citizens are Muslim, is quite naturally being resisted by them. He has imposed severe restrictions on internet communication there, thus creating a virtual prison governed by well-armed members of the Indian army.

So, has the US government officially criticised this unblushing brutalisation of the people of India? On the contrary, under Trump it has pitched the sale of arms to India in order to compete with Russia. And Modi has been paraded as a feted guest in Houston and New York.

In the light of this record of wrongdoing, the Gates Foundation’s award to Modi for starting a sanitation scheme in India seems rather like giving a prize to Mussolini for making the trains run on time.

The scheme, in any case, does little to provide sanitation for the most impoverished segments of the population who need it most, and it does nothing to undermine, let alone address, the fact that the most degrading forms of sanitation labour have for centuries been assigned to the lowest rungs in the caste hierarchy.

But such details aside, it is bizarre that a prize intended for those who uplift the poorest has gone to the seediest tormentor of the poorest and most marginalised people of India.

We write this opinion piece as citizens of these two biggest and most diverse democracies in the world, the US and India, who have spent years living and working in each other’s countries.

Governance, in the honourable traditions of liberty and democracy of both our nations, was never intended to begin with: “I, the president” or “I, the prime minister”, as is now increasingly the case. It begins, rather, with: “We, the people”.

So, we ourselves can declare our support for the International Religious Freedom Act and explicitly recoil from both Prime Minister Modi and President Trump’s anti-Muslim bias. And we can oppose their shared glorification of an unequal past by vowing to make India and the US live up to their democratic promise.",-2,https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/commentisfree/2019/sep/24/narendra-modi-gates-foundation-award-donald-trump
42,Steinem,Gloria,msmagazine,"Out of sight should not mean out of mind—and heart. But the tragedy for women in prison is that it often does. For the rest of us, this invisibility keeps us from realizing how much women in prison may resemble you and me.

(Joshua Davis / Creative Commons)

For example: 80 percent are mothers, and this year alone, incarceration will separate 2.3 million mothers from their children. About five percent are pregnant and give birth in prison. And in 28 states, women give birth in chains because we have not yet succeeded in even passing anti-shackling laws.

Most women in prison are not a danger to society; about 82 percent have been convicted of non-violent crimes. Often, they are suffering unfairly harsh consequences, even for nonviolent crimes—for example, possessing or selling illegal drugs. Even many of the women convicted of murder have actually killed a violent partner in self-defense, yet not been allowed to plead self-defense.

Two women prisoners in New York State’s maximum security facility summed it up this way: “There are no big-time gangsters here, no serial killers, no Godmothers running drug empires, no Enron or WorldCom executives.” Yet women and girls are the fastest growing incarcerated population in the United States today.

Over the course of the past four decades, women’s state prison populations have grown more than 834 percent—more than doubling the rate of growth in men’s prisons. And the incarceration rates for women of color outpace their white counterparts: black women are twice as likely as white women to be incarcerated.

Once in prison, women also suffer significantly higher rates of sexual victimization and violence by staff. Often, prisoners’ mental and physical health deteriorate, as their most basic hygiene and reproductive needs—even access to tampons or pads—go unmet.

Learning such facts is a first step to action. We at Ms. magazine want women in prison to know they are seen and valued. Because domestic violence shelters can be almost as isolating as prisons—and often lack libraries or any reading material, just as many prisons do—we decided to include women in those shelters, too.

That’s why we started the Ms. Magazine Prison and Domestic Violence Shelter Program. It is funded by charitable contributions earmarked for this purpose, and also by Ms. Community Members who buy an extra membership and subscription for a friend they don’t know.

Over the 14 years since this program’s birth, we’ve discovered that even a small gesture means a lot. Women in prison often spend 17 hours a day isolated in their cells, with no reading material except The Bible, or with only books and magazines they must share with hundreds of other women. Now, we’re reaching 8,242 federal, state and county prisoners with Ms. and women in hundreds of shelters. That’s a fraction of the total, but it’s a number we’re proud of and hope to keep growing.

Ms. also has been reporting on one of the driving forces behind increasing incarceration rates among women: the cash bail system. Sixty percent of jailed women—often primary caregivers for their families—remain locked up before their trial simply because they cannot afford to pay bail, a median cost of $11,700 in the U.S. This is a form of the debtor’s prisons that were eliminated in the 19th century.

Data has shown that when a woman is unable to afford bail, she is more likely to be convicted, more likely to receive a longer sentence and more likely to end up with a lifelong criminal record. Many women also tend not to benefit from plea-bargaining simply because they cannot afford a lawyer.

That’s exactly what happened to Deborah Burlingham, of Las Vegas, Nevada, who wrote to us after receiving Ms. in prison:

“I recently read your Summer issue and thoroughly enjoyed every article. I especially was impressed with “Held for Ransom” by Sarah Willets. I too was a victim of this practice. I am currently incarcerated for a DUI—no injuries, no property damage. My bail was set at $100,000 cash only! I remained there until my initial court date 33 days later. I was then transferred to prison. I was wondering if you are still offering a free subscription to women in prison? Reading and working out are my two periods of sanity every day. Keep up the good work of informing women about important issues. Thank you.”

Let women on the inside know they are not alone. Every American should be ashamed that this country puts a greater proportion of its citizens in prison than any other nation on earth, because of racism, sexism and also because in many states, the Prison Industrial Complex allows corporations to build and run prisons for profit.

And let survivors of domestic violence who are now in shelters know it’s unfair for them to be deprived of home while the criminal is free. We must all work together against notions of “masculinity” and “femininity” that have turned the home into the single most dangerous place for women and children in this country.

Nothing can replace systematic remedies, and nothing can replace reaching out to women in prisons and shelters right now. If you would like the deep satisfaction of knowing you’re part of letting them know they’re not alone, please make a tax-deductible contribution to the Ms. Prison and Domestic Violence Shelter Program.

Nine-year-old Anabel, from Los Angeles, CA, explains it best:

“I am nine and my daddy got me a subscription (in my name) to Ms. magazine. I read my copy once I get it. My daddy and I have enclosed $12, $2 from me and the rest from my daddy. I think it’s sad that women go to jail for no reason and I want to help. Please enjoy the picture I’ve drawn.”

If you send a friend you don’t know a copy of Ms., it will have her name on it, and be something she knows will keep coming—hundreds of pages of words and images that link her to the world of women.

On the outside, the women’s movement brings us support, facts, creativity, humor and a sense of community. Pass it on.",-2,https://msmagazine.com/2019/09/18/give-the-gift-of-ms-to-women-in-prison-and-domestic-violence-shelters/
43,Steinem,Gloria,crfashionbook,"While Queen Elizabeth I is one of the best-known monarchs in British history, very little remains of her wardrobe. But this fall, a piece of her only-known remaining dress is set to go on display at Hampton Court Palace.

The embroidered silk, which features gold and silver thread, had been preserved as an altar cloth for centuries in Herefordshire, and it is believed to have come to the town of Bacton by way of Elizabeth I's close associate Blanche Parry.

“When I saw it for the first time I knew immediately that it was something special. As I examined it, I felt as though I had found the Holy Grail, the Mona Lisa of fashion,” curator Eleri Lynn told Gordon Rayner for The Telegraph, at the time of the discovery in 2017.

“None of Elizabeth I’s dresses are known to have survived, but everything we have learnt since then points to it being worn by Elizabeth.”

Now, after more than a thousand hours of conservation work, the piece is ready for its public debut, and it will be displayed alongside the Rainbow Portrait (top), which shows the Queen in an ensemble quite similar to the silk cloth.

""To have an item of Tudor dress with such a close link to Queen Elizabeth I is extraordinarily rare,"" says collections curator Eleri Lynn.

""We are very excited to display the Bacton Altar Cloth next to the legendary Rainbow Portrait, with its prominent similarities to the fabric of the cloth itself.""

The piece will be on display at Hampton Court Palace from October 12 through February 23, 2020. Tickets for adults that include a donation, are priced at £23.50, and there are discounts available for students, seniors, children, and families.

45,Steinem,Gloria,crfashionbook,"Pole dancing is hard. Looking like a pro in a matter of months is even harder. But dancer and choreographer Johanna Sapakie, who trained the cast of Hustlers for the stripper-scammer film, made that happen for the diverse group of actresses.

With a background in acrobatics (she’s been in Cirque Du Soleil) and eight to nine years of pole dancing experience, Sapakie helped Jennifer Lopez, Constance Wu, Lili Reinhart, and Keke Palmer look like naturals in a new environment. The training varied by actress depending on her character, but the work ranged from intense, to emotional, to straight-up fun.

With J.Lo, whose character is “dominant” in the film, Sapakie started pole training two and a half months before the actress started filming. (They had to be especially prepared for Lopez’s big pole solo in the film, which she does herself.) They trained roughly two to three times per week with hour-long sessions, depending on J.Lo’s hectic schedule. (She was also touring at the time, among her other countless projects.)

""That was the point of making sure she had a pole in any city she was in. And I would go to her wherever she was at, so that within for a crazy busy schedule, we would lock out a pole training,"" says Sapakie, who was recruited for the Hustlers gig by J.Lo's choreographer and director team NappyTabs [Napoleon and Tabitha D’umo].

This content is imported from YouTube. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.

They’d train at Lopez’s homes in New York, L.A., and Miami with portable poles set up at her houses. J.Lo trained one-on-one with Sapakie; the privacy helped her get into character. And they didn’t start off easy with tennis shoes; Lopez was learning in six-inch platforms from the very beginning. Even though the music icon dances in heels onstage, she still had to adjust to the height. Sapakie, who worked with the singer on her competition show, Q'Viva: The Chosen, says Lopez had never pole danced before, but given her performance background, she had the confidence to look like a vet.

Sapakie’s teaching style is energetic and supportive, as she exhibited during an intro class at New York’s Body & Pole studio on Wednesday night. Amidst leading spine and hip stretches, core workouts, and across-the-floor warm-ups, she reminds her students that learning to pole dance isn’t about being perfect, it’s about feeling good about yourself, free, and sexy. (And you don’t need experience to try it out!)

And for those wondering, Sapakie didn’t work with Cardi B, who makes her movie debut in Hustlers. But given the rapper’s history as a former stripper, she already knew what she was doing.

Below, Sapakie spills about her Hustlers training. Catch the film in theaters on September 13.

Lopez’s pole training journey started with climbing, then spinning, then a flipping upside-down move.

With Jennifer, we started with climbing because we wanted to make sure that she felt really comfortable and safe just going up and down the pole. Then, we worked on spinning—so anything that was giving a really nice, fast rotation. Spinning can be disorienting for people who aren't used to it, it's different too because she's a dancer. When you're a dancer, you spin on top of yourself, and as a pole dancer, you're like a carousel going around a fixed point. The last piece of the puzzle was getting her inverted and upside down. We wanted one big “wow” moment where she turned upside down. So that was the last thing we tackled to make sure that she could handle that. And she nailed it.



The training was different for each of the other actresses.

Working with Constance, Keke, and Lili was different for a couple reasons. One, because their roles in the movie were different. Constance's character is supposed to look new, like she hasn't been doing this for a long time. There should be a clear difference between Jennifer's mastery on the pole and Constance's character's new vibe.

With Constance it was more making sure she felt really comfortable moving and grooving around the pole. So when she did have her scenes, she didn't feel like she had to hold back anything. We worked more with her from a character perspective because she doesn't come from a dance background. With Jennifer, we approach things a lot from a choreography and dance base, but with Constance, it was more, ""How would your character feel? How would your character move?"" And instead of putting things in a locked-in sequence, which is harder for people who aren't used to remembering choreography, it was more like ""Here's a bunch of moves that work and now you put them together the way your character would feel like they would go.""

With Keke and with Lili, it was just a party. They don't have any pole scenes that they're solely responsible for, but we wanted to make sure that they understood what it felt like because their characters are supposed to live in this world. And so basically, getting together with them was just play time. It was making sure we put some fun music on. We got them moving around the pole, feeling what it feels like to not be foreign with this apparatus. Keke turns everything into a party. Her energy is so joyous, she was a blast.

Lili Reinhart shares a BTS picture of her pole dancing training for her upcoming role in #Hustlers 💅 pic.twitter.com/3lDB51aLv0 — PopBuzz (@popbuzz) April 18, 2019

Reinhart surprised her.

Lili ended up enjoying it so much that she came back for an additional session with me just to learn. It's really fun when people fall in love with something that surprises them and they want to come back and learn more. I was surprised that Lili liked it as much as she did because in her daily life, she has a more reserved demeanor. And this is definitely something outside of the box. So I was really happy to see that she really embraced it and wanted to learn more.

Sapakie didn’t require them to do specific workouts outside of the pole training.

I think when actresses know they're going to be onscreen in less clothes than they're used to wearing, they prep themselves very well because they want to look their best. Jennifer has a really intense workout regimen, but then often we would go to the gym together. She has a personal trainer that was also working with her. Plus, she was working on her tour the whole time, so she's constantly moving. But there wasn't anything specific like, ""Hey, you got to go home and do, you know, 10 sit-ups."" It was more like, the more you can work on the pole, the more you're going to tone the things that need to be toned anyway and you're getting the work done for the movie.

This content is imported from Instagram. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.

She hopes the film can help shatter misconceptions about pole dancing.

I think there's a misconception about a stereotype of the pole community as a whole. People think of it in one specific vein, which is where it originated, but pole dancing has become a really widespread art form and has manifested itself in all of these different ways, like any art form, which is why it's such a welcoming community. Pole dancing is no longer just in the clubs. There's now pole for moms who want to get a workout. There's pole competitions where people are doing acrobatic things you could never dream of. Then there's pole just for art's sake, where you're dancing up there and feeling all of your emotions and everything in -between.

So I hope by Jennifer talking about it in interviews and seeing these actresses embrace it for this movie, people start to understand that it's open to everyone. And it doesn't mean that you're any specific type of person because you do it. It's for everybody.

Gloria Marie Steinem was born on March 25, 1934 in Toledo, Ohio. As one of the leaders of the American feminist movement in the 1960s and 70s, she campaigned for the Equal Rights Amendment, co-founded the National Women's Political Caucus, and won the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2013. She catapulted to fame after her work as a journalist led her to pose as a Playboy Bunny, therefore exposing how women were treated at the Playboy clubs. In 1972, she co-founded the feminist-themed Ms. magazine and has spent the remainder of her life as a journalist and activist advocating for reproductive rights and writing on issues of equality.

48,Steinem,Gloria,news,"The Daily Beast

Anas Alkharboutli/GettyA group of British academics was secretly in contact with Russian diplomats in four separate embassies as they worked to undermine evidence that Bashar al-Assad was using chemical weapons against his own people, according to emails seen by The Daily Beast.The documents were obtained as part of a sting operation on one member of the group that was disclosed last month by the BBC and The Times of London. Paul McKeigue, a Professor of Genetic Epidemiology and Statistical Genetics at the University of Edinburgh’s College of Medicine, was duped into sharing the inner workings of the so-called Working Group on Syria, Propaganda and Media by emails from someone calling himself “Ivan,” who implied he was a Russian intelligence officer.The Working Group consists of a handful of university professors (none with any expertise in Syria or the Middle East), who have spent years suggesting that the Assad regime has been framed for war crimes in an elaborate conspiracy consisting of Syrian rebels, White Helmet rescue workers, and the American and British intelligence services. Moreover, the Working Group alleges that conspiracy has been systematically laundered through journalists, academics and human rights workers who they believe to be CIA or MI6 agents.Some of these completely unproven theories have been taken up enthusiastically on social media and used to sow disinformation about Assad’s war crimes.In an apparent effort to further the conspiracy theories, McKeigue was all too happy to collude with someone he thought was one of Vladimir Putin’s spies.In the emails with “Ivan,” McKeigue boasted about his interactions with Russian officials, a journalist who worked for the Russian state media and WikiLeaks, which “very likely knew it was assisting a Russian intelligence influence effort” during the 2016 U.S. presidential election, according to a Senate Subcommittee on Intelligence report.McKeigue told “Ivan” in February that WikiLeaks had helped him secure free legal advice from one of Julian Assange’s personal lawyers, Melinda Taylor.The emails claim that Taylor had been communicating with the British epidemiologist since at least September 2019, when she sent him a lengthy “legal advice memorandum” detailing ways to make litigious claims against the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), an intergovernmental body that seeks to implement the worldwide ban on the stockpiling and use of chemical weapons such as sarin gas, which suffocates its drooling and vomiting victims to death.McKeigue refers to the memorandum as one way of conducting “lawfare” against the chemical watchdog—a term typically invoked to mean frivolous or harassing litigation. He said Taylor provided him with the memorandum, pro bono, to advance claims of impropriety among members of the OPCW.According to the emails, the advice memorandum also led to Taylor’s husband, Geoffrey Roberts, representing Brendan Whelan, a former OPCW employee who went rogue and criticized the group’s investigations, leaking material to WikiLeaks.McKeigue told “Ivan” that he could reach Whelan via Alexander Shulgin, Russia’s ambassador to the Netherlands and its permanent representative to the OPCW.“Brendan keeps in contact with your embassy in Den Haag,” McKeigue wrote. “So if you wanted someone to make an introduction (for one of your diplomats, not in a covert role) to Melinda [Taylor] and Geoff [Roberts], this would be a possible route. Brendan knows them better than I do.”McKeigue, Taylor and Roberts declined to comment to The Daily Beast.The emails also show that Taylor corresponded with McKeigue to discuss the secret location of the Commission for International Justice and Accountability (CIJA), an NGO that has compiled documentary evidence of war crimes in Syria carried out by the Assad regime and ISIS. Some of their evidence was used in the first successful Syrian war crimes prosecution in Germany.It was CIJA that orchestrated the sting on McKeigue when they grew frustrated by the Working Group’s fixation on undermining evidence against Assad. CIJA was running the “Ivan” account all along.In the correspondence collected by the NGO, McKeigue outlined to his presumed Russian intelligence contact “complicated lines of communication” between the Working Group and a network of Russian Foreign Ministry officials in four separate embassies around the world: The Hague, New York, London, and Geneva. Russian diplomats, he noted, had been corresponding with members of the Working Group for a presentation at a January 2020 Arria formula meeting of the UN Security Council, convened by Russia in order to sow skepticism about the OPCW’s still-pending investigation.McKeigue wrote that he worked personally with Stepan Ankeev, an official at the Russian embassy in London, to put the plan in motion, while his Working Group associates kept in touch with other Russian diplomats in other countries. “But in the end it all worked out okay,” McKeigue wrote. “The only other diplomatic communication we have had is with Sergey Krutskikh in Geneva, who is Vanessa’s contact but has occasionally passed information to the Working Group via Piers.”“Piers” refers to Piers Robinson, the founder of the Working Group and an outspoken commentator on Syria on Twitter. “Vanessa” is Vanessa Beeley, perhaps the most prominent and controversial member of the Working Group. A former waste management consultant turned blogger, Beeley became a fixture on RT, the Russian government’s English language propaganda network, for her willingness to add all manner of unsubstantiated and imaginative allegations about the Syria conflict.She has repeatedly accused the White Helmets, an internationally funded rescue organization, of staging chemical attacks in Syria otherwise attributed to the Assad regime.Beeley and Robinson’s purported contact in Switzerland, Sergey Krutskikh, is secretary to Russia’s mission at the UN. He is also the son of a better-known Russian diplomat, Andrey Krutskikh, who was appointed early last year as the first director of Russian Foreign Ministry’s newly minted Department of International Information Security, which coordinates with European countries on cybersecurity.McKeigue also boasted to his supposed Russian handler about his work with state media employees at Ruptly, a streaming video platform based in Germany, which is funded by the Kremlin.The British academic was given screen captures from a database of sensitive personal details on activists and war crimes witnesses collected through interviews conducted on the ground in Syria by Ruptly staff. McKeigue passed the details on to “Ivan,” despite the apparent threat to these people.After a while, McKeigue decided that his contact at Ruptly was insufficiently loyal to the cause and asked “Ivan” to investigate him.Nerma Jelacic, the CIJA’s director of external relations and a member of the sting op, told The Daily Beast that the disclosure that Russian diplomats and state-run media outlets were working with the Working Group helped to explain why this otherwise obscure collection of academics had managed to make headlines around the world. “These networks would have remained nothing more than a bunch of marginalized ideologues and conspiracists,” Jelacic said.She added, “Russia’s disinformation campaigns about Syria would be far less effective if they had to rely solely on statements from the Russian foreign and ministries rather than on what Westerner academics and self-described ‘whistleblowers’ have said.”McKeigue’s correspondence with “Ivan” has been passed to British authorities. The University of Edinburgh continues to insist his commentary on Syria has been undertaken as a private citizen and not on behalf of the institution; it affirms McKeigue’s right to free expression.Kristyan Benedict, Amnesty International U.K. Campaigns Manager, told The Daily Beast: “Syrian victims and their families who have endured many horrors [deserve justice]. These individuals, quite disgracefully, are trying to deny Syrians these rights. They won’t succeed.”This piece is part of a joint investigation between The Daily Beast and Newlines magazine who have a more detailed analysis here.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

49,Steinem,Gloria,time,"When President Donald Trump and North Korean Chairman Kim Jong Un met at the Demilitarized Zone last month, and Trump became the first U.S. president to take steps in North Korea, the overwhelming response was cynicism.

Believe us, we know that the continuing saga between the United States and North Korea is confusing and complicated. We understand the temptation to get caught up in — and be skeptical of — the theatrics. But in our work as activists and academics, we’ve all been to the Demilitarized Zone, met North Korean women and immersed ourselves deeply in this issue. And, at this critical moment, we implore you all to remember that what happens next is bigger than either Trump or Kim.

This is because the Korean War persists nearly 70 years on, and we are now presented with a real opportunity to end it. Many Americans may not realize that there was never a peace agreement or a formal end to the war in which up to 4 million people were killed. In 1953, a temporary ceasefire was signed by U.S. and North Korean military commanders, with a recommendation to return in 90 days to negotiate a political settlement. That never happened. It may seem like a technicality, but to millions of Koreans, it’s a reality.

This lingering state of war is the root cause of tensions and distrust between the United States and North Korea. It prevents North and South Korea from meaningful cooperation and keeps millions of Korean families separated, unable to communicate with, see or embrace their loved ones. The so-called Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) has one of the highest concentrations of landmines on earth. Crushing sanctions contribute to hunger and illness in North Korea, particularly harming the livelihood of women and the well-being of children by preventing proper food and supplies from getting into the country. The DMZ is an ever-present reminder that, at any moment, active hostilities could resume. And were nuclear weapons used, upwards of 25 million people on either side of the border could be impacted, including at least 100,000 U.S. citizens living in South Korea. That’s no small matter.

Yet the predominant reaction to Trump and Kim’s meeting seems to be that diplomacy is a giveaway to North Korea, that it “legitimizes” Kim Jong Un and that no engagement should proceed without their commitment to denuclearization and improving human rights. But these arguments do not get us closer to addressing these urgent matters.

That’s why we are calling for a formal end to the Korean War at this critical juncture because only by mending the past can we move forward. The impact of ending the Korean War would be wide-ranging, stretching far beyond the current political reality.

Real, successful diplomacy requires step-by-step reciprocal actions and confidence-building, not “grand bargains” and all-or-nothing demands. This was why talks broke down between the U.S. and North Korea last time, when Trump and Kim Jong Un met in Hanoi. The United States — with an assist from John Bolton, who has spent decades sabotaging U.S.-North Korea negotiations — asked for North Korea’s unilateral denuclearization prior to any sanctions relief or other steps from the United States. That’s totally unreasonable and unrealistic, and it’s not the path forward. We need to see continued, flexible talks to find steps toward our mutual larger goals — including a peace agreement.

Peace lays the foundation for a relationship between two historic enemies to address difficult matters. It isn’t a gift to North Korea or an endorsement of the government’s actions; peace is the means that allows us to achieve our goals. It is a necessary condition for normalization of relations and denuclearization. In fact, peace and real diplomacy are the only keys that can actually unlock big successes when it comes to nuclear weapons and human rights. Decades of isolation, sanctions and threats haven’t worked. We desperately need a new path.

The U.S. Congress can and should help forge that new path by passing H. Res. 152, which calls for a formal end to this war that was supposed to be resolved more than a half-century ago.

We’re in a delicate situation and have a rapidly closing window of opportunity that will set a precedent that lasts much longer than Trump’s presidency, and probably longer than any of us will be alive. A nearly 70-year history of militarism, tensions and hostilities lies behind us. A safer, more secure and more hopeful future could lie before us. It’s up to us to demand it.

50,Steinem,Gloria,crfashionbook,"Over the past few centuries, there's been no garment more telling of the times than the swimsuit. So, with beach season nearly upon us, we're looking back on all the styles throughout the years and the significance of each, including the suffragette one-piece, the first bikini ever, and of course, the free-the-hips Baywatch suit.

Getty Images

1. The Bathing Dresses of the Early 1800s

At the beginning of the 19th century, when swimming started to become recreational, ladies braved the waves in face-protecting bonnets and long dresses that protected their skin. (Yes, it was all about that pale skin.) To keep their bathing dresses from floating up (and keep their legs covered), women would sew weights into their hems. Uh, all we can say is, good luck swimming.

2. The Tunics and Bloomers of the Mid-Late 1800s

In the 1850s, drawers/bloomers were added to the garments as a precaution for accidental exposure. Towards the end of the century, the dress style graduated to the ""princess,"" cut, which was a one-piece fitted blouse and bloomer-like trousers combination.

3. The Knee-Length Suit of the 1920s





Thanks to the influence of Hollywood, swimwear started to become more fashionable, but was still relatively conservative. By 1920, popular styles covered women from the neck to the knees and were gradually working their way up. A popular swimsuit brand of the time, Jantzen, was known for its ""Red Diving Girl"" logo, which was a symbol of feminism by way of the waters. Alas, beaches across the country would still censor the styles with suit regulations.

4. The Limb-Liberating Suit of the 1930s





In the '30s, limbs were finally set free with silhouettes that were flattering and let the body breathe. Later on in the decade, many styles were made of Lastex, an elastic-y woven satin that was far better suited for beach elements.

Getty Images

5. The World's First Bikini in the 1940s





In 1946, designer Louis Reard designed the word's first bikini and fun fact: It was modeled by an exotic dancer, as the original model refused to wear it. An engineer hailed it ""smaller than the world's smallest swimsuit,"" and named it after nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll (because boom, it had arrived).

Getty Images

6. The Curve-Enhancing Suits of the 1950s





Swimwear during the '50s honed in on curvier women, which meant working structured undergarments into the designs for shape and support. Towards the end of the decade, bikinis started to become more accepted and embraced by the mainstream thanks in large part to Brigitte Bardot traipsing around the French Riviera.

7. The Monokini Suits of the 1960s





In 1964, designer Rudi Gernreich caused a worldwide stir when he introduced the topless ""Monokini,"" a bikini with two micro halter straps, that was denounced by the Vatican and illegal on most public beaches around the world. However, more modest styles of the cut-out swimsuit were unveiled and it was one of the most popular styles.

Getty Images

8. The Psychedelic Suits of the 1970s





At the height of a sexual revolution, the swimwear styles boasted barely-there cuts in a variety of fabrics including fringe and crochet. In 1975, the famous poster of Farah Fawcett in a red one-piece swimsuit (slightly reminiscent of that of The Red Diving Girl) sold 12 million copies and showed off more of an all-American girl aesthetic.

9. The Hawaiian Tropic Bikinis of the 1980s





Much like the clothing of the '80s, the styles were Rainbow Brite-hued, printed, and decidedly body-baring. The trends of the time were no doubt influenced by Hawaiian Tropic's annual bikini contest, in which they held competition for women to serve as spoke models for the brand. Since 2008, the contest has ceased to exist.

10. The Crotch-Baring Suits of the 1990s





'90s swimsuits were nothing if not an ode to the crotch with their high, hip-baring rise. This is due in large part to the Baywatch babes who put their hip bones on full display in their iconic red one-piece swimsuits (there's a historic pattern forming, no?).

Today, swimsuits are kind of a free-for-all with trends ranging from the high-waisted bikini à la Taylor Swift to the G-strings beloved by The Sports Illustrated cover girls. The cool part is that there's a million different ways to make a statement—and now we know the evolution that got us there.

He turned to activism during the AIDS epidemic in the early '80s and helped launched the Gay Men's Health Crisis in 1982. His unfiltered and aggressive approach forced him to part ways with the group and set his sights higher to the people and organizations that were not paying attention to the problem.

53,Steinem,Gloria,crfashionbook,"“That day we read no further in the book.” So go the last words uttered by the notorious 13th-century adulteress Francesca da Rimini in Dante’s Inferno, in the second circle of which, reserved for the Lustful, Francesca and her married lover, Paolo—the ­handsome brother of her crippled husband—are consigned to everlasting damnation. Locked in an eternal embrace, destined to waft for all eternity through the air of Hell together (just as, in life, they were carried away by waves of passion), the lovers pause for Dante while Francesca relates how she and Paolo came to consummate their illicit passion.

Long attracted to each other, she recalls, the pair were sitting and reading the romantic tale of Lancelot and Guine­vere when, at the very moment that the story’s adulterous characters finally kiss, Paolo finally kissed Francesca too. (The moment is captured above in an 18th-century painting by Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres.) As for what happened next… Well, you know what the two got up to after they “read no further.”

Although it may not be good for the soul, adultery has been very good for literature.

Whether a work of fiction can spur real-life adultery is anybody’s guess, but the way the Paolo and Francesca episode ingeniously entwines romance and reading makes one thing clear: Although it may not be good for the soul, adultery has been very good for literature.

And good, above all, for the novel, a genre that is unthinkable without matrimonial disaster. Straying husbands and wives have, of course, been great subjects since long before the printing press was invented.

Western literature begins, on the one hand, with a Biblical marital crisis (Abraham, the first Hebrew, sleeps with his wife’s maidservant) and, on the other hand, with the famous act of Greek adultery commemorated in Homer’s Iliad, the plot of which is set in motion by the mad affair between the Trojan prince Paris and Helen of Troy, which ends up destroying an entire city.

Adultery would continue to haunt the Greek imagination in the Odyssey, whose hero finds time to hook up with an array of goddesses on his way home to his wife (who, for her part, is beset by 108 hormonal suitors), and in the heroines of the tragic stage, such as Medea, who, when her husband decides to leave her for a younger woman, contrives a vengeance that makes boiled bunny look like an appealing option.

But as Dante’s encounter in Hell suggests, it isn’t until the invention of the long-form fictional prose narrative that adultery finds its ideal genre. In part, this has to do with subject matter—with the way adultery and its associations (fidelity, betrayal, trust, unity, domesticity) became useful metaphors for larger issues. And, in part, the ideal match between adultery and fiction had to do with form—that is, the tantalizing way in which both narrative and passion unfold.

From the start, the novelist’s ability to silently shadow a character’s thoughts and feelings (“free indirect discourse”) was perfectly suited to adultery, an act that provokes an intense inner turmoil that, necessarily, can’t reveal itself. Most scholars agree that the modern novel starts with a tale of adulterous temptation: Madame de La Fayette’s The Princess of Clèves (1678).

The book takes Dante’s raw material—there’s a young woman who has been married off to a man she doesn’t love, and she falls in love with a dashing aristocrat—but innovates ingeniously by preventing the two lovers from ever consummating their passion. (La Fayette’s heroine is the opposite of Dante’s: While Francesca goes to hell for satisfying her urges, the Princess of Clèves ends up in a convent, having never scratched her itch.)

This choice—and the author’s scrupulous avoidance of the improbable twists and turns that characterized the plots of earlier romances—allowed her to explore instead the characters’ mental states in exquisite detail.

The two and a half centuries that followed The Princess of Clèves constituted the great period of the adultery novel. With the rise of industrialization at the end of the 1700s and the triumph of bourgeois status hunting and morality throughout the 1800s, marriage and property became more important than ever before—and, for that reason, became the source of anxieties that could be teased out exhaustively at the length and with the detail that the novel permits.

Laclos’s Dangerous Liaisons has been seducing readers, not to mention playwrights and filmmakers (pictured here, Michelle Pfeiffer and John Malkovich in a 1988 adaptation), since it debuted in 1782. Getty Images Getty Images

The adultery novel could be a vehicle for societal critique, from Choderlos de Laclos’s Dangerous Liaisons (1782), in which the aristocratic characters’ sinister marital and sexual games can be read as a parable of cultural corruption in the ancien régime, to Nathaniel Hawthorne’s The Scarlet Letter (1850), to F. Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby (1925), in which the title character’s longing for another man’s wife becomes a symbol of the inchoate yearning that seems central to the American character itself.

The adultery novel could also serve to investigate the costs, particularly to women, of belonging to bourgeois society, with its empty consumerism and oppressive morality. These elements are foregrounded by authors ranging from Jane Austen, at the beginning of the 19th century, whose shimmering fantasies of ideal matches are always shadowed by the possibility of unfaithfulness and social disgrace, to Gustave Flaubert’s 1856 masterpiece Madame Bovary, the bored provincial heroine of which, like Dante’s Francesca, has her life destroyed when she succumbs to the romantic fantasies she finds in books.

While the social conventions remained rigidly in place—which is to say, while the battle between convention and desire had a place to rage—the adultery novel flourished: Tolstoy’s Anna Karenina, Edith Wharton’s sardonically titled The Age of Innocence, and the work of mid-20th-century authors such as Fay Weldon, Iris Murdoch, and Muriel Spark.

Times have changed. It’s no surprise that, in the morally more easygoing 21st century, the novel’s great subject has shifted from adultery to identity: race, class, sexuality, gender. Something else has shifted too. Most of the hefty tomes of the 19th century, from Dickens to Tolstoy, first appeared chapter by chapter in weekly reviews and magazines. (Bovary came out over the course of three months; Anna Karenina over five years.)

One effect of this parceling out was that reading the novel of adultery began to resemble committing adultery: the slow unfolding of a stranger’s character, the agonizing sense of being at the mercy of another’s whims. This structural overlap between the subject and the form may also explain why, at the beginning of the current century, adultery has migrated so successfully away from the novel into television, a medium that is experimenting with form the way the novel once did. The Affair, for instance, with its unsettling multiple points of view, embeds the problematics of “he said, she said” into the structure of the drama itself.

And so the marriage between fiction and adultery, at least, has been a successful one. As with the works, so perhaps with their authors. Any writer knows that when you’re in the zone, working really well, it’s like having a lover: You can’t think about anything else, and spending time in any other activity feels…well, like cheating.

Can anyone wonder why Marcel Proust—whose sprawling In Search of Lost Time, a work that is obsessed with adulterous passion and that famously concludes its 4,000 pages with the narrator realizing that he can finally write the great novel of memory and time he has long had in mind, the novel that in fact you have just read—eventually sacrificed everything for his “mistress,” and wrote the whole book in bed?

54,Steinem,Gloria,crfashionbook,"There are a dizzying number of brow products and services at our disposal aimed to get us lush and thick brows. But one treatment took Instagram by storm: microblading, the process of tattooing tiny brow hairs with a needle. We spoke with celebrity makeup artist and brow specialist (a.k.a The Eyebrow Doctor) Piret Aava to learn everything we need to know about the semi-permanent solution.

This content is imported from {embed-name}. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.

The Treatment

Microblading is a semi-permanent tattoo technique used to create the illusion of fuller brows. ""With this method I can create almost any look: from a very natural light finish to a beautifully bold brow,"" says Aava. First, she consults with clients about the best brow shape for their face and chooses a color that matches the natural hair color and skin undertone. The brow area is then cleaned and numbed for the treatment. Instead of using a tattoo machine, she uses a little handheld tool to manually draw hair strokes. Lastly, she applies an ointment like the EyebrowDoctor Aftercare to help with the healing process.

This content is imported from Instagram. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.

This all can take up to 30 to 40 minutes, depending on how full you want your brows to look. Clients are encouraged to schedule a follow up appointment four to six weeks after to make sure they are happy with the results or for if they need little tweaks. Results can last anywhere from one to three years, depending on your skin type (the ink fades faster on oily skin), products, and lifestyle. It's also not the same price as getting your brows waxed: Aava charges $1,500 for each treatment (which does include one touchup); prices can vary based on the technician's experience level and location.

Side Effects

When you go to a trusted and experienced brow artist, there shouldn't be any major side effects. Aava says infection is possible if you don't follow proper aftercare procedures.

A common misconception is that every microblading artist is the same. She warns that a lot of people only take a two-day course to get certified. "" I personally make sure that I go to a few conventions and conferences every year to ensure I’m using the latest technology and techniques,"" she says. Before your appointment, read reviews, look at images of before and afters, and choose your artist wisely.

This content is imported from Instagram. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.

Post-Care

The most important product you can use after a microblading treatment is sunscreen. Like with other tattoos, sunscreens helps extend the longevity of your brows and prevent against fading from the sun.

She also says to be off any Retin-A or retinol products about a week before an appointment and 30 days after getting your brows done, as those ingredients can cause pigments to fade prematurely. Don't wet the brows for a week or two while they heal and don't use any makeup on the area for at least a week. Once the skin is completely healed, she says it's okay to go back to a normal skin and makeup routine.

So those looking for a more permanent solution to improving the appearance of their brows and not afraid to use a needle to do, microblading is most certainly worth a shot.

56,Steinem,Gloria,msmagazine,"I Am Not OK.

Those four words are quickly making the rounds due to a viral hashtag bringing awareness to an important topic: intimate partner violence.

The day of this photoshoot, I was so weakened by an abusive relationship. I was emaciated, severely depressed, and could barely stand. I fell into a pool of tears and was sent home for the day. #IAmNotOk pic.twitter.com/aVUQ1w8ayQ — #EvanRachelWould (@evanrachelwood) March 11, 2019

After actor Evan Rachel Wood shared on Twitter that she was a survivor of intimate partner violence that eventually led to self-harm, others began telling their own truths—building an avalanche of testimony about violence that builds on the explosion of #MeToo and expands it into critical spaces. (Just this week, I shared the lyrics to Kelly Rowland’s ‘Dirty Laundry,’ a song where she revealed her story of intimate partner violence, on my own Twitter feed.)

#IAmNotOk is now a home for the stories and experiences of survivors of intimate partner violence from around the world, and Wood’s role in launching the conversation as an out bisexual woman is pivotal. It’s about time that we committed to elevating the stories and experiences of survivors of IPV—especially those who are people of color, LGBTQ+ and non-binary. Too often, even in social justice movements, these communities are left out of the conversation and lose their seat at the table.



Are you a survivor of domestic violence? Join the movement and share your story. #iamnotok pic.twitter.com/JmyM0q3E5p — #iamnotOK (@iamnotokMVMT) March 11, 2019

Today, I can’t help but think about three survivors: Wood, a bisexual woman; Rowland, a Black woman; and Cardi B, a Black Latina woman. Today, I can’t help but wonder how many more queer people and people of color, how many more celebrities and everyday people are not okay.

How many people can actually say that they are survivors? Just as Tarana Burke did when she launched the #MeToo Movement, we must take on the cycle on intimate partner violence in public and center those who are impacted, especially those at the margins, and confront the reality that many are still suffering.

The time is now to break the silence and elevate stories from the margins and from outside the typical narratives we’re more comfortable with.

57,Steinem,Gloria,thedailybeast,"In early 1980, a 31-year-old woman named Linda Marchiano called a press conference. Just eight years earlier, Marchiano’s performance in the adult film Deep Throat under the nom-de-porn Linda Lovelace had earned her a cult celebrity status, two unsuccessful sequels, a tell-all memoir, a follow-up tell-all for what the first one hadn’t told, a string of photoshoots in men’s mags from Playboy to Esquire, and even a hat tip from the renowned Watergate whistleblower. But Marchiano hadn’t called the conference for another reprise of her role as oral ingenue. Now a housewife and born-again Christian, nursing an affection for Cool Whip, daytime soaps, and “pink pinafore[s] embroidered with the word Mommy,” Marchiano was there to promote a new book, Ordeal, and to announce what it detailed—namely, that she had been forced into pornography; that Chuck Traynor, the star’s ex-husband and one-time director, had beaten her, terrorized her, and pressured her into sex work upon threat of “disfigurement and death;” and that the movie itself, hailed as the linchpin of the Golden Age of Porn, did not depict, as many had claimed, the sexual liberation of a young woman, but her rape.

The story fell on some deaf ears. (“I expect people not to believe me,” she told The Washington Post at the time. “Catholic girl, policeman’s daughter, living in a house where the pin money came from Tupperware parties. I mean the easiest thing for people to do in society is to say, ‘I don’t believe it.’ That's the world’s greatest cop-out.”) But others were listening intently. At the conference that day, Marchiano was joined by some of the biggest names in second-wave feminism, the vanguard of the anti-pornography crusade, among them: Gloria Steinem, Catharine MacKinnon, members of the radical feminist group Women Against Pornography, and the ferocious, bleakly hilarious, overall-wearing goliath of the movement—the writer and activist Andrea Dworkin.

By the time of the conference, Dworkin was already well on her way to becoming the most hated face of the feminist sex wars—a kind of “inverted sex symbol,” as writer Ariel Levy once put it, or “perhaps the most misrepresented writer in the Western world,” as John Berger did. But in some ways, Dworkin’s reputation as a one-dimensional, anti-porn man-hater—a feminist caricature which followed her to the grave and which a new collection of her writings, Last Days at Hot Slit: The Radical Feminism of Andrea Dworkin, published by Semiotexte this month, effectively complicates—began in earnest that morning.

Marchiano’s story resonated with Dworkin. In more than one respect, their trajectories were similar. The porn starlet was born in the Bronx to an absent cop father, and a cold, dictatorial mother. Dworkin came from Camden, New Jersey. Her father, as she put it, “was not a rolling stone,” but a devoted provider who worked “two jobs most of the time and three jobs some of the time.” Her mother, a chronically ill housewife who “experienced [Dworkin’s] inner life as a reproach,” often told her daughter that she “loved [her] but did not like [her].” Marchiano, née Boreman, was a Catholic girl once dubbed “Miss Holy Holy” for her high school stance on sex, had gotten knocked up at 19, forgone professional dreams after injuring her liver in a car crash, and linked up with Traynor, an amateur porn director, in part to escape from her parents’ home.

Dworkin, a Jewish girl in a white Christian suburb, grew up with her own history of violence and disillusionment, including a rape at age 9 which her parents didn’t report. At 18, she left home for a lukewarm undergraduate career at Bennington, got brutally probed by two prison doctors following her arrest at an anti-Vietnam protest in Manhattan, and fled the States to join a collection of Dutch anarchists. She married a man in Crete, who kicked, hit, and “bang[ed her] head against the floor until she passed out.” When she escaped her husband at age 25 to discover her parents would not take her back, Dworkin was homeless for a time. She shuffled between houseboats, friends’ kitchens, a hippie commune, an abandoned German mansion, and an experimental movie theater, prostituting for money, until a failed drug-smuggling deal landed her enough cash to leave. In 1972, the year Deep Throat hit theaters, Dworkin vowed to “use everything [she knew] in behalf of women’s liberation.” All that to say: when Marchiano later outed herself as a battered wife, Dworkin didn’t exactly fall in the critical camp.

“ Catholic girl, policeman’s daughter, living in a house where the pin money came from Tupperware parties. I mean the easiest thing for people to do in society is to say, ‘I don’t believe it.’ ” — Linda Lovelace

Instead, two weeks after the conference, according to Susan Brownmiller’s In Our Time: A Memoir of Revolution, Dworkin, Steinem, and MacKinnon met with Marchiano about taking legal action. When they discovered the statute of limitations for Marchiano’s charges had expired, the ex-pornstar backed out of the group. But, somewhat against her wishes, Marchiano became Dworkin’s cause célèbre, the inspiration behind a piece of legislation, drafted with the help of MacKinnon, known as the “Dworkin-MacKinnon Antipornography Civil Rights Ordinance.” The bill was a watershed moment. It was the first piece of policy to consider pornography as a civil rights issue, proposing legal recourse for women who believed they had been directly harmed as a result of adult content. It was also an incredible, staggering failure.

For many, the ordinance smacked of censorship, representing the first blow in a campaign to eradicate the adult industry entirely, and—although the bill itself imposed no limits on pornography production—Dworkin didn’t do much to dispel this impression. “Pornographers use our bodies as their language,” she once said. “Anything they say, they have to use us to say. They do not have that right. They must not have that right.” She also testified at the Meese Commission, a controversial Reagan-era investigation into porn, which drew widespread criticism as unambiguous government suppression, not only from obvious opponents like Playboy and Penthouse, but from writers like John Irving and organizations like the American Booksellers Association. Though iterations of the bill passed in some cities, all of its minor victories were stamped out by higher courts within a matter of months. The only thing it seemed to accomplish was to divide the era’s feminist movement, perhaps fatally so, and secure Dworkin’s reputation as a sour killjoy, a “preacher of hate,” as one obituary writer put it, whose contempt for men and sex were matched only by her often-ridiculed indifference to personal appearance.

That vision of Dworkin loomed over her work. She was pilloried in the media—critics spread rumors about her alleged interest in incest and Hustler ran a series of explicit cartoons featuring Dworkin (in one of them, a guy who self-describes as “a quiet, sensitive, misunderstood Jewish pimp for sorecovered, starving children from Haiti,” gets into various XXX scenes, noting at one point, “While I’m teaching this little shiksa the joys of Yiddish, the Andrea Dworkin Fan Club begins some really serious suck ‘n’ squat. Ready to give up holy wafers for matzoh yet, guys?”). Dworkin pushed back —she sued Hustler for defamation and lost—but the smears stuck. In a New York Times obituary following her death in 2005, the critic’s friend and ordinance-drafting partner, Catharine MacKinnon, wrote that, “over the course of her incandescent literary and political career, she also became a symbol of views she did not hold.” It’s a legacy that Last Days at Hot Slit: The Radical Feminism of Andrea Dworkin, edited by writer Amy Scholder and Johanna Fateman, founding member of early aughts electronic group Le Tigre, attempts to rattle, by putting “the contentious positions [Dworkin’s] known for in dialogue with her literary oeuvre,” as Fateman writes in her introduction.

The cartoon Dworkin is well represented in the collection—it samples her two most famous polemics: Pornography: Men Possessing Women, published the year after Marchiano’s press conference, which considers adult entertainment as a kind of genocidal propaganda (the opening epigraph describes a snuff film by Joseph Goebbels, who shot the trial and execution of a group of German generals); and Intercourse, where Dworkin famously looked at cis-heterosexual sex as a metaphor for the female condition.

“ Pornographers use our bodies as their language. Anything they say, they have to use us to say. They do not have that right. They must not have that right. ” — Andrea Dworkin

But Last Days at Hot Slit also includes works that ring truer to today’s cultural vernacular. It excerpts Dworkin’s first book, Woman Hating, a “seductively rough-hewn” and somewhat hopeful analysis which considers gender inequality not only as an ongoing crisis, but as a class and race issue, riffing on arguments which could have been mined from today’s progressive left (“There is certainly no program to deal with the realities of the class system in Amerika,” she says in the introduction). There’s also an essay from Right-Wing Women, Dworkin’s critique of women who become complicit in their own suppression, a nearly-sympathetic portrait of Reagan-era agitators, but one easily extended to the Pennsylvania soccer-moms of modern day; and her reflections on human rights violations in the West Bank, which are almost as radical now—in a moment when support for BDS or criticizing AIPAC can trigger widespread condemnation—as they were then.

Dworkin’s parallels to Marchiano went beyond mere biography. After her conference, Marchiano returned to her Catholic roots, making a 180-degree transition from pornstar to born-again proselytizer. Dworkin was also a proselytizer, though more in methodology than message. “She is, I always thought, our Old Testament prophet raging in the hills, telling the truth,” Gloria Steinem once told Democracy Now!’s Amy Goodman. Dworkin was dogmatic—it’s part of what made her so hard to like. She had an endless list of enemies, many of them her former friends. In an essay called “Goodbye to All This,” published for the first time in Last Days at Hot Slit, the critic goes for the jugular, attacking a litany of feminist peers, some whom were once on her side. “Goodbye to stupid feminist academics who romanticise prostitution and to stupid feminist magazine editors who romanticize pornography and fetishism and sadomasochism,” she writes. “Goodbye Women’s movement, hello girls.”

But the collection also captures Dworkin’s more tender moments: Mercy, her raw, fragmented, first-person debut novel; My Life as A Writer, a loving account of her childhood, the parents who would disown her, and her first story about “a wild woman, strong and beautiful, with long hair and torn clothes, on another planet, sitting on a rock”; and My Suicide, a long letter found after her death, describing her rape in a hotel room in Paris at age 52 (“Please help the women,” she concludes. “Please let me die now.”)

Dworkin was a kind of cartoon: a larger-than-life figure who loved guns, who abstained from sex, who kept a poster in her room that read “Dead Men Don’t Rape,” who trafficked in explicit language and vulgar description, and who often screamed “The First Amendment was written by slave traders!” But she wasn’t the neat caricature history has made her out to be. In one of her short stories, a piece called Listen, Dworkin wrote: “I have no patience with the untorn, anyone who hasn't weathered rough weather, fallen apart, been ripped to pieces, put herself back together, big stitches, jagged cuts, nothing nice."" Last Days At Hot Slit pays homage to the Marchiano-era Dworkin, to the anachronistic anti-porn persona everyone loves to hate, but along the way, it makes some much-needed jagged cuts.",-2,https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-andrea-dworkin-helped-turn-xxx-star-linda-lovelace-into-a-porn-hating-born-again-christian

60,Steinem,Gloria,commondreams,"In 2015, we were among 30 women from around the world who came together to cross the Korean demilitarized zone (DMZ), the infamous strip of land that has separated North and South Korea since a “temporary” cease-fire halted the Korean War 65 years ago.

We marched to show this anachronistic conflict need no longer separate families, prohibit communication, and provide excuses for land mines, nuclear weapons and an expensive, ongoing U.S. military commitment. Among us were women who had won Nobel Peace Prizes for helping to bring peace to Liberia and Northern Ireland.

Despite criticism that we were naively playing into the sinister plans of one side or the other, we held a peace symposium in Pyongyang with hundreds of North Korean women, and marched with thousands in the capital and in Kaesong. After crossing the DMZ, we walked with thousands of South Korean women along the barbed-wire fence in Paju.

We never could have predicted that only three years later, the leaders of South and North Korea would meet in the DMZ and declare that “there will be no more war on the Korean Peninsula.” This put in motion the kind of steps toward peace that we had marched for — soldiers from both sides shaking hands and removing guard posts, the beginning of land-mine removal from the DMZ. The new reality is a tribute to Korean leaders and their determination to end the standoff that has separated their people for three generations.

Sadly, the chances for peace depend on Washington, where the division of Korea along the 38th parallel was first drawn on a National Geographic map by two U.S. officers. Yet much of the U.S. leadership is singularly focused on forcing North Korea to unilaterally denuclearize as a precondition for peace talks.

It should show America’s commitment to peace by introducing a resolution that formally ends U.S. participation in the Korean War and calls on the president to begin a process toward the signing of a peace agreement.

This approach is backward. To convince somebody to put down a gun, you first have to convince them they will not be harmed. We need to establish peace first to create the necessary conditions for denuclearization.

Although most likely driven by his desire to do what prior presidents could not — truly end the Korean War — President Trump might actually achieve a breakthrough on this front. Stephen E. Biegun, the U.S. special representative on North Korea, said this month, “President Trump is ready to end this war. It is over. It is done.” His second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, at the end of this month, provides a perfect opening. A process for ending America’s oldest war and moving toward peace should be on their agenda.

Still, it’s risky to let hopes rest on the president’s credibility given Trump’s erratic nature and lack of respect for such past nuclear agreements as the Iran deal and the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty.

That’s where the new Congress comes in. It should show America’s commitment to peace by introducing a resolution that formally ends U.S. participation in the Korean War and calls on the president to begin a process toward the signing of a peace agreement.

And now that Congress has the greatest number of women in history, it should seek to ensure that women are involved in every part of the process. All too often, we’ve witnessed women being left out of peace talks, even though studies show that when women play authoritative roles, agreements are far more likely to be signed and to last.

Recognizing this, Congress passed, and Trump signed into law, the Women, Peace, and Security Act of 2017, aimed at increasing women’s participation in peace processes to prevent, end and rebuild after conflict. Now is the time to implement it.

The women elected to Congress brought with them commitment to such popular issues as Medicare-for-all, free college tuition and confronting climate change. Yet these goals will remain dreams as long as funding is constrained by the $700 billion a year the United States spends on the military. Thus, ending the Korean conflict is crucial not only to Koreans, but to Americans as well.

Most Americans don’t know what a pivotal role the Korean War played in creating the military-industrial complex. As University of Chicago historian Bruce Cumings has written, it “was the occasion for transforming the United States into a very different country than it had ever been before: one with hundreds of permanent military bases abroad, a large standing army and a permanent national security state at home.”

As two women who defied naysayers by crossing the DMZ, we may never know what difference we made. But we saw firsthand the impact of the war on Korean lives, and we know the impact of massive U.S. military spending on our own lives. It is time to end this longest war.",-2,https://www.commondreams.org/views/2019/02/25/women-marched-korean-reconciliation-washington-our-way

Among us were women who had won Nobel Peace Prizes for helping to bring peace to Liberia and Northern Ireland.

Despite criticism that we were naively playing into the sinister plans of one side or the other, we held a peace symposium in Pyongyang with hundreds of North Korean women, and marched with thousands in the capital and in Kaesong. After crossing the DMZ, we walked with thousands of South Korean women along the barbed-wire fence in Paju.

62,Steinem,Gloria,thenational,"Shahd Thani hid her first book at last year’s ­Emirates Literature Festival. The blogger and novelist behind the ­Emirati Kinda Love Story series chose Half of a Yellow Sun by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, which she wrapped up in a bow, and bearing a green and white sticker that explained its purpose. After placing the book on a horse statue located next to Dubai Festival City’s P F Chang’s, Thani kept watch.

“The manager was utterly fascinated and kept looking at the book,” she says. “­Eventually, he couldn’t resist. He asked if it was for free and if he could take it. When I assured him that he could, the joy on his face was priceless.” It’s all part of the Book Fairies spell.

Free books for all

Abeer Acero, a 27-year-old blogger and book reviewer, launched the Dubai chapter of the international Book Fairies movement in March last year with an Instagram account: @mydubaibookfairies. Having hidden more than a hundred books with the help of fellow volunteer Book Fairies, Acero has been busy this past year.

“One of my life’s missions is to make reading ‘cool’ again,” Acero says. “In this generation of gadgets, most people don’t have the time to read a book any more, and the younger ones feel like reading is boring. I want to change that stigma by letting everyone know that reading is a good and healthy exercise for the mind.”

Book drops to restart January 1

If you’ve missed past book drops, don’t worry, Acero and the Book Fairies are busy planning for the coming year. The next book drops in Dubai start January 1. “We will be doing so much for 2019,” Acero says. “I’ll be announcing a big new year fairy drop-off and, rest assured, we will be back at the Emirates Literature Festival [in March], dropping books like we always do.”

With titles such as Beetle Boy by M G Leonard, The Young Elites by Marie Lu, Persepolis by Marjane Satrapi, and many more, you’re likely to stumble across a book just for you. The city’s Book Fairies have concealed titles all over, from beaches to buses and, most famously, just outside the Burj Khalifa. “It was my favourite book drop because there are a lot of people there, and the suspense of who’s going to pick it up is exciting,” says Acero.

She hid Baum’s The Wizard of Oz on a ledge in front of the towering skyscraper. “A little girl saw it and grabbed it as fast as she could. She knew the story, had watched the animated version and was clearly an avid fan. She took it straight to her mum with a smile so priceless, I couldn’t help but ask for a photo.”

The original Book Fairies

Book Fairies now operate in more than 100 countries. Volunteers are devoted to the cause of reusing and sharing books with strangers, thus minimising the impact they have on the environment, while also giving those who may not have access to books a chance to read.

The movement began more than two years ago in London, with the Books on the Underground project, and has since grown into the Book Fairies under owner and director Cordelia Oxley. Social media allowed avid readers to follow clues to metro stations, malls and other public spaces to find a book of their own. Oxley’s agenda is simple. “We promote reading, in any way we can,” she says.

Last March, ahead of International Women’s Day, Book Fairies partnered with United Nations ambassador and British actress Emma Watson. Videos went viral of Watson visiting landmarks in London and New York City, and leaving behind titles for other readers to find. She chose publications from Our Shared Shelf, her feminist book club, such as My Life on the Road by Gloria Steinem and How to Be a Woman by Caitlin Moran. Each book came with a handwritten note, encouraging readers to pass it on in the same fashion once finished.

'There is not a particular genre that we share'

“The Book Fairies are all about equality,” explains Oxley. “We strive to give equal prominence to male and female authors, published and self-published authors, and a whole array of stories. Everyone has different tastes, so there is not a particular genre that we share. We accept donations from all sorts of places, including bookshops and libraries. There is a wide variety of [reading material].”

It was also as part of the International Women’s Day activities that Acero recruited Thani and other volunteers to hide titles around the grounds of the Emirates Literature Festival last year. After her first Book Fairies experience, Thani was hooked. “As a writer, poet, as well as a member of a local initiative – Untitled Chapters, a community for Emirati writers – I felt an instant kinship with Abeer and the Book Fairies,” she says. “I love the fact that different initiatives can meet and, instead of competing with one another, unite to help one another succeed and bond over our love for books and words.”

The rise of #bookstagram

Acero has been a part of the growing #bookstagram online community on Instagram since 2014, and regularly reviews books on her blog, lookingforabura.com. As a book-lover, her drive for both reading and writing propelled her into the world of Book Fairies.

“This is my first actual book project, and it has a special place in my heart,” she explains. “The Book Fairies around the world, especially Cordelia, have been very supportive. It’s a pleasure to be a part of this incredible group where we get to connect and talk to people across continents who have the same love for reading. It works like magic, really.”

63,Steinem,Gloria,nymag,"From the April 4, 1969 issue of New York Magazine.

Once upon a time—say, ten or even five years ago—a Liberated Woman was somebody who had sex before marriage and a job afterward. Once upon the same time, a Liberated Zone was any foreign place lucky enough to have an American army in it. Both ideas seem antiquated now, and for pretty much the same reason: Liberation isn’t exposure to the American values of Mom-and-apple-pie anymore (not even if Mom is allowed to work in an office and vote once in a while); it’s the escape from them.

For instance:

Barnard girls move quietly, unlasciviously into the men’s dorms at Columbia; a student sleep-in to protest the absence of “rational communities”—co-ed dorms like those already springing up at other universities.

Wives and mothers march around the Hudson Street alimony jail with posters announcing they don’t want alimony.

A coven of 13 members of WITCH (The Women’s International Terrorist Conspiracy from Hell, celebrating witches and gypsies as the first women resistance fighters) demonstrates against that bastion of white male supremacy: Wall Street. The next day, the market falls five points.

More witches and some black-veiled brides invade the Bridal Fair at Madison Square Garden. They carry signs (“Confront the Whore-makers,” “Here Comes the Bribe”), sing, shout, release white mice in the audience of would-be brides, and generally scare the living daylights out of exhibitors who are trying to market the conventional delights of bridal gowns, kitchen appliances, package-deal honeymoon trips and heart-shaped swimming pools.

At the end of the Columbia strike, the student-run Liberation School offers a course on women as an oppressed class. Discussions include the parallel myths about women and Negroes (that both have smaller brains than white men, childlike natures, natural “goodness,” limited rationality, supportive roles to white men, etc.); the paternalistic family system as prototype for capitalistic society (see Marx and Engels); the conclusion that society can’t be restructured until the relationship between the sexes is restructured. Men are kept out of the class, but it is bigger and lasts longer than any other at the school.

Redstockings, an action group in the Women’s Liberation Movement, sponsors a one-act play about abortion by the New Feminist Theatre (whose purpose it is to point out how many plays are anti-woman and how tough it is for women playwrights, directors, producers), plus two hours of personal and detailed testimony—in public—by girls who have had abortions and Tell It Like It Is, from humor through sadism. Nobody wants to reform the abortion laws; they want to repeal them. Completely.

What do women want? The above events are in no way connected to the Bloomingdale-centered, ask-not-what I-can-do-for-myself-ask-what-my-husband-can-do-for-me ladies of Manhattan, who are said by sociologists to be “liberated.” Nor do the house-bound matriarchs of Queens and the Bronx get much satisfaction out of reading about feminist escapades. On the contrary, the whole thing alienates them by being a) radical and b) young.

The women behind it, and influenced by it, usually turn out to be white, serious, well-educated girls; the same sort who have labored hard in what is loosely known as the Movement, from the Southern sit-ins of nine years ago to the current attacks on the military-industrial-educational complex. They have been jailed, beaten and Maced side-by-side with their social-activist male counterparts. (It’s wonderful to see how quickly police from Selma to Chicago get over a reluctance to hit women.) They have marched on Senate committees, Pentagon hawks, their own college presidents and the Chase Manhattan Bank. But once back in the bosom of SDS , they found themselves typing and making coffee.

“When it comes to decision-making or being taken seriously in meetings,” said one revolutionary theorist from Berkeley, “we might as well join the Young Republicans.”

Such grumbling noises were being made aloud at Movement meetings as early as five years ago. but women were ridiculed or argued down by men (as well as some “Uncle Tom” women). Eventually, they were assured, “the woman question” would come up on the list of radical priorities—as decided on by radical men. Meanwhile, more backstage work, more mimeographing, more secondary role-playing around the revolutionary cells and apartment-communes. And, to be honest, more reluctance to leave the secondary role and lose male approval.

Finally, women began to “rap” (talk, analyze, in radical-ese) about their essential second-classness, forming women’s caucuses inside the Movement in much the same way Black Power groups had done. And once together they made a lot of discoveries: that they shared more problems with women of different classes, for instance, than they did with men of their own; that they liked and respected each other (if women don’t want to work with women, as Negroes used to reject other Negroes, it’s usually because they believe the myth of their own inferiority), and that, as black militants kept explaining to white liberals, “You don’t get radicalized fighting other people’s battles.”

At the SDS Convention in 1967, women were still saying such integrationist things as “The struggle for the liberation of women must be part of the larger fight for freedom.” Many Movement women still are. But members of groups like the Southern Student Organizing Committee and New York Radical Women (a loose coalition of various radical groups whose representatives meet once a month) withdrew to start concentrating on their own problems. They couldn’t become black or risk jail by burning their draft cards, but they could change society from the bottom up by radicalizing (engaging with basic truth) the consciousness of women; by going into the streets on such women’s issues as abortion, free childcare centers, and a final break with the 19th-century definition of females as sex objects whose main function is to service men and their children.

All this happened not so much by organization as contagion. What has come to be known in the last two years or so as the Women’s Liberation Movement (WLM) is no more pin-downable than the Black Power Movement; maybe less so, because white groups tend to be less structured, more skittish about leadership than black ones. Nonetheless, when the WLM had its first national conference last fall, women from 20 states and Canada showed up on a month’s notice. A newsletter, Voice of the Women’s Liberation Movement, is published in Chicago. WLM-minded groups are springing up on dozens of campuses where they add special student concerns to their activities: professors who assume women aren’t “serious” about careers; advisers who pressure girls toward marriage or traditionally feminine jobs (would-be Negro doctors are told to be veterinarians, would-be women doctors are told to be nurses), and faculties or administrations where few or no women are honored in authority.

In New York, WITCH is probably the most colorful outcropping of the WLM. It got started when women supporters of men being investigated by the House Un-American Activities Committee decided that a witch-hunt should have witches, and dressed up for HUAC hearings accordingly. (In the words of WITCH, “We are WITCH. We are WOMAN. We are LIBERATION. WE are WE. The hidden history of women’s liberation began with witches and gypsies … the oldest guerrillas and resistance fighters, the first practicing abortionists and distributors of contraceptive herbs. WITCH implies the destruction of passivity, consumerism and commodity fetishism … the routine of daily life is the theatre of struggle.”) It was the Witch Guerrilla Theatre that hexed Wall Street, and later, as part of a technique called “violating the reality structure,” it “freaked out at a Wellesley Alumnae Fund-raising Bridge Party.”

Quieter groups seem to be forming everywhere, from the New Women in Manhattan to The Feminists in Oceanside. Redstockings, the most publically active at the moment, has recapitulated the whole WLM in its short history. Women activists rebelled against their subordinate position, but still tried to work within the Movement until a peace-and-liberation protest at Nixon’s Inaugural, where girls spoke and were booed by their own fellow radicals. After that moment of truth, they reformed as part of “an independent revolutionary movement, potentially representing half the population. We intend to make our own analysis of the system … Although we may cooperate with radical men on matters of common concern … our demand for freedom involves not only the overthrow of capitalism, but the destruction of the patriarchal system.”

If all this sounds far-out, Utopian, elitist, unnecessary or otherwise unlikely to be the next big thing in revolutions, consider two facts: 1) the WLM is growing so rapidly that even its most cheerful proselytizers are surprised, spreading not only along the infra-structure of the existing co-ed Movement, but into a political territory where anti-Vietnam petitions have rarely been seen; and 2) there are a couple of mass movements, from highly organized through just restless, that the WLM might merge with, becoming sort of a revolutionary vanguard.

The older, middle-class women come first, the ones who tried hard to play subordinate roles in the suburbs according to the post-war-baby-boom-women’s magazine idyll but found Something Missing. Betty Friedan, who explained their plight clearly and compassionately in The Feminine Mystique, named that Something: rewarding work. But when these women went out to find jobs, they found a lot of home-truths instead.

For instance, there is hardly a hierarchy in the country—business, union, government, educational, religious, whatever—that doesn’t discriminate against women above the secretarial level. Women with some college education earn less than men who get as far as the eighth grade. The median income of white women employed full time is less than that of white men and Negro men. The gap between women’s pay and men’s pay gets greater every year, even though the number of women in the labor force increases (they are now a third of all workers). Forty-three states have “protection legislation” limiting the hours and place a woman can work; legislation that is, as Governor Rockefeller admitted last year, “more often protective of men.” The subtler, psychological punishments for stepping out of woman’s traditional “service” role are considerable. (Being called “unfeminine,” “a bad mother” or “a castrating woman,” to name a traditional few.) And, to top it all off, the problem of servants or child care often proves insurmountable after others are solved.

In short, women’s opportunities expanded greatly for about 15 years after they won the vote in 1920 (just as Negroes had more freedom during Reconstruction, before Jim Crow laws took over where slavery had left off), but they have been getting more limited ever since.

The middle-class, educated and disillusioned group gets larger with each college graduation. National Organization for Women (NOW)—founded in 1966 by Betty Friedan, among others, “to bring women into full participation in the mainstream of American society now, exercising all the privileges and responsibilities thereof in truly equal partnership with men” — is a very effective voice of this group, concentrating on such reforms as getting irrelevant sex-designations out of Help Wanted ads and implementing Equal Employment Opportunity laws.

If the WLM can feel solidarity with the hated middle class, and vice versa, then an alliance with the second mass movement—poor women of all colors—should be no problem. They are already organized around welfare problems, free daycare centers, for mothers who must work, and food prices. For them, equal pay, unequal training and sex discrimination for jobs (not to mention the woman-punishing rules of welfare) exact a daily price: Of all the families living below the poverty level, 40 per cent are headed by women.

A lot of middle-class and radical-intellectual women are already working with the poor on common problems, but viewing them as social. If the “consciousness-raising” programs of the WLM work, they’ll see them as rallying points for women qua women. And that might forge the final revolutionary link. Rumblings are already being heard inside the Democratic party in New York. It’s the women who staff and win elections, and they may finally balk at working for only men—not very qualified men at that—in the mayoral primary.

There is plenty of opposition to this kind of thinking, from women as well as men. Having one’s traditional role questioned is not a very comfortable experience; perhaps especially for women, who have been able to remain children, and to benefit from work they did not and could not do. Marriage wouldn’t go straight down the drain, as traditionalists keep predicting. Women’s liberation might just hurry up some sort of companionate marriage that seems to be developing anyway.

But there is bound to be a time of, as social anthropologist Lionel Tiger puts it, “increased personal acrimony,” even if the revolution fails and women go right back to darning socks. (Masculinity doesn’t depend on the subservience of others, but it will take us a while to find that out.) It might be helpful to men—and good for women’s liberation—if they just keep repeating key phrases like, “No more guilt, No more alimony, Fewer boring women, Fewer bitchy women, No more tyrants with all human ambition confined to the home, No more ‘Jewish mothers’ transferring ambition to children, No more women trying to be masculine because it’s a Man’s World …” (and maybe one more round of “No more alimony”) until the acrimony has stopped.

Because the idea is, in the long run, that women’s liberation will be men’s liberation, too.",-2,http://nymag.com/news/politics/46802/
64,Steinem,Gloria,crfashionbook,"As far as we know, there's almost no such thing as effortless beauty. From facial treatments that leave your complexion dewy and luminous to the perfect winged eyeliner, experts reveal their most-trusted, insider hacks for CR's series, Beauty Secrets.

Bob Scott considers skincare the most important aspect of any beauty routine. After learning from makeup greats Pat McGrath, Kabuki, and Francois Nars, Scott racked up a clientele list consisting of supermodel Karlie Kloss, Gen-Z star Amandla Stenberg, and actress Padma Lakshmi. In addition to creating mesmerizing red carpet looks , Scott also specializes in brow shaping and shares skincare recommendations on Instagram stories.

""You can only makeup your skin to look so pretty as it is naturally,"" Scott tells CR. ""You can put a ton of stuff on your skin but it isn't gonna look great if you're not taking care of your skin underneath. Drink a lot of water, get a lot of sleep, and massage your face if you have the time. As long as you have good clean skin and a full brow, you can do whatever you want with makeup at the moment.""

Here, CR caught up with the makeup expert about the most coveted products for winter and what beauty trend Scott is loving on Instagram right now.

Instagram

What's your skincare routine?

""I try to be pretty minimal, and by minimal I mean lazy. I try to do as little as possible each night, addressing only what my skin needs that day. I double cleanse in the shower and it's only three or four steps total to clear everything off my skin. Before bed, I use a firming or restorative serum and then a moisturizer. I love the and snail gel. I was just in China this summer so I stocked up on snail gel because that makes your skin really plump and firm and heals it really quickly if you get a scratch or break out.""

What snail gel do you use?

""My sister turned me onto it when she found some in South Africa. It's literally the best thing in the world and makes your skin feel ten times thicker. I try to find a good one that doesn't have any other treatments in it. Often times they'll have other things in them that are brightening, which I don't like as much.""

Any holy grail items?

""My favorite staple products are clay masks. I use them with apple cider vinegar twice a month to really deep cleanse. It draws everything out of your skin in the days after and I really like the Borghese Mud Mask as well. I have a nice calming mask from Origins the sulfur and eucalyptus mask.""

What are five makeup products you're loving right now?

""I really love Urban Decay 24/7 Glide-On Eye Pencils. They changed my life; I use them every day, depending on the color. The Cle de Peau Translucent powder is so nice. I really love the Surratt Beauty Brow Pomade and the brush is a game-changer. The Makeup Forever Artist Color Pencils are sublime and the color is super-saturated and true to what you see. It goes on super creamy and lasts for a long time. The Bite Agave Lip Mask is absolutely a permanent part of my routine. I like the one in the tube that you squeeze out.""

Instagram

Do you do anything different for winter?

""I'll try to deal with my dark spots and acne scars with something that will even out my skin tone. I do that in the winter because there’s less sun, so its less likely to damage my skin from products. You cant use certain serums when you get a lot of sun, like ones with retinol. The last step is just moisturizing and I like rose oil because I don't mind looking shiny. For spot treatment, I found one called Provamed that's made in Thailand. It has salicylic acid and zinc, which helps gives your skin a boost. It literally cleared out a pimple in one day and it was $5.""

You've worked with Kloss on a lot of different looks, but she always goes back to the red lip. How would you describe her aesthetic?

""Her aesthetic is just relaxed, chic, easy, and no fuss. There's something about just throwing on a lip that anyone can do. Some people I know know how to do liner and lipstick in the back of a moving truck without a mirror. its just intrinsic, the way we put on our chapstick on while walking down the street. Only wearing a lipstick is very relatable. When I think of Karlie, I think of ease and simplicity.""

Instagram

What's your take on current makeup trends?

""Baking's got to go. Let your skin breathe. I don't get it, but to each their own. I would never apply someone else's rules to my routine and ultimately, do what makes you feel great. I just don't think that much makeup is necessary to look great. One [trend] I love is how much everyone's willing to go for makeup these days. There was a lull a few years ago where everyone was trying to go minimalist and that was really boring for me. I like that everyone's back into color and doing experimental things again, really looking at the artistry of makeup.""

What about all the different, crazy brows beauty gurus and influencers have been doing lately?

""I mean it's a slippery slope. I think the person looking at influencers for what brow shape will fit them best need to take it with a big grain of salt. They shouldn't covet one brow. I do brow shaping and someone might brow references for whose brows they admire, but it really comes down to their face and what suits them best. You can't take on a heavily drawn-on brow, put it on your face, and think it'll look good.""

65,Steinem,Gloria,msmagazine,"Out of sight may mean out of mind—and heart. For women in prison, this is the tragedy. For the rest of us, this invisibility keeps us from realizing how much women in prison may resemble and could be you and me.

Most women in prison are not a danger to society. About 82 percent have been charged with or convicted of non-violent crimes. Two-thirds have dependent children. More than a quarter of women behind bars haven’t yet had a trial, and are only there because they don’t have money for bail.

We at Ms. magazine decided to let women in prison know they are seen and valued. We started a program to benefit women in prison, and we extended it to include women in domestic violence shelters as well. Shelters can be nearly as isolating, often lacking libraries or any reading material, just as many prisons do.

That’s why the Ms. magazine Prison and Domestic Violence Shelter Program was created. This program is funded by charitable contributions earmarked for this purpose, and also by Ms. community members who buy an extra membership for a friend they don’t know.

Now, we send Ms. to 4,853 federal, state and county prisoners, and to hundreds of shelters. That’s a fraction of the total, but it’s a number we’re proud of and keep growing because of support from Ms. readers like you.

We see the importance of this work through the letters we receive—like this one from Katherine Holmes in Tennessee.

You have been a wonderful, bright spot in an otherwise bleak existence. The prison I am currently incarcerated at places copies of your magazine out in the library for the inmates. I spend as much time as possible in there, so I’m always one of the first to snag one.

Please make a tax-deductible contribution to the Ms. Prison and Domestic Violence Shelter Program. A generous supporter has also pledged to match all special year-end contributions to Ms. up to $10,000—so for every contribution to the program you give, we can send twice as many magazines to women in prisons and domestic violence shelters!

Let women on the inside know they are not alone. And let women in shelters know it’s unfair for them to be deprived of home while the criminal is free. Ms. and the women’s movement bring us support, facts, creativity, humor and a sense of community.

Pass it on.",-2,http://msmagazine.com/blog/2018/12/06/pass-give-gift-ms-women-prisons-domestic-violence-shelters/

67,Steinem,Gloria,crfashionbook,"As far as we know, there's no such thing as effortless beauty. From facial treatments that leave your complexion dewy and luminous to the perfect winged eyeliner, experts reveal their most-trusted, insider hacks for CR's new series, Beauty Secrets.

Radiant skin that looks that skin has always been the hallmark of Pat McGrath's makeup. The beauty maestro, whose mile-long resume encompasses a brief stint designing cosmetics for Giorgio Armani and helming her own eponymous brand, Pat McGrath Labs (now worth an estimated $1 billion), has inspired a feverish, cult following and month-long waitlists for her Skin Fetish highlighter and covetable Mattetrance lipstick. For McGrath, who first garnered acclaim during the early '90s, under the tenure of minimalist Jil Sander and maximalist John Galliano for her innovative use of color and experimentation with different textures and materials, emphasizing every model's individuality has always taken priority.

""It's an ultra, pretty look on the girls, but it's a really strong look and the eyeliner works for each of the girls' individual beauty,"" she says backstage of the beauty look for the Moschino x H&M's show on Wednesday night.

Using products from the H&M Beauty line, McGrath applied natural foundation on the models, concealing any blemishes and dark under-eye circles with H&M's Custom Concealer Trio, but also wanted to keep their skin as luminous as possible. The brows were groomed and then sculpted using brow liner and shaping gel to keep them in place. ""We did a gorgeous eyeliner on everyone, perfect glowing skin, a little bit of blush and highlighter on the cheeks, and the lips were outlined with balm and gloss,"" McGrath says.

For the eyes, McGrath tight-lined the models' lids (beauty vernacular for running eyeliner close to the lash line), dabbing bronze liner along the inner corners for extra glow. Individual eye shape was also taken into account for the graphic winged liner, with eyeliner flicks ranging from bold and thick to delicate and thin. As Gigi Hadid opened and Naomi Campbell closed the collection, outfitted in creative director Jeremy Scott's characteristic grandeur rife with popular culture references, the show was statement-making indeed. As McGrath aptly put it: ""It's really the girls as they are: tough and strong, but also glowing and beautiful.""

68,Steinem,Gloria,crfashionbook,"The '80s were a phenomenal time for aficionados of the gruesome, the gory, and the ghoulish. Both independent and mainstream cinematic offerings delivered chills that stayed with you long after you'd left the theater and curled up in bed, wondering about what might be lurking in your closet, or just outside your window. In honor of an era that took major risks with the malleable horror genre, we present a ranked rundown of the 50 best horror films of the '80s.

United Artists

50. Motel Hell (1980)

iTunes

A satiric take on some of its most famous genre predecessors, this wacko horror-comedy involves a motel-operating couple who sell smoked meats that are really their guests/victims, whom they bury up to their necks in a ""secret garden"" until they're ready to be harvested.

Universal Pictures

49. The Funhouse (1981)

iTunes

The Texas Chainsaw Massacre director Tobe Hooper goes back to the deformed-masked-psycho well with this entertaining 1981 B-movie, in which four teenagers decide to spend the night at a carnival—which already sounds like a bad idea—only to then have their fun ruined by a giant mutant freak with a penchant for violence.

Paramount Pictures

48. April Fool's Day (1986)

iTunes

Buoyed by one of the all-time great horror-movie posters, this 1986 cult classic hybridizes the slasher film and the manor house murder-mystery, detailing a group of college kids' weekend getaway that turns bloody when someone begins picking them off.

New Century Entertainment

47. The Gate (1987)

The big-screen debut of Stephen Dorff (at the age of 14), Tibor Takács film is a superior midnight movie about some kids who, left home alone for the weekend by their parents, discover that the construction worker-created hole in their backyard is actually a portal to Hell—and furthermore, that clues to how it works can be found in a heavy metal album's lyrics.

Paramount Pictures

46. My Bloody Valentine (1981)

George Mihalka's 1981 slasher film isn't particularly inventive, but it makes up for its rote premise (about kids being stalked by a vengeful fiend on Valentine's Day) with decent plotting, a memorable villain in a mining mask, and a level of violence that was deemed so extreme by the MPAA, the uncut version has still never been released.

New World Pictures

45. Children of the Corn (1984)

iTunes

Based on Stephen King's short story, this adolescent nightmare charts the ordeal of a couple that winds up in a Nebraska town where the kids—highlighted by the unforgettably sinister Malachai (Courtney Gains)—have decided that ritualistically killing adults is the best way to guarantee a good corn harvest.

Universal Pictures

44. An American Werewolf in London (1981)

iTunes

John Landis' seminal 1981 horror-comedy strikes just the right balance between the terrifying and the absurd through its story of two American backpackers in England who are attacked by a werewolf, leaving one dead and the other to await his lycanthropic fate. Frequently amusing, it also boasts groundbreaking monster-transformation effects by Rick Baker.

Image Entertainment

43. Bad Taste (1987)

Peter Jackson's splatter-ific calling card, this gonzo 1987 effort is nominally concerned with a small New Zealand town under siege from aliens, but it's really about the insanely gory, over-the-top B-movie special effects that Jackson created on his own.

United Artists

42. Child's Play (1988)

iTunes

Tom Holland's franchise-starting 1988 hit tapped into the underlying creepiness of kids' playthings with its story of a serial killer who transfers his soul into a popular doll, and then attempts to leapfrog back into a young boy's body—a loopy idea that's largely sold by the design of Chucky, and by Brad Dourif's voicework for the villain.

United Artists

41. Pumpkinhead (1988)

iTunes

Special effects maestro Stan Winston's directorial debut is a sturdy supernatural revenge saga about an Appalachian mountain man (Lance Henriksen) who, with the aid of a backwoods witch, conjures the legendary (and magnificent-looking) Pumpkinhead demon to kill those who murdered his son—a decision that ultimately comes back to haunt him.

TriStar Pictures

40. Silent Night, Deadly Night (1984)

Amazon

One of the most traumatizing horror movies of the era (especially if you were (un)lucky enough to see it at an early age), this scuzzy slasher film concerns a young boy who witnesses his parents' brutal murder at the hands of a lunatic in a Santa Claus costume, and then years later turns into a likeminded killer.

Universal Pictures

39. Halloween III: Season of the Witch (1982)

iTunes

The only Halloween film to not feature Michael Myers—it was intended to turn the franchise into more of an anthology-style series—Season of the Witch (about a conspiracy involving Halloween masks) remains a uniquely unsettling stand-alone film in an E.C. Comics-by-way-of-John-Carpenter tradition.

Greycat Films

38. Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer (1986)

iTunes

The film that launched the career of Michael Rooker, John McNaughton's seminal 1986 serial-killer film takes a gritty, no-frills docudrama approach to its story (based on real-life convict Henry Lee Lucas) about a psycho and his partner-in-crime acting on their murderous impulses.

Paramount Pictures

37. Pet Sematary (1989)

iTunes

It may not quite live up to its Stephen King source material, but Mary Lambert's 1989 adaptation nonetheless captures the overarching don't-make-deals-with-the-devil mood of its story—about a man who uses a mystical pet cemetery to bring his toddler son back from the grave—while also climaxing with a depiction of childlike evil that three decades later remains downright disturbing.

Columbia Pictures

36. Fright Night (1985)

iTunes

Tom Holland's stellar horror-comedy pits a young suburban teenager (William Ragsdale) and his midnight-movie TV host idol (Roddy McDowall) against a new next-door neighbor (Chris Sarandon) who, it turns out, is actually a bloodsucking creature of the night.

United Film Distribution Company

35. Day of the Dead (1985)

The third installment in George A. Romero's pioneering zombie series is a scary and smart story about a group of post-apocalyptic survivors in an underground bunker who find themselves increasingly at each other's throats, all while a team of scientists attempt to find a cure for the plague through research that includes domesticating a brain-muncher known as Bub.

Cecchi Gori/CDI

34. Opera (1987)

No one stages murder quite like Dario Argento, who continued to cement his reputation as the master of the giallo (a particular strain of lurid Italian thriller) with this saga of an opera understudy who becomes the lead in a new production of Macbeth, only to then be terrorized by one of Argento's trademark, never-seen-except-his-gloved-hands fiends.

Embassy Pictures

33. The Howling (1981)

iTunes

Joe Dante's contribution to the werewolf genre was this 1981 gem (co-written by John Sayles), which tracks Dee Wallace's TV news reporter—still traumatized by her run-in with a serial killer—to a remote resort where she finds herself in all sorts of full moon-triggered trouble.

New World Pictures

32. The Stuff (1985)

Fringe auteur Larry Cohen delivers an amusingly horrific satire of American appetites with this underappreciated B-movie about a mysterious yogurt-like diet snack that becomes a national sensation. There's just one side-effect: The Stuff turns consumers into zombie-like monsters.

United Artists

31. Cannibal Holocaust (1980)

iTunes

With all due respect to its equally revolting kindred spirits (Cannibal Ferox in particular), Ruggero Deodato's infamous Cannibal Holocaust still stands as one of the most morally repulsive—and, admittedly, effective—horror movies of the decade, courtesy of extreme violence that was either thought to be real (involving humans) or was real (involving animals).

TriStar Pictures

30. The Hitcher (1986)

Further emphasizing The Texas Chainsaw Massacre's point that picking up strangers on the side of the road is a very bad idea, Robert Harmon's 1986 thriller offers up Rutger Hauer as a psycho hitchhiker who makes life a living hell for nice-guy driver C. Thomas Howell.

Associated Film Distribution

29. The Changeling (1980)

George C. Scott brings a measure or gravitas to this haunted-house tale, about a composer who, still mourning the death of his wife and child, moves across the country to an eerie estate that boasts a ghost who likes to play ball.

Warner Bros.

28. Creepshow (1982)

iTunes

Inspired by the macabre tales of E.C. Comics, this Stephen King-George A. Romero collaboration is a phenomenal anthology, highlighted by a short in which Leslie Nielsen gets revenge on Ted Danson by burying him up to his neck in sand right in front of the ocean's tide line.

New Century Vista Film Company

27. The Stepfather (1987)

Long before he was stranded on Lost, Terry O'Quinn was a nutcase weaseling his way into new families as a stepfather—and then going off the bloody deep end like a cross between Jack Torrance and Norman Bates when things don't conform to his Reagan-era values.

Fulvia Film

26. The Beyond (1981)

Famed Italian horror director Lucio Fulci's The Beyond is a gruesome head-trip about a Louisiana hotel that contains the doorway to Hell, and the new owner who unwittingly opens it, thus instigating all sorts of nasty, hallucinatory Satanic madness that concludes with one of the great shots in all of '80s horror cinema.

Warner Bros.

25. Creepshow 2 (1987)

iTunes

George A. Romero may not have directed this sequel to his anthology hit, but he and Stephen King nonetheless had a guiding hand in its production—and in making it better than its predecessor, thanks to the strikingly sinister tale, ""The Raft.""

Universal Pictures

24. Prince of Darkness (1987)

iTunes

More than a little bit bonkers—and better off for it—John Carpenter's severely undervalued Prince of Darkness stars the director's Halloween lead Donald Pleasance as a priest who believes that a cylinder of green goo is actually Satan.

New World Pictures

23. Hellraiser (1987)

iTunes

Clive Barker paved the way for S&M-style horror with this adaptation of his novella The Hellbound Heart, about a mysterious puzzle box that functions as the portal to a sadomasochistic dimension ruled by a race of nasty ""Cenobite"" creatures led by the porcupine-y Pinhead.

Paramount Pictures

22. Friday the 13th (1980)

iTunes

The one that truly started it all, Sean S. Cunningham's Friday the 13th may not feature Jason Voorhees as its actual villain (he wouldn't even don his trademark hockey mask until 1982's Friday the 13th Part 3), but it remains the template upon which a legion of subsequent slasher films were based.

Analysis Film Releasing Corporation

21. Maniac (1980)

iTunes

The first of two William Lustig features to make this list, 1980's Maniac is a deranged and decidedly unsettling exploitation saga about a crazed loner with a fondness for decorating department store mannequins with the scalps of his many innocent victims.

Empire International Pictures

20. Re-Animator (1985)

iTunes

Stuart Gordon's loose H.P. Lovecraft adaptation is a delirious Frankensteinian riff about a demented medical student (Jeffrey Combs, in a role that rightly turned him into a B-movie icon) who discovers the means of bringing things back from the dead—albeit with a few unexpected, unpleasant side effects.

Columbia Pictures

19. Happy Birthday to Me (1981)

iTunes

A wackadoo genre work marked by its bizarre methods of murder and its even more bizarre narrative twists and turns, Happy Birthday to Me is the rare slasher film that constantly keeps one on its toes—up to its surprising final revelations.

New World Pictures

18. The Slumber Party Massacre (1982)

Rife with all sorts of psychosexual imagery—none better than the poster-ready sight of cowering women spied through the legs of a man wielding a phallic power drill—this slasher-film anomaly ultimately proves a distinctly feminist (and fight-the-male-power) take on the genre.

United Film Distribution Company

17. Sleepaway Camp (1983)

iTunes

An obvious descendant of Friday the 13th, Robert Hiltzik's Sleepaway Camp is an above-average suspense story about kids being slaughtered at an overnight camp by a mysterious assailant—until, that is, its superbly shocking finale, which stands as the decade's biggest (and best) horror blindside.

New Line Cinema

16. The Evil Dead (1981)

iTunes

Sam Raimi's breakthrough indie set the stage for the director's particularly rambunctious style, as well as established the peerless comedic-hero persona of star Bruce Campbell.

Shapiro-Glickenhaus Entertainment

15. Maniac Cop (1988)

Featuring one of the all-time great taglines (""You Have the Right to Remain Silent…Forever""), William Lustig and Larry Cohen's Maniac Cop follows a traditional return-of-the-repressed formula via its portrait of a vengeful resurrected cop who comes back from the great beyond in order to punish the corrupt officials who locked him up with those he'd previously put away.

14. Poltergeist

iTunes

Regardless of whether you believe Poltergeist was helmed by credited director Tobe Hooper or (as rumors have long suggested) producer Steven Spielberg, this TV-phobic haunted-house thriller delivers unforgettable scares and a classic horror-cinema line (""They're heeeere""), as well as a rather touching portrait of the strength of the American nuclear family.

Warner Bros.

13. Gremlins (1984)

iTunes

One of Amblin Entertainment's finest productions, this darkly humorous holiday horrorshow (directed by Joe Dante, executive produced by Steven Spielberg, and written by Chris Columbus) revolves around a strange furry pet named Gizmo who, if touched by water or fed after midnight, sprouts hordes of maniacally evil Gremlins.

20th Century Fox

12. The Fly (1986)

iTunes

David Cronenberg's big-budget body-horror saga (a loose adaptation of George Langelaan's story and the ensuing Vincent Price film) details the efforts of a scientist (Jeff Goldblum) to create a teleportation device, and the hideous consequences of his experiment when a fly accidentally gets into his machine.

DeLaurentiis Entertainment Group

11. Near Dark (1987)

Kathryn Bigelow's 1987 film is an unbelievably moody, stylish vampire-Western hybrid that's as romantic as it is tense, and features a number of cast members (Lance Henriksen, Jenette Goldstein, and Bill Paxton) from her future husband (er, ex-husband) James Cameron's Aliens.

Universal Pictures

10. Videodrome (1983)

iTunes

A year after Poltergeist suggested that television was a disruptive force in the American family, David Cronenberg suggested that it was a conduit toward a ""new flesh"" in Videodrome, a madness-infected film about a Canadian TV station owner (James Woods) who stumbles upon—to his eternal, hellish-hallucinatory dismay—a broadcast of red-room torture.

Titanus

9. Tenebre (1982)

Dario Argento's best film is this superlative giallo from 1982, in which an American writer, while in Rome to promote his new book, becomes embroiled in a police case about a serial killer whose methods may be modeled after those found in his novel. Few horror films have ever been this vividly awash in issues of twisted sexuality, voyeurism, gender power dynamics, mirror-image doubling, and the role between artist and spectator.

AVCO Embassy Pictures

8. The Fog (1980)

iTunes

John Carpenter's follow-up to 1978's Halloween is an old-fashioned ghost story about drowned mariners who return to exact revenge on the descendants of those who lured them to their death—a tale that's elevated by Carpenter's unparalleled mastery of widescreen visuals.

Cannon Releasing

7. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Part 2 (1986)

How do you follow up one of cinema's all-time scariest films? If you're Tobe Hooper, you take things in a decidedly more comedic direction, and in the process, deliver a second helping of Texas Chainsaw Massacre mayhem that's as goofy as it is grisly. ""Dog will hunt!""

New Line Cinema

6. Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn (1987)

Sam Raimi's Evil Dead sequel is, in large part, a big-budget remake-cum-overhaul of his 1981 original, marked by better special effects, more outrageous camerawork, and a truly larger-than-life performance by ably chinned leading man, Bruce Campbell.

New Line Cinema

5. A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984)

iTunes

Wes Craven turned Freddy Krueger into one of modern movies' great bogeymen with his dreamlike 1984 hit, in which a child-abusing evildoer returns from the grave to punish his killers by attacking their children through their dreams.

Limelight International

4. Possession (1981)

The craziest possession film ever—and potentially the craziest film ever—Andrzej Zulawski's relationship drama charts the disintegration of a marriage between a spy (Sam Neill) and his wife (Isabelle Adjani), who's soon sleeping with a tentacled monster. In the signature scene, Adjani writhes around a subway station floor while miscarrying. As I've said before, it has to be seen to be believed.

20th Century Fox

3. Aliens (1986)

iTunes

For this sequel to Ridley Scott's 1979 original, James Cameron shifts the focus away from horror and toward action, though that doesn't change the fact that his continuation of Ripley's (Sigourney Weaver) battle against the alien xenomorphs is an unforgettable monster-movie ride.

Universal Pictures

2. The Thing (1982)

iTunes

Far surpassing its 1951 Howard Hawks source material, John Carpenter generates nerve-rattling anxiety through his science-fiction-y horror story about a group of Antarctic researchers whose snowbound situation turns lethal when they're visited by an alien who can take human shape—and thus co-exist with them in hiding. Come for the creepy creature effects and non-stop unease, stay for Kurt Russell's first-class performance.

Warner Bros.

1. The Shining (1980)

iTunes

Never mind that Stephen King doesn't love it. Bolstered by Jack Nicholson's unhinged performance as a father increasingly determined to off his family, and by direction that creates an overpowering sense of dread in every methodical pan and tracking shot, Stanley Kubrick's haunted-hotel classic is the pinnacle of 1980s horror.

69,Steinem,Gloria,nymag,"From the December 23, 1968 issue of New York Magazine.

Toward the end of Gore Vidal’s gossipy, underrated novel, Washington, D.C., a fictional girl named Elizabeth Watress meets President Truman at a Democratic Convention. She is tall, beautiful and well-bred. (In fact, her whispery voice, a divorced father who “played polo and drank heavily,” a public manner “simulating fear and delight in equal proportions,” and her eventual marriage to a handsome young Presidential-hopeful have led a lot of people to think she is based on Jacqueline Bouvier.) So it surprises Clay Overbury, her eventual husband, when she gazes after little homespun Harry Truman with whom she has just shaken hands, and exclaims, “‘He looks so sexy!’”

“‘Sexy? Good God, you are crazy. That’s the President.’”

“‘And that’s what I meant,’ said Elizabeth evenly, and Clay laughed. Not many girls were so honest.”

If Harry Truman had pursued this advantage (he didn’t; even Gore Vidal doesn’t go that far), he certainly would have known that it wasn’t his beautiful soul and/or body that attracted her. Men wise in the ways of power understand its sexual uses as well. But there are a lot of men, and a surprising number of women, who believe the sexual segregationist argument that women aren’t interested in power at all; that something in their genes makes them prefer to be ordered about. While this is true of individual women—and some individual men: think of all those who seek out domineering wives or job hierarchies to take orders from—it turns out to be no more fundamentally true than all the other past myths: that women enjoyed sex less than men, for instance, or that Negroes were dependent creatures who didn’t want power either.

A century ago when Henry Adams wrote Democracy, still the only truthful novel about American politics, he understood that women wanted power, and had quite good instincts for using it. But objective truth and social truth are two different things. As a shy pretty Barnard girl explained, surprised to find herself braving police cordons outside a Columbia building, “I guess I’m just finding out that women are people.”

New York is probably one of the better places to discover it. Girls come here, after all, for somewhat the same reason that Negroes and homosexuals do: to escape the roles dictated by their background and Conventional Wisdom, and discover what they can do on their own. Frequently, it turns out that they, too, want to see tangible and intangible proofs that they make a difference in the world, that they are unique and valuable people. Power may be a dirty word, especially among New-Left-through-Hippies who fear that it must be manipulative and bad. (Though they have no double standard. Power is bad for anyone, male or female, and “manipulative” is the worst word in the New Left lexicon.) But vitality and a desire to change things are its ingredients, and the under-thirty generation has those in better supply than anyone else. They may not call it “power,” but they are certainly seeking to take control away from the Establishment.

Nobody seems to be denying the biological differences, not the Barnard girl, nor those few women in New York who already wield some power. (“You lose interest in everything else for a month or so before childbirth, and several months after,” explained a former State Department official, now a political science professor. “Nature takes care of that. But the women I see who continue that singlemindedness year after year because they think they ought to—they end up being a burden to the child.”) It’s just that the difference is less all-pervasive than it was in the under-populated day when women had to have a lot of children (and spend all their time running a complicated household) if a few were to survive.

Now, motherhood, like sex, dominates a woman’s life only by its absence; nothing else may go very well without it, but once that basic need is being fulfilled, there’s still a lot of life and interest with no place to go.

But the fact is, even in New York, that the great majority of women don’t have the training or opportunity or courage to get and use power on their own. Probably, they’ve been brought up to believe that such ambitions weren’t feminine. (And if any group is told its limitations long enough, pretty soon they turn out to be true.) Those who hold jobs of any influence—unless they’re totally concerned with makeup, clothes, cooking, and the like, and have no men in the hierarchy under them—are eventually gossiped about as pushy and masculine even now. (“What can I do?” said an unmarried representative of a fashion house who is often thought to be a lesbian. “I can’t sleep with every man who thinks that just to disprove it.”) It’s the same kind of emotional blackmail that used to keep men out of the arts, and push them into various forms of social violence—hunting, street fights, sports and wars—whether they liked it or not.

To accuse someone of not being a “real man” or “real woman” is a potent social weapon in preserving the status quo. During each war, women discover that they can do “masculine” jobs and wield power without losing their femininity, and after each war, they are sent back home (though there are always some who won’t go: wars have changed women’s status more than any suffrage movement) by men who return with standards unchanged.

Even those who keep their jobs are often apologetic about it, insisting that they just work so the family can have a few more luxuries; an easy way to avoid disapproval that might come from admitting they liked the independence, and even the power. In the women’s-rights movement, one of the few instances of taking this emotional blackmail head-on came from a distinguished Negro freedwoman named Sojourner Truth. “Nobody ever helps me into carriages or over puddles, or gives me the best place,” she said, letting a male critic have it between the eyes, “and ain’t I a woman? I have ploughed and planted and gathered into barns—and ain’t I a woman? I have borne thirteen children, and seen most of ’em sold into slavery, and I cried out with my mother’s grief—and ain’t I a woman?”

That was more than 100 years ago, and now, women are defensive about commanding office staffs, much less ploughing.

In fact, they don’t like to admit the barrier between men’s jobs (those with power) and women’s jobs (those without). It’s sort of embarrassing, and may lead to such dread accusations as being a feminist. (An associate producer of a television talk show, who has now seen five not-very-well-qualified men promoted to be her producers, one by one, while her capabilities are ignored, complained to a station executive. “He thought I was getting ‘women’s rightsy,’” she said sorrowfully. “Couldn’t he at least say human rightsy?”) But in New York, where hierarchies are probably more modern and flexible than the rest of the country, the barrier still exists. It seems impossible to find a profit-making organization of any size that doesn’t discourage women, subtly or not so subtly, from aspiring to positions of any power.

In banks, female “senior tellers” and male “vice-presidents” often do exactly the same job, but salaries and promotional possibilities are as different as the titles. At Time Inc., men write, edit and get promoted; women research and then research some more. Television has women with “associate” and “assistant” in their titles, but almost none (outside public service and kiddie programs) are allowed to be full-fledged writers, producers, and directors. The New York Times employs more women than Negroes (“Only because,” said one disgruntled newswoman, “we have a Women’s Page and no Negro Page”), but they are no where to be seen in Editorial Board lunches or the decision-making process. Women are illustrators but rarely art directors. J. Walter Thompson and other big advertising agencies don’t encourage women account executives “because the client might not like it”; the advertising successes of Mary Wells and June Trahey not withstanding.

Politics is probably the worst of all. Even Robert Kennedy couldn’t help Ronnie Eldridge, an eminently capable young politician who was then a District Leader, into the job of New York County Leader once occupied by Carmine de Sapio. Kennedy thought she could handle it well, but the Reform Democrats hesitated, largely because they didn’t want a woman.

Sometimes, women do well outside an organization, or by starting their own business, but in general, they just aren’t considered eligible for power. Caroline Bird, who has done the best book on this barrier, Born Female: The High Cost of Keeping Women Down, comes to the conclusion that powerful women—like Mary Wells or Judge Constance Baker Motley; or even Geraldine Stutz of Bendel’s or Mildred Custin of Bonwit’s, though fashion merchandising is traditionally a field more open to women—have gained their positions because of loopholes and idiosyncrasies in the system, not because of any liberated attitude in the system itself.

In 1944 when he wrote The American Dilemma, Gunnar Myrdal added a parallel between women and Negroes. Both groups, he noted, had been slowed down by the same crippling stereotypes: smaller brains, childlike nature, limited ambition, limited skills, roles as sex-objects-only, and so forth. Neither group liked the comparison very much, but now that Negroes are throwing off these stereotypes so insidious that they themselves had sometimes believed them, women are beginning to think twice about the similarities, in kind if not degree.

Of course, the big difference is mobility; even in work, women have more leeway, and socially, their mobility is almost limitless. Sponge-like, they acquire the status (even, temporarily, some of the power) of the man they’re with; so much so that it’s part of every girl’s experience to be treated as two entirely different people just because she’s changed escorts.

To make this acquisition of the ruling group’s privilege and power more or less permanent, all women have to do is marry it. The method is simple, socially approved and sometimes even happy. Women have been doing it for years. Of course, this practice makes for June-January matches: figuring out a man’s power-potential when he’s still in his 20s isn’t easy, and an important older man usually expects a wife to be young and to look good; that’s her part of the bargain. (New York is full of this sort of marriage, from the short bald men and tall blonde wives in the Stage Delicatessen to distinguished lawyers and Vassar graduates on Sutton Place. Washington would be even fuller, if only politicians could get divorced.) Marrying for power is slightly more evolved than marrying for money and doesn’t get boring nearly as fast. The wife must have had some dim appreciation of her husband’s work, after all, in order to figure out how powerful he was in the first place. They may even be working together, though never on an equal basis. (Secretaries marry executives, students marry professors, researchers marry television producers; it’s a giant step, an Instant Promotion.) Only Helen Gurley Brown has grasped and openly written about the idea that office proximity is to the making of “good” marriages what social connections and dowries used to be.

The bargain, if both parties are clear about it, may work out well. The man gets the pleasure of a new and admiring audience for his power displays, and the wife has the exhilarating experience of being on the Inside; a place she would never be allowed by herself.

Moreover, she herself becomes a power symbol: youth and beauty well displayed. Sexually and even financially, her husband may view her that way. The sales people at David Webb, the jewelers who have a genteel air of having seen everything, nod solemnly at arguments like (one woman to another hesitating over $18,000 earrings). “It’s a wife’s duty to be a showcase for her husband’s power and success.”

Unfortunately, the man—believing the convention that women aren’t interested in power—may assume she loves him for himself. There isn’t much excuse for this considering that he has probably used power calculatingly in order to attract her. (It’s a standard part of the New York mating game for men to have girls pick them up at the office, whereupon they push every button and issue orders to every employee in sight. Lunch in executive dining rooms, police escorts on the way to the theatre, celebrities produced for all occasions, a personal wine cellar at one or several restaurants: all this heavy artillery may be brought out for the wooing.) But it still comes as an unpleasant surprise to many men when they produce three Broadway flops in a row and their wives’ affection cools; or when “the other man” turns out to be someone older, less attractive, but more powerful; or when they retire to long-¬anticipated lives of comfort and leisure, and their wives want a divorce.

They are even surprised, if not quite so unpleasantly, when their wives try to exert power through them. The simplest form is the marital “we” (as in “we just bought a big British company,” or “Bernstein is doing our symphony,” or “we knew we should have re-written the second act”), even though the wife has had nothing to do with it. This taking of unearned credit is as ridiculous (especially when spoken by the 22-year-old wife of some hard-working man) as it is popular.

A more combative form is two such noncontributing wives competing, with or without subtlety, about whose husband is the more powerful. The air at chic restaurants is thick with such gamesmanship every day when ladies lunch. (This bears a great unconscious resemblance to nannies and other servants who compete about their families’ wealth; except the servants have usually worked harder and deserve to brag more.)

Finally, there is the wife who tries to make her husband’s power her own, who wants to select the companies he buys, or the scripts he produces, or the political strategy he campaigns with. She is much more admirable (at least she’s trying to earn some of the credit she’s taking), but if ability doesn’t go along with desire to influence, she may be the most destructive in the end. There are always stories in New York of talented husbands who haven’t got this or that job because they come as a package with interfering wives. The name of one movie producer gets groans from directors. His wife insists on showing up to interfere at all production meetings.

The wife looking for power and the husband who has it are dependent on a lot of outside circumstances at best. But the difference between public and private conclusions about women and power comes out in odd ways.

In Washington, for instance, it was a much-discussed fact that many of the men around President Kennedy got divorced when the Administration ended. Most men assumed that the husbands had wanted out all along, but refrained from leaving because the publicity would be bad. Many of their wives, who worry about what their lives would be like should their husbands leave, assumed the same. But several of the hostesses and one woman high up in the State Department—some of the few in Washington with identities not dependent on marriage—wondered if the wives hadn’t had something to do with it. “Why stay?” as one hostess said. “The Kennedy court was obviously their high point. Better get out and find some other interesting man fast, because it’s going to be straight downhill.”

Few wives, even if they have made power marriages, are that clear-eyed about it. Going along with the women-aren’t-interested-in-power theory, they may assume that they couldn’t possibly be, and therefore the attraction they feel must be something else. Power translates into sex, and admiration into love. But power and sex are only the same in anticipation, so the wife—who still feels her own power urge satisfied through her husband—may find herself having an affair with a more ordinary man, without any thought of leaving her husband. That’s the lady married to a bigwig who goes out with her garage attendant on the side.

If she loves him, or is convinced that she does, she often finds herself jealous of the work whose results attracted her in the first place. Political wives who rarely see their husbands except on national holidays and campaign planes; business wives who get tired of having all birthday and Christmas gifts selected by secretaries; every wife of a powerful man who finds she can get anything except his attention: life and fiction are full of them.

“Never marry an important man,” said a girl who observed all this from her vantage point as secretary in the White House. “Go out with them or have affairs with them, but find some other kind of husband.”

According to Alice Roosevelt Longworth, even Eleanor Roosevelt didn’t always enjoy her position. On hearing of her husband’s first election to the Presidency, she is supposed to have run from the room in tears, and said, “Now, I’ve lost my identity.” One New York woman complains that people she has had dinner with don’t recognize her the next day in the street without her husband’s famous face. A woman who marries a powerful man gets an instant identity all right, but it’s his.

Still, acquiring power through men remains the only sure-fire acceptable way. Margaret Mead notes that this society approves women’s power only if it’s been inherited in some sense, and that widows of admired men are therefore the only women leaders to be widely accepted. Inheriting a seat in Congress is liked, but winning it is not. The activism of Eleanor Roosevelt won more affection and less resentment after the death of F.D.R.

Even Jacqueline Kennedy, regarded as ornamental but frivolous before her husband’s death, got all kinds of serious suggestions that she become Ambassador to France, or even Johnson’s Vice President, immediately after. But as she was quoted in a New York newspaper profile, “There are two kinds of women: those who want power in the world, and those who want power in bed”; the clear implication being that she was the latter. And, almost equally clear, that she disapproved of the former.

Some women solve the problem of being limited to one husband’s identity by having several. One New York widow is said to have married once for money, once for power, and once for social standing, so that she emerged, if not as herself, at least as the author of an anthology. She fell somewhere between Mrs. Kennedy’s categories, but then so do most women. Sexual power may be enough by itself. (As in the case of girls who enjoy conquering powerful men, and thereby making them pathetic and human. “It’s hard to explain,” said one television actress, who was having an affair with a much-feared Texas business executive, “but seeing him pad around in shorts to bring me breakfast, or knowing he’s switching the schedules of millions of dollars and hundreds of lives just so he can get to New York and see me—that gives me some feeling of accomplishment.”) Or it may be a direct path to worldly power, as in the case of many girls who marry for it, or get jobs and favors as the result of affairs. But it’s rare that the excitement and rewards are totally detached from the outside world.

“Sex,” said an English historian, “is woman’s only path to power.” As women’s options increase, that’s not much more true than, “The way to a man’s heart is through his stomach.” But it is likely that, as long as power is seen by some women as a peculiarly male attribute which only men can confer, they will go right on confusing sex with power.

It’s no accident that politicians have to devote less time and trouble to the seduction of women than anyone, possibly including male movie stars. And it’s no accident that political conventions, not to mention White House workers of almost any rank, are surrounded by dozens of otherwise well-bred girls who are strangely willing.

As Arthur Koestler wrote, quoting a European woman who was interested only in important men, “It’s like going to bed with history.”

The power-through-men theory can produce very constructive marriages and good partnerships. One of the best examples is Clementine Churchill, who simply made a decision when she married young Winston, not yet a leader of any kind: she would devote herself to him totally, to the exclusion of any separate life of her own, and chances of the couple’s success in the world would depend totally on his tastes and decisions. Mrs. Leland Hayward, an adopted New Yorker who was married to Sir Winston’s son, the late Randolph Churchill, believes that this investment of time and loyalty had a lot to do with Churchill’s later power and success.

“Clemmie never did many of the things that other wives enjoyed—dinner parties, going out with her own friends; anything—unless it happened to be part of her husband’s life, too. His friends were hers, his enemies were her enemies. I think that unquestioning support did a lot for him, especially during the middle years when his career seemed to be over. I wonder about a man like Duff Cooper [a diplomat and a wartime Cabinet officer]. He was very intelligent, very talented. His wife was a good wife, but she wasn’t interested in politics, and so tended to have her own dinner parties and activities. Would he have been more of a force had his wife been like Clemmie? I don’t know; it seems possible.”

But, as Mrs. Hayward also observed, this kind of devotion doesn’t always get rewarded these days. “Too many first wives,” she said, “find themselves exchanged for younger ones when the lean years are over.”

Certainly, the number of divorces right out of medical school, with men no longer interested in the girls who worked to help put them through, has become a kind of joke around colleges. Very few women find themselves married to a man of potential power, much less greatness, whether they can recognize it or not. But this kind of partnership is still possible, and may contribute to the rise of a powerful man.

Whether out of love and devotion or cynicism and necessity, the truth is that most women will have to exercise their much-denied but very much alive instincts for power through men for a while yet, at least until the generation now in college starts taking over the control centers. Young girls are refusing to be emotionally blackmailed into domesticity in the same way that boys no longer fall for the real-men-go-out-and-fight tradition, but the change will take a long time.

Because women don’t have power in this country or this city except as consumers. (Which is exactly parallel to a voter’s power to run Washington. There is a choice between candidates, or among brand names, but very little influence on what’s presented for that choice.) Or as a nuisance. (Large numbers can occasionally make enough noise so that men act just so the noise will stop.) The myth of economic Momism that grew up in the ’50s—based on women’s new consumer power, and the rise of Madison Avenue—is, when it comes to real power and control, just that: a myth. Women make, have, and inherit a great deal less money, and what they do have (even the greatly exaggerated number of rich widows) is usually controlled by men. They do very poorly at getting into the knowledge elite. (Nine per cent of professors are women; six per cent of doctors, much less than in so-called underdeveloped countries; three per cent of all lawyers; and one per cent of engineers. Professional schools habitually discourage women, and so do most of the teachers and career advisors they meet along the way.) Of the income elite, only five per cent of all people receiving $10,000 a year or more are women, and that includes the famous rich widows.

Of the prestige elite as taken from Who’s Who in America, they are six per cent. Of the business power elite (executives of corporations and the like), they are four per cent. And when it comes to elected officials, judges, and so forth, the percentage is almost nil.

Perhaps if women had more encouragement, more opportunity to gain power on their own, there would be less of the bitterness and hypocrisy that comes from using men for subversive ends. If society stopped telling girls that men can and should hand them their total identity on a silver platter, wives wouldn’t be so resentful when it didn’t happen. And ambitious women could relax, and look for pleasure instead of power in bed.

Men ought to encourage the idea. It might take a load off all of us.",-2,http://nymag.com/news/features/50175/

Legendary feminist and human-rights advocate Gloria Steinem takes a rare step into the spotlight with an upcoming play and movie about her exceptional life.

Laura Brown: Gloria! Am I correct in assuming you’re as busy as ever?

Gloria Steinem: I always thought the idea about age is that life gets less complicated, right? Or simpler. No, it’s cumulative, it turns out [laughs]. Who knew? Nobody told me.

LB: With the new play, Gloria: A Life, there will be another you. I was thinking about what it must be like to witness a play about your life and be portrayed by someone else.

GS: Kathy Najimy, who is a friend, director, and actor, said to me around three years ago, “You should do a one-woman play.” I said, “Oh, be serious now.” I couldn’t imagine! [laughs] But she went to see Daryl Roth, and Daryl — a very wise, experienced producer — said yes. We did a few days of workshop from which I learned that I could not possibly do it. I mean, it’s taken me to past 40 to feel OK about getting up and talking publicly because I’ve been two things in my life: a dancer and a writer. I went to a speech teacher when I was first trying to speak in public, and she said, “Of course you can’t talk; you’ve chosen both of those [professions] because you don’t want to talk.” She ended up giving up on me.

LB: You’re kidding! So you were 40 at this point?

GS: Yes. Clearly, it was very difficult then [in 1974] to get any accurate or serious articles published about the women’s movement, but since that was what my column in New York magazine was about, I received invitations to speak. So I asked my friend Dorothy Pitman Hughes, who ran one of the first nonsexist multiracial childcare centers and was a great organizing person, if she would come with me. So that was the beginning, and when she had a baby and wanted to stay home more, Florynce Kennedy and I [traveled] together for years, and then Margaret Sloan-Hunter.

LB: Did you get stage fright?

GS: Yes, the physical manifestation was that I lost all my saliva, and each tooth got a little angora sweater on it [laughs]. But to do it together was comforting because I realized that if I totally fucked up, there was somebody else there. Also, especially with Florynce, I had to go first anyway because I would’ve been an anticlimax after her. And we didn’t think, “Oh, it’s good if one white and one black woman do it together.” It just happened, and it became apparent how important that was, especially in the South.

LB: Right, to be represented. When was the first time the training wheels came off?

GS: Well, I don’t know that the training wheels came off [laughs]. Although, after a while, I can do it by myself. But the most enjoyable part, which relates to the play, has always been the audience discussion. Act 2 [of Gloria] is not a talk back about the play; it is a talking circle.

LB: Because that’s how you’ve engaged with people throughout your life.

GS: It always works. And in the rare case in which someone gets up and talks for too long, someone else will say, “Sit down.” It takes care of itself. I have such faith in it, and it is our original form of government. We’ve been sitting around campfires for millions of years for a reason. There will be different organizers who come in to be part of the talking circle. I’ll do it in person, onstage, when I can.

LB: How does it feel to be outwardly represented? Christine Lahti is playing you in Gloria, and Julianne Moore is playing you in Julie Taymor’s upcoming film, My Life on the Road, based on your book. Is that strange at all?

GS: Christine is more animated than I am, so I don’t know, but whatever it is, I have faith. We both are also from the Midwest and came to a sense of ourselves later because of our age. She’s younger than me, but still.

LB: Do you remember a moment or an experience when you were “in your bones”?

GS: Well, I was always rebelling in a sense in that I didn’t get married to the man I was engaged to. I went to India instead of getting a job. I was individually rebelling, but I was hoping no one would notice. I assumed I was going to have to do what I was supposed to do in order to have children and lead someone else’s life, so I was just putting it off.

LB: Right, you’re like, “Hey, if I go to another land, no one will ask me.”

GS: I also felt like an outsider from this system, and my family was very unconventional too. They were also rebelling secretly, I think, hoping no one would notice [laughs]. So it didn’t come together until I went to cover an abortion hearing for my column in New York magazine [in 1969]. The New York state legislature had organized a hearing on whether to liberalize New York state abortion laws. And they had invited 14 men and one nun to testify.

LB: Hmm ... something’s missing there.

GS: So a group of women had gathered together to talk about the real experience of having to enter a criminal underground in order to get an abortion and what had happened to them. At that point one in three American women, and now one in four, needed an abortion at some point in their lives. Why is it criminal and dangerous, and why are we not talking about it? It was the first time I’d experienced women talking about something that only happened to women.

LB: And in every single pragmatic way you can look at it, it was illogical.

GS: It also was a good place to start, because it is true as you pursue this that it’s all about controlling reproduction. That’s what the patriarchy and male-dominated systems are all about, and what the racist systems are about too. So if we didn’t have wombs, we’d be fine [laughs].

LB: With #MeToo, Time’s Up, etc., how often were you drawn into those discussions before they hit the national sphere?

GS: Well, always, just because of the nature. For instance, the term “sexual harassment” was invented in the early ’70s by women in Ithaca, N.Y., who all had summer jobs. They were coming together discussing their experience trying to name what had happened to them. So we at Ms. magazine did a cover story on sexual harassment, which we illustrated with puppets. We didn’t want it to be too shocking, so we had a male puppet and a female puppet. Even so, we were put off the newsstands.

LB: What were the puppets doing? Was one puppet grabbing the other puppet’s ass?

GS: It was a male puppet standing behind a female puppet at a desk, and his hand was heading toward her breast. That was all.

LB: I’m curious — how did you develop your backbone?

GS: After I wrote about the abortion hearing in my column, I was considered the girl writer. And the guys there [at New York magazine] were nice guys — like Jimmy Breslin, Tom Wolfe, Clay Felker — but they all said to me, “Gloria, you must not get involved with these crazy women, because you’ve worked hard to be taken seriously.” And it made me realize that I was one of those crazy women.

LB: There is something about being on the right side of history. When people come at you, you have solidarity.

GS: It’s the purpose of movements — to share values, laugh at the same jokes. You’re very different, but you have the same hopes, and I had that in ever-growing forms. And the other good news was that I was a freelancer. I wasn’t in an office. So I wasn’t subjected to it all day. I wasn’t worried about my paycheck, or even if I was, I could have another freelance job.

LB: Can you imagine if you’d had Twitter at your fingertips?

GS: You know, it’s great for the speed of information, and a problem for the speed of defamation. In both cases it’s not complete because you can’t empathize with each other unless you’re physically together.

LB: It’s nice to have an interaction with someone who fills you up. How often do you take time for yourself?

GS: Well, it’s not an either or. You may need to sleep for 12 hours. Or see friends or go to a movie, but there’s not such a thing as off and on.

LB: Right, especially with the state of this current administration. I think of it as a long game. Some of us are engaged who never used to be. What do you think about that?

GS: Well, we know the bad news. Trump was not a democratically elected president because of the peculiarities of the electoral college. He lost the popular vote by six million. And he came up through the media, not through the political party. And he has the clearest case of narcissistic personality disorder you could possible imagine. It’s dangerous. You can’t downplay the danger that comes from his executive powers and from a Congress that hasn’t stood up to him, although the courts have been better. But his purpose is that he’s allowing us to see exactly what is wrong with this country at a high level. And we are woke.

LB: We wake up every morning swearing pretty much. What makes you feel optimistic about this time?

GS: Mostly talking to you, traveling, seeing groups of people. The first moment that I thought something different was happening was when Trump issued his first travel ban and the courts weren’t able to act yet. Within two hours thousands of people were protesting at every international airport.

LB: Also, I think it’s a super-challenging time for young women who don’t really know where to begin to engage. Would you say to go and find your like-minded girls?

GS: Yeah, I think we need each other. We can’t do it alone for very long. What I would say to them is not only to look up because it makes us feel empowered, but also to look out for each other and we’ll know the things we can do.

LB: What women in the political field are currently impressing you?

GS: Maxine Waters is such a good, smart, brave woman. I’ve known her since the late ’70s. She was on the Ms. Foundation board when she was in the California legislature. Cynthia Nixon had a positive impact on the electoral race as well.

LB: Are you involved in any voting campaigns for the midterms?

GS: I try to be helpful in races where I can, like in Georgia with Stacey Abrams. She came to see me with some of her people, and I went to a benefit for her. I think she’s an ideal candidate. She understands how to describe the issues in the way we experience them. She has a personal journey that helps her understand people. She came from a very unlikely place into the state legislature. For her, it depends on the turnout outside Atlanta. Atlanta is one thing, but it’s the counties outside. And in one of the poorest counties with the most black residents, they tried to reduce the number of polling stations.

LB: I read that Lyft is offering free or discounted rides to get to the polling stations.

GS: Yes, we just have to keep going. The one disturbing thing I’ve seen lately is a poll of millennial women. There’s a group that’s political and cares but doesn’t see that voting matters. I understand the feeling of disillusionment with the system because there’s been redistricting in the states. But, still, our vote is our voice. It isn’t the most we can do, but it’s the least.

LB: Especially as a woman. How’s it going with Time’s Up?

GS: They’re quite organized. The last meeting I went to was the one in California for three days. They have launched efforts in different industries and established goals in terms of numbers of women on the board and created a legal defense fund. I think they’ve done a good job. Being at their meetings quite a lot made me realize that, as always, they have situations that are unique to the way they work. Listening to everybody made me realize that female actors are probably the only women who are also competing with each other for jobs. So what was moving to me was to see how new it was for them to be together and to be supporting each other. I also think there were a lot of mystified men who didn’t quite understand that your body belongs to you, and it’s the basis of democracy.

LB: What about the current female resistance? In what ways is it different from before?

GS: In that now it’s a majority. It’s not intrinsically different because it’s still basically saying, “My body belongs to me.” We’re all human beings; gender and race are not any kind of logical divisions. We’re unique as human beings. But now it’s the majority, and that means that women are being believed. Also, it isn’t only that we live in a patriarchy; it’s also that patriarchy lives in us. So we also have to deal with the internalized values we’ve grown up with.

LB: How do you feel about young women saying that they’re feminists? Is there a different way they approach it now?

GS: Yes, it’s much more positive and plentiful.

LB: What’s going to happen 10 years from now for you?

GS: I’ve given up the idea that I can control what happens. I just have to hang in there, because as a writer, I have three more books that I want to do.

LB: You have to! For the “crazy women.” But most important, how are your belts? [laughs]

GS: I have a drawer full. That’s my idea of changing my clothes: changing my belt. It’s still the same.

72,Steinem,Gloria,womensmediacenter,"Eight reasons why victim-blaming needs to stop: Writers, activists, and survivors speak out

Author Consolee Nishimwe, second from right, sits with her sisters and brothers in front of her Rwandan home in 1993, just a few months before the genocide began. The house was destroyed; her brothers were all killed. This is the only photo she still has of them.

About once a day someone comes to this website by searching “Are rape victims to blame?” I hope when these visitors arrive they find some solace in the message they find here that rape victims are not culpable, ever, no, never. Unfortunately, they will also find information on how rape survivors are blamed mercilessly around the world for the violence perpetrated against them.

From Mexico to Sudan, women who survive brutal sexualized violence are forced out of their homes, divorced, and killed. Men chastise women who have been raped, such as in this instance in Burma: “Prostitute! If you want to sell sex, we will build you a small hut in the jungle,” one woman’s husband said after a soldier raped her. “You can sell sex there.” Her own children told her: “Whore, you are not our mother, don’t come see us anymore.”

In this country, we’ve seen our politicians and leaders make ignorant and insensitive statements such as what one judge said to a woman who’d been sexually assaulted in a bar in Arizona last summer: “If you wouldn’t have been there that night, none of this would have happened to you.”

“This.” “Happened to.” “If you wouldn’t have been there.” Dismissive, fault-finding, victim-blaming.

These words have an impact. We are watching women commit suicide in Syria and living with the toll of honor killings globally. According to a 2011 report in the Journal of the American Medical Association, 35 percent of women in an Australian survey who had experienced gender-based violence later tried to commit suicide.

Women are literally dying from blame.

With all this in mind, we held a Twitter chat last week on victim-blaming with the hashtag #RapeIsRape. I asked Gloria Steinem, this project’s founder, if she’d be willing to share some thoughts on the subject with our followers. She wrote what you’ll see below, and inspired me to seek out more thoughts from leading writers, activists, and survivors. Here are their words:

Invading and devaluing: The double impact of victim-blaming

Victim-blaming isn’t unique to females. Crimes against humanity have often been blamed on the victims. The theft of entire continents was rationalized by “scientific” craniology proving that their inhabitants were “savages.” Read Exterminate All the Brutes, a brilliant small book by Sven Lindqvist about the invention of racism to justify taking over land. In this country, enslaved Africans were seen as permanent children who couldn’t care for themselves. Even class and criminality have been said to be inherited, and poverty may still be blamed on the poor.

But blaming females has a double impact: invading female bodies sexually and then de-valuing them as spoiled and ruined—all because female bodies are the means of reproduction that are “owned” by one male so he can “own” children. Females may be the last worldwide case of victim-blaming. The “honor” of some men, families, and cultures is written on the body of a female.

Women’s rights are human rights, and we must shift the blame from women who suffer sexualized violence to men who inflict it; from women who are raped to men who rape; from battered women to battering men; from sexually abused children to adults who sexually abuse.

Right now, the victim still may be punished more than the criminal, men may assault females to punish other men, and victimized females are often punished more than the males who victimized them.

—Gloria Steinem

Born ‘evil’: When men think women deserve abuse

My first experience of victim-blaming occurred when I was raped at the age of 7. While my perpetrator assaulted me, he blamed me for his actions and told me I had to be punished for my sins. He was my nanny at that time and a student at a conservative Christian seminary in Dallas. He essentially used the theology of original sin as the justification for his actions. Since I was born “evil,” he concluded that I deserved to be abused. This was also his rationale when he forced me into sex-trafficking.

I’ve spoken extensively with other women who were trafficked in the U.S. Some have shared that the johns they encountered used a similar kind of religious language.

Patriarchal religion has played a significant role in blaming victims of sexual assault. This is deeply interconnected with distorted views of gender and sexuality. When I worked with a rape crisis center in Idaho, one of our clients was a 17-year-old girl who was assaulted by an acquaintance on a date. She was devastated by this violation and confided in her pastor about the experience. Instead of trying to help her find recovery resources, he publicly shamed her in church for “losing her virginity.” He literally made her stand up in front of everyone and confess her “sexual sin.”

I have seen countless examples of victim-blaming in my work as an activist and media commentator. The justifications may change, but they are never acceptable. We must openly challenge this kind of poisonous and dehumanizing discourse in our communities and mass media. Survivors deserve respect as they engage in the healing process, not further victimization.

Collectively, we must learn how to become a compassionate witness. We cannot overcome injustice if we keep blaming the oppressed for their own oppression.

—Brooke Axtell

The many faces of victim-blaming

The accounts we receive on the Everyday Sexism Project website reveal how heartbreakingly prevalent victim-blaming is. A university student wrote that she receives regular faculty e-mails telling female students “not to go home alone in the darkness.” But “if you ask male students, they don’t even know about the problem…they come up with, ‘She wore a skirt, she asked for it.’”

Another young woman wrote: “I have friends who have been raped and not told anyone because they had passed out drunk and so felt it was there [sic] fault.” Yet another account reads: “I was raped at a party after being drugged… .When I had the courage to tell what happened I was blamed by everyone. I had to do a lot of tests, including HIV and no one supported me. My family and friends abandoned me saying it was all my fault because I acted like a whore.”

These stories go on and on: Strangers judge and blame; family members refuse to believe survivors; survivors blame themselves. This internalized finger-pointing is perhaps the hardest to hear about. In addition to everything else they must bear, victims are forced to carry the heavy burden of self-blame.

Often, they report that this prevents them from telling anybody about what has happened. Social misconceptions about rape and rapists also play a significant role.

One girl described being raped at 14. “Took me years to even label that a rape,” she said. “In my head, it was my fault. And everybody knows that rapists aren’t cute boys, they are shady men hiding in bushes, right?” Another woman reported being told by a nurse, as she had blood tests after being raped, to “be more careful next time.”

We’ve received hundreds of accounts. But almost none report justice, conviction, or even criticism of the perpetrator by the confidant the victim chose to tell.

—Laura Bates

Let’s talk about systems, not victims

Victim-blaming continues to be the rule, not the exception. For women, this is particularly true, living as we do with a cultural preference that so persistently portrays women as the cause of our own undoing. In cases of rape, even more so.

So, why? What purpose does this approach—to rape, murder, racism, poverty—serve?

One, it props up widespread denial of unpleasant realities. Two, it keeps the focus on individuals, instead of systems of oppression. Regardless of whether the issue is related to rape, racial inequities, or poverty, it is easier to blame the victim than to admit to systemic problems. In the United States in particular, this flies in the face of national mythologies rooted in success and exceptionalism. Three, we have millennia worth of histories, myths, and parables in which women are the cause of their own, and often, others’, woes. Those stories, written by the powerful about the powerless, form the basis for deeply entrenched cultural attitudes about blame, shame, sex, and power. Those stories inform the casual blame assigned to rape victims regularly.

This goes a long way toward explaining why although extensive studies show that between 6 percent and a maximum of 10 percent of rape claims may be false, college students think that up to 50 percent are.

Since the early 1970s, when objections to victim-blaming entered the public discourse, victims-rights advocates have been accused of having a victim mentality—one in which we’d rather ignore personal responsibility and the culpability of women in their own victimization. Others claim that it would be better to stop considering blame at all and to think instead of the roles that each person plays in the dynamics at hand. That might work as an academic exercise, but in terms of changing culture, I think it is virtually useless.

Shifting the focus from people to systems isn’t a mentality of victimization, it’s a critique of the deeply entrenched, destructive attitudes at the heart of violence and oppression, and the first steps toward dismantling them. That is a matter of personal responsibility.

—Soraya Chemaly

‘Little compassion was shown for victims like me’

In my homeland, Rwanda, in 1994, my family and I were forced into hiding for three months, moving from place to place trying to evade capture and certain death by hordes of extremist Hutu militiamen and civilians intent on eliminating all members of my Tutsi tribe.

We encountered a myriad of traumatic experiences during that period, including—to name a few—witnessing my aunt being savagely killed as she tried to escape from killers, followed by the hunting down and killing of my dad later the same day, and, weeks later, painfully witnessing my three young brothers, ages 18 months to 9 years old, being forcibly taken from us at one of our hiding places and brought back to our burned-out home and chopped to death. Apart from these and other unbelievable events we faced daily during the genocide, I was personally targeted and subjected to rape and torture and infected with HIV at the tender age of 14.

I know firsthand the difficulties rape victims face in trying to deal with the deep psychological, emotional, and physical trauma. In my situation, I suffered in silence for months after being raped at the height of the genocide, while simultaneously having to deal with other more gravely catastrophic situations we faced at the time.

Even more hurtful, however, was the fact that at the end of the genocide little compassion was shown for victims like me. On occasion after returning to my hometown, I would hear people on the street making sarcastic, degrading comments about women who were raped. For example: “Those women’s lives are over—no one will be interested in them anymore!” Such remarks only served to further erode my already shattered dignity and confidence.

I believe that people in general need to become more sensitized to the deep-seated effects of rape on the psyche of its victims, especially when offenders or members of society compound the indignity those victims have faced by being insensitive to what they have been through.

—Consolee Nishimwe

Respect a woman's body—and her right to it

I have grappled for years with the question of why people blame rape survivors. The honest-to-god answer is that wherever I've looked, I’ve found that victim-blamers place an arbitrary value on women’s chastity.

Chastity…it almost sounds like a positive word. But it isn’t. It means that women are held to a higher, no, different standard than men. While how highly it’s regarded varies from culture to culture, generally in this country for victim-blamers, not having sex outside a committed relationship—usually marriage—or one-night-stands means a woman is chaste, thus, good.

This means that even in the United States of America, which was founded on the principle of personal liberty, a woman is repeatedly reminded through slut-shaming that she must preserve this nonsensical value by restricting her freedom and only having sex with her husband or boyfriend.

It gets worse, though.

This “women’s chastity” thing has been idealized to the point where, to many victim-blamers, it’s the single most important value there is to a woman—sometimes the only value. Therefore, the preservation of it is perhaps the most important responsibility that’s bestowed upon a woman. And she will be blamed if she fails—even if she is powerless to stop a “sexual” encounter from happening because someone’s holding a gun to her head.

I hope you know it’s painful to write this, but it’s what I believe the truth is. If Americans want to eliminate victim-blaming in the U.S., they have to change their attitudes and abolish this degrading value system by putting an end to treating women’s bodies differently than those of men.

Not only does it result in horrible things like preemptive victim-blaming—“You should just lock yourself up at home or get raped!”—but also other equally horrible things like slut-shaming. Ultimately, however, it’s just a killer of personal liberty.

—Josh Shahryrar

Silencing the witness

It’s important to remember that the phenomenon of victim-blaming is not just prevalent in rape. It’s the method by which people in power protect and maintain support for their coercive and criminal activities, a method that turns people against their own best interests and against themselves.

Victim-blaming occurs predominantly in issues of class. Regardless of your gender, race, age, sexuality, if you are poor you are seen as responsible for your poverty. No system put you there; according to the dominant culture, your hunger, your homelessness are your own problems.

There is also this common notion that rape is the only crime where the responsibility falls on the victim to avoid and prevent their brutalization by the hands of another. But this is also false. Crimes such as the systematic, institutionally sanctioned theft of fair wages, health care, food, shelter, and education are perpetrated and go unpunished because of this “victim responsibility” model. It’s up to you not to starve, to budget to the last penny, to manage your wage cuts so that corporate shareholders can afford their second homes.

The real function of victim-blaming is not simply to take focus away from the perpetrators, but to make sure that those who could help the victim don’t. Make sure they believe whatever has transpired is simply inevitable. Women have always been raped and will always be raped unless they do something themselves to stop it. The poor will always be poor unless they pull themselves up by their bootstraps.

Victim-blaming creates irresponsible cowards.

It creates a world where there are no perpetrators, where those who have been harmed live in shame and those who witness remain silent. It is an essential part of the cult of antisocial masculinity.

And it’s time to take a good long look at that cult. It’s time to bring it down.

—Cara Hoffman

What if?

More than 20 years have passed since I was raped while serving as a Peace Corps volunteer in Niger, West Africa. The memory of the rape itself has faded. But the memory of the response I received from Peace Corps staff members when I reported my rape and sought justice has not.

“I am so sick of you girls going over there, drinking, dancing, and flirting. And then if a guy comes on to you, you say you have been raped.”

“It is your word against his. He said you wanted to have sex, and we believe him.”

Young and naive, I believed if I “did the right thing” I would be supported. Instead, I was blamed, and very effectively silenced. Two decades would pass before I would “come out” publically about my rape, despite working in the field of trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder. I broke my silence to help pass legislation to reform the Peace Corps policies around sexual assault. I learned quickly from my work on the Hill that victim-blaming is pervasive across the political spectrum.

GOP Rep. Todd Akin’s August statements about “legitimate rape” were widely and justly reviled. But I’ve heard similar sentiments from the left: After telling a liberal Democratic staffer that there had been 1,000 sexual assaults in the Peace Corps over the past 10 years, he replied: “How many of those were real rapes?”

To my surprise, one of our strongest allies was right-wing congressman Ted Poe, who said publicly during House hearings: “As a former judge, let me just say this. Sexual assault is never, never, the fault of the victim.”

What if our public leaders all spoke like this? What if they honored the 12 million and counting rape survivors a year in America? And what if all 12 million of us stood up and said, “I was raped”? We could actually bring victim-blaming to an end.

74,Steinem,Gloria,bustle,"When you visit a prison, you discover that the prisoners are not different from you. It's pretty arbitrary who's in prison and who is not. A few years ago, I went with Deborah Jiang Stein of the unPrison Project to visit a women’s prison in Minnesota, and we spent a day together. These women — because of poverty, drug addiction, whatever their individual situation was — they were in prison, and I was not.

Deborah was born in prison, had been adopted, and only later in life learned her history. In the prison she was born in, a woman could keep her baby for the first year. But after she was adopted, she was not told about her background for a while, and it took her time to make the connections of what had happened in her life.

Deborah got in touch with me about her project of bringing books — especially children's books — into women's prisons so that mothers there had something. When their children came to visit, they had something to talk about other than what was within the prison walls. She's challenged me to be more aware of the walls between us.

Kate Powers

At the same time that I came to know her, I had been working on a project in Manhattan. The Bayview Correctional Facility, a women’s prison that was flooded during Hurricane Sandy and abandoned, has been an empty building since. Because it's a state-owned building, we campaigned for several years to be able to take this empty building and turn it into a women's center.

In the process, we got in touch with all the formerly incarcerated women, people who had been incarcerated in that building, and they are part of the planning process as it turns into a building with a new purpose. It's been another way of trying to break down these divisions.

Deborah is doing what so many of us do or need to do, which is to heal through using what happened to us to help other people. Even if something negative has happened to you, you know it can be turned for a positive purpose.

Kate Powers

She's warm and welcoming and funny. She is immediately direct, honest, funny, able to explain to a wide variety of people what her project is about and how to move it forward.

Without Deborah, I would lack a practical, satisfying human way of connecting with women who are potential friends that are in prison. I would miss her spirit and her courage and positive attitude toward the world. I would be deprived of possibilities.

Gloria Steinem and Deborah Jiang Stein are currently working to bring awareness to the mass incarceration of women by partnering with The Lipstick Lobby to create a lip balm called ""In The Clear"" — 100 percent of net profit from the sales will go to the unPrison Project.

As told to Celia Darrough. This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.

75,Steinem,Gloria,geaugamapleleaf,"I think my favorite part would probably be that so many people have heard me and so many people are hearing my message. – Julianne Speyer

A 12-year-old Russell Township girl’s recent letter to the editor titled “Sexist Comment” has gone viral, garnering national attention and even brought her to New York City this week for a network television interview.

The letter, which appeared in the Geauga County Maple Leaf newspaper July 19, expressed Girl Scout and West Geauga student Julianne Speyer’s disappointment at an announcer’s comment during the Chester Township 4th of July parade.

The announcer — on a grandstand located at the north entrance to West Geauga High School and whose identity has not been confirmed as of July 31 — offended Julianne when he labeled the Boy Scouts as “future leaders of America” and then said the Girl Scouts were “just having fun.”

“I found this comment very sexist and patronizing,” wrote Julianne, who had been marching with Girl Scout Junior Troop 77192 behind the Boy Scouts in the parade. “I would appreciate it if you would help me to let other people know how much this kind of thing happens and how bad it is. I feel it is an insult to both girls and women of all ages. This kind of thing happens way too much and it is not OK at all.”

Julianne went on to say she has always been taught if she thinks something is unjust, to change it.

“So, this is how I am making a change,” she wrote. “Thank you for listening to me and I hope you can help me.”

The Kiwanis Club of West Geauga did not return multiple calls for comment, however, parade organizers did issue the following statement, as reported by Cleveland 19 News:

“There was an unfortunate misunderstanding of two unrelated comments. The announcer is a volunteer and made an observation that participants were enjoying the parade, with no disrespect intended.”

Julianne and her mother, Jennifer Speyer, were reached briefly while walking through Central Park in New York City Tuesday afternoon — the day before their interview on the Megyn Kelly TODAY show.

Jennifer said after the parade, Julianne and her friend were in the car talking about the announcer’s comment and Julianne kept saying she wanted to do something about it.

The next day, the girls were in sewing camp and one of Julianne’s friend’s mom suggested she write a letter to the editor.

“She didn’t know what it was, so when she got home from sewing camp that day, she went online and researched samples of letters to the editor. She wrote it out. She went online, researched the address and mailed it,” Jennifer, a former English teacher, said. “I was so proud of her. She wrote a rough draft, she indented her paragraphs and I was like, ‘Yes!’ I prepped her to not be disappointed if they don’t publish it, I was just so proud of her for doing it.”

The letter not only got published, it spread like wildfire throughout social media.

A news clipping of Julianne’s letter was posted on Facebook and went viral, being shared over 100,000 times and drawing attention from several news networks, publications and people all over the world, including former First Daughter Chelsea Clinton and actor George Takei.

The Maple Leaf received emails from people around the country and Canada praising Julianne’s courage and strength. Many of them have been forwarded to the family.

One such email, from former Girl Scout and current Troop Leader Erin Branham, 48, of Los Angeles, read:

“Ms. Speyer rightly called this it as a sexist remark and I applaud her and you for sharing her thoughts. I would like to add that the announcer’s words were also deeply mistaken. Here are a few Girl Scouts:

History-making singer Marian Anderson

First Lady Nancy Reagan

Astronaut Sally Ride

Astronaut Mae Jemison

Astronaut Eileen Marie Collins

Astronaut Kathryn D. Sullivan

Secretary of State Hillary Clinton

Author Gloria Steinem

Labor leader Dolores Huerta

Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice

Attorney General Janet Reno

Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor

Secretary of State Madeline Albright

Senator Tammy Duckworth

First Lady Michelle Obama

CEO of YouTube Susan Wojcicki

CEO and Chairwoman of IBM Virginia Rometty”

“Her voice has been heard and she validated that what she said mattered, that she could have an impact,” Jennifer said. “And it’s just, holy cow, it just spiraled. Never did we expect this. The response has been absolutely amazing.”

While neither Jennifer nor Julianne believe the announcer meant any harm by what he said, they thought it was important to let people know it was not OK.

“Julianne was very adamant about she doesn’t want anyone getting in trouble,” Jennifer said. “It was just about this is what she noticed, she thought it was wrong. (Sexism) can be subtle, but it’s not OK. The Kiwanis is a wonderful, wonderful organization. They support our community in so many ways throughout our community. I don’t know who the announcer is. I don’t wish him any ill will; I don’t want Kiwanis blamed.”

When asked how she feels seeing the impact of her letter, Julianne said she’s “really excited.”

“I’m so thankful for everybody who supported me in all of this,” she said. “I couldn’t have gone this far without everyone’s support.”

That support included an email from an enlisted female in the U.S. Navy, who told Julianne she was proud of her letter and when she’s older, the Navy would welcome her on its team, Jennifer said, adding that meant a lot as she has family on both her and her husband’s side who served in the military.

Another email sent to the Maple Leaf from Nathalie Gamache represented a Canadian organization that comprises 7,000 members, all women physicians and leaders.

“A letter published last week entitled ‘Sexist Comment,’ written by 12-year-old Julianne Speyer, attracted our attention and we wish to commend her for expressing an opinion we all share, and voicing it with such determination,” she wrote. “Although girls and women of all ages know they can strive to become and do anything they choose, we are still faced too often by archaic and paternalistic attitudes and actions, which makes it an added challenge to achieve our goals, grow to our full potential and help make this world a fair and better place for everyone.

“The announcer of the Chesterland 4th of July parade obviously needs to be informed, as Julianne knows already, that while they are having fun, Girl Scouts (all over the world), are also growing into leaders. Michelle Obama, honorary president of Girl Scouts USA; Sally Ride, first American woman astronaut in space; and her Canadian counterpart, Roberta Bondar; Carol Bellamy, head of Unicef; and Queen Elizabeth ll are just a few of the thousands of women leaders who have been nurtured by this preeminent organization whose mission is to ‘build girls of courage, confidence and character, who make the world a better place.’

“Obviously, this fine organization, and so many others, are succeeding in the likes of Julianne Speyer. Julianne, if you read this, know that we all stand beside you and thank you for publicly denouncing an attitude that is ‘not OK at all.’ By doing so, you have already become an exemplary leader.”

Susie Greer, advisor for Julianne’s Girl Scout troop, said the girls were in the process of earning their Bronze Award, which focuses on making a change by taking action.

“The whole notion is that women in service do things to make change in their communities and nation,” she said.

In her interview with Cleveland 19 News, Julianne credited her mother for her courage to stand up for what she believed.

“She’s always taught us to choose to be kind,” Julianne said. “You don’t want to judge people based on their sex. Maybe in the future, if no one beats me to the job, I’ll be the first girl president. I could scream the message that girls can be anything they want to be, they can be in charge someday. We can be the leaders of America.”

As she geared up Tuesday for her interview with former Cleveland weather forecaster Al Roker — who is filling in for Kelly Aug. 1 — Julianne reflected on the best aspect of this entire experience:

Here are all 19 titles from Emma Watson's feminist book club, ""Our Shared Shelf""

We are currently living in the golden age of celebrity book clubs. Since kicking off the trend in 1996 for her daytime talk show, Oprah Winfrey is the godmother of celebrity book clubs. But the digital age has breathed new life into the trend, with new celebrity book clubs making rounds across Instagram and Twitter.

However, one of the most formidable of celebrity book clubs belongs to Harry Potter star and United Nations Women Goodwill Ambassador Emma Watson. Inspired by her work for the UN, in January 2016, the Perks of Being a Wallflower actress launched Our Shared Shelf, a feminist book club housed on Goodreads.

Every two months, a new book — a work of fiction, non-fiction, or prose — is selected with Watson and the club’s moderators leading a discussion with Our Shared Shelf’s more than 215 thousands members using the Goodreads discussion board. Additionally, the club occasionally features conversations and interviews with authors and relevant figures to help guide the discussion. Thus far, Our Shared Shelf has covered classics like The Handmaid’s Tale; acclaimed memoirs, including Maya Angelou’s Mom & Me & Mom; and President Obama-backed novel, The Power.

Currently, the club is reading Milk and Honey, a poetry and prose collection by Rupi Kaur, the feminist poet and Instagram poetry sensation, who initially published the collection back in 2014, which went on to become a New York Times bestseller.

Here are the 19 other books Watson and the Our Shared Shelf crew have currently completed thus far:

78,Steinem,Gloria,commondreams,"Many Americans remain deeply concerned about reports of Russian interference with the 2016 election. Meanwhile, relations between the United States and Russia are at their lowest and most dangerous point in several decades. For the sake of democracy at home and true national security, we must reach common ground to safeguard common interests—taking steps to protect the nation’s elections and to prevent war between the world’s two nuclear superpowers.

Whatever the truth of varied charges that Russia interfered with the election, there should be no doubt that America’s digital-age infrastructure for the electoral process is in urgent need of protection. The overarching fact remains that the system is vulnerable to would-be hackers based anywhere. Solutions will require a much higher level of security for everything from voter-registration records to tabulation of ballots with verifiable paper trails. As a nation, we must fortify our election system against unlawful intrusions as well as official policies of voter suppression.

""As a nation, we must fortify our election system against unlawful intrusions as well as official policies of voter suppression.""

At the same time, the U.S. and Russian governments show numerous signs of being on a collision course. Diplomacy has given way to hostility and reciprocal consular expulsions, along with dozens of near-miss military encounters in Syria and in skies above Europe. Both sides are plunging ahead with major new weapons development programs. In contrast to prior eras, there is now an alarming lack of standard procedures to keep the armed forces of both countries in sufficient communication to prevent an escalation that could lead to conventional or even nuclear attack. These tensions are festering between two nations with large quantities of nuclear weapons on virtual hair-trigger alert; yet the current partisan fixations in Washington are ignoring the dangers to global stability and, ultimately, human survival.

The United States should implement a pronounced shift in approach toward Russia. No political advantage, real or imagined, could possibly compensate for the consequences if even a fraction of U.S. and Russian arsenals were to be utilized in a thermonuclear exchange. The tacit pretense that the worsening of U.S.-Russian relations does not worsen the odds of survival for the next generations is profoundly false. Concrete steps can and must be taken to ease tensions between the nuclear superpowers.

Fashion trends, as hot as they are at the time, have a way of turning wonderfully whimsical in hindsight. Who could forget the Flashdance inspired legwarmers craze of the '80s? Or the iconic grunge uniform of flannel shirts, or riot-grrrl-inspired baby doll dresses?

Then there are the looks that have turned bonafide sought-after vintage, like the poodle skirts and bobby socks (or sox, if you prefer) of the 1950s. Or the eternally appealing James Dean inspired ""greaser look,"" complete with the jacket, the perpetual comb in the back pocket, and the iconic pack of cigarettes rolled up into the sleeve of a white T-shirt. (""Greased Lightning,"" anyone?).

Whatever fashion era you hail from (or whatever fashion era you aesthetically prefer), revisiting the fads of yore is always a pleasure. As the musician Joe Jackson said, ""nostalgia is a recreational drug,"" so turn on, tune in, and drop in to the good clean fun of style-crazes past.",-2,http://www.thelist.com/117927/popular-fashion-trend-year-born/

84,Steinem,Gloria,bostonglobe,"It also endangers women and girls. That’s because, in this country as around the world, extractive industries create so-called “man camps,” places where male workers often work 12-hour days, are socially isolated for weeks or months at a time, and live in trailers in parks that extend for miles. Many men retain their humanity, but as advocacy organizations like First Nations Women’s Alliance have noted, these man camps become centers for drugs, violence, and the sex trafficking of women and girls. They also become launching pads for serial sexual predators who endanger females for miles around.

This 1,134-mile pipeline would run under the Missouri River, posing a serious threat to drinking water, especially for the native nations whose sacred sites sit in the path of the proposed structure. Native leaders are warning all of us. They have traveled from hundreds of native nations to support the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in North Dakota. At first in obscurity, and often at risk of arrest or beatings, they have succeeded in putting the country on notice that the pipeline endangers sacred lands and the environment.

Thanks to the biggest protest by Native Americans in a century, plus support from environmental activists as well as social media, the federal government has temporarily halted construction of a crucial portion of the Dakota Access Pipeline. This is not a victory or a defeat, but it does give everyone in America time to think.

In North Dakota, the man camps created during the Bakken oil boom drastically increased the levels of violent crime perpetrated against women and girls — and particularly native women and girls. Studies conducted during the peak of the oil boom — from 2010 to 2013 — showed that the number of reported domestic violence incidents and sexual assaults increased by hundreds, flooding and overwhelming service providers. Victim advocates from the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara Nation — a native nation that became ground zero for the increase in violent crimes that accompanied the boom — have reported a doubling, and in some instances a tripling, in the number of calls that victim-service providers receive for domestic violence, sexual assault, and sex trafficking. As Bea Hanson, principal deputy director of the Department of Justice’s Office on Violence Against Women, stated in 2014: “Local and tribal victim-service providers have been overwhelmed with the increase in domestic violence and sexual assault victims coming forward and needing help.”

Already, and even without the proposed Dakota Access Pipeline, North Dakota produces more oil than any other state in the nation. The majority of this oil comes from tribal lands. On the Fort Berthold reservation alone, there are 35 corporations extracting oil, and countless man camps. The Bakken oil boom has brought increased rates of rape, murder, and sex trafficking to a population that already suffers from the highest rates of violence in the United States. According the National Institute of Justice, four out of five Native Americans have suffered a violent crime in their lifetime. Man camps are also a major reason why four out of five perpetrators of violence against American Indians are non-Indians themselves, yet thanks to a 1978 Supreme Court ruling eliminating tribal criminal jurisdiction over non-Indians who commit crimes on tribal lands, tribal police have no jurisdiction over non-tribal crime. Native people, especially females, are often unprotected.

Native Americans tell us that it takes four generations to heal one act of violence. As they have learned throughout American history, an attack on a native woman’s body is a violent attack on her nation’s sovereignty. As the Standing Rock Sioux tribe chairman Dave Archambault has said, they are protesting the pipeline not just to protect their lives but to protect the lives of generations to come. They are the canaries. We are all living in the mine.

There have been many life-saving books, from Louisa May Alcott’s when I was a child, to Alice Walker’s and Robin Morgan’s as a grownup. Overall, what has been most helpful is knowing that patriarchy is not some inevitable part of human nature, that male control of reproduction and thus the bodies of women is what creates “masculine” and “feminine” gender roles as the first step in hierarchy, and these roles are new in human history.



They deprive everyone of being fully human. When divisions of race, caste or class are added, controlling reproduction – and thus female bodies – becomes even more crucial in order to keep categories separate. This is maintained by violence or the threat of violence.

In North America, Native American feminists teach us this wasn’t always so. Languages such as Cherokee have no gendered pronouns – no “he” and “she” – and the group paradigm is a circle, not a hierarchy. Matrilineal cultures of southern India and parts of Africa teach us the same lesson. As Paula Gunn Allen wrote in The Sacred Hoop: “The root of oppression is the loss of memory.”

So I will choose one neglected book, The Mermaid and the Minotaur by Dorothy Dinnerstein. It looks at the way humans lived before patriarchy, and before male control of reproduction was codified into “masculine” versus “feminine” roles. It reports that, in our very long migratory past, both men and women raised children. Men developed empathy, patience, attention to detail and a sense of the value of life – all those qualities now wrongly called “feminine”, because they are necessary to raise children. Just as women become more whole as humans by entering into public life, men become more whole as humans by entering into private life.

So for this reason, I choose Dinnerstein’s political and practical book. It convinced me, and may convince you, that men raising children – boys being raised to raise children – is the key to equality, democracy and world peace.

Mary Beard, classicist

Germaine Greer’s The Female Eunuch is the top of my list. That is not so much for what it says (though that is important, too); it is more for how she says it, and her particular use of a woman’s voice. It was life changing when I first read it because of the powerful, in-your-face straight talking. I hadn’t realised that you could speak, let alone write, about gender politics or your own body like that without flinching. When I look back to the key books that broke my own silence and loosened my tongue (and yes I was once terribly tongue-tied), The Eunuch still holds pride of place.

Gina Miller, anti-Brexit campaigner

As a woman thrust on to the political stage and baffled by the anger and depth of negative feeling I have been targeted with, Mary Beard’s Women & Power: A Manifesto brought me a sense of solidarity, power and determination.

The book is adapted from two lectures, one given at the British Museum in 2014, and the other in 2017. A renowned intellect, Beard explores complex issues, but is able to make her text understandable. She makes you think about women being silenced, about fear of the female voice. She explores sexual politics and takes a “long view on the culturally awkward relationship between the voice of women and the public sphere of speech-making, debate and comment”, so that we get beyond “the simple diagnosis of misogyny that we tend a bit lazily to fall back on”.

Beard shows that if we are to find solutions to the problems of misogyny, we need to investigate, examine and find effective ways of combating it.

What I found particularly fascinating was Beard’s classicist approach to the subject. Reading her book in the wake of the today’s sexual harassment scandals – surrounding Weinstein, Westminster, the Presidents Club dinner in London and Trump in the US – I found myself shouting out “Yes!”

I like that she does not want women to wallow in self-pity and promotes the idea of being progressive in changing the very nature of power. She talks of the “decoupling” of power from prestige, a bifurcation that will mean thinking about power as an attribute rather than as a possession, and of the power of followers as well as of leaders. I love her pragmatism, intellectual elegance and energising voice.

I found The Beauty Myth by Naomi Wolf on the shelf of my mother’s bookcase at 11 years old. It was its cover that attracted me – the image of a bound naked woman. I took that to mean it was a dirty book, which clearly highlights the issue. The book is luridly written, and is now recognised to contain absurdly inflated statistics, but it presented a challenge that was new to me. As a child, I’d accepted there were two types of woman I could become: either “beautiful” or “not really a woman”. If I wasn’t attractive in the way the passive, perfect, dead-eyed women in magazines were, I would be a “tomboy” or “more like a guy” or “not a girls’ girl”. After reading this book I realised there was another sort of woman I could be, one who sees what you are doing and won’t hold the shame.

In Why I’m No Longer Talking to White People About Race, Reni Eddo-Lodge writes about a great many things I already knew and believed. But she comes with a fresh perspective and writes with an energy that is exhilarating. Typical is her dissection of the all too frequent plaintive cry by white liberals that “they don’t see race”. The author is merciless about this cliche. She asserts: “Not seeing race does little to deconstruct racist structures or materially improve the conditions which people of colour are subject to daily. In order to dismantle unjust, racist structures, we must see race. We must see who benefits from their race, and upon whom power and privilege - earned or not – is bestowed because of their race, their class and their gender. Seeing race is essential to changing the system.”

Eddo-Lodge says that feminism was her first love. I would say the same. However her book features an uncompromising analysis of the relationship between feminism and race. While an earlier generation of black political writers were shaped by the patriarchy, Reni writes from an essentially feminist or (as Alice Walker would put it) womanist, perspective. This polemic was never more needed. And the best bit is that, with Reni still in her 20s, there are many more good books to come.

It is very difficult for me to choose just one favourite political text written by a woman as there are so many. Reading is one of my great passions, and I derive particular enjoyment from historical and political fiction.

My fiction choice would be The Abbess of Crewe by Muriel Spark. Though set in a convent rather than a parliament, this delightful book is intensely political. Full of intrigue and election rigging, it also has echoes of the Watergate scandal that erupted just a few years before the novel’s publication. I first read it as a young student activist and it cemented my love of Spark. Although not as well known as her classic novel The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, I would highly recommend this for anyone looking for a wry, satirical take on the often Machiavellian nature of politics – be that politics in an abbey, a workplace or a parliament.

In terms of non-fiction, my choice would be The Second Sex by Simone de Beauvoir. The ultimate feminist text had a huge influence on me as a young woman, not so much shaping my beliefs as helping me to order and understand them in a historical context. The concept of being “The Other” accurately sums up the experience of many women in the 1940s when De Beauvoir wrote about it. As Mary Beard demonstrates in her excellent recent manifesto, Women & Power, it’s a concept that continues to have relevance to how many women feel today.

Stella Rimington’s autobiography Open Secret was published to mixed reviews just days before the 11 September attacks – sceptics felt Rimington had overstepped the mark as the custodian of secrets at MI5, while others felt she had revealed too little about the secret services.

What fascinated me was that this was a woman who broke both glass ceilings and taboos – who not only became the first woman to head up MI5, but the first chief of MI5 to be named and photographed while in office.

Dame Rimington wrote the book at a time when little was known about the security services. Operating in the shadows of secrecy and misogyny, the book tracks her battles to make MI5 a more transparent and modern institution.

Critics felt the autobiography was a sanitised version of her failures, with some claiming she had overplayed her success; for me, what was profound was that she had written it at all. In the end it became the first of 10 books as she turned her hand to fiction.

It’s an account of history, a memoir of the political challenges of her time and a personal account of her life. The book weaves counter-espionage with tentative meetings with the KGB and the trauma of marital breakdown. A pioneer, a trailblazer but mostly just an ordinary woman.

Harriet Harman, MP

The Female Eunuch was more than just a book. It was a bible, a call to arms, the writings of a woman who pronounced that she, for one, didn’t care what men thought of her. This was revolutionary stuff. I was 20, it was 1970 and, at that time, the summit of a young woman’s ambition was to get a good husband. You needed to be, wanted to be, were expected to be, a woman dedicated to pleasing men. The Women’s Movement was questioning this and growing in strength. And then along came Greer, and shouted about what we were only whispering in quiet meetings. She didn’t seek to persuade men; she just told them. She was outrageous in a way that I longed to be, but would never have dared to be. I was peering out at the world through false eyelashes but she said I needn’t bother. She was loud in an era when women were supposed to be meek. She pronounced what was wrong with men and their anger perturbed her not one bit. I never quite worked out what the cover was meant to depict. But I cherished my battered copy. It was more than just about reading it. To own a copy of The Female Eunuch was to be part of a mighty movement that would change everything - families, work and politics. And we did!

Shami Chakrabarti, Labour peer

Eleanor Marx: A Life by Rachel Holmes is a political book by a political woman, about another political woman. In it, one of our leading biographers raises the dead in the form of one of the greatest and too-long forgotten radical figures of the 19th century. This British-born daughter of suspect refugees was a founder of new trades unionism (organising “unskilled” workers including women). She was a socialist before the existence of the Labour party (and involved in initiatives that lead to its birth), a feminist before the suffragettes, and an internationalist and anti-racist more than half a century before the establishment of the United Nations and post-1945 liberation struggles. She is an example to subsequent generations that feminism cannot be a “non-political”, single-issue or ethnocentric pursuit.

In this moment of Labour revival under Jeremy Corbyn, it has become fashionable to unearth the “Marxist menace”. Yet Karl’s youngest daughter was both a passionate democrat and her father’s most direct political heir. In Phoenix Park, Dublin, in 1891, while supporting parliamentary representation to further the cause of working people, she abstained from a resolution for “manhood suffrage” because (according to the Irish Times), “she wanted to see women having their share in the ordering of their lives”.

Yet the ultimate beauty of this book lies in the exquisite telling of Eleanor’s story. I am not the first to notice how much this compelling history reads like a novel and that it is both gripping whodunnit and moving family drama. And the talent for combining great writing with politics worked as well for Marx in 1890 as it does for Holmes and others in more recent times. The first mass May Day gathering was not in Glastonbury but Hyde Park. Eleanor called for legislation for an eight-hour working day and ended with a stanza from The Masque of Anarchy: “Shake your chains to earth like dew / Which in sleep had fallen on you – / Ye are many – they are few.”

Like the underlying values, it still works.

In Flight Behaviour, Kingsolver’s words come alive in ways that climate scientists and politicians can only dream of Caroline Lucas

Jess Phillips, MP

Every week I would push my buggy to my mum’s house and steal her Saturday paper. She and I were fans of Caitlin Moran’s weekend column – we had our own version of the big feral West Midlands family that Moran describes so well. So when How to Be a Woman came out, she bought me a copy straight away.

I inhaled the text, the story was so familiar. I was no stranger to feminism: as a child I’d been to a women’s liberation playgroup and made murals for Greenham Common, and at the time of the book’s publication, I was working in Moran’s native Black Country in a women’s refuge. But I was new to feminist theory that could reach so well into my existence. With its descriptions of grubby sexual encounters, rubbish boyfriends, sweaty gigs, andbeing a young, ill-equipped mother, the narrative was inclusive, funny, dirty and relatable. It captured the way in which feminism had punctuated my existence and how patriarchy had punctured it.

After my angry feminist activism eventually led me to Westminster, in one of the first speeches I ever made, I challenged my colleagues to do as Moran suggests and stand on the green benches and shout: “I am a feminist!” Feminist writing, much like Westminster, was in need of humanising and a bit of rowdy chair stomping.

My mother had been making me declare my feminism all my life, just as Moran demands in the book. She died weeks after the book came out and before I had finished it. Her final gift to me was this account by an honest, filthy, funny Midlands feminist. Nothing could have been more fitting.

Everywoman by Jess Phillips is published by Hutchinson.

Caroline Lucas, Co-leader of the Green Party

Barbara Kingsolver’s powerful novel Flight Behaviour is as much about personal transformation as it is about politics – but it’s a book that has stuck with me, and informed my politics. The power of the book comes from its vivid description of a world being transformed by a changing climate, as hoards of bright orange monarch butterflies suddenly arrive in small town Tennessee. The image of the insects, so numerous on the trees that every “bow glow[s] with an orange glaze”, is at once stunning and mystifying.

At its core the book is, as the main character Dellarobia calls it, about “the climate thing”. It’s about how human life is changing our planet - and how those changes could take on biblical proportions in the near future. As Ovid, the scientist who arrives to examine the butterflies and eventually convert Dellarobia to the climate cause, says: “This is a biological system falling apart along its seams … Unseasonable temperature shifts, droughts ... Everything hinges on the climate.”

There is so much to learn from Flight Behaviour – Kingsolver’s words come alive on the page in ways that climate scientists and politicians can only dream of. She has an expert way of batting away the myth that poor people, like Dellarobia, are somehow responsible for environmental damage because of their shopping habits.

Perhaps the greatest lesson in the book is for those of us who try to communicate climate change. In one excruciating passage a climate activist tells Dellarobia to “bring Tupperware to restaurants for leftovers”, fly less and eat less red meat. The incredulous response – from a woman who can’t afford to eat out, who comes from a family of people who have never set foot on a plane and who doesn’t eat much red meat – is a reminder of the desperate need for climate activism to break out of its bubble.

I’ve read more books about the environment than I can remember, but none match Flight Behaviour for the feeling it left me of both the damage we’re doing to our precious world, and the urgent need to change the way we live.

Anarchism is usually seen as idealism or nihilism. But in The Dispossessed, Le Guin makes it pragmatic Natasha Walter

Lucy Worsley, historian

The Description of a New World, Called the Blazing-World (1666) is an uncategorisable book written by Margaret Cavendish, scientist, author, feminist and – perhaps surprisingly incompatible with all that – duchess and courtier. When Cavendish turned up at the Royal Society to discuss her scientific work, they all laughed at her. Sometimes called the first work of science fiction, sometimes called a feminist utopian fantasy, The Blazing-World evokes an “empress” (really the author herself) who flies magically above the mansions and estates of her wealthy husband and imagines a better world through a blaze. I came across this book when I was researching a PhD thesis on Margaret’s husband, and sort of came to realise I’d devoted four years of my life to the wrong half of the couple. A crazy, difficult and totally admirable woman.

Natasha Walter, writer and activist

Ursula K Le Guin’s The Dispossessed first grabs the reader as a glorious journey through imaginary worlds, but gradually reveals itself as a carefully grounded exploration of the possibility of anarchism. Le Guin tracks the physical and emotional repercussions of the loss of authority and property, right down to small linguistic resonances. “You can share the handkerchief that I use,” a child on Anarres, the planet of anarchism, says to the hero at one point. “Take mine,” a man on Urras, the planet of capitalism, says at another.

So although The Dispossessed is a novel, it works as politics, drawing you along by its ideas as much as by plot and character. As you read it, you are constantly thinking, Could this work? Has it been tried? Will it be tried?

Anarchism is usually seen as flimsy idealism or destructive nihilism. But Le Guin makes it densely pragmatic, and often derails the narrative in favour of detailed expositions about work rotas and food distribution. These may slow down the plot, but they heighten our sense that this society is a real possibility.

And she nails feminism alongside anarchism on Anarres. Even though the protagonist is a man, The Dispossessed is peopled by women who work and live at full throttle, released by a society in which sexism has gone the way of all power relations.

But this is no simple manifesto. Rather than proselytising for the anarchists all the time, there is something too drably stern about poor old Anarres, something temptingly lush about naughty Urras. There is ambiguity here, and the space for failure.

I read it as a teenager; and when more than 30 years on, I read it again last summer, I found it even more prescient. I hope that in the aftermath of Le Guin’s death more people revisit this extraordinary book. Because while it is so tempting – and often so necessary – to keep within the limits of the real in our politics, to keep plugging away at what will make things a tiny bit better here and now, we also need to keep flexing that muscle called hope. In times when inspiration seems to be running dry, we need to dip into the reservoir of the imagination. As Le Guin says, in her protagonist’s words: “You cannot buy the revolution. You cannot make the revolution. You can only be the revolution.”",-2,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/03/the-political-books-by-women-that-inspired-me-100-years-of-revolution

In the 1970s, women students invented the term sexual harassment to describe what was happening to them in summer jobs, and Ms. magazine wrote a cover story about it that was banned in supermarkets. Then the great feminist legal scholar Catharine MacKinnon incorporated the concept into sex-discrimination law. And Anita Hill educated the country while facing down an all-male, all-white Senate Judiciary Committee.

88,Steinem,Gloria,interviewmagazine,"For ten years now, Judy Chicago’s 20th-century masterpiece The Dinner Party has been on permanent view at the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art in the Brooklyn Museum. It’s become such a fixture there that it is hard to imagine the shock and vitriol the piece caused when it was first displayed in 1979, after four years and hundreds of hands went into its production. The Dinner Party went against so many mores, even by progressive art-world standards: it was overtly political, its content directly championing women’s rights and liberation; it was constructed not by an auteur but by a community; it was comprised of ceramics and needlepoint, “decorative arts” associated with feminine domesticity. Chicago’s sculpture was—and is—radical, correcting the boldfaced names of history while inspiring a new way of conceiving open, activist art production. Amid the straightforward concept of 39 increasingly vaginal place settings, each reserved for a different groundbreaking woman, Chicago and her team filled the triangular structure with so many symbols and allusions that the reading of the work never stops. (Each side of the triangle, for instance, holds 13 place settings, which is the same number of seats at both The Last Supper and of witches in a coven.)

While The Dinner Party is certainly the 78-year-old artist’s most well-known contribution to the volatile terrain of art history, it is by no means her only one. Chicago is not only a pioneer of feminist art; she is arguably its founder, inventor, and chief figurehead. While teaching at CalArts in the early 1970s, she created Womanhouse, a highly influential installation by a collective of female artists who turned a rental home into the site of charged feminist performances. In the mid-’80s, Chicago embarked on a series of acrylic and oil paintings whose subjects explored the aggression and arrogance of unchecked masculinity. Entitled “PowerPlay,” these works will be shown together for the first time in 30 years this January at Salon 94 in New York. Their relevance to today’s political and social climate only proves that Chicago’s message still needs to be heard and that there are still so many battles to wage for equality. Chicago now spends most of her time in New Mexico, but she was in New York for the opening of “Roots of The Dinner Party: History in the Making,” a look into the making of that now-iconic piece, and it was here that she spoke with her dear friend and comrade Gloria Steinem about how much—and how little—has changed.

JUDY CHICAGO: Hi, Gloria. How are you?

GLORIA STEINEM: On a scale of one to ten, about a seven.

CHICAGO: Me, too. I did a press preview today, and they can be exhausting. I hate when people say, “Have fun at the press preview.” Fun is talking to you.

STEINEM: You and I are always striving to cross the country and get together, so I appreciate that we’re finally getting to talk now.

CHICAGO: We’ve known each other for so long. Let’s start with our first encounter, which neither of us can be sure was an encounter at all. I didn’t know you had been at Womanhouse in the 1970s. I only found that out later.

STEINEM: I’m not 100 percent sure that you were physically present when I was there. We should probably explain what Womanhouse is.

CHICAGO: In the early 1970s, when I was teaching at CalArts, I was focused on creating a feminist art practice and a new form of art education. I started a program in Fresno, California, because I had to be away from L.A. in order to try it out. It was the first feminist art program, and I was invited to bring it to CalArts—except we didn’t have a space at the school, so instead we met in people’s living rooms. Eventually, thanks to the suggestion of Paula Harper, who was one of the first feminist art historians, we rented an old house in Burbank. There were about 20 students, and we turned the house into the first major feminist art installation. It was up for a month. There was a film made about it by Johanna Demetrakas, and Jill Soloway is now working on a TV project about it. There’s been a wave of recent interest. Amazon recently bought the rights to my first autobiography.

STEINEM: At some point during that month, I was fortunately traveling through L.A. and was able to walk through Womanhouse. It was a kind of thunderbolt moment for me of realizing, “Wait a minute, we have symbols, too.” I remember that there was a bedroom with a woman sitting at a mirrored vanity perpetually brushing her hair. There was a tub in the bathroom full of colored sand with a female figure in the tub, and a sign saying, “Please don’t touch the sand,” which made it irresistible. But once you touched the sand, nothing could remove the mark you made. It was the proof of vulnerability. I remember there was a bride going up a staircase.

CHICAGO: The bride was actually going down the staircase, and she ran into a wall.

STEINEM: [laughs] It had the familiarity of your home and place of birth and growing up and current living, so there was a circular impact—not just the linear impact that a canvas or a sculpture has. It had a profound impact on me.

CHICAGO: It has inspired projects all over the world. There’s even a digital Womanhouse and an exhibition of young artists influenced by it opening right now in Paris. Even though you and I likely didn’t meet at Womanhouse, our relationship goes back to the birth of feminist art. And now, here we are, both involved with the Sackler Center for Feminist Art.

STEINEM: One of the many rewards of age is seeing this growth of vines.

CHICAGO: It comes up a lot these days that young women run into obstacles that daunt them. We should discuss how we’re able to offer young people a model for how you can fight for change your whole life and not get discouraged. We watch again and again the very story The Dinner Party tells of erasure and pushing back. We still witness that after being part of a social movement where we actually felt we were going to make a permanent change.

STEINEM: In my case, it did feel like being struck by lightning when I first realized that I wasn’t crazy, that the system is crazy. I kept looking with new eyes, with hierarchy removed or at least questioned, and saying to myself, “This is so unjust and crazy and irrational that surely if we explain it to people they will want to change it.” That was a function of my naïveté because I was failing to see the depths of the entrenchment and the profiteering and the fact that, as they say with wisdom in Indian country, “It takes four generations to heal one act of violence.” What I didn’t understand at first was that being a part of a movement was not just a part of my life, it was my life. I say this to young women because I think it helps us to pace ourselves. We have to rest and jog and replenish and drink water and say hello to each other and have humor and companionship along the way. Also, we must understand that the end doesn’t justify the means—the means are the end. So if we don’t have a community and jokes and love and creativity along the way, we won’t have it at the end.

CHICAGO: One of the things I understood from early on was that art was a symbol of systemic inequity. The absence of women artists in our museums, or the marginalization of women in university curriculum, mirrors the everyday experience of women. In January, my New York gallery is going to show my series “PowerPlay” [1982–87], which is about the construct of masculinity. It’s going to be retitled “PowerPlay: A Prediction,” because what I think that women are beginning to see is a global system of male terrorism that is manifested in Afghanistan in stoning women who violate the canon, sequestering women, covering women; or in the Congo as systemic rape, as a weapon of war; and at a less severe level, sexual harassment and the abuse of power in Hollywood, in the military, and in the California legislature. The reason we have to do what you just described is because when we were working in the ’70s, we thought we were going to change everything right then and there. The Dinner Party tells that story of pushing forward, pushing backward, forward, backward—now we’re witnessing the pushing backward. I was just thinking about how I am sustained. You, Gloria, have a whole global network of support. I’ve been really isolated—I’ve had to be in order to think against the culture. But the stories of the women in The Dinner Party have sustained me. Their stories are stories of courage. I’m talking about figures like Elizabeth Blackwell, who was only admitted to medical school as a joke, and then endured two years of total isolation. Nobody spoke to her. Women spat at her on the street. I mean, what kind of courage did it take to stand up to that? If she could do it, I can do it. The 1,038 women represented in The Dinner Party offer an incredible path to courage and fortitude.

STEINEM: You seem to experience stories from history. I experience stories in the present, from different places in the world. I lived in India for two years, where I absorbed a populist, Gandhian revolution. When I went to visit a great global feminist of Gandhi’s era in the ’80s, I was talking about how well-suited Gandhian methods were to women’s movements. She listened to me patiently and finally said, “Well, my dear, we taught him everything he knew.” [laughs] It wasn’t really until the birth of the women’s movement in the United States that I could see that walking from village to village in India was a version of listening to women’s stories in living rooms here. Our brains are organized by narrative because we’ve been sitting around the campfire listening to stories for a hundred thousand years. I think it’s important to see the parallels, and to understand that our masculine and feminine roles are relatively new in human history. Both gender and race are inventions that go deep because we have been raised with them, but they are still inventions.

CHICAGO: One of the reasons for sharing these stories is to help imagine another future. One of the problems of being raised within a particular paradigm is that the education of that particular paradigm is presumed to be universal and there is no alternative.

STEINEM: Yes, which is utter bullshit. If we started to study humans when humans started, we would have a very different picture of what’s possible.

CHICAGO: My goal as an artist has been to create images in which the female experience is the path to the universal, as opposed to learning everything through the male gaze. The reason women spat on Elizabeth Blackwell was because they had been raised to believe that a woman doctor was obscene. The first step is freeing oneself from the prison of that gaze. While working on “PowerPlay,” I went to the library and looked up gender, and only women came up—as if only women had genders.

STEINEM: [laughs] That’s like saying only black people have race. It’s crazy.

CHICAGO: Absolutely! I think one of the real setbacks in the women’s movement was that women were more willing to raise their daughters as feminists than to teach their sons another way of being men.

STEINEM: I would add that women are only half responsible for children. Men raise children as much as women do. Until men are as nurturing as women are, and until women are as active outside the home as men are, we won’t have democratic families, and therefore we won’t have democracy, and we will continue this hierarchical notion of life.

CHICAGO: My husband, Donald, a truly radical man, talks about how men are rewarded for going along with the program, even if in their hearts they feel like the program is wrong and unjust and inequitable.

STEINEM: The men I know who are single fathers get much more help from the women around them, to put it mildly, than the women I know who are single mothers do from the men around them. You and I could go on forever on this subject. But let’s get back to The Dinner Party. It’s been showing for ten years now at the Brooklyn Museum, where I think I read that a million and a half people have seen it.

CHICAGO: I’m opening a show there called the “Roots of The Dinner Party,” which is the first look at my creative process in the making of it. The Dinner Party was shocking when it entered the world. It was female-centered art that took up a lot of space. As a result, it faced an uncertain future, even though it had traveled to six countries on six continents—that is, until Elizabeth Sackler intervened, acquired it, donated it to the Brooklyn Museum, and established the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art. The only comparable institution is the National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington, D.C., but these two small institutions can’t possibly accommodate all of the cultural production of women around the world.

STEINEM: I have to say, Judy, that since I’m a writer and only need a pencil, I have faced less adversity than you, whose creativity involves much more than that and is communal. I can report on people. Your practice involves an enormous level of different kinds of creativity.

CHICAGO: It’s no accident that in the three arts— literature, art, and music—literature was the first avenue in which women were able to excel because, as you said, it only takes a pencil and one other person, an editor who believes in you, to bring what you write into public view. In art, women could never get training. They couldn’t get their work out into the world even when they could get training. Music is the last of the three arts. For that, you need a huge apparatus of support.

STEINEM: I would add architecture, too.

CHICAGO: Of course! With architecture, you need millions and millions of dollars. Which leads me to a question to perfectly end this conversation: You once asked me what I would do if all monetary and geographic limits were lifted. So I’m asking you that, too.

STEINEM: I’d thought of that question for you before I thought of answering it myself! [laughs] I would love to see a kind of Alcoholics Anonymous system for women around the globe so that wherever women are, whether they are washing clothing on the rocks in a river in Rajasthan or in an office in England—wherever they are—they know that within their reach, not only online, but physically, there is a place every week where a small group of women, and men, too, if they are gathering in the feminist spirit, can meet to support each other, tell our stories, and suggest shared solutions. Movements grow like trees from the bottom up, not the top down. That’s how revolutions grow.

CHICAGO: Okay, my turn. If all the financial and geographic limits were lifted, I would separate art from commerce, and I would encourage artists around the world to make art that is accessible and understandable to the communities in which they live. I would encourage subjects relevant to their communities because I believe that art has incredible power. As long as it is linked to and controlled by marketplace values, communication is controlled and limited, and the power of human beings to make change and to make art that can contribute to change is prevented. Both of us have been working in our parallel ways to achieve these goals and that is why, even when we are apart, our lives represent parallel paths.",-2,https://www.interviewmagazine.com/uncategorized/feminist-art-icon-judy-chicago-isnt-done-fighting
89,Steinem,Gloria,teenvogue,"Hillary Rodham Clinton is the guest-editor of our Volume IV issue, on newsstands nationally December 5. She will keynote at the first-ever Teen Vogue Summit in conversation with actress, scholar, and activist Yara Shahidi. The Teen Vogue Summit will take place on December 1 & 2 in Los Angeles. Tickets and information are available here. Here, Gloria Steinem reflects on what Hillary's political career has taught her.

I first became aware of Hillary when she was a young attorney working with the congressional committee investigating President Richard Nixon. There were virtually no women doing what she was doing, so I remembered her name — Hillary Rodham. To this day, we’ve never sat down and had lunch together, but we have passed messages and shared hopes, and I suspect we feel we can depend on each other long-distance.

Hillary doesn’t play the game, but the irrationality of the current political game plays her. Whenever she’s been in a role for a while — for instance, in the White House or as a senator or as Secretary of State — her approval ratings soar. Yet the minute she aspires to something higher, those ratings drop. The bias against women who don’t play a “feminine” role could not be more obvious: Who does she think she is? How dare she aspire to something more?

Hillary doesn’t play the game, but the irrationality of the current political game plays her.

Supporting Hillary in the election was an easy decision: She may have been the most experienced presidential candidate in the history of the nation. But I did recognize that if I had supported Bernie Sanders, I would have been praised by the same people who condemned me for supporting Hillary. She and Bernie shared many of the same ideas, so it wasn’t as if there were a huge difference on issues. It’s the fact that women who deny themselves by supporting a man are always praised more by some people than those who affirm and support a woman.

On election night, I was sitting with a group of female ambassadors to the U.N., women from different continents, who were watching the results in New York. I could see from the faces around me that her defeat was devastating — not just in this country but worldwide. Yet I know that in the future, Hillary’s defeat will be part of our victories because the path up is always a jagged line, not a straight one. Our victory is not a one-person marathon but a relay race. When the first of many diverse women wins this highest of all democratic offices, she will be climbing steps that were carved out by Hillary. And everyone who has been inspired by her will activate talents that might have stayed dormant without her.

From Hillary, I learned courage, calm, and kindness — even when her own character was being attacked with fantastic lies. All you have to do is list the accusations against her and they fall from their own unspeakably ridiculous weight. I also learned the depth of hatred that comes when you break with centuries of hierarchy that starts with sex and race.

And above all, I learned to keep going and to stay true to yourself.

92,Steinem,Gloria,msmagazine,"Out of sight may mean out of mind—and heart. For women in prison, this is the tragedy. For the rest of us, this invisibility keeps us from realizing how much women in prison may resemble you and me: Most women in prison are not a danger to society. About 82 percent have been convicted of non-violent crimes. Two-thirds have dependent children.

We at Ms. magazine decided to let women in prison know they are seen and valued. We started a program to benefit women in prison, which was extended to cover women in domestic violence shelters as well. Shelters can be nearly as isolating, often lacking libraries or any reading material, just as many prisons do.

That’s why the Ms. Magazine Prison and Domestic Violence Shelter Program was formed.

We send Ms.to 4,853 federal, state and county prisoners and to hundreds of shelters. That’s a fraction of the total, but it’s a number we’re proud of and keep growing because of support from Ms. readers like you.

We see the importance of this work through the letters we receive:

“You have been a wonderful, bright spot in an otherwise bleak existence. The prison I am currently incarcerated at places copies of your magazine out in the library for the inmates. I spend as much time as possible in there, so I’m always one of the first to snag one.” – Katherine Holmes, Tennessee

It is funded by charitable contributions earmarked for this purpose, and also by Ms. community members who buy an extra membership for a friend they don’t know.

Please make a tax-deductible contribution to the Ms. Prison and Domestic Violence Shelter Program. Let women on the inside know they are not alone. And let women in shelters know it’s unfair for them to be deprived of home while the criminal is free.",-2,http://msmagazine.com/blog/2017/10/23/help-us-send-ms-women-prisons-domestic-violence-shelters/

94,Steinem,Gloria,vanityfair,"Gigi Hadid proved she’s becoming an old pro on the runway at Anna Sui’s show on Monday night. The model strutted down the runway wearing a sequin dress and feather-lined coat, and upon closer look, only one shoe. According to Glamour, one of Hadid’s heels wasn’t properly secured after she went through a head-to-toe quick change, causing the shoe to fall off her just as she came out from backstage. The model improvised by walking on her toes for the rest of the show.

This wasn’t Hadid’s first time battling harsh runway elements. While walking the Moschino show in Milan back in February, Hadid’s dress got caught on her heel, but she was able to break free before any major stumbling took place. A year earlier, during her Milan debut, Hadid stepped out onto the Versace runway in a black gown that slipped down a little too far and exposed one of her breasts. All was well though, as Donatella Versace high-fived her at the end of the show and Hadid sent out a playful tweet saying, “Wadrobe [sic] malfunctions happen on the runway every day of fw & are...unfortunate,lol,but let’s talk instead about the new VERSACE CHOKERS.”

A lot can go wrong on the runway, but Gigi Hadid has been good at proving she’s prepared for anything—missing shoes included.",-2,https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/09/gigi-hadid-anna-sui-missing-shoe-nyfw

96,Steinem,Gloria,nzherald,"One of the founders of the modern feminist movement Gloria Steinem.

Fifty years after she became America’s most famous feminist, Gloria Steinem tells Gaby Wood why the fight is far from over.

One evening last month, the Emmanuel Centre in central London was filling up with women of all ages. The man who'd organised the event hovered outside, cheerfully attempting to spot people of his own sex. There were only one or two. ""This is not a football match,"" he said, grinning as a 1200-strong crowd swarmed past him.

The occasion: Emma Watson, the 25-year-old actress and UN goodwill ambassador for women, was due to interview the 82-year-old feminist, Gloria Steinem. When they came on stage, sleekly dressed, it was immediately clear who was the more nervous. ""It only hit me 20 seconds ago that this was really happening,"" said Watson, in awe of her interlocutor.

She needn't have worried. Steinem's life has been spent asking other women about theirs. No sooner had Watson brushed past the notion that women can feel bad about themselves than Steinem brought her back to it, calmly turning the tables. ""Well, would you like to address that?"" she asked. Before long, Watson was confessing that she hated her bushy eyebrows and saying she felt pressurised to pretend she was nothing like Hermione in Harry Potter, when really she was just the same.

Steinem, who usually lives in New York, was in Britain to talk about her memoir, My Life On The Road. The tour involved speaking to a much younger generation of feminists: Watson, to begin with, then students in Oxford and Cambridge, in conversation with Everyday Sexism founder Laura Bates. Steinem evaded the notion of passing a torch - ""we all have a torch"", she said - but it was heartening to see how many young admirers she has, because for years a backlash seemed to have sounded a death knell for feminism and, if there's a new wave, its members couldn't hope for a more generous or good-humoured role model.

Once, Steinem was the most famous feminist in America. Now it's often said that her contribution is hard to place, because she hasn't written a groundbreaking book, as Betty Friedan did with The Feminine Mystique or Germaine Greer did with The Female Eunuch. But it's also because she's not a screecher, nor an exhibitionist, and most of what she's achieved has been done with others. That's the whole point of a movement.

Even Steinem's most famous quip is only ever quoted in part. When a reporter told her, 42 years ago, that she didn't look 40, she said: ""This is what 40 looks like."" But she also said, ""We've been lying so long, who would know?"" By halving the quote, her point about women's collective pressure to pretend was turned into a proud response about her own good looks.

Those looks themselves came in for criticism, of course (the sisterhood has rarely been short on sibling rivalry). Her hair and nails received a level of attention that never came the way of her New York magazine colleague Tom Wolfe - though he must have spent more time choosing his outfits than Steinem ever did.

Yet she is always open to the possibility of a joke. Her seminal 1963 investigation into Hugh Hefner's domain had a wry tone that's absent from most undercover reportage. Her witty riff, ""If Men Could Menstruate"", rivals Woody Allen - and even turned Martin Amis into a self-described feminist.

Though she started out as a newspaper columnist - and, in 1972, co-founded a magazine, Ms. - she now describes herself as an organiser, or an activist. Much of her work has been on the ground all along, helping to set up history-shifting conferences like the one in Houston in 1977, encouraging workers to speak to their bosses, campaigning for equal rights and better pay.

Gloria Steinem wearing a Playboy bunny costume in 1960.

She has been more like a union leader than a journalist, though her capacity for infiltration into the world of the oppressors is unusual. It's hard to imagine [British unionist] Arthur Scargill applying for a job as a Playboy bunny.

This is the woman who greets me the morning after the Watson event, signing books in her publisher's office. There is almost too much to talk about - if we're going to discuss issues that concern women, the frontiers are numerous. At one point, I ask Steinem why the women's movement was perceived as mostly white and middle-class if, as she has said, the reality was different.

""Books,"" she replies. ""It was white, middle-class women writing books. I mean, I love books, but ... For instance, the first big group of women doing feminist activism that I remember meeting were welfare mothers. They had done the first analysis of welfare policy I'd ever seen - analysing the welfare system as a gigantic husband that looked under your bed for the shoes of other men, gave you just enough money to survive ... it was funny and wonderful and smart. They were pioneers. But they didn't write a book.""

Though any political movement can become more about rhetoric than strategy, Steinem's grasp on specific issues is sharp, and her solutions clear. On the question of work, she says that of course access to employment is key - women shouldn't be confined to ""what used to be called the pink-collar ghetto - service jobs, help jobs and so on"". But it doesn't all have to be about boardrooms; we should also be valuing the work women already do.

""Caregiving, nurturing, taking care of elderly relatives and invalids - which is something like a third of the productive work in my country - is economically invisible,"" she says. ""We couldn't get on without it, and it's often the case that caring for elderly relatives and invalids at home is better for them and better for the economy. We could reward that.

""You attribute an economic value to care-giving at replacement level, and make that tax-deductible if you pay taxes, and tax-refundable if you're too poor to pay taxes. So it replaces the idea of welfare to some extent. That allows you to value care-giving culturally and account for it in your economic planning.""

Later, when I refer to second-wave feminism, Steinem points out that she never uses the phrase. She finds such terms ""divisive and over-generalised. It doesn't honour the young woman from a Mormon family - she's practically a first-wave feminist because she's overcome such difficulty,"" she explains. ""Nor does it recognise the woman who's come from three generations of feminists and had a whole different experience.""

An Evening with Gloria Steinem and Emma Watson in London, Britain.

I wonder if Steinem is ever disappointed by the decisions she sees women making now. She looks a little uncomfortable. ""Yeah,"" she replies, ""but it's not for me to ... "" What about a woman who takes her husband's name, I ask - does she consider that to be backsliding? (The December 1973 issue of Ms. carried a feature instructing women how to get their maiden names back. It was entitled ""Give Yourself Your Own Name For Christmas"".) With effortless irony, Steinem says: ""I mean, I would just want to make sure she's thought of the fact that there may be three or four women with her name, eventually."" After divorce? I ask, dimly. ""Yeah,"" she says, laughing.

So when she sees post-feminists, or post-post-feminists ... I begin. Steinem gently interrupts me.

""There is no such thing as post-feminism,"" she says.

Because we're still in it? I ask.

""Yeah.""

This, to her, is obvious. After all, she says, if it took women a century to get a legal identity as human beings, legal equality may take another century. ""And after that, there's equality of daily life and parenting and so on,"" she adds.

Okay, I say, attempting to rephrase my question. Can we talk about young women who've enjoyed the benefits from what your generation did but don't realise what kind of fight got them there?

Women get more radical with age. And men get more conservative. People look at younger women and think if they're not radical there's something wrong with them. No, they just haven't experienced the problems yet.

Gloria Steinem

Steinem shrugs. ""Listen,"" she says amiably, ""I did not walk around saying: 'Thank you for the vote'. No. I got mad about what was happening to me.""

What if they're not mad?

""They're 20,"" she replies. ""Chances are [by that age] you haven't been discriminated against that much in the labour force. Maybe you don't yet have children and you haven't experienced how unequal and difficult that is. It's why, in a general way, women get more radical with age. And men get more conservative. People look at younger women and think if they're not radical there's something wrong with them. No, they just haven't experienced the problems yet.""

Steinem herself was once in this position. As a single young woman with exactly the job she wanted, she thought ""everything had been solved decades earlier by boring, asexual suffragists"". Then she realised the fight was far from over.

So does she say to young women, ""Just you wait""? Steinem shakes her head.

Condescension is not her style. ""I would try to identify things they're really experiencing. Do you feel as safe in the street as a man would? Probably not. Do you feel your body is okay in the same way a man would without alteration? Probably not. We can raise each other's consciousness by addressing what is going on, without expecting someone to have the same knowledge they will have later on.""

Steinem's mother, Ruth, suffered her first nervous breakdown four years before Steinem was born. After that, she was never free of depression and became addicted to a liquid tranquilliser. Steinem always thought of Ruth as someone ""to be worried about and cared for"". Steinem's father was a travelling salesman with a cartoonish sense of adventure and quixotic plans for making a fast buck. Although she remembers him with great love, there was a point at which he could no longer look after his wife.

Later, as she put it in an essay called Ruth's Song, Steinem understood that no one had tried to solve her mother's problem because ""her functioning was not that necessary to the world ... she was not an important worker"".

Steinem's sister was 9 years older, and left home before Steinem was 10. That's when her father chose to leave too, and Steinem spent seven years with her mostly bedridden mother, taking care of her alone.

Did she fear she would inherit her mother's depression? I ask.

Gloria Steinem is an American feminist, journalist and activist who was recognised as a spokeswoman for the feminist movement in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

""To me she was not crazy, she had just had her spirit broken. I don't think mental illness was part of her life. I think patriarchy did her in.""

It was only years after she'd made her escape that Steinem heard about her mother's former life - how she'd been a journalist and had had to give up her career; how she'd fallen in love with another man but couldn't leave Steinem's father. Steinem asked her why she hadn't broken free. ""Then you wouldn't have been born,"" her mother replied. And Steinem thought: ""But you would have been born instead.""

Cod psychology might suggest this was why Steinem - who in her 60s was married to the English businessman, David Bale, for three years, until his death in 2003 - never had children of her own. She had, in a sense, already been a mother since the family roles had been reversed. ""I think if you early on become the parent rather than the child, the downside is obvious but the up-side is that you feel like your own self earlier,"" she says.

In any case, feminism fought for a woman's right to do what she wants with her body, and not to have to use it for reproduction - so it seems wrong to ask Steinem if there was a reason why she didn't have children. But I ask anyway.

""I just discovered I didn't have to,"" she says, laughing. ""In my generation you were crazy if you did not marry and have children. And I happened to have one elderly cousin who did not marry and did not have children, and was crazy. So I believed I had to. And only later I realised: not everyone has to live the same way. For a while I still imagined I would adopt a child. In my mind, the child was always a 7 or 8-year-old little girl. And finally, un-introspective as I am, I had to realise that was me: I was trying to save myself at that age.""

And what about her sister? I ask. What was her relationship to the women's movement?

""Her time of basic decision-making - getting married and having children - preceded the movement,"" Steinem explains. ""I think she was trying to create a secure family that we did not have, in a different way. So she had six children,"" she pauses. ""And after that she went to law school. That, I think, she would not have been able to do if it hadn't been for the movement.""

97,Steinem,Gloria,cosmopolitan,"Every writer, truth-seeker, parent, and activist I know is in love with one or more books by Anne Lamott. There are 17 of them, including such classic guides to real life as , , , , and , and such novels as and .

Though I myself am a writer who hasn't made it even to the double digits, I could never find it in my heart to envy Anne Lamott. That's because she writes as naturally as she breathes, she explores the mysterious paths and detours of life itself, and she reports back to make the way ahead easier for all of us.

A long time ago, I read Enemies of Promise by Cyril Connolly, the English writer and literary critic. He said that one mark of great writing is simple: It cannot be imitated. Its style is so transparent that, like water in a glass, it is not separate from its content. That's why stylists like Ernest Hemingway or Tom Wolfe are so often imitated, yet E. M. Forster and Alice Walker are not. This insight made Connolly aware that he himself was not a great writer but he could recognize people who were.

I bet that, if this wise man were with us still, he would say that Anne Lamott is a great writer. Her style and content are as inseparable as water in a glass.

Though the two of us live on opposite coasts and know each other only through writing, this gift of email dialogue, on the occasion of her new book, , feels as intimate as sitting down together. In a way, we have been doing that for years. I keep learning a lot from the clear and great Annie Lamott.

I think you will too.

You are that most subversive of writers, a deep philosopher who dares to be understandable. Were you ever tempted by the long tradition of philosophical and theological obfuscation?

Thank you for saying this but I don't see myself as a deep philosopher. The things I write about tend to be what we all have to face, or consider, or experience, that I talk about with my friends and brothers. It's universal stuff, told in my own voice, my own details and truth, which is all I have to offer.

We are going to die, as is everyone we adore — I hate this! But the question is, how do we live as women and men in the face of this? Why do we let ourselves be so distracted and obsessed by meaningless B.S. in light of having one short, precious life? When are we going to wake up and be fully alive to each other and nature and magic and wonder and Life with a capital L? When will we stop hitting the snooze button? And then, how alive are we willing to be?

I never thought I'd be a fancy philosopher because I dropped out of college. (I went to Goucher in Baltimore for two years when it was a women's college, where I was radicalized by feminist professors but wanted to pursue the dream of being a writer. I was 19, and people had accidentally mentioned that to be a writer, you had to be a house cleaner and waitress first, for years.)

And I had NO interest in being a theologian, especially not a Christian, as I had been raised by progressive atheists. We bowed down every morning to the golden calf of the New York Times, Noam Chomsky, Hannah Arendt. I tried to get my parents to respect and nourish me, let alone delight in me, so even though I secretly loved and believed in the Divine Something — Goodness, Good Orderly Direction, Gift of Desperation, the Cosmic Muffin (from the Deteriorata — Google it) — I wasn't ready yet to commit myself to the study of a higher power.

Since you write from such wisdom, the biggest leap for the reader is to understand that you didn't always have it — that self-doubt, alcoholism, and bulimia were paths to learning. Is it always crucial to take the reader with you on this journey?

As I said above, the stuff I write about is pretty universal, the things my closest friends and I talk about — our anxiety about being here on this scary planet, during these scary times, as vulnerable as kittens, having lost so many people I couldn't live without. Many of my closest friends are staunch feminists AND have struggled with eating disorders, whether bulimia or an addiction to diets, or Bad Body Thoughts. They secretly get on the bathroom scale every morning, which is like asking Dick Cheney for his opinion of your worth as a woman and human being. Then they take to the streets to march for abortion rights and justice and equality — or at least I do. My theology is based on what I tell my Sunday-school kids — that they are loved and chosen, AS IS, now, today. That the moment is holy, sacred, and all there is — and that we are only as sick as our secrets. So TELL IT. This was how the women's movement saved me, when I was 16 and read the first issue of Ms. magazine. Women and girls gathering to TELL IT, tell the truth, of who we were in our deepest inside places, not on the surface, not who we had agreed to be because the culture dictated beauty and value, not so men in power would validate us and stamp our Approval Cards. But who we knew or were committed to discovering who we had been born to be. That we were going to live in our Truth, celebrate our diversity and uniqueness and unity. That we were about holiness and passion, brilliance, ordinariness, solidarity, peace — and that we were just a TINY bit angry.

You manage to squeeze the very best out of monotheism in general, and Christianity in particular. This means leaping over such barriers as, if God is man, man is God, and also heaven as a patriarchal invention to give men the edge: Yes, women give life, but only men can give everlasting life. Have you ever been tempted to just say God is in all living things and become a pagan?

I always secretly believed in Something Or Other, and tried all through my 20s to find a home on an Eastern path (partly because my parents lived the Beat poets, so I grew up on Allen Ginsberg and Alan Watts. They were Buddhists, which was OK to the atheist parents).

But at the end of my drinking, I liked to go to the flea market near Sausalito, because greasy food is so comforting when you are hungover. I could hear these old hymns wafting from this ramshackle church across the road, songs that our family idols sung — the Weavers, Pete Seeger, Odetta, Joan Baez, the voices of the civil rights movement, in which my parents were so involved. So I wasn't seeking a church or Jesus — just respite from my disease and mental problems. There were about 50 people at the church, half black, half white, all liberal civil rights and Vietnam activists people. Way more women than men, lots of old black women from the South, via the Great Migration. And they didn't hassle me, or threaten me with home visits, or make me take classes, so I could figure out who shot the Holy Ghost.

They just let me be, and fed me, and loved me. I was very slowly restored by the love of gentle do-gooders, and a year later, in 1986, I got sober, and eventually got baptized. So I swear, IT WAS AN ACCIDENT!

I don't believe in dividing everything into two, but there do seem to be two kinds of people — those who see the universe as welcoming, and those who see it as hostile. I've always assumed this had to do with how we were raised, yet you seem to have traveled from a hostile childhood to a friendly place, thus allowing readers to do the same. Does what I've just said make any sense at all?

I had very progressive parents but they had a terrible marriage. There was alcoholism, black belt co-dependence. And my mother is from Liverpool, which is its own Monty Python craziness. (There are special 12-step meetings for children of the English...). The world was so hostile to me — I was savagely bullied for having kinky hair, and weighing about 10 pounds, and skipping a grade. I started getting migraines at 5 years old. And to survive all these fearful mean things, and to save my family, two brothers, unhappy parents, I became addicted to high achievement and people-pleasing. Was a champion tennis player, etc. I had to make my family look good.

So I knew that the world was a harsh place, and my family was a mess, and even though I danced as fast as I could, I did not feel welcome, did not feel the great Shalom. THIS WORLD WAS NEVER A GOOD MATCH FOR ME. But my belief was that there was a loving magical energy in the world – seen in Nature's beauty and awesomeness, my best girl and women friends, art, music.

You have a gift for such super-concentrated phrases as, ""Be where your butt is,"" ""a rosary of loss,"" ""expectations are resentments under construction,"" and ""the necessary mercy to experience self-respect."" If you poured water on any one of them, it would become an essay. How do they come to you?

I make myself available for creativity, and I cultivate spaciousness through the outdoors, meditation, reading a lot of poetry. Then I get my butt into the desk chair, and through bribes and threats, I sit and wait while ideas and phrases get knit together inside my spirit and heart and mind. One day, I was just sitting bitterly at my desk, with no ideas, and something inside me said, ""Laughter is carbonated holiness."" And I looked around for the sound.

So you have to be paying attention for ideas to come — 50 percent of the struggle. Then the ideas tug on my shirt sleeve to get my attention, and then I scribble it down into a shitty first draft — which is where all good writing starts.

You make clear that mercy is radical kindness, that it isn't and doesn't have to be deserved, that it brings us to the miracle of apology. For women, I often think the Golden Rule should be reversed: We must learn to treat ourselves as well as we treat others. Do you have special advice for women on how to be as merciful toward ourselves as we are toward others?

That's about 90 percent of my theological life — radical self-care. Put your own oxygen mask on first. I watch the self-talk that goes through my mind, and if I am being critical with myself, I shake myself out of it. I do for myself exactly what I would do for you — make a lovely cup of tea, or a hot bath, or go buy myself a fabulous pair of socks. I believe that you take the action, and THEN the insight follows — I do loving things for me, stroke my own shoulder, put myself down for a short nap, and the insight follows: that I am a wild precious woman, a human merely being, as e e cummings put it, deserving of respect, tenderness, protection, delight, and solidarity. And that is what Home looks like for me now.

98,Steinem,Gloria,huffingtonpost,"Recently in an El Paso, Texas courthouse, Irvin Gonzalez was waiting for a hearing on her request for a protective order. A 31-year-old transgender woman, Gonzalez was nervous about seeing her abusive ex-boyfriend.

A caseworker from a women’s shelter, who had driven her to the courthouse, told her that he might not show up and that if he did, he wouldn’t be allowed near her. “I felt very safe and protected in the court,” she told The New Yorker magazine.

But then there was a commotion. Six agents from the Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE), likely acting on a tip from her ex-boyfriend, had come for her. There was no warrant or her arrest; she isn’t one of President Trump’s “bad hombres.” She is an undocumented immigrant who sought protection from a man who had brutally beaten her several times.

“This is really unprecedented,” El Paso County Attorney Jo Anne Bernal told The Washington Post. Never before in her 23-year career had ICE agents shown up at a protective order hearing.

The mantra of the modern movement to end domestic violence is: You are not alone. Gonzalez’s arrest sends a different message: face further abuse or get deported. This is cruel and untenable choice. It’s also dangerous; already, far too few undocumented victims seek protection.

This is cruel and untenable choice. It’s also dangerous; already, far too few undocumented victims seek protection.

The full effects of President Trump’s crackdown on refugees, Muslim travelers, and undocumented immigrants aren’t yet clear. But one thing is certain: like many assaults on human rights and human dignity, it will disproportionately harm women. This month we recognize and celebrate the contribution women have made to our country.

Let’s mark Women’s History Month by reminding our political leaders that immigration and refugee protection are women’s issues.

As part of their effort to depict refugees as a threat to Americans, President Trump and other politicians have claimed that most of those fleeing Syria are young males. In fact, half of Syrian refugees — like all refugees worldwide — are women, and unlike men, they’re often forced to flee because of gender-based persecution such as rape, honor killing, forced marriage, and genital mutilation. And when they flee, they’re also vulnerable to sexual assault and sexual harassment from border security officials and detention center guards.

The President’s effort to shut out Muslims has attracted the bulk of attention. Overlooked are his moves that will further restrict the rights of refugees who cross the country’s southern border. A 2015 report by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) found that women face a “startling” degree of violence in Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Mexico. Rape, assault, extortion, and threats by armed criminal groups are prevalent.

Yet many women — after taking the courageous step to defy their persecutors and seek asylum in the United States — have received neither the protection they need nor the humane treatment they deserve. The Obama Administration locked up thousands of women refugees from Central America, along with their young children, in jail-like detention centers. So-called “family detention” inhibits the effort of persecuted women to receive asylum and compounds their trauma. On several occasions, refugee women in detention facilities have gone on hunger strikes to protest inhumane conditions, including sexual assault by guards.

President Trump’s executive order on border security will lead to a massive increase in detention of refugees and build on the already-high barriers to asylum. Along with the travel ban and the roundup of undocumented immigrants, this order poses a grave threat to the rights and wellbeing of women.

This order poses a grave threat to the rights and wellbeing of women.

In his speech to Congress, the President indicated a willingness to compromise on deportation. One would hope that we could all agree that abused women like Irvin Gonzalez should not be deported as a cost for seeking protection. After all, unprosecuted domestic abuse is an insidious cancer that kills not only women but also children, of immigrants and citizens alike. As it happens, domestic abuse is ALS the most reliable predictor of all other violence; especially what might be called Supremacy Crimes that have no motive other than proving superiority.

But sufficient pushback against the President’s anti-immigrant agenda won’t happen without intensified activism and advocacy from both women and men.

Let us mark Women’s History Month by letting our political leaders know that we refuse to accept policies that treat the lives of women as disposable because they weren’t born in the United States. We refuse the lie that undocumented immigrants commit more crimes per capita than U.S. citizens. In fact, the truth is the other way around.

When women request protection from violence — in an American courtroom or at an American border — the U.S. government should live up to its ideals and provide it.",-2,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/an-indefensible-silence-on-domestic-abuse-in-the-undocumented-community_us_58c6f99ee4b0428c7f125916

Emma Watson and Other Celebrities Who Wore Red on International Women’s Day

Paint the town red!

Female celebs were out in full force yesterday in honour of International Women’s Day (IWD), and their outfits all had one thing in common—the colour red. The organizers of the Women’s March on Washington launched a new campaign, Day Without Women, encouraging women around the world to strike from work and wear red on March 8th to show their solidarity with the movement. Hillary Clinton got the memo; she wore a pantsuit in this powerful hue for her speech at the Girls Inc. luncheon in New York. Hollywood sprung into action, too.

Emma Watson posted a selfie sitting in the back of a car wearing a red sweater and matching beret, while holding a copy of New York Times bestseller My Life on the Road by Gloria Steinem. “Today I’m a red-striking ninja book-fairy out to spread some wise women’s words. Happy International Women’s Day!” she captioned the shot.

Khloé Kardashian posted a pic on Instagram wearing a sexy body-con red dress featuring a plunging neckline. Her makeup was glowy perfection with an emphasis on lashes and glossy lips.

Brie Larson wore a ruby red halter-neck gown to the Los Angeles premiere of her new movie Kong: Skull Island.

Thank you Los Angeles!!! ??? @kongskullislandmovie #internationalwomensday A post shared by Brie (@brielarson) on Mar 8, 2017 at 8:40pm PST

Kerry Washington was on set at work, but took a few minutes in between takes to pose in a red sweatshirt and matching sunnies in celebration of IWD. “At work to support my bad*ss boss lady and all the women in our work world but I’m wearing red in solidarity with my sisters! #ADayWithoutAWoman #womensmarch #Resist,” she captioned the shot. ICYMI: Washington’s “bad*ass boss lady” is Shonda Rimes.

Eva Longoria teamed a bright red top featuring a cool cut-out with a pencil skirt and killer heels for a panel discussion on women in the workforce at an International Women’s Day event.

International Women's Day is meant to celebrate the social, economic, cultural, and political successes of women while urging more gender equality!

Anne Hathaway was outfitted in red, too, for her speech at the United Nations. Wearing a wrap dress in this power hue, the A-list actress passionately spoke about maternity leave and motherhood. “The assumption and common practice that women and girls look after the home and the family is a stubborn and very real stereotype that not only discriminates against women, but limits men’s participation and connection within the family and society. Why do we continue to undervalue fathers and overburden mothers? Paid parental leave is not about taking days off work. It’s about creating the freedom to define roles, to choose how to invest time and to establish new positive cycles of behavior,” she said during her 12-minute address. Watch Hathaway’s entire speech here.

Katy Perry started celebrating several days before IWD. For her iHeart Music Awards performance on Sunday, March 5, the pop star rocked out in a red fringed Stella McCartney look. It’s the kind of look that makes a girl want to get up and ???.

Having a career can be both rewarding and challenging for anyone, but look closer at modern working life and it isn’t long before differences become apparent in the treatment, expectation, understanding, and assignment of women in the workplace. These biases do not stem from any one workplace, boss, or co-worker. They are part of a larger set of cultural norms, histories, policies, and societal beliefs, that still impact working women, no matter how much any individual woman may try to lean in or have it all.

Acknowledgement is the first step to creating a better work ecosystem where people of all genders are considered equal. The sooner we acknowledge that long-held-to cultural beliefs and practices still attribute to the struggle of women in the workplace, the sooner we can move forward and see problems for what they are. Having a career can be challenging for women in ways that must be understood before they can be dealt with, every step of the way, by women in at all stages, and types of work.

This is a list of books designed to empower women, from a variety of viewpoints and workplaces. Some of the books focus on how to get ahead, some focus on achieving “live balance,” some are funny, some are profound, some are observations of famous successful women, and some are professional advice on how to deal with difficult subjects women often struggle with.

Whether you’re reading these books yourself or buying them for a friend, it is my hope that that they will give the working women who read them a context for many of the challenges they face, and a framework for moving forward together.

And for those of you who think you’re too busy to read, I must stress that it’s always worth it to broaden your mind and perspective, even if only a little at a time. Developing a lifelong habit of reading is one of the best things you can do–not only for your career, but for your own personal wellbeing. And with the convenience of reading from your Kindle, your phone, or even listening to Audible during your daily commute, reading insightful books can easily become a cherished part of your life.

This practical, hands-on book reveals the ways in which working women often underestimate and sabotage themselves, based on lessons learned in childhood (the “nice girl” mentality). The book then covers specific tactics to overcoming career roadblocks that are often specific to women.

Lois P. Frankel teaches readers how to eliminate these unconscious mistakes and offers coaching tips that can easily be incorporated into social and business skills. Hundreds of thousands of women have found career opportunities they never thought possible-at every stage of their career, from entry-level to the corner office.

Mistake #21: Multi-tasking. Just because you can do something, doesn’t mean you should do it.

Mistake #54: Failure to negotiate. Don’t equate negotiation with confrontation.

Mistake #82: Asking permission. Children, not adults, ask for approval. Be direct, be confident.

When Anne-Marie Slaughter accepted her dream job as the first female director of policy planning at the U.S. State Department in 2009, she was confident she could juggle the demands of her position in Washington, D.C., with the responsibilities of her family life in suburban New Jersey. Her husband and young sons encouraged her; she had a tremendously supportive boss, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton; and she had been moving up on a high-profile career track since law school. But then life intervened.

The reactions to her choice to leave Washington because of her kids led her to question the feminist narrative she grew up with. Her article for The Atlantic, “Why Women Still Can’t Have It All,” created a firestorm, sparked intense national debate, and became one of the most-read pieces in the magazine’s history.

Now, Anne-Marie Slaughter returns with her vision for what true equality between men and women really means, and how we can get there. She uncovers the missing piece of the puzzle, presenting a new focus that can reunite the women’s movement and provide a common banner under which both men and women can advance and thrive. With moving personal stories, individual action plans, and a broad outline for change, Anne-Marie Slaughter reveals a future in which all of us can finally finish the business of equality for women and men, work and family.

This book is a practical and scientific approach to not giving up. It’s a powerful shot-in-the-arm for women and anyone looking for the secret to finding and doing meaningful work.

Pioneering psychologist Angela Duckworth shows that the secret to outstanding achievement is not talent but a blend of passion and persistence called “grit.” Duckworth takes readers into the field to visit cadets struggling through their first days at West Point, teachers working in some of the toughest schools, and young finalists in the National Spelling Bee. She also mines fascinating insights from history and shows what can be gleaned from modern experiments in peak performance. Finally, she shares what she’s learned from interviewing dozens of high achievers.

Among Grit’s most valuable insights:

Why any effort you make ultimately counts twice toward your goal

How grit can be learned, regardless of I.Q. or circumstances

How lifelong interest is triggered

How much of optimal practice is suffering and how much ecstasy

Which is better for your child—a warm embrace or high standards

This book profiles over 100 influential and creative women from all ages, races, backgrounds, and industries. Chock-full of practical, inspirational advice for those looking to forge their own paths, these interviews detail the keys to success (for example, going with your gut; maintaining meaningful and lasting relationships), highlight the importance of everyday rituals (meditating; creating a daily to-do list), and dispense advice for the next generation of women entrepreneurs and makers (stay true to what you believe in; have patience). The book is rounded out with hundreds of lush, original photographs of the women in their work spaces.

How many times have you been in a workplace conversation, review, or meeting where the stakes were high and you couldn’t find the words to get your point across, or counter an argument or attack against your idea? Being on the same page with others in a conversation is an important, ongoing dance that changes depending on what is said and the context.

This book addresses how we attempt or avoid difficult conversations every day-whether dealing with an underperforming employee, disagreeing with a spouse, or negotiating with a client. From the Harvard Negotiation Project, the organization that brought you Getting to Yes, Difficult Conversations provides a step-by-step approach to having those tough conversations with less stress and more success. you’ll learn how to:

Decipher the underlying structure of every difficult conversation

Start a conversation without defensiveness

Listen for the meaning of what is not said

Stay balanced in the face of attacks and accusations

Move from emotion to productive problem solving

Part manual, part manifesto, Feminist Fight Club is a hilarious yet incisive guide to navigating subtle sexism at work, providing real-life career advice and humorous reinforcement for a new generation of professional women.

Hard-hitting and entertaining, Feminist Fight Club blends personal stories with research, statistics, and no-bullsh*t expert advice. Bennett offers a new vocabulary for the sexist workplace archetypes women encounter everyday—such as the Manterrupter who talks over female colleagues in meetings or the Himitator who appropriates their ideas—and provides practical hacks for navigating other gender landmines in today’s working world. With original illustrations, Feminist Mad Libs, a Negotiation Cheat Sheet, and fascinating historical research, Feminist Fight Club tackles both the external (sexist) and internal (self-sabotaging) behaviors that plague women in the workplace—as well as the system that perpetuates them.

Ever wondered how society got this way? Why women’s work is often undervalued? Why women who show emotion are sometimes considered hysterical, while men are considered grounded? This book has the answers.

With cool humor and rich intellect, Gloria Steinem strips bare our social constructions of gender and race, explaining just how limiting these invented cultural identities can be.

In the first section, Steinem imagines how our understanding of human psychology would be different in a witty reversal: What if Freud had been a woman who inflicted biological inferiority on men (think “womb envy”)?

Steinem presents positive examples of people who turn stereotypes on their heads, from a female bodybuilder to Mahatma Gandhi, whose followers absorbed his wisdom that change starts at the bottom.

This inspiring book’s discussions are centered on the practical, well-lived life. From the perspective of nineteen indigenous women, this book offers interpretations of such topics as ceremony, governance, womanhood, love, and acceptance.

Author and activist, the late Wilma Mankiller has garnered the thoughts these women–a physician, an attorney, ranchers, professors of American Indian studies, an urban planner, a cultural anthropologist, artists, poets, musicians, and an Onondaga Clan Mother– who reflect on many topics. Spirituality, which connects all indigenous peoples, means respect for the earth and all living things. Land is crucial to all tribes, as shown by the Dann sisters, Shoshone ranchers struggling to defend the sacred ceremonial grounds of their ancestors, and Sarah James, who fights for her Gwich’in tribal rights to protect caribou birthing grounds from oil and gas exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Profound yet simple words from strong women working hard to perpetuate their culture, and who have a lot to share, and who need to be heard.

From existential to practical, this book explores one of the world’s most influential women (Arianna Huffington) and her awakening and re-evaluation of success after an unexpected emergency drove her to look further for the meaning of life, work, family, and balance.

Our relentless pursuit of the two traditional metrics of success — money and power — has led to an epidemic of burnout and stress-related illnesses, and an erosion in the quality of our relationships, family life, and, ironically, our careers. In being connected to the world 24/7, we‘re losing our connection to what truly matters. Our current definition of success is, as Thrive shows, literally killing us. We need a new way forward.

In this deeply personal book, Arianna talks candidly about her own challenges with managing time and prioritizing the demands of a career and raising two daughters — of juggling business deadlines and family crises, a harried dance that led to her collapse and to her “aha moment.” Drawing on the latest groundbreaking research and scientific findings in the fields of psychology, sports, sleep, and physiology that show the profound and transformative effects of meditation, mindfulness, unplugging, and giving, Arianna shows us the way to a revolution in our culture, our thinking, our workplace, and our lives.

This memoir is for all the nerdy women who’ve ever felt isolated, awkward, or unsure if they’ve chosen the right path.

When Felicia Day was a girl, all she wanted was to connect with other kids. Growing up in the Deep South, where she was “home-schooled for hippie reasons,” she looked online to find her tribe. The Internet was in its infancy and she became an early adopter at every stage of its growth—finding joy and unlikely friendships in the emerging digital world. Her relative isolation meant that she could pursue passions like gaming, calculus, and 1930’s detective novels without shame. Her unusual background gave her the naïve confidence to forge her own path and launch her career as one of the most influen­tial creators in new media.

Ever candid, this funny, honest, and refreshing book reveals personal struggles and triumphs, recounting battles with writer’s block, a full-blown gaming addiction, severe anxiety, and depression—and how she reinvented herself when overachieving became overwhelming.

This book is proof that everyone should celebrate what makes them different and be brave enough to share it with the world, because anything is possible now—even for digital misfits.

Bonus Read — 11. Rejected Princesses: Tales of History’s Boldest Heroines, Hellions, and Heretics By Jason Porath

They say well-behaved women seldom make history. Good thing these women are far from well behaved . . . This beautifully illustrated collection celebrates history’s most inspirational, badass women, whom many people have never heard about. Illustrated in a contemporary animation style, Rejected Princesses turns the ubiquitous “pretty pink princess” stereotype portrayed in movies, and on endless toys, books, and tutus on its head, paying homage instead to an awesome collection of strong, fierce, and yes, sometimes weird, women: warrior queens, soldiers, villains, spies, revolutionaries, and more who refused to behave and meekly accept their place.

An entertaining mix of biography, imagery, and humor written in a fresh, young, and riotous voice, this thoroughly researched exploration salutes these awesome women drawn from both historical and fantastical realms, including real life, literature, mythology, and folklore. Each profile features an eye-catching image of both heroic and villainous women in command from across history and around the world, from a princess-cum-pirate in fifth century Denmark, to a rebel preacher in 1630s Boston, to a bloodthirsty Hungarian countess, and a former prostitute who commanded a fleet of more than 70,000 men on China’s seas.

In Conclusion

It is my hope that you are inspired to get out there and connect with working women and even share your own stories. There are many books that can help you with just about any situation you may be going through or thinking about.

The bottom line; don’t stop learning, listening, and working to make things better, as best you can, however you can. And it’s okay to go for it, or to ask for help, or to try and get more out of life than a 9 to 5, (or 80 hour work week), if that’s what you want. You get one chance at this thing called life, so do your best to make it count and work for you. There is support out there and if there isn’t any where you live, make it, connect with it online, empower yourself. You are not alone.

Here’s to your growing career, empowerment, and an understanding of the choices you make. I wish you the very best in your journey.

To the Young Man on the Plane from Los Angeles to Seattle Who Said of the Movie That Most Passengers -- Male and Female -- Voted to Watch, ""I don't watch chick flicks!""

So what exactly is a ""chick flick?"" I think you and I could probably agree that it has more dialogue than special effects, more relationships than violence, and relies for its suspense on how people live instead of how they die.

I'm not challenging your choice; I'm just questioning the term that encourages it. After all, if you think back to your school days, much of what you were assigned as great literature could have been dismissed as ""chick lit."" Indeed, the books you read probably only survived because they were written by famous guys.

Think about it: If Anna Karenina had been written by Leah Tolstoy, or The Scarlet Letter by Nancy Hawthorne, or Madame Bovary by Greta Flaubert, or A Doll's House by Henrietta Ibsen, or The Glass Menagerie by (a female) Tennessee Williams, would they have been hailed as universal? Suppose Shakespeare had really been The Dark Lady some people supposed. I bet most of her plays and all of her sonnets would have been dismissed as some Elizabethan version of ye olde ""chick lit,"" only to be resurrected centuries later by stubborn feminist scholars.

Indeed, as long men are taken seriously when they write about the female half of the world -- and women aren't taken seriously when writing about themselves much less about men or male affairs -- the list of Great Authors will be more about power than about talent.

Still, I know this is not your problem. Instead, let me appeal to your self-interest as well as your sense of fairness: If the ""chick flick"" label helps you to avoid the movies you don't like, why is there no label to guide you to the ones you do like?

Just as there are ""novelists"" and then ""women novelists,"" there are ""movies"" and then ""chick flicks."" Whoever is in power takes over the noun -- and the norm -- while the less powerful get an adjective. Thus, we read about ""African American doctors"" but not ""European American doctors,"" ""Hispanic leaders"" but not ""Anglo leaders,"" ""gay soldiers"" but not ""heterosexual soldiers,"" and so on.

That's also why you're left with only half a guide. As usual, bias punishes everyone. Therefore I propose, as the opposite of ""chick flick"" and an adjective of your very own, ""prick flick."" Not only will it serve film critics well, but its variants will add to the literary lexicon. For example, ""prick lit"" could characterize a lot of fiction, from Philip Roth to Bret Easton Ellis and beyond. ""True prick"" could guide readers to their preferred non-fiction, from the classics of Freud to the populist works of socio-biologists and even Rush Limbaugh.

Most of all, the simple label ""prick flick"" could lead you easily and quickly through the thicket of televised, downloaded and theatrical releases to such attractions as:



All the movies that glorify World War II. From classics with John Wayne and Ronald Reagan, those master actors who conveyed heroism without ever leaving the back lot, to Spielberg's Band of Brothers, in which the hero would rather die than be rescued, Hollywood has probably spent more on making movies about the war than this country spent on fighting it. After all, World War II was the last war in which this country was clearly right. Without frequent exposure to it, how are we to believe we still are?

All the movies that glorify Vietnam, bloody regional wars, and the war on terrorism. These may not be as much fun to watch -- you probably are aware that we aren't the winners here -- but they allow you to enjoy mass mayhem in, say, South Asia or Africa or the Middle East that justifies whatever this country might do.

All the movies that portray violence against women, preferably beautiful, sexy, half-naked women. These feature chainsaws and house parties for teenage guys, serial killers and sadistic rapists for ordinary male adults, plus cleverly plotted humiliations and deaths of powerful women for the well-educated misogynist.

All the movies that insist female human beings are the only animals on earth that seek out and even enjoy their own pain. From glamorized versions of prostitution to such complex plots as Boxing Helena, a man's dream of amputating all a rebellious woman's limbs -- and then she falls in love with him -- these provide self-justification and how-to manuals for sadists.

As you can see, one simple label could guide you through diversity, and help other viewers to practice avoidance.

But if you really think about it, I'm hope-a-holic enough to think you might like to watch a chick flick after all.

103,Steinem,Gloria,nytimes,"Not only would this term serve movie marketers well, it would add to the lexicon of literary critics. For example, it could characterize a lot of contemporary fiction — works from Philip Roth and Bret Easton Ellis, for example — as well as the plays of David Mamet. It could also guide readers to preferred nonfiction, from the classics of Freud to the collected radio ravings of Rush Limbaugh and the tweets of Donald Trump.

Most of all, this new and simple label could guide confused viewers through the thicket of downloadable movies to these types of attractions:

All the movies that glorify World War II. From classics starring John Wayne and Ronald Reagan, both masterful actors who portrayed heroism without ever leaving the studio back lot, to Steven Spielberg’s “Saving Private Ryan,” in which the character would rather risk death than be rescued, Hollywood may have spent more money on making movies about World War II than was spent on fighting it. No wonder, because that was the last war in which this country was clearly right. Without continuing reminders of it, how are we to keep on believing that we still are?

All the movies that glorify Vietnam, bloody regional wars and now, the war on terrorism. These may not be as much fun to watch — Vietnam was the first major war we lost, and we haven’t been so great about stopping terrorism either — yet such movies do allow us to see mass mayhem in, say, Africa or South Asia or the Middle East, and so to justify whatever this country might try to do there. Movie violence also diverts attention from the fact that, since Sept. 11, more American women have been murdered by their husbands or boyfriends than Americans have been killed in those attacks, the Iraq war, and the long war in Afghanistan — combined.

All the movies that portray violence against women, preferably beautiful, sexy, half-naked women. These tend to feature chain saws and house parties in films for teenage boys, and sadistic rapists and serial killers for adult males, plus humiliations and deaths of uppity women for the well-educated misogynist.

All the movies that portray female human beings as the only animals on earth that seek out and enjoy their own subordination and pain. From such whitewashed versions of prostitution as “Pretty Woman” (literally whitewashed, since poverty and racism mean that white women are much less likely to be prostituted) to such complex plots as “Boxing Helena,” a man’s dream about amputating the arms and legs of a rebellious woman who, when she is living in a box, falls in love with him — all provide media justification and how-to manuals for sadists.

After a low-level and mostly online explosion of interest in a woman-led march on Washington, there will be 1,200 buses transporting people who speak, care and sing about all the issues Trump opposes, from equal rights to the environment. In support of the Women’s March on Washington, there also will be sister marches in every major city in this country and more than 50 cities around the world.

Second, we probably didn’t learn that Rebecca Shook, a retired lawyer in Hawaii, posted on Facebook her idea that women should march on Washington in response to the first thing.

Of course, I have to admit that Trump himself helped galvanize this march. By his fact-free Tweets, narcissistic lashing out at the smallest criticism, seduction by praise, even from his country’s enemies, and appointment of a fox to head every chicken coop in Washington, he has depressed his Gallup poll ratings to a level way below that of any previous president-elect. We always knew he would be richer if he had just invested what he inherited from his father. Now we know he would be more popular if he just disappeared.

So what I want to address here is not Trump, but the surprising questions I’ve been getting about the guiding principles of the march. I am a supporter, not an organizer or decision-maker, but some observers and reporters ask me (a) why the Women’s March is including racism as well as sexism, thus making some white women feel alienated and guilty, and (b) why Planned Parenthood is one of the sponsors, though some women say they are turned off by abortion but would support equal pay and equal rights with men.

This has made me realize that we need a Twitter version of history and Feminism 101. So here goes:

Sexism and racism are intertwined and can only be uprooted together. That’s because controlling reproduction, and therefore women’s bodies, is the only way to maintain a visible difference in the long run. Yes, racism affects women differently. White women have been more likely to be sexually restricted in order to maintain racial “purity.” Black women have been more likely to be sexually exploited in order to produce cheap labor. But there is no such thing as freedom for any woman as long as racism wins. Even during slavery, when any contact between white women and black men was a crime more reliably punished than arson or murder, white Northern women and a few white Southern women joined with Frederick Douglass and other abolitionists to form a movement for universal adult suffrage. How brave was that?

But white male leaders divided this most threatening of all coalitions by giving the legal right to vote to the smallest group, black men, and then limiting it by everything from poll taxes to lynching. Racist white women then argued that “educated” white votes were needed to counter the votes of black men, but most others, like Sojourner Truth and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, tried to keep the coalition together. As Stanton warned: “There can never be true peace in this Republic until the civil and political rights of all citizens of African descent and all women are practically established.” When Gunnar Myrdal researched the first massive study of racism in America, he found that laws governing slaves had been adapted from laws governing wives, “the nearest and most natural analogy.” Writing in the 1940s, he found that, “The parallel between women and Negroes is the deepest truth of American life, for together they form the unpaid or underpaid labor on which America runs.”

Even without the big added motive of racism, patriarchy strives to dictate how many workers and how many soldiers, patriarchal religions tell us that sex is immoral unless it leads to reproduction, and made-up gender roles divide our shared humanity. Yet if women can’t decide our lives from the skin in, we can’t decide our lives from the skin out. Reproductive freedom remains the biggest indicator of whether we are poor or not, educated or not, work outside the home or not, and how long we live.

OK, that’s Twitter-length history — but it’s still going on. For instance, 53 percent of married white women voted for Trump, the most obvious sexist in presidential history, so we must ask: Is dependence on a man’s income and male approval colonizing the female spirit? Is Hillary Clinton just too painful a reminder of what women could be? Ninety-five percent of black women voted for Clinton, so we must also ask: Does the lived reality of racism plus sexism make us twice as wise? Does a need for strength create strength?

We have to figure this out together, but one thing is clear: We owe a big debt of gratitude to the young and diverse women who have interrupted their lives to organize this high-tech, high energy, and contagious march. Woman-led and all-inclusive, the march is founded on the simple idea that we as human beings are linked, not ranked. Yet even as I write this, newspapers are reporting that the issue of abortion will “strain calls for unity at the Women’s March.” In fact, it isn’t abortion that strains unity, it’s religious or political forces that would deny women — or men — bodily integrity.

If you would like to join marches around the world for a silent minute of imagining equality, join 1@1 at 1 p.m. on Saturday.

After all, hope is a form of planning. If our hopes weren’t already real within us, we couldn’t even hope them.

And it’s high time.

108,Steinem,Gloria,theguardian,"In my country, the white-lash and the man-lash have just created President Donald Trump, an unqualified candidate who came up not through politics, but through inheriting money, a gift for bullying, and being on television.

Though Hillary Clinton won the popular vote, Trump won enough to get a majority of electoral votes. That was a move to the right not unlike Brexit and the rule of Prime Minister Modi in India. Yet I also have to admit that, in answer to the question I’m most often asked, I hoped but never quite believed I would see a female president in my lifetime. At least, not a woman like Hillary Clinton.

If a first female president were someone like, say, Margaret Thatcher, Sarah Palin, or another woman who knew how to play the game and win, I wouldn’t have been surprised. But Hillary Clinton didn’t just play the game; she changed the rules.

She insisted that women’s rights are human rights, that women can decide the fate of our own bodies, that workers of all races should get paid the same as white men for the same work, that fathers can and should be equal parents, that women’s rights and children’s rights should be fundamental to foreign policy, and that global warming was a reality. That’s why she was, and always has been, supported more by women than by men, more by voters of color than by white voters, and more by scientists than creationists. It’s also why she is deeply and vehemently resented.

There have always been women who could have changed the game. I was in college when Margaret Chase Smith became the first US senator to oppose Joe McCarthy, the Donald Trump of his day. Later, she also became the first woman whose name was placed in nomination for the presidency by a major party convention, yet that was as far as she got. In 1972, I ran as a delegate pledged to congresswoman Shirley Chisholm, a candidate for the presidency. Though she was only on the ballot in 14 states, she spoke out against the Vietnam war, and against racism and sexism in education and politics. In the public imagination, she single-handedly took the “white male only” sign off the White House door.

The truth is that for two and a half centuries, this country has excluded females of every race from its top leadership; also the 40% of males who are African American, Hispanic, Jewish, or otherwise seen as needing an adjective; also the 5% who identify as gay or lesbian; and also the 60% who can’t afford to purchase a college degree. There has been only one president who wasn’t married, and none who was openly atheist or agnostic. Add this up, and we’ve been selecting our top leadership from 10% of our talent at most. We may be giving birth to democracy, but there will be years of labor to come.

That’s why electing Barack Obama was such a crucial beginning. We were rewarded by his intellect and gift for unifying, his cool head and warm heart. I believe he will be remembered as a great president, yet he, too, was often paralyzed by corporate and religious powers that are deeply racialized and gendered, and include a male cult of guns. Sometimes I thought that, if his opponents had cancer and Obama had the cure, they wouldn’t accept it.

Though in public opinion polls, rightwing issues were rarely supported by more than a third of the country, their representatives were elected and re-elected by unlimited corporate contributions, gerrymandering by state legislatures, and low voter turnout. They took and kept control of the once centrist Republican party that had produced Margaret Chase Smith and was the first to support the equal rights amendment.

Now, we need to be aware that this obstructionist minority is still hooked on hierarchy and still opposed to issues of equality. Add the fact that many men, especially powerful men, haven’t seen a female authority since childhood, and they felt unmanned, threatened, and regressed by the prospect of Hillary Clinton in the most powerful position in the world. Add those white Americans who are about to become a minority for the first time, and are opposed to everything from birth control (because it lowers the white birthrate disproportionately) to immigration (because it doesn’t have racial and religious restrictions). Of course, this is guilt talking: they fear being treated as they have treated others. Finally, there is free-floating misogyny, hostility to Washington, and real economic suffering, all of which Donald Trump exploited, incited, or exposed. The result is: a lot.

I’m being realistic, not negative. Almost every issue of equality now has majority support in public opinion polls, ideas of race and gender are changing, activism and iPhones are exposing the racial violence that has always been there, sexual assault from the campus to the military is no longer hidden, and Trump’s very public misogyny has unified women, educated men and inspired activism. It’s the Anita Hill effect, but deepened and multiplied. Trump has helped to expose desperation among those jobless and working poor who support him only because they oppose Washington.

It is also telling that the angry third or so of this nation are desperate enough to support a soft and, by stereotypical standards, un-masculine man like Donald Trump. He inherited his power, has no athletic or military record and no financial success earned on his own, has cheated the hard-working white male constituency he now courts, behaves as a sexual predator toward women that alpha males are supposed to protect, and sports cotton candy hair and suit jackets that fly open to reveal a gelatinous mass. Though a man’s word is supposed to be his bond, his own lawyer warned: “Donald is a believer in the big lie theory. If you say something again and again, people will believe you.” To paraphrase the great Mary McCarthy, his every word is a lie, including “and” and “the”.

At times like this, Gandhi used to say, “The truth is revealing itself.” Because Trump came up through mainstream corporate media that depend on ratings and ads, not through a political party, media must take responsibility and refuse to give the next un-fact-checked despot the estimated $2bn in free exposure that was given to Trump. Centrist Republicans must also take back their shattered party from extremists. And even in this moment, we have to recognize that electing one African American president and nominating one potential female president was only a beginning. We all will have to learn that the president can only hold a finger to the wind. We must become the wind.

The truth has been revealed. The next few years are going to be hell. However, we know from family violence – the paradigm of all violence that isn’t in self-defense – that the most dangerous time is the moment just before or just after escape. This is when a person is most likely to be beaten or killed because she or he is escaping control.

I think this country is in a time of danger because most of us are escaping control by some of us. Just as we would never tell a woman, man or child to stay in a violent household, we will never go back to the old hierarchy. Despite ongoing threats, at home and in other countries, including a very racialized and gendered terrorism, we have many leaders who inspire democracy, who model it, and who know we are linked, not ranked.

Luckily, real change, like a tree, grows from the bottom up, not the top down. We have Hillary, Barack and Michelle to guide us. We will not mourn, we will organize. Maybe we are about to be free.",-2,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/10/after-donald-trump-win-americans-organizing-us-politics

Boston Globe:

“Beautifully written and vividly illustrated with her images — which are stunningly cinematic, often strange, always evocative — the book helps us understand not only what would lead a young woman to pursue such a dangerous and difficult profession, but why she is so good at it. Lens to her eye, Addario is an artist of empathy, a witness not to grand ideas about human sacrifice and suffering, but to human beings, simply being.”



Entertainment Weekly:

“The opening scene of Lynsey Addario’s memoir sucker punches you like a cold hard fist. She illuminates the daily frustrations of working within the confines of what the host culture expects from a member of her sex and her constant fight for respect from her male journalist peers and American soldiers. Always she leads with her chin, whether she’s on the ground in hostile territory or discussing politics.”



Los Angeles Times :

“[A] richly illustrated memoir. [Addario] conveys well her unstated mission to stir the emotions of people like herself, born into relative security and prosperity, nudging them out of their comfort zones with visual evidence of horrors they might do something about. It is a diary of an empathetic young woman who makes understanding the wider world around her a professional calling.”



San Francisco Chronicle :

“Addario’s narrative about growing up as one of four daughters born to hairdressers in Los Angeles and working her way up to being one of the world’s most accomplished photojournalists, male or female, is riveting. [She] thoughtfully shows how exhilarating and demanding it is to cover the most difficult assignments in the world. Addario is a shining example of someone who has been able to “have it all,” but she has worked hard and absolutely suffered to get where she is. My hope is that she continues to live the life less traveled with her family, as I will be waiting for her next book with great anticipation.”



Washington Post :

“[An] unflinching memoir. [Addario’s] book, woven through with images from her travels, offers insight into international events and the challenges faced by the journalists who capture them.”



Associated Press:

“[Addario’s] ability to capture… vulnerability in her subjects, often in extreme circumstances, has propelled Addario to the top of her competitive field.”



Dallas Morning News:

“A rare gift: an intimate look into the personal and professional life of a war correspondent… a powerful read… This memoir packs a punch because of Addario’s personal risks. But some of the power in this book comes from the humanity she holds on to despite the horrors she witnesses. [It’s What I Do] should be read, processed and mulled over in its entirety….in [Addario’s] words and photos, readers will see that war isn’t simply a matter of black and white, of who’s right and who’s wrong. There are as many shades of gray as there are sides to every story.”



Kirkus (starred review):

“A remarkable journalistic achievement from a Pulitzer Prize and MacArthur Fellowship winner that crystalizes the last 10 years of global war and strife while candidly portraying the intimate life of a female photojournalist. Told with unflinching candor, the award-winning photographer brings an incredible sense of humanity to all the battlefields of her life. Especially affecting is the way in which Addario conveys the role of gender and how being a woman has impacted every aspect of her personal and professional lives. Whether dealing with ultrareligious zealots or overly demanding editors, being a woman with a camera has never been an easy task. A brutally real and unrelentingly raw memoir that is as inspiring as it is horrific.”



Publishers Weekly :

“A highly readable and thoroughly engaging memoir…. Addario’s memoir brilliantly succeeds not only as a personal and professional narrative but also as an illuminating homage to photojournalism’s role in documenting suffering and injustice, and its potential to influence public opinion and official policy.”



Booklist :

“Addario has written a page-turner of a memoir describing her war coverage and why and how she fell into—and stayed in—such a dangerous job. This ‘extraordinary profession’—though exhilarating and frightening, it ‘feels more like a commitment, a responsibility, a calling’—is what she does, and the many photographs scattered throughout this riveting book prove that she does it magnificently.”

Tim Weiner, author of Legacy of Ashes and Enemies :

“It’s What I Do is as brilliant as Addario’s pictures—and she’s the greatest photographer of our war-torn time. She’s been kidnapped, nearly killed, while capturing truth and beauty in the world’s worst places. She’s a miracle. So is this book.”

Dexter Filkins, author of The Forever War :

“Lynsey Addario’s book is like her life: big, beautiful, and utterly singular. With the whole world as her backdrop, Addario embarks on an extraordinary adventure whose overriding effect is to remind of us what unites us all.”

Jon Lee Anderson, staff writer for The New Yorker and author of The Fall of Baghdad :

“A gifted chronicler of her life and times, Lynsey Addario stands at the forefront of her generation of photojournalists, young men and women who have come of age during the brutal years of endless war since 9/11. A uniquely driven and courageous woman, Addario is also possessed of great quantities of humor and humanity. It’s What I Do is the riveting, unforgettable account of an extraordinary life lived at the very edge.”",-2,http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/312770/its-what-i-do-by-lynsey-addario/9780143128410/

Hillary Clinton’s victory goes way beyond the obvious “first” of a presidential nominee from a major party. That could have been a Thatcher-like figure who succeeded partly because she didn’t represent most women. Hillary Clinton has been supported by voters from the majority of this country who have been excluded because of sex or race or both. Her candidacy is a long overdue move toward democracy.

112,Steinem,Gloria,nytimes,"By Jon Meacham:

On a lovely early autumn day in her final October in the White House, Michelle Obama stepped out onto a sunny South Lawn and, in a way, bid farewell. The setting was her celebrated organic kitchen garden, but the subtext seemed to go far beyond any single initiative. “I have to tell you that being here with all of you, overlooking this beautiful garden — and it is beautiful — it’s kind of an emotional moment,” Mrs. Obama said at a ceremony to unveil a bigger, fortified version of the garden. “We’re having a lot of these emotional moments because everything is the last. But this is particularly my baby, because this garden is where it all started. So we’re really coming full circle back to the very beginning.” She recalled conversations in 2008 about the role she might play in an Obama presidency — and noted, tellingly, that the garden emerged after “Barack actually won,” to which she added: “He won twice.” The gathered guests happily applauded.

There, in a way, was the essential Michelle Obama, or at least the essential observable version of herself: speaking of broad public good (the garden, which was part of her campaign against childhood obesity) while revealing an arch sense of competitiveness. My husband won; he won twice. As their history-making time in the White House comes to an end, it’s worth pondering the lessons of the Age of Obama. My own view is that both the president and the first lady have conducted themselves splendidly in the White House, managing the most difficult of tasks with apparent ease: projecting a grace that masked the ambition and the drive that took them, at early ages, to the pinnacle of American life.

In this they have kept faith with a tradition that, in our country, is as old as George Washington, who embodied the classical ideal of Cincinnatus, the reluctant leader summoned from his plow to lead the nation. President Obama gets much of the public credit for handling his eight years coolly, but the first lady has been a critical element of his success. She has chosen her shots carefully — not least in choosing to make the case against Donald Trump on the campaign trail in 2016 — and is leaving the country with a warm impression of an excellent mother, a steady spouse and a sensible, devoted American.

Not everyone agrees, of course; not everyone ever does. The Obama skeptics and the Obama haters have from time to time questioned her patriotism, but this is the same country that managed, in some quarters, to hold Eleanor Roosevelt in contempt. The important thing is that Mrs. Obama, a clear-eyed lawyer, found a way to withstand the scrutiny of the spotlight. In point of fact, she did more than withstand it. To borrow a phrase from William Faulkner, she not only endured it; she prevailed over it.

How? By finding, or appearing to find, that most elusive of things in the modern world: balance. She was not Mrs. Roosevelt or Mrs. Carter or Mrs. Reagan or Mrs. Clinton, playing roles in affairs of state. Instead she did what the first African-American first lady arguably had to do to play a successful public role. In Voltaire’s terms, she cultivated her own garden, never threatening and never intimidating her neighbors. Much more doubtless unfolded beneath the surface or behind closed doors; history will sort that out. For now, it is enough to say that she is leaving the White House a strong and popular figure with a lifetime of good will and great reservoirs of capital on which to draw as she and her husband write their next chapters.

Back in 2008, musing on the life she was about to enter, Mrs. Obama recalled doubts about her garden — a bit of projection, one suspects, for doubts about the entire presidential enterprise. “What if we planted this garden and nothing grew?” Mrs. Obama asked. “We didn’t know about the soil, or the sunlight. And it’s like, oh, my God, what if nothing grows? … It was like afterwards I remember telling Sam [Kass, the former White House senior advisor for nutrition], ‘This better work, buddy. This better work.’” And so it did.",-2,http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/17/t-magazine/michelle-obama-chimamanda-ngozi-adichie-gloria-steinem-letter.html

One poser was composed in an entirely made-up language. To the young man, it read something like the Elvish of Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings, which had first been published in a single volume the year before.

There were one or two grammatical notes, but otherwise nothing to go by. How to make sense of this gibberish? A face-to-face interview was scarcely less intimidating.

The other day, on a television programme in America, I was introduced as ""a guy with a true claim to fame – he once shook the hand that held the paw of Winnie the Pooh"".

Yes, I knew Christopher Robin, the real Christopher Robin, the most famous small boy in literature. We first met about 18 years ago when I was writing a musical play about his father, AA Milne. I made the pilgrimage to Dartmouth in Devon where Christopher, then about 60, and his wife, Lesley, owned and ran a bookshop and cared for their severely disabled, grown-up daughter, Clare.

Christopher – slim, a little bent, owlish glasses, tweed jacket – was not at all as I had expected. I had been told I would find him painfully shy, distant, introspective, diffident about his parents, reluctant to talk about Pooh. He surprised me at once. He was consciously charming, courteous, kindly, gentle but forthcoming, amusing, amused. He said: ""Of course we must talk about Pooh."" He had a mischievous twinkle. ""It's been something of a love-hate relationship down the years, but it's all right now.""",-2,http://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/what-to-read/i-knew-christopher-robin--the-real-christopher-robin/

123,Steinem,Gloria,huffingtonpost,"Trump's misogynist behavior, which by now we should fully expect, has released another fecal storm and everyone is offended. A New York Times headline read: ""Tape Reveals Trump Boast About Groping Women---GOP Leaders Recoil in Shock."" Cleaning up the language of the video in question, the Times reported that ""Mr. Trump, then newly married to his third wife, Melania, crassly boasted about groping women's genitalia, vulgarly commented on their bodies and generally described women as sex objects who could not resist his advances.""

Among the shocked and offended were Trump's vice presidential running mate Mike Pence, who said: ""As a husband and father, I was offended by the words and actions described by Donald Trump in the eleven-year-old video released yesterday."" Paul Ryan was offended, actually ""sickened"" by Trump's comments. Many other Republicans joined the chorus.

But here's the thing: I'm shocked that everyone is so shocked. Let's face it: Only very recently has the idea of men grabbing women's genitalia, or any other part of a female body, on the street, in the subway, or on a date, unbidden, been seen as sexual assault. For years, those unbidden grabs were friskily referred to by men as ""copping a feel"" and would never, ever have landed any guy in front of a judge, much less in jail. ""Lighten up,"" was our directive.

Once in Greenwich Village a young guy in sweatpants who had been coming towards me suddenly grabbed my vagina; I ran after him for blocks, yelling and screaming, until, exasperated and humiliated, I lost him in the crowd. On another occasion, I was momentarily paralyzed, stopped in my tracks, as I watched a tall, slender, Brooks Brothers' guy walk off merrily swinging his briefcase after grabbing my ass as I ascended the subway stairs at West 57th Street in front of him.

Thankfully, things are changing; this behavior is being recognized for what it is--a crime. What surprises me is that Republican Party leaders like Pence and Ryan, so self-righteously appalled by this image of Trump feeling empowered to grab a woman in her most private part, do this in legislatures every day.

They effectively advocate forced childbirth by impeding women's access to birth control, morning-after pills, and safe, legal abortion. They comprise the health and lives of young low- income women by banning funding to Planned Parenthood and laboring to close down clinics, depriving these young women of all reproductive health and preventive cancer care. They vote against equal pay for equal work, paid maternity leave and paid sick leave.

While they criticize Trump for his sense of entitlement to the bodies of women, they have the same sense of entitlement. They refuse to respect women's moral authority, spiritual beliefs or choices--to work or not work, to combine motherhood and career, to choose or reject motherhood, to carry a pregnancy to term, or not. They may not grab ""pussy"" the way Trump says he can, but make no mistake: they grab it, without apology. That, too, is criminal. When will lawmakers taking these liberties with women's bodies shock us, too?",-2,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/angela-bonavoglia/grabbing-pussy-gopwhy-the_b_12417894.html
124,Steinem,Gloria,edition,"Sexual assault on the pipeline

Thanks to the biggest protest by Native Americans in a century, plus support from environmental activists as well as social media, the federal government has temporarily halted construction of a crucial portion of the Dakota Access Pipeline. This is not a victory or a defeat, but it does give everyone in America time to think.

This 1,134-mile pipeline would run under the Missouri River, posing a serious threat to drinking water, especially for the native nations whose sacred sites sit in the path of the proposed structure. Native leaders are warning all of us. They have traveled from hundreds of native nations to support the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in North Dakota. At first in obscurity, and often at risk of arrest or beatings, they have succeeded in putting the country on notice that the pipeline endangers sacred lands and the environment.

It also endangers women and girls. That’s because, in this country as around the world, extractive industries create so-called “man camps,’’ places where male workers often work 12-hour days, are socially isolated for weeks or months at a time, and live in trailers in parks that extend for miles. As advocacy organizations like First Nations Women’s Alliance have noted, these man camps become centers for drugs, violence, and the sex trafficking of women and girls. They also become launching pads for serial sexual predators who endanger females for miles around.

In North Dakota, the man camps created during the Bakken oil boom drastically increased the levels of violent crime perpetrated against women and girls — and particularly native women and girls. Studies conducted during the peak of the oil boom — from 2010 to 2013 — showed that the number of reported domestic violence incidents and sexual assaults increased by hundreds, flooding and overwhelming service providers. Victim advocates from the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara Nation — a native nation that became ground zero for the increase in violent crimes that accompanied the boom — have reported a doubling, and in some instances a tripling, in the number of calls that victim-service providers receive for domestic violence, sexual assault, and sex trafficking. As Bea Hanson, principal deputy director of the Department of Justice’s Office on Violence Against Women, stated in 2014: “Local and tribal victim-service providers have been overwhelmed with the increase in domestic violence and sexual assault victims coming forward and needing help.’’

Already, and even without the proposed Dakota Access Pipeline, North Dakota produces more oil than any other state in the nation. The majority of this oil comes from tribal lands. On the Fort Berthold reservation alone, there are 35 corporations extracting oil, and countless man camps. The Bakken oil boom has brought increased rates of rape, murder, and sex trafficking to a population that already suffers from the highest rates of violence in the United States. According the National Institute of Justice, four out of five Native Americans have suffered a violent crime in their lifetime. Man camps are also a major reason why four out of five perpetrators of violence against American Indians are non-Indians themselves, yet thanks to a 1978 Supreme Court ruling eliminating tribal criminal jurisdiction over non-Indians who commit crimes on tribal lands, tribal police have no jurisdiction over non-tribal crime. Native people, especially females, are often unprotected.

Native Americans tell us that it takes four generations to heal one act of violence. As they have learned throughout American history, an attack on a native woman’s body is a violent attack on her nation’s sovereignty. As the Standing Rock Sioux tribe chairman Dave Archambault has said, they are protesting the pipeline not just to protect their lives but to protect the lives of generations to come. They are the canaries. We are all living in the mine.

133,Steinem,Gloria,nzherald,"One of the founders of the modern feminist movement Gloria Steinem.

Fifty years after she became America’s most famous feminist, Gloria Steinem tells Gaby Wood why the fight is far from over.

One evening last month, the Emmanuel Centre in central London was filling up with women of all ages. The man who'd organised the event hovered outside, cheerfully attempting to spot people of his own sex. There were only one or two. ""This is not a football match,"" he said, grinning as a 1200-strong crowd swarmed past him.

The occasion: Emma Watson, the 25-year-old actress and UN goodwill ambassador for women, was due to interview the 82-year-old feminist, Gloria Steinem. When they came on stage, sleekly dressed, it was immediately clear who was the more nervous. ""It only hit me 20 seconds ago that this was really happening,"" said Watson, in awe of her interlocutor.

She needn't have worried. Steinem's life has been spent asking other women about theirs. No sooner had Watson brushed past the notion that women can feel bad about themselves than Steinem brought her back to it, calmly turning the tables. ""Well, would you like to address that?"" she asked. Before long, Watson was confessing that she hated her bushy eyebrows and saying she felt pressurised to pretend she was nothing like Hermione in Harry Potter, when really she was just the same.

Steinem, who usually lives in New York, was in Britain to talk about her memoir, My Life On The Road. The tour involved speaking to a much younger generation of feminists: Watson, to begin with, then students in Oxford and Cambridge, in conversation with Everyday Sexism founder Laura Bates. Steinem evaded the notion of passing a torch - ""we all have a torch"", she said - but it was heartening to see how many young admirers she has, because for years a backlash seemed to have sounded a death knell for feminism and, if there's a new wave, its members couldn't hope for a more generous or good-humoured role model.

Once, Steinem was the most famous feminist in America. Now it's often said that her contribution is hard to place, because she hasn't written a groundbreaking book, as Betty Friedan did with The Feminine Mystique or Germaine Greer did with The Female Eunuch. But it's also because she's not a screecher, nor an exhibitionist, and most of what she's achieved has been done with others. That's the whole point of a movement.

Even Steinem's most famous quip is only ever quoted in part. When a reporter told her, 42 years ago, that she didn't look 40, she said: ""This is what 40 looks like."" But she also said, ""We've been lying so long, who would know?"" By halving the quote, her point about women's collective pressure to pretend was turned into a proud response about her own good looks.

Those looks themselves came in for criticism, of course (the sisterhood has rarely been short on sibling rivalry). Her hair and nails received a level of attention that never came the way of her New York magazine colleague Tom Wolfe - though he must have spent more time choosing his outfits than Steinem ever did.

Yet she is always open to the possibility of a joke. Her seminal 1963 investigation into Hugh Hefner's domain had a wry tone that's absent from most undercover reportage. Her witty riff, ""If Men Could Menstruate"", rivals Woody Allen - and even turned Martin Amis into a self-described feminist.

Though she started out as a newspaper columnist - and, in 1972, co-founded a magazine, Ms. - she now describes herself as an organiser, or an activist. Much of her work has been on the ground all along, helping to set up history-shifting conferences like the one in Houston in 1977, encouraging workers to speak to their bosses, campaigning for equal rights and better pay.

She has been more like a union leader than a journalist, though her capacity for infiltration into the world of the oppressors is unusual. It's hard to imagine [British unionist] Arthur Scargill applying for a job as a Playboy bunny.

This is the woman who greets me the morning after the Watson event, signing books in her publisher's office. There is almost too much to talk about - if we're going to discuss issues that concern women, the frontiers are numerous. At one point, I ask Steinem why the women's movement was perceived as mostly white and middle-class if, as she has said, the reality was different.

""Books,"" she replies. ""It was white, middle-class women writing books. I mean, I love books, but ... For instance, the first big group of women doing feminist activism that I remember meeting were welfare mothers. They had done the first analysis of welfare policy I'd ever seen - analysing the welfare system as a gigantic husband that looked under your bed for the shoes of other men, gave you just enough money to survive ... it was funny and wonderful and smart. They were pioneers. But they didn't write a book.""

Though any political movement can become more about rhetoric than strategy, Steinem's grasp on specific issues is sharp, and her solutions clear. On the question of work, she says that of course access to employment is key - women shouldn't be confined to ""what used to be called the pink-collar ghetto - service jobs, help jobs and so on"". But it doesn't all have to be about boardrooms; we should also be valuing the work women already do.

""Caregiving, nurturing, taking care of elderly relatives and invalids - which is something like a third of the productive work in my country - is economically invisible,"" she says. ""We couldn't get on without it, and it's often the case that caring for elderly relatives and invalids at home is better for them and better for the economy. We could reward that.

""You attribute an economic value to care-giving at replacement level, and make that tax-deductible if you pay taxes, and tax-refundable if you're too poor to pay taxes. So it replaces the idea of welfare to some extent. That allows you to value care-giving culturally and account for it in your economic planning.""

Later, when I refer to second-wave feminism, Steinem points out that she never uses the phrase. She finds such terms ""divisive and over-generalised. It doesn't honour the young woman from a Mormon family - she's practically a first-wave feminist because she's overcome such difficulty,"" she explains. ""Nor does it recognise the woman who's come from three generations of feminists and had a whole different experience.""

An Evening with Gloria Steinem and Emma Watson in London, Britain.

I wonder if Steinem is ever disappointed by the decisions she sees women making now. She looks a little uncomfortable. ""Yeah,"" she replies, ""but it's not for me to ... "" What about a woman who takes her husband's name, I ask - does she consider that to be backsliding? (The December 1973 issue of Ms. carried a feature instructing women how to get their maiden names back. It was entitled ""Give Yourself Your Own Name For Christmas"".) With effortless irony, Steinem says: ""I mean, I would just want to make sure she's thought of the fact that there may be three or four women with her name, eventually."" After divorce? I ask, dimly. ""Yeah,"" she says, laughing.

So when she sees post-feminists, or post-post-feminists ... I begin. Steinem gently interrupts me.

""There is no such thing as post-feminism,"" she says.

Because we're still in it? I ask.

""Yeah.""

This, to her, is obvious. After all, she says, if it took women a century to get a legal identity as human beings, legal equality may take another century. ""And after that, there's equality of daily life and parenting and so on,"" she adds.

Okay, I say, attempting to rephrase my question. Can we talk about young women who've enjoyed the benefits from what your generation did but don't realise what kind of fight got them there?

Women get more radical with age. And men get more conservative. People look at younger women and think if they're not radical there's something wrong with them. No, they just haven't experienced the problems yet.

Gloria Steinem

Steinem shrugs. ""Listen,"" she says amiably, ""I did not walk around saying: 'Thank you for the vote'. No. I got mad about what was happening to me.""

What if they're not mad?

""They're 20,"" she replies. ""Chances are [by that age] you haven't been discriminated against that much in the labour force. Maybe you don't yet have children and you haven't experienced how unequal and difficult that is. It's why, in a general way, women get more radical with age. And men get more conservative. People look at younger women and think if they're not radical there's something wrong with them. No, they just haven't experienced the problems yet.""

Steinem herself was once in this position. As a single young woman with exactly the job she wanted, she thought ""everything had been solved decades earlier by boring, asexual suffragists"". Then she realised the fight was far from over.

So does she say to young women, ""Just you wait""? Steinem shakes her head.

Condescension is not her style. ""I would try to identify things they're really experiencing. Do you feel as safe in the street as a man would? Probably not. Do you feel your body is okay in the same way a man would without alteration? Probably not. We can raise each other's consciousness by addressing what is going on, without expecting someone to have the same knowledge they will have later on.""

Steinem's mother, Ruth, suffered her first nervous breakdown four years before Steinem was born. After that, she was never free of depression and became addicted to a liquid tranquilliser. Steinem always thought of Ruth as someone ""to be worried about and cared for"". Steinem's father was a travelling salesman with a cartoonish sense of adventure and quixotic plans for making a fast buck. Although she remembers him with great love, there was a point at which he could no longer look after his wife.

Later, as she put it in an essay called Ruth's Song, Steinem understood that no one had tried to solve her mother's problem because ""her functioning was not that necessary to the world ... she was not an important worker"".

Steinem's sister was 9 years older, and left home before Steinem was 10. That's when her father chose to leave too, and Steinem spent seven years with her mostly bedridden mother, taking care of her alone.

Did she fear she would inherit her mother's depression? I ask.

Gloria Steinem is an American feminist, journalist and activist who was recognised as a spokeswoman for the feminist movement in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

""To me she was not crazy, she had just had her spirit broken. I don't think mental illness was part of her life. I think patriarchy did her in.""

It was only years after she'd made her escape that Steinem heard about her mother's former life - how she'd been a journalist and had had to give up her career; how she'd fallen in love with another man but couldn't leave Steinem's father. Steinem asked her why she hadn't broken free. ""Then you wouldn't have been born,"" her mother replied. And Steinem thought: ""But you would have been born instead.""

Cod psychology might suggest this was why Steinem - who in her 60s was married to the English businessman, David Bale, for three years, until his death in 2003 - never had children of her own. She had, in a sense, already been a mother since the family roles had been reversed. ""I think if you early on become the parent rather than the child, the downside is obvious but the up-side is that you feel like your own self earlier,"" she says.

In any case, feminism fought for a woman's right to do what she wants with her body, and not to have to use it for reproduction - so it seems wrong to ask Steinem if there was a reason why she didn't have children. But I ask anyway.

""I just discovered I didn't have to,"" she says, laughing. ""In my generation you were crazy if you did not marry and have children. And I happened to have one elderly cousin who did not marry and did not have children, and was crazy. So I believed I had to. And only later I realised: not everyone has to live the same way. For a while I still imagined I would adopt a child. In my mind, the child was always a 7 or 8-year-old little girl. And finally, un-introspective as I am, I had to realise that was me: I was trying to save myself at that age.""

And what about her sister? I ask. What was her relationship to the women's movement?

""Her time of basic decision-making - getting married and having children - preceded the movement,"" Steinem explains. ""I think she was trying to create a secure family that we did not have, in a different way. So she had six children,"" she pauses. ""And after that she went to law school. That, I think, she would not have been able to do if it hadn't been for the movement.""

134,Steinem,Gloria,cntraveler,"When I first began flying a lot in the early 1970s, planes meant only mindlessness, escape from phones, maybe a movie, and most of all, sleep. Even if I took work on board, I nodded off as soon as we were aloft. Like a flying version of Pavlov’s dog, just being carried through space made me feel I needed to make no further effort.

Once when I stayed awake long enough to admire the olive twill pants of a flight attendant’s uniform, she let me order a pair at her discount, thus combining shopping with travel. It was the beginning of a lifetime of finding girlfriends in the sky. I noticed that stewardesses were all young—and all female—but I assumed they wanted a few years of travel before doing something else, or this was an entry-level job and a pipeline for airline executives. I only began to pay attention when I was shuttling constantly between the start-up of Ms. magazine in New York and the organizing of the National Women’s Political Caucus in Washington. Once when exhaustion caused me to fall asleep with my credit card in my hand, a kindhearted stewardess removed the card, ran it through the onboard ticket machine—the way one paid for the shuttle in those days—and put it back in my hand without waking me. Neither she nor others knew who I was or why I was such a frequent-flying oddity among the mostly male passengers going to our nation’s capital, but we seemed to share a sense of being outsiders.

On longer trips with various airlines, I began to hang out in the galley, where I could ask questions and listen. I learned that the first stewardesses had been registered nurses hired to make passengers feel safe at a time when flying was new, airsickness was frequent, and passengers were fearful. Some pilots resented this female invasion of their macho air space so much that they quit…

Once male business travelers became the airlines’ bread and butter, everything changed. Stewardesses were hired as decorative waitresses with geisha-like instructions. There were even “executive flights” for men only, complete with steaks, brandy, and cigars lit by stewardesses. Though they still had to know first aid, evacuation procedures for as many as seventy-five kinds of planes, underwater rescue, emergency signaling, hijacking precautions, and other skills that took six weeks of schooling—not to mention how to handle passengers and fend off some—their appearance was prescribed down to age, height, weight (which was governed by regular weigh-ins), hairstyle, makeup (including a single shade of lipstick), skirt length, and other physical requirements that excluded such things as “a broad nose”—only one of many racist reasons why stewardesses were overwhelmingly white. They had to be single as well as young, and were fired if they married or aged out at over thirty or so. Altogether the goal of airline executives seemed to be to hire smart and ornamental young women, to use them as advertising come-ons, to work them hard, and to age them out soon. Flight schedules were so merciless that on some airlines, the average stewardess lasted only eighteen months. As one United executive famously said, “If a flight attendant was still on the job after three years . . . I’d know we were getting the wrong kind of girl. She’s not getting married.”

Back in the galley, stewardesses were only too glad to tell me about the indignities, from ad campaigns with slogans like “I’m Sandy, Fly Me,” and “She’ll Serve You—All the Way,” to an “Air Strip” in which they were required to walk up and down the aisles while stripping to hot pants. Passengers were influenced by this image of stewardesses, and made them second only to farmers’ daughters as objects of sex jokes. This image was publicized by such X-rated pornographic movies as Come Fly with Me and The Swinging Stewardesses. Some pilots expected to be serviced sexually on layovers, and though the answer from stewardesses was overwhelmingly no, passengers assumed they must be saying yes. Airlines fended off sex discrimination lawsuits for refusing to hire male stewards by maintaining that the care and feeding of passengers was so peculiarly “feminine” that it amounted to a “BFOQ”—a bona-fide occupational qualification—otherwise reserved for wet nurses and sperm donors. Stewardesses could be “written up” for any infraction of the rules, including talking back to an obnoxious drunk passenger or refusing to sell more drinks to an already inebriated one. They were made to share rooms on layovers while male crew had private rooms, and they were definitely not on a job ladder to the executive suite…",-2,http://www.cntraveler.com/stories/2016-03-25/gloria-steinem-on-how-female-flight-attendants-fought-sexism

DODGEVILLE, Wis. – Wisconsin-based retailer Lands’ End is apologizing to customers for featuring feminist Gloria Steinem in its spring catalog and has removed her from its website.

The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reports that the company on Tuesday removed a feature on Steinem from its website after customers complained about her support for abortion rights. It issued an apology to customers who were offended Wednesday.

Steinem had been interviewed by company CEO Federica Marchionni for the Lands’ End “Legend Series.” The company says in a statement that its goal was to feature people who have made a difference, and not to take a political or religious stance.",-2,http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2016/feb/25/lands-end-apologizes-for-feature-on-feminist-glori/
139,Steinem,Gloria,nytimes,"If the lawyer described above had been just as charismatic but named, say, Achola Obama instead of Barack Obama, her goose would have been cooked long ago. Indeed, neither she nor Hillary Clinton could have used Mr. Obama’s public style  or Bill Clinton’s either  without being considered too emotional by Washington pundits.

So why is the sex barrier not taken as seriously as the racial one? The reasons are as pervasive as the air we breathe: because sexism is still confused with nature as racism once was; because anything that affects males is seen as more serious than anything that affects “only” the female half of the human race; because children are still raised mostly by women (to put it mildly) so men especially tend to feel they are regressing to childhood when dealing with a powerful woman; because racism stereotyped black men as more “masculine” for so long that some white men find their presence to be masculinity-affirming (as long as there aren’t too many of them); and because there is still no “right” way to be a woman in public power without being considered a you-know-what.

I’m not advocating a competition for who has it toughest. The caste systems of sex and race are interdependent and can only be uprooted together. That’s why Senators Clinton and Obama have to be careful not to let a healthy debate turn into the kind of hostility that the news media love. Both will need a coalition of outsiders to win a general election. The abolition and suffrage movements progressed when united and were damaged by division; we should remember that.

I’m supporting Senator Clinton because like Senator Obama she has community organizing experience, but she also has more years in the Senate, an unprecedented eight years of on-the-job training in the White House, no masculinity to prove, the potential to tap a huge reservoir of this country’s talent by her example, and now even the courage to break the no-tears rule. I’m not opposing Mr. Obama; if he’s the nominee, I’ll volunteer. Indeed, if you look at votes during their two-year overlap in the Senate, they were the same more than 90 percent of the time. Besides, to clean up the mess left by President Bush, we may need two terms of President Clinton and two of President Obama.

But what worries me is that he is seen as unifying by his race while she is seen as divisive by her sex.",-2,http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/08/opinion/08steinem.html

I’m talking about feeding your family, walking the dog, finishing a project for work. Don’t start reading My Name Is Lucy Barton before getting those things done. And don’t start it right before you plan to go to sleep either. You’ll be up half the night. This is one of those books that grabs you fast and hard, and by the time you’re 10 pages in you’re not going to notice the world around you. You’re only going to care about the world of this novel.

Opening this book is like having someone you love walk into the room, pick up your hand, look you in the eye, and say, OK, there’s something I have to tell you. You want to listen to every syllable of what this person has to say. How Elizabeth Strout makes you care so immediately about Lucy Barton and everything she needs to tell us is a mystery to me, but she does it. I fell into this book as if falling down an open manhole cover. One second I was in my world, the next second I was in hers, utterly and completely, and even though the world of Lucy Barton can be a tough place, I didn’t want to leave it, not even after I was finished.

Sometimes we might think we’ve seen the very best a writer can do. A lot of people would have thought that Elizabeth Strout could never write a book better than Olive Kitteridge. How could such a thing even be possible? But it is. This new book is my favorite Strout novel by far. And the most exciting thing about that is the idea that she might surprise again in the future. What My Name Is Lucy Barton proves is that there really isn’t anything Elizabeth Strout can’t do.

As she approached 60, the co-founder of Ms. magazine says, she entered a new phase in life, one in which ""you can do what you want."" Originally broadcast Oct. 26, 2015.

TERRY GROSS, HOST:

This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. This week we're featuring some of our favorite interviews of the year. Later on this edition, we'll hear from Jeffrey Tambor, the star of ""Transparent."" Up first, my interview with Gloria Steinem, recorded in October. Steinem has been a leader and symbol of the women's movement since the 1970s and continues to speak out at the age of 81.

She co-founded Ms. magazine in 1972 and remained one of its editors for 15 years. She's written about political, social and economic barriers to women's rights and has also written about her own life and the personal obstacles she's had to overcome and how they represent obstacles many women face.

Her latest book, ""My Life On The Road,"" was published in the fall. She estimates that she's spent at least half of her time on the road for more than four decades. She's traveled with a purpose - to raise awareness of women's issues and organize women in the U.S. and around the world. As we'll hear later in the interview, she kind of grew up on the road.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)

GROSS: Gloria Steinem, welcome back to FRESH AIR. I want you to start by reading the dedication of your new book.

GLORIA STEINEM: (Reading) This book is dedicated to Dr. John Sharpe of London who, in 1957, a decade before physicians in England could legally perform an abortion for any reason other than the health of the woman, took the considerable risk of referring for an abortion a 22-year-old American on her way to India. Knowing only that she had broken an engagement at home to seek an unknown fate, he said, you must promise me two things. First, you will not tell anyone my name. Second, you will do what you want to do with your life. Dear Dr. Sharpe, I believe you, who knew the law was unjust, would not mind if I say this so long after your death. I've done the best I could with my life. This book is for you.

GROSS: Thank you for reading that dedication to your new book. When did you first speak about your abortion?

STEINEM: The amazing thing was that it took me so long. There was no women's movement. It was supposed to be a secret. Women didn't share in the same way. So it wasn't until many years later, after New York Magazine had started. And I had gone to cover an abortion speak-out held in a church downtown in New York City. And suddenly I heard other women standing up and talking about what it was like to have to go out and seek an illegal abortion. This was actually an alternate hearing to one that the New York state legislature was holding on the liberalization of abortion law in New York state. This was before the Supreme Court ruling.

And, you know, a group of early feminists had just say - said, wait a minute, you know, in New York (laughter) - in the legislature, they asked 14 men and one nun to testify. You can't make this up, right?

GROSS: (Laughter).

STEINEM: (Laughter) Let's hear from women who have actually had this experience. So I sat there as a reporter for New York Magazine, listening to women tell their stories, you know, that were tragic and ludicrous and every human emotion all wrapped into one. And suddenly, I thought, wait a minute, you know. I had an abortion, and actually 1 in 3 American women had needed an abortion at some time in her life, so why is this illegal? And why is it dangerous? And it's the kind of revelation that comes from people just telling the truth and discovering you're not alone.

GROSS: Do you often wonder what your life would've been like had you not had the abortion and had you had a child at that age?

STEINEM: You know, it just - you know, I don't know what would've happened. I had been doing all the foolish things that we then did, like riding horseback, throwing ourselves down stairs (laughter), you know, the - all kinds of things in the hope that's...

GROSS: Well, let me stop you right there. Did you throw yourself down stairs?

STEINEM: Yeah, kind of, I did. I did. And, you know, I am the most cowardly (laughter) person you can imagine, so - physically speaking. But I did. I kept thinking that somehow, you know, I could - I don't know what I thought. I was desperate. I really was desperate because, you know, I just knew that if I went home and married, which I would've had to do, it would be to the wrong person. It would be to a life that wasn't mine, that wasn't mine at all.

GROSS: So, what surprises you about the current debate around abortion?

STEINEM: I think I am still most surprised by the inability or the reluctance of many people to tell the truth because - you know, about the need for abortion and, I must say, about the morality of abortion because it seems to me that every child has the right to be born, loved and wanted. And every person has the right to control - male and female - to control their own bodies from the skin in. I think we need a - legal principles called something like bodily integrity which recognizes that, though the state may jail us, they can't insist on injections or tests or pressuring us for organ transplants or, you know, the - our skin needs to be the line of defense between our own dignity and will and any outside force. We do need a new wave of telling the truth, I think. However, I'm not surprised by the opposition because it is the basis of (laughter) - of everything. I mean, to be able - the definition of patriarchy is to be able to control reproduction. And that means you have to control women's bodies.

GROSS: You spent half of your life on the road. You're still on the road a lot. You grew up on the road. Let's talk a little bit about your very atypical childhood. Your mother was often incapacitated by depression. Can we call it depression?

STEINEM: You know, I - I don't know what to call it. I think her spirit was broken. You know, she, before I was born, had to give up everything she loved and cared about. And she was depressed. She got addicted to tranquilizers. I just think her spirit was broken.

GROSS: Your father, until you were 10, during the summer, ran a dance pavilion that he created. Would you describe what your father did summers?

STEINEM: This was a little lake in southern Michigan called Clark Lake. He had built a kind of long, big pier with part of it covered, part of it uncovered over the lake. And on weekdays, there would be sort of canned music and a jukebox. And on weekends, a band - then, the big bands of the '30s and '40s used to travel the country in the summertime in a bus (laughter). And so we would get some famous bands sometimes - Wayne King and Joe Venuti, I mean, names I don't know if people know anymore. And this was his dream. And he - you know, he created a kind of magical place.

GROSS: So, what was it about being there or about being with your father that broke your mother's spirit?

STEINEM: It just wasn't hers. Well, let me describe what she had been doing (laughter) long before I was born. She was a pioneer newspaper reporter and journalist and, actually, editor, which was extraordinary. But it was an era in which she at first had to write under a man's name in order to get published. So, you know, she was a real pioneer, and she loved it. She adored it. At the same time, she was married to my father, a wonderful, kind, charming, utterly irresponsible man, so there were always money troubles and, you know, lots of difficulties. She had my sister, who is nine years older than me. And I think, you know, as she later explained, she'd fallen in love with a man at work and had grown up believing that you could not divorce. You could not change. She had a girlfriend who wanted to come to New York with her where she could try her hand at being a journalist. You know, she had all these aspirations. She just couldn't make it work. She had a - what was then called a nervous breakdown, which meant she was in a sanatorium for a year or two. I'm not sure. And there, she got hooked on an early form of tranquilizer.

GROSS: So getting back to this life that you had as a child, your mother's spirit was broken. It was often hard for her to get out of bed. Your father created this - you know, like, wonderful dance-pavilion summers. But then when the summer was over, the family would move into a van and drive south and basically live - when I say a van, I should say trailer, I suppose - and then the family would live in the trailer for the duration until the following summer. You write that you never started out with enough money to complete the trip. Your father would buy antiques and then sell them to antique dealers - you know, buy them at country auctions and then sell them to antique dealers at higher prices to fund your trip south. How did you like being itinerant like that?

STEINEM: I suppose that two things happen at once when you're a child. One is that you just accept as normal whatever is around you. And the other is that you go to the movies and you see kids or your classmates - because I would go to school till it got cold - to Halloween or something - who are living a different way, and you want to be like them. You want to be like the other kids. It never, for a moment, occurred to me that they might envy me. So I both accepted it and hoped that my real parents would come find me and take me to a house with a picket-fence and a pony. I mean, that's the degree of realism and fantasy.

GROSS: So you weren't in school for those years that your family was on the road. How did you learn to read and do basic math?

STEINEM: Well, I'm not sure I've ever learned to do basic math to be frank (laughter). But I learned to read just because my family had lots and lots of books, especially my mother, you know, read all the time. My memory is that I learned how to read from ketchup bottles and labels and billboards along the highway. I don't know. I'm not sure. But I don't remember not knowing how to read.

GROSS: Was it legal for you to not be in school?

STEINEM: No, I'm sure it was illegal. And my mother always said that if the truant officer showed up, she would use her teaching certificate - the fact that it was for university calculus, which she had been teaching in order to make money to finish college herself, I don't know how impressive it would've been. But anyway, no - but no truant officer ever showed up.

GROSS: Your parents separated when you were 10, in 1944, and you had to take on a lot of responsibility for your mother at a young age. What were the - some of the things you had to do for her when you were still a child yourself?

STEINEM: Well, it depended on, you know, on the ups and downs of her moods. But I would make her meals, or the child's idea of a meal. I kind of always worried about what I would find when I came home from school, you know, because she might be really depressed or she might have retreated into another world or she might be convinced that a war was happening outside the house and be wandering around in the street. I - you know, talking to other people whose parents were, say, alcoholics and who also kind of didn't know what they would find when they came home, has made me realize that it's not - I mean, it's hopefully uncommon, but it's certainly not unique, my experience.

GROSS: She was called the crazy lady of the neighborhood once you had a neighborhood. What was your reaction to that, and did it make you think of her differently than you did before?

STEINEM: No, I don't - didn't make me think of her differently. She was - how can I say? - I mean, she was a loving, wonderful woman who recited poetry by heart and was, you know, certainly super loving toward me, but sometimes she was just in another world, and I didn't know when that would happen.

GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Gloria Steinem, and she has a new memoir called ""My Life On The Road."" Let's take a short break here then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Gloria Steinem. She has a new memoir called ""My Life On The Road."" Do you remember the moment when you first realized women's rights was a legitimate issue along with all the other rights that you are interested in fighting for?

STEINEM: You know, the amazing thing is how long it took me, actually. I mean, there was no - at least to me, there was no visible women's movement. So I thought I just had to function within the system as it was. And I identified with everybody else who was having a hard time. I think women often do that without knowing that it applied to us, too. But I owe it to the women who held that hearing on abortion, for instance, or, you know, who had been inside the civil rights movement and the anti-Vietnam movement and even in those movements that we utterly loved, still were not treated equally and so I had understood that there needed to be an additional women's movement.

GROSS: I remember you telling me that one of the reasons why you co-founded Ms. magazine was that writing for other magazines, they just weren't interested in women's issues. They'd say, oh, we did an article about women's issues or about the women's liberation movement, like, eight months ago, so we don't need another article yet. And that article about men was, like, articles about the world. But articles about women fell into the category of, like, yeah, we covered that a while ago. We're done.

STEINEM: Well, in - that was true of women's magazines, but in other places where I was writing, including The Sunday New York Times, (laughter) you know, lots of other places, the attitude was even worse. It was sort of, well, if we publish an article saying women are equal, then in order to be objective, we'll have to publish one saying they're not, you know (laughter). So...

GROSS: What was your reaction to that?

STEINEM: Well, it seemed perfectly logical to them because they thought it was debatable, if you see what I mean.

GROSS: Yeah, I definitely see what you mean.

STEINEM: But it seemed - right.

(LAUGHTER)

STEINEM: But it seemed extremely frustrating and outrageous to me.

GROSS: Do you remember the articles - the headlines - in the first edition of Ms.? I want to see if those articles could still be written today. Like, how much have things changed?

STEINEM: Well, we did have a piece about a couple that had made a marriage contract. In order to make up for the unequal laws on the books, they had made their own contract. We had reprinted an article from another feminist publication called ""Why I Want A Wife,"" by Judy Syfers. I remember. She deserves credit.

GROSS: I remember that article.

STEINEM: Right.

(LAUGHTER)

STEINEM: And it was a woman talking about all the reasons why she needed a wife. It was funny and wonderful.

GROSS: To have somebody at home who was doing the cooking and cleaning and taking care of the errands and stuff...

STEINEM: Exactly.

GROSS: ...Which was what wives were supposed to do, but she was working so she needed to somebody to take on that role.

STEINEM: Yeah, exactly. Right.

GROSS: Would have been helpful. Yeah. So that first edition was 1972, right?

STEINEM: Yes.

GROSS: What's your connection to Ms. magazine now?

STEINEM: Now it's published by the Feminist Majority Foundation in Los Angeles, and I am an adviser to it. But I'm not the daily role at all that I was for, you know, such a very long time. And I'm very grateful to them that they are taking good care of it. And now it's quarterly, but it has an additional and big life on the Web.

GROSS: If I asked you to make a list of the five most important issues for women today, what would be on that list?

STEINEM: Well, I can do it, but I would like to say that the most important issues are those to the women who are listening. I mean, it's not about dictating to each other what's important, but supporting each other and solving the ones that are in our daily lives.

GROSS: I like that point that you just made.

STEINEM: However, if you add up, you know, in terms of the numbers of people, I would say that competing for number one would be violence against females worldwide. If you add up all the forms of violence, whether it's domestic violence in this country, which is at an enormously high rate - I mean, the most dangerous place for a woman in this country is her own home, and she's most likely to be beaten or killed by a man she knows. Or it is FGM - female genital mutilation - or it is female infanticide or honor killings or child marriage and too-early childbirth, which is a major cause of death among adolescent girls worldwide. So, you know, violence has reached an emergency - well, it's - I mean, any violence is an emergency but, you know, collectively...

GROSS: What - well, the sense of emergency has certainly increased with groups like the Taliban and ISIS truly attacking women and denying them any form of rights.

STEINEM: Yes, yes. Yes. No, it's the extreme forms of patriarchy, often religious - so-called religious, and the violence against females in warzones - sexualized violence in the Congo and, you know, many in the former Yugoslavia. You know, and all of these have mounted up to a real emergency. But tied, I would say, for first place is the ability of women to decide when and whether to have children because that is a major cause of death - the lack of that ability is a major cause of death. And it is also a major cause of inability to be educated or to be free outside the home or to be healthy. You know, so I would say those two concerns - violence - sexualized violence against women and reproductive freedom or reproductive justice are right up there in our focus in every country.

GROSS: Gloria Steinem, it has been great to talk with you again. Thank you so much.

STEINEM: Thank you so much.

An abject apology from Donald Trump for being a Birther; anti-immigrant; a builder of buildings that look like big Dunhill cigarette lighters; the world's most punishing source of Green Cards for women who marry him to get one; daring to rate women as no longer Tens when he himself has never been a One; going bankrupt multiple times in order to stick other people with his bad-judgment debt; pretending he ever hit a home run when actually, he was born on Third Base -- and oh, yes, setting the hair weave industry all the way back to Rogaine.

9. If Trump doesn't apologize, I wish us all the gift of remembering that Hitler was democratically elected -- in a low voter turnout.

8. I would like state legislatures to stop building prisons with money that once went to universities, thus keeping way too many people in prison and way too many people in lifetime debt. This would not happen if Americans gave ourselves the gift of knowing and caring who our state legislators are.

7. I'm glad we've begun to raise our daughters more like our sons -- but it will never work until we raise our sons more like our daughters.

6. I want people to know that the great gift of Black Lives Matter was created by 3 young black women: Alicia Garza, Opal Tometi and Patrisse Cullors -- and that has led to 3 great organizing guidelines:

Lead with love Low ego, high impact Move at the speed of trust

Gives you faith in the future, doesn't it?

I want Uber to stop charging for the weather -- nobody, not even airlines, charge for the weather! -- and I want Uber to stop refusing the disabled, and now, with 30,000 unregulated Uber cars in New York City, driving wheelchair accessible taxis out of business. Don't let Uber become uber alles.

4. I would like us all to send a nice Christmas thank you to President Obama -- for surviving ultra-right-wingers who, if they had cancer, and Obama had the cure, wouldn't accept it.

3. I want any young men who buy a gun to be treated like young women who seek an abortion. Think about it: a mandatory 48-hours waiting period, written permission from a parent or a judge, a note from a doctor proving that he understands what he is about to do, time spent watching a video on individual and mass murders, traveling hundreds of miles at his own expense to the nearest gun shop, and walking through protestors holding photos of loved ones killed by guns, protestors who call him a murderer.

After all, it makes more sense to do this for young men seeking guns than for young women seeking an abortion. No young woman needing reproductive freedom has ever murdered a roomful of strangers.

(This riff is not mine, it's on the Internet -- I thank whoever gave us all this present.)

2. I want the three magical women of BETTY to have everything they need to spread the BETTY Effect around the world. They are such a gift. They organize with music and by their own irresistible examples.

My Life on the Road

By Gloria Steinem

Random House 304 pp. $28

By Carol Owens

Gloria Steinem is a real person. That may be stating the completely obvious, but it also accurately sums up the dawning realization a reader feels while making her way through Steinem's lyrical, fascinating, and ultimately frustrating memoir, My Life on the Road. As key a figure as Gloria has been in the Second Wave of feminism - and there is no argument about the centrality or longevity of her leadership - she herself as a person has remained in the shadows.

Certainly, Steinem is recognizable, and in fact, easily described: her physicality, her distinct manner of dress and speech, the aviator glasses and center-parted long hair unchanged over the years. She is readily and easily associated with her championing of the core political causes meant to achieve women's equality and basic civil rights: the Equal Rights Amendment, the National Organization of Women, and Ms. magazine. At 81 years old, she has been in the public eye for nearing six decades.

And yet, despite being at the red-hot center of one of the most important social movements of the last century, Steinem has somehow managed to remain a singular person, her own person, never defined by her relationships to others in the way most women find themselves: daughter, sister, lover, wife, mother, aunt. She has always just been Gloria Steinem.

Perhaps this is why the first third of My Life on the Road is such a pleasant surprise, shattering whatever preconceptions of normalcy about Steinem's early years may have existed. Instead of reading the expected story of the hardscrabble life of a Depression-era childhood, there is Gloria's family living happily in Toledo, Ohio -- mother, sister, and most surprising, father Leo.

Gloria's father's outsize figure is the one that looms largest both physically and in spirit. Leo, the son of German and Polish Jewish immigrants, is a restless wanderer by nature. As soon as the summer begins to wane, not too long after the camp where he runs an entertainment pavilion has begun to empty out, Leo packs his wife and daughters into the car and heads out for the open road.

This is, of course, just when the school year should be beginning, but there is no mention of Steinem's early, formal education. Instead, she describes her life as a passenger in the family car, headed to one warm-weather destination or another, as she reads whatever books she wants and is indulged in her love of horses at various stops along the way.

To support the family, Leo, Gloria, and her sister cull treasures from roadside antique stores and yard sales. Leo, it is clear, has taught them how to spot quality in precious metals and jewels, a skill Gloria's never-named sister utilizes in her adult life when she becomes a jewelry buyer in a department store. The Steinems prowl the back roads, snapping up small treasures from unsuspecting or desperate householders and loading them up in their car. Steinem says her father, a man of well over three hundred pounds, was noted for his propensity for carrying loose, perfect jewels wrapped in tissue paper in his pockets, small treasures that he first admired and hoarded before selling to feed the family and fuel the car.

Steinem never refers to her father as a grifter, and it is clear she has only fond memories for this start to her life on the road. Still, there is so very much left unsaid in her often-poetic descriptions of her early years. One throwaway sentence gives a small hint, when she mentions the resonance she felt on first seeing the father-daughter pairing in the movie Paper Moon. There is much to be said there, but she writes nothing further about it.

This is Steinem's style as a memoirist: giving the reader a quick glance at a fascinating part of her life, such as her peripatetic childhood, and then closing the door before the reader can look too long. So it is with Steinem's mother, who remains a cipher, a literate woman whose own journalistic career was cut short by mental illness and by the gender-based limitations of her time. Once again, the reader is left saying to herself: tell me more.

After she graduates from Smith College and begins her own career as a journalist, Steinem acknowledges that she is in part living the life her mother never could, even as the aggregation of her traveling tales makes clear that she is very much her father's daughter. Always on the go, Steinem is a hoarder of valuables of a different kind - connections that she makes with people, often other women, along her path.

Like many great travelers, Steinem manages to cover a lot of ground in part by rarely looking back. She is not one for regrets - the only one she expresses in this memoir is that she was unable to get to her father's side before he died. Her mother and her unnamed sister then disappear from her narrative, never to be mentioned again.

It is not only family that Steinem holds at arm's length. Even in the most heartfelt of the later sections of the book, when she writes about the long, important friendship she had with Wilma Mankiller, the distance is notable. There is no doubt about the love and kinship - the sisterhood - Steinem felt with Mankiller. And yet the grief that she feels about the loss of that relationship to death is muted, hidden between the lines.

In her adult years, Steinem's life intersected with many of the biggest literati and glitterati of the 20th and early 21st centuries, but few of them appear in the pages of My Life on the Road. It is to her credit that she is not a namedropper, as so many memoirists are, but again the reader is likely to be left wanting a bit more. The names Steinem does share are almost all female, as in the long section, ""Talking Circles,"" which reads like a compendium of famous names from the Civil Rights Movement and the Women's Movement.

Recalling those historic times, Steinem writes a good deal about how she and the other participants communicated. She discusses her training in listening and facilitating change through achieving consensus, lessons she ascribes to the time she spent in India, her work with female leaders of the American Civil Rights movement, and her later associations with indigenous people both at home and internationally.

Steinem is much taken with the concept of the ""talking circle,"" a traditional Native American way of working through problems. It is a structure that allows people to give a little, get a little back, create understanding - and then move on. It is not hard to believe some of the attraction of this episodic mode of communication, for her, is its similarity to her earliest days on the road.

In the end, it always seems to come back to moving on. Steinem would no doubt be a fascinating person to sit next to on a plane or train, or in the backseat of a car rolling down the highway. Her stories would certainly make the miles fly by. If only there were more to them. If only we could really get to the heart of things before she bid a polite goodbye and moved on to the next adventure.

146,Steinem,Gloria,audible,"Actually reading the book may be warranted.

Ms. Steinem provided many tales that are educational and eye opening. The time line was hard to follow, as the book doesn't flow according to time, but to ""lessons learned"" perhaps? Or are grouped according to theme?

I'm not sure if the following is a critique of the book itself, or the narration, but it wasn't clear when one chapter began and the previous ended. This may have been due to Ms. Winger's narration having little emotion, and was somewhat monotonous at times. I think there were even some mispronunciations?

Mostly, I did enjoy the Ms. Steinem's tales of her life: from celebrity and political encounters and opinions, to the lessons she learned from everyday encounters with ""normal folk"". I was pleasantly surprised by, and intently listened to, her tales of ""original peoples"". I believe I will read the book myself, as I feel I will get a better feel for the organization and overall themes of the book. Ms. Steinem did narrate the introduction, and to have heard her voice thru the entirety would have been best. But she did relate her fear of public speaking, for which I'm sure this qualifies.",-2,http://www.audible.com/pd/Bios-Memoirs/My-Life-on-the-Road-Audiobook/B015RQOREG

148,Steinem,Gloria,npr,"At 81, Feminist Gloria Steinem Finds Herself Free Of The 'Demands Of Gender'

Enlarge this image toggle caption Annie Leibovitz/Random House Annie Leibovitz/Random House

Gloria Steinem is 81 — a fact that the iconic women's movement leader describes as ""quite bizarre.""

""Eighty-one is an age that I think is someone else's age,"" Steinem tells Fresh Air's Terry Gross. ""I stop people on the street and tell them how old I am, because I'm trying to make myself believe it.""

But Steinem isn't unhappy about aging. The co-founder of Ms. magazine says that as she approached 60, she felt like she entered a new phase in life, free of the ""demands of gender"" that she faced from adolescence onward.

""Remember when you were 9 or 10 and you were this independent little girl climbing trees and saying, 'I know what I want, I know what I think'?"" she says. ""That was before gender descended for most of us.""

""Ironically, I found by 60 you're free again. So you're the same person you were at 9 or 10, only now you have your own apartment, you can reach the light switch, you hopefully have a little money. So you can do what you want,"" Steinem explains.

For Steinem, doing what she wants means continuing to speak out about the political, social and economic barriers to women's rights. She cites violence against women and the fight for reproductive rights as two of the most important issues facing women today.

In her new memoir, My Life on the Road, Steinem looks back on her unconventional childhood, her decades-long career and her efforts to create a home for herself after spending much of her life on the road.

Interview Highlights

On becoming pregnant at 22, before abortion was legal

My Life on the Road by Gloria Steinem Hardcover, 276 pages | purchase close overlay Buy Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How?

I had been doing all of the foolish things that we then did [to terminate a pregnancy], like riding horseback, throwing ourselves down stairs. ... I am the most cowardly person you can imagine, physically speaking, but I did [throw myself down stairs]. ... I was desperate. I really was desperate. I just knew that if I went home and married, which I would've had to do, it would be to the wrong person; it would be to a life that wasn't mine, that wasn't mine at all.

On what made her decide to start talking about her abortion

The amazing thing was that it took me so long. There was no women's movement. It was supposed to be a secret. Women didn't share in the same way. So it wasn't until many years later, after New York magazine had started, and I had gone to cover an abortion speak-out held in a church downtown in New York City and suddenly I heard other women standing up and talking about what it was like to have to go out and seek an illegal abortion. This was actually an alternate hearing to one that the New York State Legislature was holding on the liberalization of abortion law in New York state. This was before the Supreme Court ruling, and a group of early feminists had just said, ""Wait a minute, in the Legislature they asked 14 men and one nun to testify"" — you can't make this up — ""let's hear from women who have actually had this experience.""

So I sat there as a reporter for New York magazine, listening to women tell their stories that were tragic and ludicrous and every human emotion all wrapped into one, and suddenly I thought, ""Wait a minute, I had an abortion."" And actually 1 in 3 American women had needed an abortion at some time in her life, so why is this illegal and why is it dangerous? And it's the kind of revelation that comes from people just telling the truth and discovering you're not alone.

On the morality of abortion

It seems to me that every child has the right to be born loved and wanted, and every person has the right to control — male and female — to control their own bodies from the skin in.

It seems to me that every child has the right to be born loved and wanted, and every person has the right to control — male and female — to control their own bodies from the skin in. I think we need a legal principle called something like ""bodily integrity"" which recognizes that though the state may jail us, they can't insist on injections or tests or pressuring us for organ transplants. Our skin needs to be the line of defense between our own dignity and will and any outside force. ...

The definition of patriarchy is to be able to control reproduction, and that means you have to control women's bodies.

On the most pressing issues for women today

The most important issues are those to the women who are listening. I mean, it's not about dictating to each other what's important, but supporting each other in solving the ones that are in our daily lives. ...

If you add up, in terms of the numbers of people, I would say that competing for No. 1 would be violence against females worldwide. If you add up all the forms of violence, whether it's domestic violence in this country, which is at an enormously high rate — I mean, the most dangerous place for a woman in this country is her own home, and she's most likely to be beaten or killed by a man she knows — or it is FGM, female genital mutilation, or it is female infanticide, or honor killings or child marriage. ... But tied for first place is the ability of women to decide when and whether to have children, because that is a major cause of death, the lack of that ability. ... And it is also a major cause of inability to be educated or to be free outside the home or to be healthy. I would say those two concerns — sexualized violence against women and reproductive freedom or reproductive justice — are right up there in our focus in every country.

On creating a home for herself after many years on the road

I had buried in my head this idea that you only made a home for [a] husband and children. I didn't see a lot of women making a permanent home for themselves; I didn't think that way. And also, I was on the road, so I was always living out of suitcases and cardboard boxes when I was at home, and even though I now, to this day, live in the same apartment that I did then, it was more like a storage place than an apartment.

It was only after I was 50 that ... I began to make a home — a nest — for myself. And I take such pleasure in it. I think in general, as a culture, we tend to think there are two choices: settling down or traveling. And actually you need both. ... Birds need a nest and they still fly. It took me a while [to understand] that it wasn't either/or — it was both.",-2,http://www.npr.org/2015/10/26/451862822/at-81-feminist-gloria-steinem-finds-herself-free-of-the-demands-of-gender
149,Steinem,Gloria,publishersweekly,"This week: Marilynne Robinson, dinosaurs, and dark matter.

Two Brothers by Gabriel Bá and Fabio Moon (Dark Horse) - This work goes far beyond its publicity hook, which is that Eisner award–winning Brazilian twin brothers (Casanova, Daytripper) have adapted Milton Hatoum’s classic novel about twin brothers to the graphic novel form. Narrated mostly by Nael, the illegitimate son of one of the brothers, the tale is presented in a nonlinear narrative with multiple flashbacks, as stories within stories begin to fill in the greater family chronicle spiraling around the twins and their simmering rivalry and hatred. The intricate secrets and lies at the heart of families are set against a backdrop of almost cinematic cityscapes and vistas. Bá and Moon present the naturalistic dynamism of Brazil in their art: sweeping, dramatic organic shapes against the sharp angularity of the people. The stark b&w art crackles to express the subtleties of palpable, barely contained tension between kin, a brutal police beating, and the erotic electricity of an exotic dance. Bá and Moon bring a cool, confident sharpness to their narrative to reflect the shades of gray in this powerful family saga.

Lady Bird and Lyndon: The Hidden Story of a Marriage That Made a President by Betty Boyd Caroli (S&S) - The spouses of the world's most influential movers and shakers rarely receive similar attention to their lives, regardless of the influence they may have had, but biographer Caroli (First Ladies: Martha Washington to Michelle Obama and The Roosevelt Women) bucks the trend with this enticing and fun examination of Claudia Alta Taylor ""Lady Bird"" Johnson. The ascendance of Lyndon B. Johnson. to the White House has been dissected and criticized since he reached the office. He was known for being rude to his closest associates, ridiculing his opponents, and blowing up on his staff. Caroli posits that if it hadn't been for his wife cleaning up his messes, L.B.J. would never have reached such political heights. Johnson was born in Karnack, Tex., to an abusive businessman of a father and a closed-off mother. Being brought up in such a tumultuous household taught Johnson ambition and drive, qualities that later would prove invaluable. As Caroli tells it, she was the real driving force behind every ally L.B.J. ever gained, and she ran interference for him with the press.

These Shallow Graves by Jennifer Donnelly (Delacorte) - Josephine Montfort, one of the wealthy elite in 1890 New York City, is supposed to finish school, marry a suitable gentleman, raise a family, “and that is all.” But smart, self-assured Jo desires more from life—and wants to become a reporter like Nellie Bly. When Jo’s father unexpectedly dies, and she discovers that his death wasn’t an accident, she teams up with an intrepid reporter named Eddie to find out what really happened. They uncover secrets that upend everything she has known, and Jo risks her reputation as they visit checkered parts of the city and she starts to fall for Eddie. While this isn’t a short book, Donnelly’s (Revolution) action-packed chapters propel this compelling mystery. Through Jo’s sheltered perspective, readers learn about class disparity right alongside her, and Donnelly is as adept at describing an opulent ball as she is a seedy neighborhood.

Sinatra: The Chairman by James Kaplan (Doubleday) - The great singer-actor contains multitudes in this vast, engrossing biography of Frank Sinatra’s mature years. Completing his bestselling Frank: The Voice, Kaplan follows the 17-year span from Sinatra’s Oscar-winning role in 1954’s From Here to Eternity to his (first) retirement in 1971, a period when he was a commanding Hollywood star and the acknowledged master of the American songbook. Kaplan delves with gusto into Sinatra’s seething contradictions: swagger and insecurity; sensitivity and callousness; deep loneliness amid a perpetual throng of cronies; an omnivorous sexual appetite that encompassed polar opposites Ava Gardner and Mia Farrow; lordly generosity combined with tyrannical control and a violent compulsion to push people around (most memorably when, while dressed as an Native American woman at a benefit event, he got in a shoving match with a cowboy-costumed John Wayne and then, to work off his anger, had a bodyguard beat up a parking attendant). Kaplan’s sympathetic but unflinching narrative revels in the entertainer’s scandalous private life while offering rapt, insightful appreciations of his sublime recording and stage performances.

The Mulberry Bush by Charles McCarry (Grove/Atlantic/Mysterious) - The unnamed narrator of this exceptional spy novel from McCarry (The Shanghai Factor) vows to avenge his father, a disgraced secret agent. The narrator engineers his own recruitment into “Headquarters” (McCarry’s name for the CIA) and, after training, begins his career as a covert agent, hunting and killing terrorists in the Middle East, though he never forgets his chief purpose in life: exacting retribution on those responsible for his father’s downfall. Amzi Strange, the deputy director for operations and his father’s former enemy at Headquarters, brings the narrator back home, where he decides to implement his plan by infiltrating the remains of a terror organization in Latin America that was led by the charismatic Alejandro Aguilar. The narrator begins an affair with Aguilar’s 29-year-old daughter, Luz, and eventually they marry. McCarry spins his riveting story in unexpected ways; the writing is always subdued but brilliant, leading unsuspecting readers to collide straight into the unforgiving wall of a stunning ending. In a cover blurb, Lee Child says, “Charles McCarry is better than John le Carré.” Many thriller fans will agree.

The Big Book of Sherlock Holmes Stories edited by Otto Penzler (Vintage Crime/Black Lizard) - The breadth of this anthology, which spans over a century and includes everything from straight pastiches and parodies to fully developed whodunits, is but one of its virtues. Among the 83 selections, Penzler offers works by authors better known for other fiction, such as O. Henry, A.A. Milne, and P.G. Wodehouse, as well as tales from Holmes scholars such as Christopher Morley and Leslie Klinger. Settings range from Baker Street to unfamiliar terrain, not necessarily on Earth. The variety of approaches is an eloquent testament to Conan Doyle’s genius in creating such an iconic character. One gem, which may be new even to Sherlockians, is “The Adventure of the Murdered Art Editor,” penned by none other than the classic American illustrator of the Holmes canon, Frederic Dorr Steele. Perhaps Penzler’s most significant contribution is rescuing from undeserved obscurity talented writers who have captured the Watsonian narrative voice and combined it with brilliant deductions and mesmerizing plots, such as Rick Boyer (“The Adventure of Zolnay, the Aerialist”), August Derleth (“The Adventure of the Remarkable Worm”), and James Iraldi (“The Problem of the Purple Maculas”). This volume is a must for all fans of the great detective.

Clementine: The Life of Mrs. Winston Churchill by Sonia Purnell (Viking) - In this first fully researched biography of Clementine Churchill, British political reporter Purnell (Just Boris) reveals a smart, savvy, and independent-minded woman who disagreed with her husband on such political issues as women’s suffrage, and on personal matters such as “holidays, gambling, and even their own son.” Based on extensive interviews with three generations of the extended Churchill family, as well as archival work in Britain and the U.S., Purnell’s work aids readers in appreciating Clementine’s personality, her domestic life, and the political context that she and Winston lived in and helped to shape. While she spent much of her 57-year marriage apart from Winston, Clementine was fiercely loyal and immensely helpful to him, as shown through anecdotes featuring key figures with whom she and Winston interacted, especially during WWII. Purnell shows empathy for her subject, but she doesn’t spare criticism, particularly in portraying her as a distant, somewhat neglectful mother of the couple’s five children—all of whom led troubled lives, except their youngest daughter, Mary. This exemplary biography illustrates how Clementine’s intelligence, hard work, and perseverance in often difficult circumstances made her every bit a match for her remarkable, intimidating husband, and a fascinating figure in her own right.

Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs: The Astounding Interconnectedness of the Universe by Lisa Randall (Ecco) - Using accessible writing and vivid examples, Randall, a theoretical particle physicist and cosmologist at Harvard University, examines the indirect role dark matter may have played in the extinction of the dinosaurs, as just one example of the unlikely connections to be found in the universe. She builds her argument methodically, moving from discussions of the big bang and galaxy formation, through prehistoric extinction events, and into the way dark matter interacts with other forces and particles. Scientists detect dark matter indirectly, Randall says. In space, a massive object bends light as it zips past, so that object’s mass can then be determined by measuring the bend. Its gravity can also perturb the motion of other bodies passing through the area. Randall proposes the existence of a dense disk of dark matter inside the galactic disk of the Milky Way. As stars—including our sun—rotate around a galactic center, they and their planets cross the dark disk. On Earth’s pass-through, the dark disk’s gravity could have perturbed an icy rock in the Oort Cloud, sending it on a collision course with Earth. Randall covers a lot of ground, but does so smoothly even when addressing some of science’s most abstruse subjects. Hers is a fascinating, tantalizing theory, linking life on Earth—or the extinction thereof—with the very origins of our universe.

The Givenness of Things: Essays by Marilynne Robinson (FSG) - This probing, provocative collection by Pulitzer winner Robinson argues for the recovery of humanism as a response to the problems of our historical moment. Robinson's is a ""humanism articulated in the terms of Christian metaphysics,"" based on a deep reading of the Bible and her self-declared Calvinism. She is as impressively erudite and incisive in dealing with Shakespeare's ""theological seriousness"" and the literariness of the Reformation as in examining the current American allegiance to science over wonder, competitiveness over generosity, technology over art. The essays demonstrate an engaging humility, a quiet voice pure of accusation or bombast, and insight touched with humor. Robinson's surgically precise prose and disciplined thought convey regret for human fallibility just as strongly as reverence for human potential. Her solution is a moral reparation—a reinvigoration of ""the conceptual vocabulary of religion"" and ""a more considered understanding of the soul"" that acknowledges ""the ontological centrality of humankind in the created order."" ""To value one another is our greatest safety,"" Robinson writes, ""and to indulge in fear and contempt is our gravest error."" Eloquent, persuasive, and rigorously clear, this collection reveals one of America's finest minds working at peak form.

My Life of the Road by Gloria Steinem (Random) - “If you want people to listen to you,” iconic women’s rights activist Steinem underscores in this powerfully personal yet universally appealing memoir, “you have to listen to them.” And that’s exactly what she’s done for the past four decades, crisscrossing the country in search of inspiring women and women—and men—to inspire. Steinem, a staunch advocate for reproductive rights and equal rights for women, long before either was fashionable in the public eye, writes candidly for the first time about her itinerant childhood spent with a father who itched to be constantly in motion and mother who gave up her own happiness for the sake of others. Vowing to distance herself from both her mother’s dependent lifestyle and her father’s peripatetic ways, Steinem ended up doing exactly what she never imagined: being a public speaker who’s constantly on the move. Highlights include her role in the 1977 National Women’s Conference—“It was my first glimpse of how little I knew—and how much I wanted to learn”—and her accounts of conversations with taxi drivers across the country.

Custer's Trials: A Life on the Frontier of a New America by T.J. Stiles (Knopf) - Stiles, winner of a National Book Award and a Pulitzer Prize for 2009’s The First Tycoon, grounds this spectacular narrative of George Armstrong Custer in skillful research to deliver a satisfying portrait of a complex, controversial military man. The biography centers on the importance of period context in understanding character, incisively showing that Custer lived uncomfortably on a “chronological frontier” of great modern change in the U.S. Though Custer is best known for his fatal “last stand” at the 1876 Battle of the Little Bighorn, Stiles recounts how the officer first attracted national attention for his cavalry exploits during the Civil War. Stiles also delves into the role of celebrity in Custer’s life, tracing the ebb and flow of his popularity over more than a decade after the war, as Custer struggled to find a prominent place in the “peacetime” army that the U.S. deployed in the West against Native Americans. Custer’s personal life was tumultuous: he was a womanizer before and during his marriage to Libbie Bacon, and their home life was complicated by the presence of a freed bondswoman as well as persistent rumors that he had taken a captive Cheyenne woman as his “mistress.” Confidently presenting Custer in all his contradictions, Stiles examines the times to make sense of the man—and uses the man to shed light on the times.

The English and Their History by Robert Toombs (Knopf) - Proceeding from prehistoric times to the present at a commanding pace, Tombs (coauthor, with Isabelle Tombs, of That Sweet Enemy), an expert at the University of Cambridge on Franco-British relations, focuses on England and the English while paying due regard to their Irish, Scot, and Welsh compatriots. No one will confuse this work with the celebrated, sweeping multivolume histories of Macauley, Trevelyan, and Churchill, but this is nevertheless a brilliant distillation of a vast tale and arguably the finest one-volume history of any nation and people ever written. Rare is the historian who can maintain balance amid the interpretive snares posed by such a large subject poses, especially while making “memory and its creation an inherent part of the story.” Comprehensive, authoritative, and readable to a fault, this book should be on the shelves of everyone interested in its subject.",-2,http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/tip-sheet/article/68448-pw-picks-books-of-the-week-october-26-2015.html
150,Steinem,Gloria,theguardian,"I know Hillary Clinton mostly in the way we all do, as a public figure in good times and bad, one who became part of our lives and even our dreams. I once introduced her to a thousand women in a hotel ballroom. Standing behind her as she spoke, I could see the binder on the lectern with her speech carefully laid out – and also that she wasn’t reading from it. Instead, she was responding to people who had spoken before her, addressing activists and leaders she saw in the audience, and putting their work in a national and global context – all in such clear and graceful sentences that no one would have guessed she hadn’t written them in advance. It was an on-the-spot tour de force, perhaps the best I’ve ever heard.

But what clinched it for me was listening to her speak after a performance of Eve Ensler’s play Necessary Targets, based on interviews with women in one of the camps set up to treat women who had endured unspeakable suffering, humiliation, and torture in the ethnic wars within the former Yugoslavia. To speak to an audience that had just heard these heartbreaking horrors seemed impossible for anyone, and Hillary had the added burden of representing the Clinton administration, which had been criticised for slowness in stopping this genocide. Nonetheless, she rose in the silence, with no possibility of preparing, and began to speak quietly – about suffering, about the importance of serving as witnesses to suffering. Most crucial of all, she admitted this country’s slowness in intervening. By the time she sat down, she had brought the audience together and given us all a shared meeting place: the simple truth.

When she left the White House and decided to run for the US Senate from her new home in New York State – something no first lady, not even Eleanor Roosevelt, had dared to do – I was blindsided by the hostility toward her from some women. They called her cold, calculating, ambitious, and even “unfeminist” for using political experience gained as a wife. These were not the rightwing extremists who had accused the Clintons of everything from perpetrating real estate scams in Arkansas to murdering a White House aide with whom Hillary supposedly had an affair. On the contrary, they mostly agreed with her on the issues, yet some were so opposed to her that they came to be called Hillary Haters. It took me weeks of listening on the road to begin to understand why.

In living rooms from Dallas to Chicago, I noticed that the Hillary Haters often turned out to be the women most like her: white, well educated, and married to or linked with powerful men. They were by no means all such women, but their numbers were still surprising. Also, they hadn’t objected to sons, brothers, and sons-in-law using family connections and political names to further careers – say, the Bushes or the Rockefellers or the Kennedys – yet they objected to Hillary doing the same. The more they talked, the more it was clear that their own husbands hadn’t shared power with them.

If Hillary had a husband who regarded her as an equal – who had always said this country got “two presidents for the price of one” – it only dramatised their own lack of power and respect. After one long night and a lot of wine, one woman told me that Hillary’s marriage made her aware of just how unequal hers was.

Haters condemn her for staying with her husband despite his well-publicised affairs. It turned out that many of them had suffered a faithless husband, too, but lacked the ability or the will to leave. They wanted Hillary to punish a powerful man in public on their behalf. I reminded them that presidents from Roosevelt to Kennedy had had affairs, but the haters identified with those first ladies and assumed they couldn’t leave. It was Hillary’s very strength and independence that made them blame her. When I tried describing the public condemnation Hillary would have suffered had she abandoned her duties in the White House for such a personal reason, this changed the minds of some – but not many.

Finally, I resorted to explaining my own reasons for thinking the Clintons just might be, in Shakespeare’s phrase, “the marriage of true minds”. Yet when I brought this up, some Hillary Haters became even angrier. The fact that Bill valued Hillary as an equal partner – and vice versa – seemed to make them more aware that their own marriages were different. It dawned on me that if a sexual connection is the only bond between a husband and wife, an affair can make her feel replaceable – and perhaps cause her to be replaced. This was not only emotionally painful but devastating when it also meant losing social identity and economic security as well. I began to understand that Hillary represented the very public, in-your-face opposite of the precarious and unequal lives that some women were living. In a classic sense, they were trying to kill the messenger.

Their projections made me realise that I was projecting, too. I couldn’t understand why Hillary wanted to go back to Washington, and so campaigned for the Senate in the first place. Why ask for six more years with a target painted on her back? It seemed quixotic and self-punishing, especially now that she had such great alternatives as creating her own foundation, and supporting female empowerment globally.

Finally, I had to admit that the latter would have been my choice, not hers. If she was willing to face a degree of combat that I couldn’t even imagine, I should celebrate.

As my own part of her senate campaign, I began to invite Hillary Haters to the living room events where Hillary herself was fundraising. To my surprise, all but a few turned around once they had spent time in her presence. This woman they had imagined as smart, cold, and calculating turned out to be smart, warm, and responsive. Instead of someone who excused a husband’s behaviour, she was potentially, as one said, “a great girlfriend” who had their backs.

They also saw her expertise. For instance, George Soros, the Hungarian-born financier and philanthropist, introduced her in his Manhattan living room by saying, “Hillary knows more about eastern Europe than any other American.”

After she was elected to the US Senate on her own merits, she worked constructively, even with old enemies there, and was solidly re-elected to a second term. I began to hear the first serious talk of Hillary Clinton as a presidential candidate. By the time the election of 2008 was in the wind, she had a higher popularity rating than any other potential candidate, Republican or Democrat.

Whenever I was on the road before the primaries, I saw a revival of this unconscious coalition in audiences that were interested in politics as never before. There was enthusiasm for these two new faces that stood for a shared worldview. In audiences from very blue states to very red ones, support was more like a Rorschach test than a division by race and sex. For instance, 94% of black Democrats had a favourable view of Hillary Clinton, compared to an 88% favourable view of Obama. After all, he was new on the national stage and the Clintons had earned a reputation for racial inclusiveness that caused African American novelist Toni Morrison to famously call Bill Clinton “the first black president”. Both white and black women were more likely than their male counterparts to support Hillary Clinton – and in my observation, also more likely to believe that she couldn’t win. Male and female black voters were more likely than white voters to support Obama and also to believe he couldn’t win. Each group was made pessimistic by the depth of the bias they had experienced.

Some mostly white audiences seemed to hope this country could expiate past sins by electing Obama. As one white music teacher rose in an audience to say, “Racism puts me in prison, too – a prison of guilt.” Many parents of little girls, black and white, were taking them to Clinton rallies so they would know that they, too, could be president. Older women especially saw Hillary Clinton as their last and best chance to see a woman in the White House. And not just any woman, as one said: “This isn’t just about biology. We don’t want a Margaret Thatcher, who cut off milk for schoolchildren.”

They wanted Hillary Clinton because she supported the majority interests of women. On the other hand, many young, black, single mothers said they supported Obama because their sons needed a positive black male role model.

But the press, instead of reporting on these shared and often boundary-crossing views as an asset for the Democratic party – after all, Democratic voters would have to unify around one of these candidates eventually – responded with disappointment and even condescension. They seemed to want newsworthy division. Soon frustrated reporters were creating conflict by turning any millimetre of difference between Hillary Clinton and Obama into a mile. Since there was almost none in content, they emphasised ones of form. Clinton was entirely summed up by sex, and Obama was entirely summed up by race. Journalists sounded like sports fans who arrived for a football game and were outraged to find all the players on the same team.

It dawned on me that in the abolitionist and suffragist past, a universal suffragist movement of black men and white and black women also had been consciously divided by giving the vote to black men only – and then limiting even that with violence, impossible literacy tests, and poll taxes. Now, this echo of divide-and-conquer in the past was polarising the constituencies of two barrier-breaking “firsts”, never mind that the candidates were almost identical in content. As in history, a potentially powerful majority was being divided by an entrenched powerful few.

Maybe attributing a divide-and-conquer motive was unfair in a country that treats everything like a horse race, but there had to be some reason why the press did not consider what I witnessed on the road – delight in two “firsts” with similar purpose – worth reporting.

Soon, a person or a group’s choice of one candidate was assumed to be a condemnation of the other. I could feel fissures opening up between people who had been allies on issues for years. The long knives of reporters, plus a few shortsighted partisans in both campaigns, deepened those fissures until they bled.

As the New York primary approached, I certainly wasn’t against either candidate, but I still had to decide who to vote for. So I sat down with a yellow pad and made a list of pros and cons for each.

The only obvious difference was experience. This primary race was a rare case in which the female candidate was more experienced in big-time political conflict than the male candidate. She was more familiar with extremists for whom there was no middle ground. I knew that outside the women’s movement, I would be better liked if I chose Obama. Women are always better liked if we sacrifice ourselves for something bigger – and something bigger always means including men, even though something bigger for men doesn’t usually mean including women. In choosing Hillary, I would be seen as selfish for supporting a woman “like” me. But that was a warning, too. Needing approval is a female cultural disease, and often a sign of doing the wrong thing. There was one more note on my yellow pad. Because I still believed it was too soon for Hillary or any woman to be accepted as commander-in-chief, I wrote: If I were Obama, I would not feel personally betrayed by lack of support from someone like me, a new ally. If I were Hillary Clinton, I might feel betrayed by a longtime supporter who left me for a new face. In other words: Obama didn’t need me to win. Hillary Clinton might need me to lose.

Once again the road educated me – by showing me what voters were subjected to. I began to think that the wait for a female president might be even longer than I imagined. On campuses, I saw young men wearing T-shirts that said “Too bad OJ didn’t marry Hillary” (all caps). I watched as MSNBC political analyst Tucker Carlson said of Hillary Clinton: “I have often said when she comes on television, I involuntarily cross my legs.”

A woman reporter for the Washington Post wrote about a Hillary suit jacket that disclosed a bit of cleavage and called it “a provocation”. No such charge had been levelled at male presidential candidates, from John F Kennedy to Obama, when they were photographed on the beach in bathing suits. About Hillary, Rush Limbaugh asked: “Will this country want to actually watch a woman get older on a daily basis?”

No wonder such misogyny was almost never named by the media. It was the media.

In making my list about the pluses and minuses of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, I discovered I was angry. I was angry because it was OK for two generations of Bush sons to inherit power from a political patriarchy, but not OK for one Clinton wife to claim experience and inherit power from a husband whose full political partner she had been for 20 years. I was angry because young men in politics were treated like rising stars, but young women were treated like – well, young women. I was angry about all the women candidates who put their political skills on hold to raise children – and all the male candidates who didn’t. I was angry about the human talent that was lost just because it was born into a female body, and the mediocrity that was rewarded because it was born into a male one. And I was angry because the media took racism seriously – or pretended to – but with sexism, they rarely bothered even to pretend. Resentment of women still seemed safe, whether it took the form of demonising black, single mothers or making routine jokes about powerful women being ball-busters.

Once Obama won, a few wise people in his and Hillary’s campaigns – who had been in touch all along – knew there had to be a healing. With my friend and colleague Judy Gold, who was in charge of women’s issues for Obama’s campaign, I planned what we knew would be the first of many healing meetings. There were heartbroken older women who now knew they would never live to see a woman in the White House. There were younger ones who had grown up being told they could be anything, then been shocked by Hillary’s treatment and defeat. African American women and men who had supported Hillary also worried that some would punish them for working across racial lines. Oprah Winfrey and other women in public life who had supported Obama paid a price, too. Some criticised them for not supporting Hillary Clinton, since women were their main supporters and constituency. This was also true for Karen Mulhauser, a white woman and an important and longtime feminist leader, who supported Obama. I had written and spoken in support of their right to choose Obama, and now they, too, helped to heal the wounds of Hillary Clinton’s defeat.

As my last campaign effort, I made hundreds of buttons that said: HILLARY SUPPORTS OBAMA SO DO I. Then I got on the plane to Washington, went to join the crowd at her historic and generous concession speech – in which she pledged her wholehearted support to Obama – and distributed the buttons to the audience. They were in great demand.

151,Steinem,Gloria,theguardian,"My mother’s stories of suffering during the Depression – and how Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt helped us out of it – taught me that politics are a part of daily life. She described making soup from leftover potato skins, then listening to Roosevelt’s speeches on the radio to nourish her spirit. Or cutting up a blanket to make a warm coat for my older sister and protecting her from ridicule by saying if people loved a new kind of First Lady, they could love a new kind of coat.

It made perfect sense to me that my mother’s stories began in a personal place, and came to a political point. When I saw a mysterious newspaper photo of police dragging dark-skinned people through city streets, my mother explained there were race riots in nearby Detroit – because the Depression had never ended for people called Negroes. I imagined people making soup from potato peelings, yet somehow I couldn’t imagine my family being attacked by police. She also sat with me as we listened to a radio drama about a mother and child trying to survive in a place called a concentration camp. I knew my mother didn’t want to frighten me, only to teach me something serious, and this made me feel important and grown-up. In later years, I wondered if she meant such small doses of hard realities to immunise me against the depression that, in her, could be triggered by as little as a sad movie or a hurt animal. Yet I never asked why my happy-go-lucky father had zero interest in politics. Both were kind and loving, just very different.

It was hard to believe that Franklin and Eleanor would no longer be part of our lives

I was 11 when President Roosevelt died. By then, my mother and I were living in the small town in Massachusetts where we had moved after she and my father separated. I can still see the exact look of the cracks in the sidewalk where I was riding my bike when my mother came out to tell me. It was hard to believe that Franklin and Eleanor would no longer be part of our lives. It was harder still when I realised that not everyone was sorry. Some in that town blamed the president for getting us into the second world war, and others thought his idea of a United Nations would just let foreigners tell us what to do.

Our only companion in mourning was an elderly man across the street who wore a tie with FDR woven into it, something he showed to us as if to co-conspirators. My mother was brave enough to put a black-draped photo of the president in our front window, but not brave enough to explain it to the neighbours.

I was beginning to suspect that conflict follows politics as night follows day, yet the mere thought of conflict was enough to depress my already depressed mother. I myself cried when I got angry, then became unable to explain why I was angry in the first place. Later, I would discover this was endemic among female human beings. Anger is supposed to be “unfeminine”, so we suppress it – until it overflows. I could see that not speaking up made my mother feel worse. This was my first hint of the truism that depression is anger turned inward; thus women are twice as likely to be depressed. My mother paid a high price for caring so much, yet being able to do so little about it. In this way, she led me toward an activist place where she herself could never go.

My own political life didn’t begin until my last year in high school. I was living with my sister in Washington DC, where she was a buyer in a department store and shared a house with three other young working women. They assumed I must be homesick, and it seemed disloyal to tell the truth. Because I was responsible only for myself, I was in heaven.



In my new high school, everyone seemed headed for college. They came from families with bank accounts instead of pay envelopes, dinner parties instead of TV dinners, and vacations in countries my Toledo friends’ families had fled in poverty. Many of my new classmates came from high-level military families, and regarded presidential candidate Dwight D Eisenhower as war hero and father figure combined. To me, Adlai Stevenson, a reluctant candidate drafted by Democrats, sounded more like Roosevelt. Only by accident did I discover that a makeshift Stevenson-for-president office was just a streetcar ride away. The minute I walked into that big room full of ringing phones and rushing people, I felt it was the most exciting place I’d ever been. Staff members were presiding over cluttered desks, volunteers were talking intensely while stuffing envelopes, and teenagers were stacking lawn signs for nearby Maryland and Virginia, where people could actually vote for president, unlike residents of DC, who were supposed to be neutral.

Paid staff were white men, and the few black women and men were volunteers or messengers

Soon I had a place working alongside other young women volunteers, getting purple ink on our hands while tending a big drum-like mimeograph machine churning out a newsletter designed to attract volunteers, called Students For Stevenson. I could see there was a clear hierarchy. Male staffers made decisions, and women carried them out, even women old enough to be their mothers. Paid staff were white men, and the few black women and men were volunteers or messengers. Still, this was much more like the real world than my new school. I spent my first days there trying to figure out why the halls full of students looked so odd. Suddenly I realised everyone was white. I asked a teacher if this reflected the neighbourhood, and he said of course not, it reflected segregation. Washington was two separate cities, he said, and the black majority wanted separate schools, too. Besides, the city had come a long way since slaves built the White House.

This was news to me. My Toledo high school was segregated socially, too – not only by race, but by whose family had a television set, spoke Polish or Hungarian at home, or had a father who was a foreman instead of working the line; but at least we all went to the same classes, ate in the same cafeteria and cheered the same football team.

Altogether, this Stevenson-for-president office was the most open and welcoming place I’d ever been. But one Saturday, when I and the other young women arrived, we found ourselves stashed away on an upper floor. We were devastated. A staffer explained that Stevenson himself might drop in and must not be seen with any female unless she was old enough to be his mother. After all, he was that terrible thing: divorced – something no president had ever been. Though everyone seemed to know Eisenhower had imported the beautiful young Englishwoman who was his driver during the war, and even arranged for her US citizenship, he would have his wife Mamie as a proper First Lady. Appearances were all that mattered.

We didn’t object to being hidden away; we felt like Typhoid Marys who might endanger the cause we cared about. When we went out for 10-cent hamburgers, we talked about staying out of sight. What we didn’t talk about were the male staffers who rated our looks and brushed against us in close quarters. Our presence was the problem; their behaviour was inevitable. Avoiding them while keeping their egos intact was just part of our job.

The truth is that we would have put up with almost anything to stay in this exciting place with its air of fighting for outsiders – even though we didn’t yet know we were outsiders, too. Or, to put it another way, we didn’t believe we could ever be insiders. I didn’t know that political change could make me feel safer in the street, or allow me an identity of my own instead of marrying it, or send my Toledo classmates to college instead of factories, or get my current classmates out of their white ghetto.

I didn’t realise that changes made through politics might have helped my mother remain the pioneer journalist she had been before I was born. My only thought was where else could I find such openness, excitement and hope? I was hooked.

153,Steinem,Gloria,sfchronicle,"After a marathon of emergency talks, the two Koreas called off a state of combat readiness and a border propaganda war last month. Both had been triggered when two South Korean soldiers were severely wounded by a land mine in the Demilitarized Zone, a narrow strip of land that divides the Koreas and is the last relic of the Cold War.

In May, we crossed the Demilitarized Zone with 28 female peace activists from around the globe to call attention to this symbol of unresolved war that has separated families for almost 70 years.

We are grateful that the all-male Korean delegation succeeded in defusing the crisis; however, we cannot help but wonder how the inclusion of female peacemakers could have addressed this militarized division and the still unended Korean War in a more transforming way.

Not only are women and children disproportionately affected by conflict, but, as the two Nobel Laureates from Northern Ireland and Liberia who walked with us in the Demilitarized Zone have proved, female peacemakers can succeed in ending conflicts when their governments cannot. Even the U.N. Security Council recognized this when it unanimously adopted Resolution 1325, calling for women’s participation in all peacemaking processes. The only problem: This has never happened.

So here, as female peacemakers, we offer a way to turn the Demilitarized Zone from a symbol of war and division into one of peace and unity.

First, Seoul and Pyongyang could begin to clear the Demilitarized Zone of its approximately 1.2 million land mines. Both Koreas could transform from being an example of intransigence and danger to one of hope, just by joining 162 countries — 80 percent of the nations in the world — in signing the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty to eliminate these indiscriminate weapons. It won’t end all conflict, but it will end mines.

Second, the two Koreas could allow more civilians to cross the Demilitarized Zone, the physical barrier that keeps the Korean people separated — not seeing, not knowing and not understanding one another. It was drawn by Cold War powers and sealed as a buttress between the two Koreas. Long-stalled family reunifications and civil society exchanges are vital now, but the insanity of this division needs revision.

The only open road across the Demilitarized Zone is the Gyeongui Highway, which a few South Koreans travel by bus to work alongside North Koreans in the Kaesong joint economic zone. It’s the road we took, and although the road is paved, getting permission to traverse this no-man’s land was like navigating a diplomatic jungle. The Koreas should establish a commission to facilitate future requests for Demilitarized Zone, crossings because they will keep coming.

South and North Korean citizens cannot legally cross the Demilitarized Zone. We in the international community can — spiritually and physically — and so we must.

Lastly, we urge our leaders to formally end the Korean War with a peace settlement as promised 62 years ago in the Armistice Agreement by the signatories: North Korea, China, and the United States on behalf of the U.N. Command that included South Korea.

Three members of Congress who are veterans of the Korean War took Washington a step closer in July by introducing House Resolution 384, calling for an end to the Korean War. Voters should urge its passage and remind our leaders to implement U.N. Security Council Resolution 1325. Peace is too crucial to be left to politicians or only the male half of our world.

155,Steinem,Gloria,flavorwire,"Feminist writer and activist Gloria Steinem has launched a book review series: “Reading Our Way to the Revolution: Each Month, a Timeless and Timely Book.” This month, Flavorwire is pleased to host Steinem’s review of The Sacred Hoop: Recovering the Feminine in American Indian Traditions by Paula Gunn Allen.

Perhaps the most powerful adversary of human possibilities is the belief that they don’t exist, can’t exist, and will never exist because they are contrary to human nature.

It is this we are supposed to believe when we are told that hierarchy has always been the way humans organized themselves, with men fighting for the top and women competing for their protection. Or that men have always owned women in order to own children, thus a patriarchy that is universal. Or that land has always has been a private possession and the cause of wars. Or that monotheism is an advance over pagan beliefs in the godliness of all living things.

This is exactly why reading The Sacred Hoop: Recovering the Feminine in American Indian Traditions by Paula Gunn Allen, Native American poet, novelist, mythologist, and activist, may make you more hopeful and more realistic about our possibilities. By teaching us lessons from the hundreds of advanced cultures that prospered on this North American continent — until Europeans brought disease, wars of conquest, and the biggest genocide in world history — Allen helps us to see that patriarchy is neither universal nor inevitable, but the first step in normalizing hierarchy. We also see that land has often been communally possessed and used, and that there are and always have been ways of solving conflict without war.

As she writes, “Feminists too often believe that no one has ever experienced the kind of society that empowered women and made that empowerment the basis of rules and civilization. The price the feminist community must pay because it is not aware… is necessary confusion, division, and much lost time.”

She explains: “Traditional tribal lifestyles are more often gynocratic than not, and they are never patriarchal.” Another term for what she describes is matrilineal, with tribal or clan identity flowing through the woman, husbands joining their wives’ households, and an absence of gender roles that divide human qualities and rob men and women of their full humanity. For instance, Cherokee and many other original languages don’t even have gendered pronouns of “he” and “she,” nor do they have a word for “nature,” since it includes all of us. And the primal symbol of society is not the pyramid of hierarchy, but the circle, the Sacred Hoop, in which all living things have value.

However, balance and equality doesn’t mean sameness in these cultures. Women were usually the growers of food and men the hunters, yet each was equally necessary and respected. A gynocratic or matrilineal society was not a matriarchy in which women dominated men. That perception may be a failure of the imagination, as if someone has to dominate. Instead, balanced societies were rooted in women’s control of their own bodies and birth-giving, through their knowledge of herbs, abortifacients, and timing. The Sacred Hoop is a reminder of why reproductive freedom has to be fought for over and over again, and why the adversaries of non-reproductive sex are the same, whether they are against birth control and abortion, or against sexual expression between women or between men.

The Sacred Hoop helps us to see why the withdrawal of God from women and from nature was a political process over millennia, and that it justified the conquering of women and nature. As Egyptologist James Henry Breasted wrote, “Monotheism is but imperialism in religion.”

Everything described in The Sacred Hoop existed as little as 500 years ago — a mere flicker in the 100,000 or so years that humans have been around. We can’t return even to this recent past, but we can know it as it once was and could be again. We might even insist on learning human history when humans began, instead of when patriarchy, monotheism, and nationalism did.

We honor Indian Country and ourselves by learning what once was and what could be.

As Paula Gunn Allen warned in her wise and mind-blowing way, “the root of oppression is the loss of memory.”

158,Steinem,Gloria,cosmopolitan,"Gloria Steinem is a journalist, author, activist, and feminist leader. She co-founded Ms. magazine and the Women's Media Center and was the subject of the recent HBO documentary Gloria: In Her Own Words. She shares her thoughts about why you should vote on November 4.

If your friends say, ""My vote doesn't count,"" or, ""Politics are dirty,"" it's no wonder. Many forces profit from the unequal pay and status of women, and ever since the civil rights movement and the women's movement created a new majority, they have been trying to convince us that our vote doesn't matter.

You may also be discouraged because voting lines are long, polling places far away, and responsibility for kids and jobs makes voting difficult. Some state officials also create barriers of voter identification — especially for the poor, voters of color, students, and other forces of change. That's part of the reason that voter turnout in this country is lower than in, say, India, with all its problems of poverty and illiteracy. In fact, our country makes voting more difficult than any other democracy.

In non-presidential years like this one, turnout is even lower because the media tend to focus on the White House. This creates the very real danger that the majority of Americans — who believe that women, not the government, should make reproductive decisions about our own bodies — will let unrepresentative anti-choice state legislatures go right on shutting down clinics, as in Texas and Mississippi. Also many or most state legislatures will go right on using our tax dollars to support profit instead of equal pay, and redistricting themselves into perpetuity — including in Washington.

All this is why we must not only vote but be willing to fight to vote — not only for who goes to Washington, but also for our school board and state legislature. #CosmoVotes and many other websites will give you the facts so you can vote for representatives who vote for you. I want to tell you a story.

At the beginning of the 1980s, I went to Missouri to campaign for Harriett Woods, then the only Democratic woman to run for U.S. Senate. She was a great candidate, and her path into politics had been so improbable that no one could have made it up. As a mother of two young children, she complained about a noisy manhole cover that woke them up every time a car rolled over it in her otherwise quiet street. After getting nowhere with the city council, she circulated a petition to close the street to cars. It worked. This success led her to run for the city council. She won, served eight years, got appointed to the state highway commission. Then she ran a successful race for the state legislature, and was re-elected there too. This also made her the much-loved host of a local television show, and a popular candidate statewide.

Still, when the Democratic Party was choosing a candidate for the U.S. Senate primary, it backed a well-to-do guy with no political experience except writing checks. After all, no woman had ever won a statewide office in Missouri. However, Woods turned out have something more important than her party's blessing: community support and volunteers. She beat the rich guy two-to-one.

Suddenly, she was in a race against Republican John Danforth, not only the incumbent U.S. senator, but a former attorney general of Missouri, an ordained Episcopal priest, and the wealthy grandson of the founder of Ralston Purina. It was as if she were running against the entire patriarchy. Also Missouri was thought to be an anti-choice state, yet Woods refused to budge from her principled position in support of reproductive freedom as a human right.

Still, she was winning in rural Republican areas — even one known as Little Dixie. Then with only a week to go, she ran out of money, and couldn't answer the last-minute storm of television attack ads. She lost by less than 30,000 votes out of more than a million and a half.

However, a righteous race can inspire other victories, even in defeat. It was so clear that her loss was due only to money that it caused the founding of EMILY's List, a political action committee supporting pro-equality women. It would become the single biggest such resource in the nation.

Yet Danforth did win. He took with him to Washington and his Senate staff an African-American lawyer who, in St. Louis, had worked for Monsanto, the agrochemical giant that gave us Agent Orange and now genetically engineered seeds. His name was Clarence Thomas. Danforth explained that he was very attracted to him because both men were conservatives and had studied to be priests.

All this happened nearly three decades ago. Woods herself later became head of the National Women's Political Caucus, and in 2007, she died from leukemia at the age of 79. Nonetheless, the impact of this one woman's electoral loss is with us still.

Remember the parable of the nail: ""For want of a nail, the horseshoe was lost; for want of a horseshoe, the horse was lost; for want of a horse, the battle was lost; for want of a battle, the war was lost.""

This should be our mantra — and your vote is the nail. Indeed, the voting booth is the one place on earth where the least powerful are equal to the most powerful.

Here is why:

* If Harriett Woods had won, Danforth wouldn't have gone to Washington as U.S. senator.

* If Danforth hadn't returned to Washington, he couldn't have taken Clarence Thomas with him on his Senate staff.

* If Clarence Thomas hadn't been a visible in Washington as a rare African-American conservative willing to go against the majority views of other African-Americans, he wouldn't have been appointed by President George H.W. Bush to head the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission.

* If Clarence Thomas hadn't headed the EEOC, he couldn't have dismantled its class action powers against discrimination, or been rewarded with an appointment to the D.C. Court of Appeals.

* If he hadn't been appointed as a judge, President George H.W. Bush wouldn't have nominated him to replace the great civil rights advocate Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall.

* If Clarence Thomas hadn't been confirmed by the Senate Judiciary Committee — after narrowly surviving accusations of his sexual harassment of Anita Hill — he wouldn't have been appointed to the Supreme Court.

* If he hadn't been on the Supreme Court, he wouldn't have supplied the one-vote margin that halted the recount of votes in Florida — thus giving the U.S. presidency to George W. Bush. (A post-election examination of uncounted ballots commissioned by 12 major news organizations confirmed that former Vice President Al Gore would have won Florida, and thus the U.S. presidency.)

* If George W. Bush hadn't been president, he couldn't have manipulated evidence to justify the U.S. invasion of oil-rich Iraq — and events still flowing from two Iraq wars plus its occupation by U.S. troops would have been absent.

* If Al Gore had become president, U.S. actions on global warming and the environment would have been very different, and … well, I could go on, but you get the idea.

Due to the absence of just a few votes, each of us can count the differences in our lives, our nation, and our world.

Yes, voting isn't the most we can do — but it is the least. Our vote is our voice.

159,Steinem,Gloria,nytimes,"That’s why the recent passage of Senate Bill 967 in California is such a welcome game-changer in understanding and preventing sexual assault. The bill, which passed the Senate unanimously after a 52 to 16 vote in the State Assembly, now awaits Gov. Jerry Brown’s signature, which is expected. It would make California the first state to embrace what has become known as the “yes means yes” law, because it alters the standard regarding consent to sexual activity on college campuses. It is the first state response to President Obama’s initiative on campus sexual assault, announced earlier this year.

Until this bill, the prevailing standard has been “no means no.” If she says no (or, more liberally, indicates any resistance with her body), then the sex is seen as nonconsensual. That is, it’s rape. Under such a standard, the enormous gray area between “yes” and “no” is defined residually as “yes”: Unless one hears an explicit “no,” consent is implied. “Yes means yes” completely redefines that gray area. Silence is not consent; it is the absence of consent. Only an explicit “yes” can be considered consent.

This is, of course, completely logical, and fully consistent with adjudicating other crimes. Nevertheless, it is bound to raise howls of protest from opponents of women’s equality and their right to make decisions about their own bodies.

“Yes means yes” has been the law of the land in Canada since 1992, yet the reporting of sexual assault has not skyrocketed with this higher standard.

In the 1990s, there was a similar conversation in this country when Antioch College, long a bastion of innovations in education, also decided that consent to sexual activity required more than just a failure to say no. Verbal consent, the new code of conduct stated, was required for any sexual contact that was not “mutually and simultaneously initiated.”",-2,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/05/opinion/michael-kimmel-and-gloria-steinem-on-consensual-sex-on-campus.html

161,Steinem,Gloria,advocate,"Op-ed: On Working Together Over Time

Movements are like rivers. Dipping into them is never the same twice.



Remember in 2007 when the then president of Iran told students at Columbia University, “In Iran, we don’t have homosexuals, like in your country?” The response was laughter, but I had a sinking feeling that something more serious than denial was going on. It did indeed turn out that Iran’s “solution” to freely chosen same-sex relationships was to criminalize them and to subsidize and even compel sexual reassignment surgery. I doubt I would have been so suspicious if his words hadn’t hit memories of four decades ago when I began traveling as a feminist organizer.



In 1974, Ms. Magazine published a long excerpt from Conundrum, the autobiography of the writer Jan Morris, and her transition from her life as James Humphrey Morris, a British army officer. Hers was a brave voyage to authenticity and a story I was glad to play a role in bringing to this country.



The reaction was mixed. It caused some to think that Ms. or I was recommending sexual reassignment surgery as a way of dealing with bias, and others just to be reaffirmed in their idea that we were unnatural women. I remember an outraged professor at a Catholic university standing up in a lecture hall and reading aloud the closing lines of our excerpt: “I do not for a moment regret the act of change. I could see no other way, and it has made me happy.""



Feminists must be right up there with bartenders and therapists as recipients of personal stories, because I also began to hear from gay men and lesbians surrounded by such lethal homophobia that they were considering — and in a few cases proceeding with — transitioning, not to align their bodies with their internal identities, but because of society’s bias against their sexual orientation.



Such stories led me to write a 1977 essay reminding us that, in addition to supporting informed choices like those of Jan Morris, Renee Richards, and others in the news at the time, we also needed to change society to fit individuals. It asked the question: If the shoe doesn’t fit, must we change the foot?



Years passed the Internet arrived, and words circulated out of time and context. Last year one young transgender student on campus assumed that old essay’s use of the word “mutilate” for surgeries performed because of societal pressure meant I was against sexual reassignment surgery altogether. He didn’t consider that it had been written two generations before he was born, and also in the context of global protests against routine surgical assaults, called female genital mutilation by some survivors.



So now I want to be unequivocal in my words: I believe that transgender people, including those who have transitioned, are living out real, authentic lives. Those lives should be celebrated, not questioned. Their health care decisions should be theirs and theirs alone to make. And what I wrote decades ago does not reflect what we know today as we move away from only the binary boxes of “masculine” or “feminine” and begin to live along the full human continuum of identity and expression.



Obviously, there is much similarity among the challenges of transgender people and all women — from health care to harassment to discrimination in the workplace. And there is always the basic patriarchal bias against any sexual expression that can’t end in conception, which is why kids on campus are sometimes mystified by the fact that the same groups oppose both, say, contraception and lesbians. I also think we have a lot to learn from original cultures that often didn’t even have “he” and “she” in their languages, taught girls how to control their own fertility, and routinely accepted and had special roles for the “twin-spirited.” These facts may remind us that patriarchy, racism, and nationalism have been dominant for less than 5% of human history. Maybe they are an experiment that failed.



I know we’ve all worked hard on and are celebrating the Supreme Court marriage rulings this spring, but there is so much work to do to reach full LGBT equality — and ensuring that transgender people also have equality under the law has been the most left out and therefore should become foremost on that list. A stunning 90% of transgender employees have faced discrimination or harassment at work — and no federal law explicitly protects transgender people in the workplace, though nearly 80% of voters in the U.S. support such a law. In weeks, the Senate is expected to take up the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which would provide basic protections against workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity – ensuring that no one can be denied employment or a promotion, or be fired, simply for being lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender. It’s time that law passed. Obviously, no LGBT person should be denied the ability to be who they are because their boss disagrees. I’m grateful for this opportunity to say that I’m sorry and sad if any words floating out there from the past seem to suggest anything other than support, past and present. As feminists know, power over our own minds and bodies comes first.

162,Steinem,Gloria,cnn,"Story highlights Jane Fonda, Glora Steinem, Robin Morgan: Obama short on women appointees They say women helped him win, he must show he sees them as leaders, not just voters They say media companies shape attitudes. He should name women to head FCC, FTC Writers: Media is run largely by men. Time to close the gender gap in U.S. media leadership

Editor’s Note: Jane Fonda, Robin Morgan and Gloria Steinem are the co-founders of the Women’s Media Center.

First, the good news. News organizations – including CNN, The New York Times, The Washington Post and Bloomberg – are asking: Where are the women? They’ve noticed that President Obama’s nominees for his national security team and Cabinet, including Secretary of State, Defense, Treasury, and Director of the CIA, have excluded the talent of potential female appointees.

As co-founders of the Women’s Media Center, whose purpose is to make women more visible and powerful in the media, we want to say thank you for noticing.

Jane Fonda

Robin Morgan

Gloria Steinem

Now, the bad news. President Obama isn’t answering. He wouldn’t have been re-elected without 55 percent of the women’s vote, something he earned by representing women’s majority views on issues, yet now he seems to be ignoring women’s ability to be not only voters, but leaders.

Fortunately, there are still possibilities. A second-term President Obama still has time to demonstrate his commitment to equality in a different but equally important area of the federal government, the agencies that have oversight of the media and telecom industries.

Media companies have some of the most powerful resources at their disposal in shaping attitudes and culture. But media culture, from our TV shows to advertising, is often deeply sexist and normalizes roles that limit everyone. There is a powerful “bully pulpit” effect to having women at the head of these agencies.

Four important agencies regulating media include the Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice’s Antitrust Division and the Commerce Department’s National Telecommunications and Information Administration. One slot has already been filled by a man. On January 3, William J. Baer was sworn in as assistant attorney general for the Antitrust Division.

Erin Burnett: White men to fill Obama’s cabinet

That could leave three. We say “could” because it’s not yet 100% clear that the heads of the FTC or FCC will be stepping down, though top appointees do shift around in a president’s second term. For instance, there has already been speculation that Lawrence E. Strickling, assistant secretary for communications and information, which manages the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, is in the running for FCC chair. Why not an equally logical woman’s name?

Karen Kornbluh, who has just returned from serving as U.S. ambassador to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, was one of six women called qualified by the National Journal. Others named as possible FCC chairs were FCC Commissioners Mignon Clyburn and Jessica Rosenworcel, Clinton administration FCC executives Susan Ness and Cathy Sandoval and Obama adviser and communications expert Susan Crawford.

Obama’s Cabinet shaping up to be a boys club

We’re glad to say the FCC has had black chairmen. William Kennard, for example, made a top priority of closing the digital divide for African-Americans and for Americans with disabilities. It’s unfortunate that there have not been more, though we live in a diverse country in which white Americans are about to become the minority. Never in the 80 years of the FCC has a woman of any race or group been its chair, though women have been the nation’s majority for a long time.

Then there’s the Federal Trade Commission, which has broad oversight over everything from price fixing at the gas pump to whether Google is a monopoly. It includes the Bureau of Consumer Protection, which monitors false and deceptive advertising. Women still have most of the purchasing power in households. According to GfK MRI’s Spring 2011 Survey of the American Consumer, 75% of women are the primary shoppers for all household products. Women are more likely to have the expertise for such decisions in the interest of consumers and also to be affected by those decisions.

As we step into 2013, America’s media are still largely run by men. Women hold only 6% of all TV and radio station licenses. It’s long past the time to close the gender gap in our nation’s leadership and in the media and telecom industries’ leadership especially, where in 2011 only 28.4% of TV news directors were women, according to the Women’s Media Center’s 2012 Status of Women in the U.S. Media report.

We thought President Obama wanted women in his inner circle. Right now, the makeup of that inner circle looks nothing like the country.

163,Steinem,Gloria,cnn,"Limbaugh has long history of hate speech. FCC should ask: Are stations carrying him are acting ""in public interest,"" writers say.

Story highlights Fonda, Morgan, Steinem: Limbaugh long made racist, sexist, homophobic remarks His most recent incident drew strong rebuke, some advertisers have dropped him They say Clear Channel should dump him; if not FCC should evaluate station licenses Writers: Airwaves scarce government resource; his show not ""in public interest""

Editor’s Note: Jane Fonda, Robin Morgan, and Gloria Steinem are the Co-Founders of the Women’s Media Center.

(CNN) —

Ironically, the misogyny Rush Limbaugh spewed for three days over Sandra Fluke was not much worse than his regular broadcast of sexist, racist and homophobic hate speech:

– Female Cabinet members are “Sex-retaries.”

-- “The NAACP should have riot rehearsal. They should get a liquor store and practice robberies.”

– The National Organization for Women is “a bunch of whores to liberalism.”

– [Said to an African-American female caller]: “Take that bone out of your nose and call me back.”

These are just a few samples from the arsenal of degrading language Limbaugh deploys on women, people of color, lesbians and gays, immigrants, the disabled, the elderly, Muslims, Jews, veterans, environmentalists and so forth.

Jane Fonda

Limbaugh doesn’t just call people names. He promotes language that deliberately dehumanizes his targets. Like the sophisticated propagandist Josef Goebbels, he creates rhetorical frames – and the bigger the lie, the more effective – inciting listeners to view people they disagree with as sub-humans. His longtime favorite term for women, “femi-Nazi,” doesn’t even raise eyebrows anymore, an example of how rhetoric spreads when unchallenged by coarsened cultural norms.

Robin Morgan

At least this most recent incident has turned a spotlight back on the vile, damaging statements Limbaugh has been promulgating for years. His sponsors are dropping him; his stations have begun to follow suit. VoteVets, a coalition of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans, released a statement by female vets, including Katherine Scheirman, former chief of medical operations in the U.S. Air Forces, demanding that the American Forces Network drop Limbaugh from its programming.

Gloria Steinem

They state, “Our entire military depends on troops respecting each other – women and men. There simply can be no place on military airwaves for sentiments that would undermine that respect.”

Opinion: It’s un-American to silence Limbaugh

That makes this a fitting time to inquire of his syndicator, Clear Channel Communications, whether it intends to continue supporting someone who addicts his audience to regular doses of hate speech. Clear Channel’s Premiere Radio Networks Inc., which hosts Limbaugh’s program, has defended his recent comments.

If Clear Channel won’t clean up its airways, then surely it’s time for the public to ask the FCC a basic question: Are the stations carrying Limbaugh’s show in fact using their licenses “in the public interest?”

Spectrum is a scarce government resource. Radio broadcasters are obligated to act in the public interest and serve their respective communities of license. In keeping with this obligation, individual radio listeners may complain to the FCC that Limbaugh’s radio station (and those syndicating his show) are not acting in the public interest or serving their respective communities of license by permitting such dehumanizing speech.

Opinion: Democrats should reject Bill Maher’s money

The FCC takes such complaints into consideration when stations file for license renewal. For local listeners near a station that carries Limbaugh’s show, there is plenty of evidence to bring to the FCC that their station isn’t carrying out its public interest obligation. Complaints can be registered under the broadcast category of the FCC website: http://www.fcc.gov/complaints

This isn’t political. While we disagree with Limbaugh’s politics, what’s at stake is the fallout of a society tolerating toxic, hate-inciting speech. For 20 years, Limbaugh has hidden behind the First Amendment, or else claimed he’s really “doing humor” or “entertainment.” He is indeed constitutionally entitled to his opinions, but he is not constitutionally entitled to the people’s airways.

It’s time for the public to take back our broadcast resources. Limbaugh has had decades to fix his show. Now it’s up to us.

164,Steinem,Gloria,womenundersiegeproject,"Sexual violence against women is the result of the cult of masculinity

Gangs of young men rape girls. They also sometimes act as pimps that seduce a girl, then subject her to gang rape or otherwise insist that she sexually service gang members. Some girls are so desperate for acceptance and so convinced by sexual abuse that they have no other value: they see this as inevitable. Thanks to the testimony of a brave female former member of a London gang in Peckham, Guardian readers learned these terrible truths. Certainly, London is not alone in this phenomenon.

But as long as we focus only on the victims, we will never end this victimisation. Think about it: in a report on antisemitism or racism, most of the focus is on the antisemites or the racists – so why not on the sexists who victimise girls and women?



We fear this is because we accept such behaviour as inevitable, almost as much as those girls do – as if ""boys will be boys"" – and that is a libel on men. In fact, the average man is not a rapist. In the US, and probably in yours, too, one in five women has been sexually assaulted in her lifetime, but the average rapist has attacked 14 times.



The use of sexualised violence on the streets of Britain or America is the result of the cult of masculinity – some men become addicted to it and feel they have no identity without it. This cult is a drug pushed by gangs and the culture of wars in order to make men act violently and risk their lives against their own self-interest as human beings. That's why what happens with gangs on the streets of your cities and ours most resembles what happens in wartime. Sociologically, psychologically and practically, the gangs of London and New York may be different in degree, but not in kind. We can only uncover and cure this wound to humanity – especially to the female half of humanity, whose control and subjugation is the most basic requirement of the cult of masculinity – if we report on and pay attention to the victimiser, not just the victim.

167,Norquist,Grover,washingtontimes,"ANALYSIS/OPINION:

Arizona Republicans are working on a tax plan that is shaping up to be the model for states looking to reduce and eliminate their income taxes.

Over the past decade, millions of people and jobs have moved out of high-tax states, such as New York and California, and into Florida, Tennessee, Texas and the five other states that do not impose income taxes. The flexibility to work remotely will only amplify this trend.

In order to compete for that investment, key lawmakers in several states — including Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves and House Speaker Philip Gunn, New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice and Arkansas Lt. Gov. Tim Griffin — are looking to put their income taxes on the path to zero.

Arizona’s leaders have also noticed this trend and want to ensure the Grand Canyon State does not fall behind. This year, they are working on a tax plan that would reduce and maybe even phase out the state income tax.

Arizona’s current income tax is not attractive. Its top rate of 8% is one of the highest income tax rates in the country. Why would anyone move to Arizona when its neighbor Nevada and nearby Texas do not impose individual income taxes of any kind, and neighbors Colorado, New Mexico and Utah have top rates that are significantly lower?

Fortunately, Gov. Doug Ducey, Sen. J.D. Mesnard, President Pro Tem. Vince Leach, Majority Leader Ben Toma and many other Republicans in the legislature want to turn things around for Arizona. The Grand Canyon State is experiencing a $3.9 billion surplus for fiscal year 2022, $1.2 billion of which is ongoing. Rather than using it all to grow government, as Democrat-controlled states often do, Arizona Republicans want to return it to taxpayers in the form of pro-growth income tax relief.

As currently written, the Republican tax plan would streamline Arizona’s current four-bracket income tax system (five brackets when accounting for the new 3.5% “surcharge” that will be imposed on certain income due to Prop 208, which now gives Arizona an effective top rate of 8%) down to a flat rate of 2.5%, lower than its current bottom rate of 2.59% (technically, there will be two brackets with the Prop 208 “surcharge,” but the plan would include an aggregate cap to ensure the effective top rate is not higher than 4.5%).

While that alone would be a huge improvement, many lawmakers also want to set Arizona up for success over the long term, even as the list of no-income-tax states continues to grow. While a flat rate of 2.5% is competitive now, it is a lot higher than zero. As such, there is a serious effort to include a responsible phase out of the income tax over time (excluding the Prop 208 “surcharge”) in the Republican tax package.

The income tax phase out provision that is currently being considered was inspired by North Carolina, where revenue triggers were used to reduce the corporate tax. The revenue triggers in Arizona would be structured a little differently, but the general concept is the same: the rate will only be reduced when excess revenues are available to “pay for” it.

Revenue triggers are a smart way for lawmakers to provide tax relief without the need to reduce current spending levels or raise other taxes, and without the risk of getting ahead of their ski tips. If the use of revenue triggers to phase out the income tax is included in the Republican tax package, Arizona would be a model for other states to copy.

Reducing and, ideally, eliminating the state income tax would be a huge win for all Arizonans. It would make the Grand Canyon State more attractive to businesses and investment, which would ultimately lead to new jobs and opportunities for current Arizona residents.

It would allow small businesses, which overwhelmingly file their taxes on the individual side of the code, to invest more resources in their employees. And most importantly, it would allow the hardworking people of Arizona to keep more of their paychecks.

The Republican tax plan is shaping up to make Arizona the model state for income tax relief and reform. The growing movement of states that are looking to phase out their income taxes is paying attention and eager to be next.

168,Norquist,Grover,ozy,"If you earn less than $400,000, President Joe Biden plans to raise your taxes.

Biden and Kamala Harris publicly pledged at least 56 times that “no one” who earns less than $400,000 a year would see “a single penny” of tax increases or any “new” taxes.

Barack Obama and Biden in 2008 made a similar pledge to never raise any taxes of any sort on anyone earning less than $250,000. They broke that repeatedly.

And Bill Clinton promised to never raise taxes on the middle class, on the bottom 98 percent of incomes.

Less than a month into his first term, Clinton announced he would break his pledge in a Feb. 16, 1993, Oval Office address.

So, the “I will only raise taxes on the few” is a well-developed strategy to convince most voters they are safe from higher taxes and should vote on other issues.

Biden is unique in simultaneously promising to never raise taxes on anyone who earns less than $400,000 in a year while also promising to impose taxes that would do just that. Repeatedly, Biden has said he would “eliminate” the entire Trump tax cut. His audience applauds, having been told over the years that that tax cut was only for “the rich and big corporations.”

But the median income ($73,000) family of four would face a $2,000 tax hike per year if the Republican tax cut was repealed. The median income single parent with one child would face a $1,300 annual tax hike.

Biden emphatically told CNN he would reimpose the Obamacare tax penalty, the tax on those who decline to purchase Obamacare. It hit 5 million American households per year, three-quarters of whom earned less than $50,000. The tax was between $695 and $2,085. Republicans took it to zero in the 2017 tax cut.

Biden, Harris and many members of the Cabinet have called for a tax on energy, or “carbon.” This is a gas tax on steroids, raising the cost of everything in your life including the cost of driving your car, and heating and cooling your home.

Biden wants to impose the highest capital gains tax rate since Jimmy Carter in 1977. Biden has called for doubling the capital gains tax from 20 percent to 40 percent. Remember to add on the 3.8 percent capital gains surtax imposed as part of Obamacare. Then add state capital gains taxes: Californians will face a combined rate of 56.7 percent. Twenty-five million Americans filed a capital gains tax form in 2018.

Biden will also impose an additional death tax and a severe financial and paperwork burden on households and small businesses by eliminating “step up in basis” for capital gains. When a loved one dies, this will automatically force the recipient of any asset to pay an immediate capital gains tax based on the original acquisition cost from decades prior. Later, if you sell the asset, you’ll pay capital gains taxes again. There’s a reason Biden is fattening up the IRS and hiring legions of auditors and agents.

Biden said in the campaign that he would return the corporate income tax from 21 percent to the Obama/Biden level of 35 percent, the highest in the world. His aides now say he might raise it to 28 percent, still higher than China, Canada or most European nations. Higher than all other nations when you add the average state corporate income tax of 4.8 percent for a total U.S. corporate rate of 32.8 percent to the low end of Biden’s expected corporate income tax hike.

The corporate income tax on public utilities is directly passed onto consumers. Americans will see their utility bills go up as a direct result of Biden’s corporate income tax increase. They saw them drop by billions due to the Republican tax cut in 2017.

Studies show that roughly 70 percent of any corporate income tax rate increase is passed onto workers in lower wages. When the GOP cut the corporate rate, we saw this in reverse with the median family income increasing by $4,440 in 2019 alone — a 6.8 percent increase, higher than Obama achieved in eight years.

Why? More after-tax income allows investment in making employees more productive, more valuable and higher-paid. That will now flow backward. Biden hopes you believe that corporations pay the corporate income tax.

And the percentage of the corporate tax that is paid by investors whacks a great number of Americans who will never earn $400,000 in a year. Biden grew up in a period in the 1960s where only 10 percent of Americans owned stock directly. But today thanks to Individual Retirement Accounts and 401(k)s, fully 53 percent of American households have their life savings in a 401(k) or IRA. That is 100 million households. Their life savings are the target of the corporate income tax.

And Biden has demanded an annual gun tax of $200 on Americans who own a rifle for any rifle NOT given up to the federal government in a “voluntary” buyback program. How many Americans paying this tax earn more than $400,000 a year?

And Biden’s cabinet members and leading Democrat congressional leaders are also urging a Value Added Tax (Senator Manchin), a financial transactions tax (AOC), a wealth tax (Senator Warren) — enacted by 14 European nations and repealed by 11 — and an exit tax for leaving the country, pioneered by the Weimar Republic in the 1930s. (Senator Warren again.)

There is not an American who will not see their taxes increase — income, energy, gas, cap gains, guns, IRA/401(k) and Obamacare penalty tax — when the Biden tax bill is enacted.

169,Norquist,Grover,thepoliticalinsider,"By Grover Norquist for RealClearMarkets

Democrats are the party of higher taxes. President Joe Biden has proposed trillions of dollars in tax hikes on American families and businesses while far-left politicians like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are pushing for Biden to go even further and enact trillions more.

Now, with passage of Biden’s $1.9 trillion spending plan, Democrats are not just trying to enact higher taxes at the federal level – they are also trying to stop states from cutting their own taxes.

At the last minute, Democrats added a provision giving federal bureaucrats veto power over any tax cut from now until 2024 if a portion of the $350 billion in state and local aid is used to “directly or indirectly” offset tax cuts.

RELATED: New Progressive Policies, Same Old Tax Tricks From ‘Do Something’ Congress

This provision was inserted by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) at the request of Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) in order to prevent federal dollars from “subsidizing” tax cuts.

This prohibition shows the mentality of the Left – they are okay with providing states with billions of dollars to expand the size of government, but not to reduce taxes for families and businesses.

This vague standard is ripe for abuse and could be broadly applied to block tax cuts across the country for years to come.

The ban violates federalism, infringes on the sovereignty states have over their own tax policy and is an attempt to prevent competition between states.

Tax competition between low-tax states and high-tax states allows voters to see a clear contrast between success and failure. Democrats know that taxpayers have already been voting with their feet.

Over the last decade, millions of people and jobs have moved from high-tax states into states with low or no income taxes, and the ability to work remotely will only amplify this trend.

States such as New York, California and Illinois —which have been spending recklessly for decades —will still be allowed to use the bill’s funds to directly grow the size of government or bail out government union pension funds.

New Hampshire, which does not tax wage income, is looking to adopt a true no income tax by phasing out its 5% tax on interest and dividends income. Several more states — including Arizona, North Dakota, West Virginia, North Carolina and Mississippi— are currently exploring ways to put their income taxes on the path to zero.

RELATED: ‘Climate Change’ Policy Is A Money-Making Opportunity For The Elite

While the Treasury Department said that Georgia’s proposal to cut state income taxes could go ahead, this is the first of many proposals the federal government may demand a say in.

Senators in swing states that voted for the provision, such as Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), and Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.) should explain to their states’ citizens why they want Obama and Chuck Schumer (D-NY) to have veto power over state tax cuts.

Moving forward, Congress should repeal this state tax cut ban.

Fortunately, Republican lawmakers are taking action.

Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.) and Congressman Dan Bishop (R-N.C.) have introduced the “Let States Cut Tax Act,” legislation to repeal this provision immediately.

Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) has introduced similar legislation and has called on Treasury to immediately clarify the vague provision so that states are able to proceed with tax cuts.

Unfortunately, Democrats are doubling down on the ban. Last week, Braun went to the Senate floor to ask for his bill to be passed but it was blocked by Manchin.

The fact is, Congressional Democrats have no business dictating to states whether they can or cannot cut taxes.

171,Norquist,Grover,thehill,"The 2020 elections were some of the most contentious in recent memory. Lawmakers on the left responded by pushing their For the People Act, the liberal wishlist that will never be enacted. What can Congress really do to ensure safe and secure elections in 2022 and beyond? Instead of pushing partisan bills that have no chance of garnering critical bipartisan support, lawmakers should focus on promoting nationwide use of paper ballots as a simple and cost effective way to safeguard our elections.

Our aging voting infrastructure is an environment for malicious hackers trying to wreak havoc on our elections. All hackers have to do is strike a few swing districts to flip a tight race or at least sow doubt in the results. Experts found vulnerabilities in touch screens, optical scanners, and the registration databases that can let sophisticated hackers mount serious threats. Officials told the Brennan Center that machines bought in 2000 have a lifespan of less than 20 years and that they have to scrounge for replacement parts online to keep older machines running.

Worst of all is that most of these outdated machines do not make voters use paper ballots. When older touch screens fail to count votes properly, it could lead to flipping that causes the machines to incorrectly register votes. Indeed, the more machines age, the more vulnerable they are to hackers. Much attention has been focused on Russia, but threats could come out of China and other foreign or domestic hackers.

The Constitution grants states and localities primary administration over elections, but Congress should still take cost effective actions to secure elections across the country. Just as federal agencies provide support to states to manage terrorist threats, the federal government has a limited but critical role to play in giving states and localities the tools they need to defend from sophisticated foreign or domestic hackers.

Republican lawmakers have offered numerous cost effective solutions to harden this voting infrastructure. Former Representative Mark Meadows introduced the Paper Act that allows cost sharing with states to upgrade outdated machines with systems that will produce verified paper ballots. Senator James Lankford introduced a bipartisan Secure Elections Act to provide targeted funds to states to upgrade their systems.

Such legislation need not break the bank and should not be delayed by unrelated spending priorities. Leading estimates reveal that this cost to replace all paperless voting machines in the country is like the cost for one fighter aircraft. Supporting cost effective audits, procedures which verify a small random sample for paper ballots to ensure results, would cost little more. Republican lawmakers have set forth bills that include budget offsets that ensure no additional deficit spending.

Americans deserve to know their elections are safe and secure with all ballots counted as cast. Our insecure voting systems are vulnerable to malicious hackers seeking to cast doubt with our elections. Instead of pushing useless partisan bills, lawmakers must focus on targeted bills which secure voting infrastructure without onerous federal mandates. National use of an older technology of paper ballots will serve us with safeguarding all our critical elections in 2022 and beyond.

173,Norquist,Grover,nationalinterest,"“What would happen to the national debt will depend on the extent to which the bill would include revenue raisers as well as spending. Of course, Congress basically has two options: borrowing money or raising taxes, whether it uses reconciliation or not,” Stan Veuger, a resident scholar in economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, said.

Days after President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion rescue package finally passed, Democrats are already working on another big-spending initiative that will likely target the nation’s infrastructure and invest billions into new projects like broadband internet.

Biden is likely to preview the plan during a joint session of Congress in April, offering lawmakers several months to draft and modify the bill before an August recess, according to Reuters. Though specific details of the package have been vague, it will likely include provisions aimed at gaining a tighter grip on climate change, mirroring the $2 trillion infrastructure and climate plan proposed by Biden on his campaign trail.

“It is going to be green and it is going to be big,” Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-Oregon), chair of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, told the Associated Press on Sunday, noting that he hopes the legislation can swiftly pass through his committee in May.

The president’s infrastructure and climate proposal outlined goals including achieving a carbon pollution-free power sector by 2035, upgrading four million buildings and weatherizing two million homes over four years, constructing 1.5 million sustainable homes, expanding broadband internet to every American and investing in 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations. The initiative also aims to create millions of jobs in related industries such as agriculture, clean energy and auto manufacturing.

“I hope the infrastructure will be of a more fundamental nature than was the case in Obama’s ‘shovel-ready’ investment projects. That is to say, projects need to be carefully thought out to yield high returns over an extended period. These are not ‘stimulus’ measures. Though they stimulate demand to some degree, that is not their primary purpose. Their purpose is to expand the potential of the economy to grow,” Eric Leeper, an economics professor at the University of Virginia, said.

But to swiftly pass the package with razor-thin margins in both congressional chambers, Democrats are reportedly turning to budget reconciliation, a legislative process with wonky rules that avoid a GOP filibuster and doesn’t require a single Republican vote. Democrats used the same procedure to push through the relief bill earlier in the month, making it a purely partisan effort.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-California) pushed Democratic committee chairs in Congress last week to begin working with Republicans on a “big, bold and transformational infrastructure package,” adding that the bill can hopefully rally bipartisan support.

While Republicans support widespread infrastructure spending, most have concerns about the overall price tag of the package that would add to the alarming national debt level and the Democrats’ push to incorporate items on climate into a big-spending initiative.

“What would happen to the national debt will depend on the extent to which the bill would include revenue raisers as well as spending. Of course, Congress basically has two options: borrowing money or raising taxes, whether it uses reconciliation or not,” Stan Veuger, a resident scholar in economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, said.

Veuger added that the ratio of debt held by the public to gross domestic product (GDP), which currently stands at 99.37 percent, could reach as much as 110 percent by the end of fiscal year 2021. He noted that it will continue to grow under current law, “but if we were to add another $2 [trillion] from the infrastructure bill by borrowing the full amount, it would go up to a little under 120 percent. That is very high by historical standards, but interest rates are at historically low levels, making for more moderate annual interest payments.”

“The problem is that rates may go up and that the debt to GDP ratio will go up dramatically over the next few decades if we continue on the current path. Both of those factors will lead to a dramatic increase in interest payments,” Veuger said.

While the growing national debt is a looming issue, some economists pointed to the historically low interest rates for borrowing and that investing in infrastructure projects tends to yield a high rate of return.

“What matters is not the debt but the size of interest payments relative to GDP. Since interest rates are so low, any investment that raises GDP significantly is worth it. Investing in infrastructure has a high rate of return and so it should be done,” Jonathan Gruber, a former technical consultant to the Obama Administration and an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said.

Top congressional Democrats have suggested removing former President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax cuts or implementing stiff tax policy on the wealthy to help fund the package, moves that will likely see rejection from the other side of the aisle.

“Given the severe need for government infrastructure, arguments about funding the investment are red herrings. High-value infrastructure may not fully pay for itself, but it will certainly spur federal tax revenues far more than, say, a cut in capital gains taxes or corporate taxes.” Leeper said.

It’s unclear how Biden and the Democrats will look to fund the infrastructure and clean energy plan at this point, as the focus is more targeted on developing a bipartisan package that won’t resort to budget reconciliation.

Of course, Congress basically has two options: borrowing money or raising taxes, whether it uses reconciliation or not,” Stan Veuger, a resident scholar in economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, said.

Days after President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion rescue package finally passed, Democrats are already working on another big-spending initiative that will likely target the nation’s infrastructure and invest billions into new projects like broadband internet.

Biden is likely to preview the plan during a joint session of Congress in April, offering lawmakers several months to draft and modify the bill before an August recess, according to Reuters. Though specific details of the package have been vague, it will likely include provisions aimed at gaining a tighter grip on climate change, mirroring the $2 trillion infrastructure and climate plan proposed by Biden on his campaign trail.

“It is going to be green and it is going to be big,” Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-Oregon), chair of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, told the Associated Press on Sunday, noting that he hopes the legislation can swiftly pass through his committee in May.

The president’s infrastructure and climate proposal outlined goals including achieving a carbon pollution-free power sector by 2035, upgrading four million buildings and weatherizing two million homes over four years, constructing 1.5 million sustainable homes, expanding broadband internet to every American and investing in 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations. The initiative also aims to create millions of jobs in related industries such as agriculture, clean energy and auto manufacturing.

“I hope the infrastructure will be of a more fundamental nature than was the case in Obama’s ‘shovel-ready’ investment projects. That is to say, projects need to be carefully thought out to yield high returns over an extended period. These are not ‘stimulus’ measures. Though they stimulate demand to some degree, that is not their primary purpose. Their purpose is to expand the potential of the economy to grow,” Eric Leeper, an economics professor at the University of Virginia, said.

But to swiftly pass the package with razor-thin margins in both congressional chambers, Democrats are reportedly turning to budget reconciliation, a legislative process with wonky rules that avoid a GOP filibuster and doesn’t require a single Republican vote. Democrats used the same procedure to push through the relief bill earlier in the month, making it a purely partisan effort.

175,Norquist,Grover,nationalinterest,"During his campaign, Joe Biden said he would “eliminate” the entire landmark Republican/Trump tax cut enacted in 2017, and that his goal was $4 trillion in higher taxes over the next decade. At least 56 times he said there would be no new taxes or tax increases of any kind -- ""not a single penny"" -- on any household making less than $400,000.

During his campaign, Joe Biden said he would “eliminate” the entire landmark Republican/Trump tax cut enacted in 2017, and that his goal was $4 trillion in higher taxes over the next decade. At least 56 times he said there would be no new taxes or tax increases of any kind -- ""not a single penny"" -- on any household making less than $400,000.

The first casualty was the promise of never raising taxes on those earning less than $400,000 a year. The $1.9 trillion spending spree actually included $57 billion in higher taxes. Some of which will hit Americans who earned less than $400,000 and there was no effort to carve them out by Congress or the president.

The Carbon Tax: a gas tax on steroids

Biden, Vice President Harris, Janet Yellen, John Kerry, Pete Buttigieg and many other top appointees want to impose a “carbon” tax. Any carbon tax would hit every single American household and business. Higher cost of gasoline at the pump, more expensive to heat and cool your home, more expensive products.

A carbon tax is so radical that even Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign abandoned any talk of a carbon tax pronouncing that all the polling on the subject “sucked"" and that it would devastate poor households. Biden’s Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg publicly stated that the Biden administration would not support a gas tax as it was obviously a tax on middle class voters. But so is the carbon tax. Just bigger.

Any energy tax would hit the entire economy. It is viewed as the gateway drug to a Value Added Tax—simply extend the tax from the energy sector to all sectors and the United States looks a great deal like Europe. The average VAT in Europe is about 20%.

Raising the Corporate Income tax

Biden has threatened to hike the corporate income tax to either 35% (repealing the entire Trump tax cut as he has promised repeatedly during the campaign) or to 28% (which his staff discusses.) Either would bring the U.S. business tax higher than China’s 25% corporate income tax rate. When Biden was Obama’s Vice President the U.S. tax rate was 35%, ten percentage points higher than China’s 25%.

In 2014 more than $360 billion in U.S. corporate assets announced loans to invert, to leave the U.S. Our higher corporate rate and worldwide -- rather than territorial -- tax system made the U.S. uncompetitive. Biden would return us to that zone.

Hiking the corporate income tax is also a big hit on Americans earning less than $400,000. When Republicans cut the corporate rate form 35% to 21% the lower rates were directly passed on to utility customers -- electric, gas, water bills. Utilities pass the cost of corporate taxes directly to consumers. Billions in lower utility bills flowed from the GOP corporate tax cut. Conversely a Biden corporate income tax hike will mean billions in higher utility costs which will hit households and small businesses hard. Most are earning well below $400,000.

And while ownership of shares of corporate stock was once the realm of Rockefellers and Kennedys, today thanks to mutual funds and 401Ks and individual retirement accounts fully 53% of American households own stocks through their defined contribution retirement accounts. A corporate tax hike reduces after-tax earnings and therefore the value of all stocks. Biden intends to reduce the life savings of 100 million American families.

Doubling the capital gains tax

Biden wants to raise the capital gains rate to 39.6%, the highest capital gains rate since Jimmy Carter in 1977, when the highest possible rate was 39.875%. Malaise. Even a Democrat-controlled House and Senate forced him to sign a reduction in the capital gains tax, after their offices were flooded with letters from middle income households.

Biden repeatedly said in the campaign that he wanted the capital gains tax to be doubled from 20% to 40%, which does not even include the 3.8% tax on capital gains (“Net Investment Income Tax”) imposed as part of Obamacare. Add in state capital gains taxes and some Americans will pay well over 50% on their capital gains.

Biden also wants to repeal “step up in basis” on when a loved one dies, which will automatically force a capital gains realization and paperwork burden on the recipient of any asset.

Capital gains tax cuts lead to investment and growth. Reverse engineer that to calculate how much growth will suffer if the capital gains tax is doubled.

177,Norquist,Grover,washingtonexaminer,"The Democratic Party-controlled House of Representatives is about to vote on the ""PRO Act."" It will destroy the livelihood of millions of independent contractors and freelancers, ban Right to Work laws, and make it easier for union bosses to intimidate workers.

The PRO Act drastically increases the power of labor union leaders to force workers to pay them union dues. This is a quid pro quo, the payoff, in return for the hundreds of millions of dollars Big Labor poured into Democratic Party campaigns to capture the House, Senate, and White House. On the campaign trail, both President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris endorsed the PRO Act and threatened to ban state Right to Work laws, which allow people the freedom to work without being forced to join a union or pay union dues.

The PRO Act would repeal all the existing Right to Work laws that protect 166 million people in 27 states, over half the U.S. population. Forced union dues are wrong, and no one should have to pay someone just to get a job. Congress recognized this over 70 years ago when it passed the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947. If the PRO Act passes, workers all across the country will be forced to pay cash to unions whether they want to or not.

This will harm workers just as our economy recovers from a pandemic-induced recession. Research shows that Right to Work states experience stronger growth in the number of people employed, growth in manufacturing employment, and growth in the private sector than states run by union bosses. According to the National Institute for Labor Relations Research, the percentage growth in the number of people employed between 2007-2017 in Right to Work states was 8.8% and 4.2% in forced-unionism states. Growth in manufacturing employment between 2012-2017 in Right to Work states was 5.5% and 1.7% in forced-unionism states. The percentage growth in the private sector from 2007-2017 in Right to Work states was 13.0% and 10.1% in forced-unionism states.

The PRO Act is also a crucial part of the Left’s full-court press to destroy the gig economy and crush opportunities for freelancers. The ability to work as an independent contractor has allowed millions of people to earn a living without the need to report to a boss.

Instead of championing these workers and their vibrant contributions to our economy, the Left wants to force them to have a boss. The PRO Act will federalize California’s harmful ""ABC test"" for independent contractors. The ABC test, promulgated under California’s absurd AB5 law, forcibly reclassified hundreds of thousands of California’s workers and limited opportunities for freelancers statewide. Nationalizing the ABC test would threaten the more than 57 million workers who engage in freelance work. A key part of the California AB5 law was repealed last November in a statewide referendum. The Democrat state legislators had passed AB5 to empower the union bosses who fund their campaigns. But the people of California wanted the freelance workers to be free.

But there are no national initiative petitions. If the Democratic majorities in Congress pass the PRO Act, people who support freelance work and Right to Work will simply lose their rights.

Note something else. The PRO Act also makes it easier for union organizers to bully and harass workers into joining a union. The bill forces employers to hand over sensitive employee information to union organizers, including home addresses and phone numbers, exposing workers to union intimidation in their homes. Additionally, the PRO Act dismantles key secret ballot protections for workers in certain circumstances, forcing workers to disclose publicly whether they want to be supported by a union or not.

The PRO Act is a massive expansion of Big Labor’s power at the expense of worker freedom. Employers will be able to force workers into unions as a condition of employment, and union bosses will have access to personal information to bully workers into compliance.

Let us hope this legislation dies a quick death.

178,Norquist,Grover,washingtontimes,"ANALYSIS/OPINION:

Now that Democrats fully control Washington they have announced they will bring back “earmarks.”

Earmarks? The bridge to nowhere. The currency of corruption in Washington, D.C., for decades. Earmarks that have been banned by Republicans for a decade because they led to wasteful spending and “pay to play” corruption.

House Appropriations Committee Chair Rosa DeLauro, Connecticut Democrat, and Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, Vermont Democrat, announced their framework to reinstate earmarks last week, which they are calling “Congressionally directed spending.” This will fool nobody.

Democrats are branding this proposal as a way to provide “community project funding.” However, it will actually be a way to buy the votes members of Congress use to support legislation they would otherwise vote against. You do not need to give cash to friends and neighbors of a congressman to vote for a good piece of legislation. Only for a bad one.

Not everyone waits to be bribed. All members of Congress can dangle cash from Washington before the eyes of voters and more importantly potential donors. Of course, earmarks are only needed to get contributions and favors from someone who otherwise would not give to the congressman. It is always a quid pro quo. Pay to play.

Now that the Democratic Congress and White House are adding trillions to their spending spree wish lists, they are simultaneously restoring the means of corrupting all such spending decisions. This will not end well.

President Biden’s $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package already contains countless provisions unrelated to the pandemic.

For instance, the legislation contains $350 billion in bailout money for state and local governments even though many states have seen little or no revenue loss from the pandemic. It spends $1.5 billion for Amtrak, $500 million to fund the arts and $800 million in foreign food aid. The legislation even tried to spend $100 million for the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) expansion in San Jose, California, (right outside of Nancy Pelosi’s district), $1.5 million for the Seaway International Bridge in New York (in Chuck Schumer’s state), but this language had to be removed because it violated budget reconciliation rules.

By restoring earmarks, Democrats will ensure this wasteful spending is only the tip of the iceberg. Already, the left is floating a $4 trillion infrastructure plan in infrastructure spending that would provide giveaways to labor unions, green energy and other special interests. Democrats are already telegraphing that they will use earmarks to buy votes on this proposal.

This kind of process is exactly why earmarks were first banned in 2011. They are the currency of corruption and big spending. They are given to buy the vote of a congressman who may oppose large spending bills, but can find it in his heart to forgive and endorse and vote for this waste if it includes a lovely gift for their district. Earmarks buy bad votes.

Earmarks have a proven lead to massive amount of frivolous spending. The most infamous example of this is the “Bridge to Nowhere,” which would have connected a town of 9,000 to an island with an airport and population of 50, despite the availability of a ferry. This would have cost taxpayers $320 million. Thankfully, once exposed, the project was canceled.

Other examples include a $500,000 earmark for a teapot museum and at least 119 earmarks for bike paths.

Ending earmarks was a great step toward reducing corruption. Bringing them back will once again enable members of Congress to abuse their power, leading to billions in wasted taxpayers dollars.

Washington pundits and lobbyists describe earmarks as a way to foster transparency and make Congress work. In reality, the opposite is true.

In recent years, Congress has developed a bad habit of passing massive multi-trillion dollar spending bills at the 11th hour after giving lawmakers and the public mere hours to review thousands of pages of text.

Earmarks will make this problem worse, not better. It will be easier to buy the votes of politicians while doing nothing to make more transparent or efficient. Politicians will be incentivized to look the other way on this broken process because it benefits them.

A key aspect of the Democrat agenda is trillions of dollars in new spending. Restoring earmarks will make it easier for them to achieve this goal as it will provide them a pathway to buy off hesitant members of Congress. It will make our broken budget process even worse by encouraging corruption and wasteful spending.

179,Norquist,Grover,thegazette,"Phasing out the state income tax would be a huge win for Iowa. It would allow individuals and families to keep more of their hard-earned money while also attracting new jobs and opportunities to the Hawkeye State.

For years, people and jobs have been fleeing high tax states and moving into states that do not impose income taxes. U-Haul's 2020 report on state migration corroborates this trend.

Based on more than 2 million one-way truck customer transactions, U-Haul found Tennessee, Texas and Florida - all of which appear on the list of the eight no income tax states - experienced the greatest in-migration last year. On net, these three states had the most one-way U-Haul trucks enter their borders.

Iowa unfortunately did not come anywhere close to these states when it comes to attracting residents and businesses. In fact, U-Haul did not even find it to have among the 20 highest in-migration rates. But that is not very surprising.

Today, Iowa's income tax scares away investment and jobs. Iowa's top marginal individual income tax rate is 8.53 percent - placing Iowa among the 10 highest state income tax rates in the nation. The good news is that could soon change.

Thanks to a law enacted by Gov. Kim Reynolds in 2018 - which already reduced the rate of each of Iowa's nine income tax brackets - Iowa could have a simpler four-bracket income tax with a top rate of 6.5 percent as soon as 2023. Once fully implemented, that tax reform package will provide Iowans with

$2.1 billion in tax relief, the largest tax cut in Iowa history.

The catch here is that this component of the law is contingent upon revenue collections and certain metrics of growth. Understandably, those triggers were utilized to ensure the state's continued financial stability. But the future is here, and Iowa's financial picture is promising.

Thanks to conservative budgeting practices, Iowa's reserve accounts are full and the state ended the most recent fiscal year with a more than $300 million surplus. That is great news, and official projections have Iowa coming very close to reaching the triggers. However, if tax collections continue to grow, but miss this growth target by a just small fraction, the tax cuts will be unnecessarily delayed.

Fortunately for Iowans, Reynolds does not want to take that risk. '[W]e need to continue the conversation about cutting taxes, and we can start by getting rid of the unnecessary triggers that were put in place in 2018,” said Gov. Reynolds in her Condition of the State address. 'Let's make Iowa more competitive and guarantee our taxpayers that they can keep more of their hard-earned money.”

To guarantee that much-needed tax relief is delivered on time, Reynolds introduced legislation this year that would remove the triggers from the 2018 law. That alone would be a victory for Iowa taxpayers, but lawmakers should not stop there. Even with a top rate of 6.5 percent, Iowa would still have a very long way to go if it wants to compete with the likes of Florida, Tennessee and Texas. In addition to the nine states that do not tax wage income, there still would be 23 more states with top rates lower than Iowa's reduced new rate.

As people and jobs continue to move into states without income taxes, more and more states - including Arkansas, Mississippi and West Virginia - are looking to put their income taxes on the path to zero. Unless Iowa wants to become even less attractive relative to competing states, it needs to begin this journey now.

Reducing and phasing out the state income tax would be a huge win for Iowans. Such pro-growth tax relief would make Iowa more attractive to businesses that are looking to expand, investors who are looking for growing economies with hospitable tax climates, and families who are looking for greater prosperity. This would ultimately bring new jobs and opportunities to current Iowa residents.

It also would allow small businesses, which file their taxes under the individual code, to invest more resources in their employees and business operations. And most importantly, it would allow the hardworking people of Iowa to keep more of their paychecks.

Commentary

One of the lessons for Republicans in Congress from the 2020 election is that they should not be fooled into thinking the American people support socialism.

With control of the House, Senate, and the White House, Democrats are poised to push socialist policies including price controls on the entire healthcare system, Green New Deal mandates and subsidies, and massive tax hikes and spending. Republicans should reject these efforts knowing that they are unpopular with voters.

Let’s take one example of these socialist policies: price controls on medicines.

Democrats in Congress passed and campaigned on the “Lower Drug Costs Now Act,” legislation that forced manufacturers to accept government-set prices as dictated by federal health bureaucrats or pay a 95 percent excise tax on hundreds of medicines.

This was not a good faith effort to lower drug costs, but an attempt to expand the size and scope of government that would move the country closer to socialism. The proposed 95 percent tax is so onerous that the Congressional Budget Office estimated that manufacturers would be forced to comply with government price setting or discontinue selling drugs in the United States.

At a time when new cures and vaccines to fight the Coronavirus pandemic are more important than ever, the proposal would also lead to 100 fewer new medicines over the next decade, according to a study by the Council of Economic Advisors.

When the bill was voted on in the House of Representatives, 191 Republicans in the House—almost the entire conference—voted against this radical proposal. In response, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) launched ads attacking Congressional Republicans for inaction.

How did this message play to the electorate? Not very well. House Democrats expected to pick up 10 to 15 seats, instead they lost that many. Senate Democrats only narrowly took back the Senate—again performing below their expectations.

Individual Democrats even admit that socialist policies cost them races.

For instance, on a conference call of House Democrats shortly after the election, Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D-Va.) criticized those who were pushing socialism, stating “We need to not ever use the word ‘socialist’ or ‘socialism’ ever again … we lost good members because of that.”

Rep. Spanberger is not alone in this assessment. House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.), the third ranking Democrat in the House, said that socialist policies were a “real burden” for members running in moderate districts—including the many districts that caused Democrats to take back the House in 2018.

In Florida, incumbents Donna Shalala (D-Fla.) and Debbie Mucarsel-Powell (D-Fla.) lost after they were unable to shake the charge that they supported socialist policies. On the other hand, Republicans who voted against the plan, like Rep. Brian Mast (R-Fla.) won reelection by comfortable margins despite attack ads being run against them.

Clearly, voters were not swayed by socialist policies.

This is not an isolated case. Progressive activists and the North Carolina Democrat party repeatedly claimed Senator Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) was obstructing efforts to lower drug prices.

First of all, the attack was clearly misleading. While Sen. Tillis opposed one piece of legislation supported by Senator Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Senator Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), he supported other measures to lower drug costs.

It is also worth noting that North Carolina has 45,000 pharmaceutical manufacturing jobs and 250,000 direct and indirect jobs that are promoted by medical innovation. Voters recognized that this line of attack was a left-wing talking point and that the socialist policies being pushed by the left would cost high paying jobs in every industry, including in the pharmaceutical sector. Sen. Tillis stood strong and rejected “solving” the issue through government taxes and mandates.

Just like in the House, these attack ads did not work—Sen. Tillis won his race and ran ahead of the Presidential election by 25,000 votes.

Republicans should remember this lesson of the 2020 election.

Voters do not support the socialist agenda of Congressional Democrats to impose trillions in new spending, new taxes, and more government rules and regulations. Republicans must not get fooled into working with the Left on these socialist policies, whether this is on healthcare, or on other issues.

On the other hand, Republicans who voted against the plan, like Rep. Brian Mast (R-Fla.) won reelection by comfortable margins despite attack ads being run against them.

Clearly, voters were not swayed by socialist policies.

This is not an isolated case. Progressive activists and the North Carolina Democrat party repeatedly claimed Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) was obstructing efforts to lower drug prices.

First of all, the attack was clearly misleading. While Sen. Tillis opposed one piece of legislation supported by Senator Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Senator Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), he supported other measures to lower drug costs.

It is also worth noting that North Carolina has 45,000 pharmaceutical manufacturing jobs and 250,000 direct and indirect jobs that are promoted by medical innovation. Voters recognized that this line of attack was a left-wing talking point and that the socialist policies being pushed by the left would cost high paying jobs in every industry, including in the pharmaceutical sector. Sen. Tillis stood strong and rejected “solving” the issue through government taxes and mandates.

Just like in the House, these attack ads did not work – Sen. Tillis won his race and ran ahead of the Presidential election by 25,000 votes.

Republicans should remember this lesson of the 2020 election.

Voters do not support the socialist agenda of Congressional Democrats to impose trillions in new spending, new taxes, and more government rules and regulations. Republicans must not get fooled into working with the Left on these socialist policies, whether this is on healthcare, or on other issues.

Competition brings out the best in Americans. In sports, science, business, and yes, even in government.

Our federal system has 50 states competing to provide the best government at the lowest cost. Families and businesses move to states with more competent government and lower taxes. Today there is a 50-state competition to attract investment, new businesses, and workers.

In the past 20 years, millions of Americans have moved from states with high state income taxes to states with no state income taxes.

Mississippi’s leaders have noticed this.

Gov. Tate Reeves and House Speaker Philip Gunn would like to responsibly phase out the state income tax over the next several years. If enacted, this reform would allow taxpayers across the Magnolia State to keep more of their hard-earned money and make Mississippi a much more attractive place to live, invest, do business, and raise a family.

Under the status quo, Mississippi has three income tax brackets: 3 percent, 4 percent, and 5 percent. Having a top rate of 5 percent – the component of the income tax that is most often used to make decisions about investment – is not very competitive.

Eight states do not tax personal income at all. New Hampshire does not tax wage income (and is likely to become a true no income tax state very soon). And 10 more states have top marginal individual income tax rates that are lower than Mississippi’s. No wonder Mississippi’s individual income tax ranks 27th in the Tax Foundation’s 2021 Business Tax Climate Index.

Three of the eight no income tax states are located close to Mississippi, with Tennessee just to the north, Florida to the east, and Texas is the west.

As more and more people and jobs continue to move into no income tax states, more and more states in the Southeast and across the country are looking to put their income taxes on the path to zero. In Arkansas, Lt. Gov. Tim Griffin, a former member of the U.S. House Ways & Means Committee, is committed to making Arkansas a no income tax state.

“Now more than ever before, states are competing with each other: for jobs, for new movers, for skilled workers, and for quality of life,” explained Lt. Gov. Griffin. “That’s why I’m calling for a complete and total phase-out of Arkansas’s personal income tax. Eliminating the income tax will incentivize work and productivity, attract high-quality, good-paying jobs, and unleash Arkansas small businesses.”

Top lawmakers in Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, and West Virginia are also eager to put their income taxes on the path to zero. Unless Mississippi acts quickly, it is likely to look even less attractive in the coming years.

Gov. Reeves and Speaker Gunn understand this. Thanks to Republican legislation signed back in 2016 by Gov. Phil Bryant with the help of then-Lt. Gov. Reeves, the 3 percent bracket is already scheduled to be eliminated by 2022. Now, Gov. Reeves and Speaker Gunn want to build on this success by eliminating the income tax completely.

In his Fiscal Year 2022 Budget Recommendation, Gov. Reeves has proposed phasing out the 4 percent bracket within five years and then, subject to revenue triggers, which are a responsible way for states to provide tax relief without getting ahead of their skis, phasing out the 5 percent bracket by 2030.

“Because this plan is a phased approach, we will be able to ensure adequate funding will be available for education, law enforcement, health care, and transportation priorities,” explained Gov. Reeves. “It will not be necessary for us to increase other taxes in order to make up for lost revenue from the elimination of the income tax.”

Gov. Reeves, Speaker Gunn, and Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann have an opportunity to deliver a huge win for all residents of Mississippi by making it the next state to commit to phasing out the job-killing state income tax.

This would make Mississippi much more attractive to investment, bringing new jobs and opportunities to the state. It would allow small business, which file their taxes under the individual code, to have more resources available for jobs and higher wages. And most importantly, it would allow individuals and families to keep more of their hard-earned paychecks.

Mississippi’s future will be brighter if it begins the march to becoming income tax free.

184,Norquist,Grover,foxnews,"Congressional Democrats have a plan to forever keep Republicans from winning elections and influencing policy decisions with H.R. 1 in the House, and the similar S. 1 in the Senate.

They want to empower the government to police more speech, force states to allow vote-by-mail and taxpayer funding of candidates, and silence Americans through fear by exposing their support for issue groups.

The fact that these bills are the first filed shows how high a priority they are, even though the nation is still in the middle of a pandemic and economic catastrophe. Under President Barack Obama, H.R. 1 was the stimulus, under President George W. Bush, it was ""No Child Left Behind."" It’s also a sign that President Biden’s agenda is being dictated by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and The Squad.

LIZ PEEK: BIDEN'S FIRST 10 DAYS – HERE'S HOW HE INFURIATED HALF THE NATION IN RECORD TIME

The mess of bad and unconstitutional policies in H.R. 1 are an existential threat to the Republican Party. They would shatter the ability of Americans to effectively organize, support causes they believe in, and hold government accountable.

H.R. 1 would undermine state election oversight, like efforts to clean up old voter rolls. It eliminates any restrictions on vote-by-mail. Taxpayers would be on the hook for matching 600% of campaign contributions to subsidize candidates they may disagree with – a practice that has been ripe for corruption.

It empowers federal regulators to categorize and regulate speech, including online.

New standards for ""coordination"" would be broad and confusing. All speech that simply mentions a candidate could be illegal four months out from an election if groups speak to the public. Worse, at any time, any funded communication that mentions an issue that might be associated with a politician could be illegal.

The government just has to say the speech ""promotes,"" ""attacks,"" ""supports"" or ""opposes"" a potential candidate.

Who would be doing the regulating? A newly-partisan Federal Election Commission, since the president would appoint the chairman, who would have new powers, and be a tie-breaking vote on a five-person board (down from a bipartisan six-person board).

On top of that, H.R. 1 would also force groups to disclose the personal information of supporters in multiple ways, including tacking the names of top supporters on advertisements.

Democrats can dress this up with talk of ""dark money"" and pretend they’re worried about money in politics, but they’re only worried about Americans with right-of-center views speaking out.

A Cato Institute poll released last summer found 62% of respondents don’t believe they can express opinions publicly.

No billionaires will be harmed in the making of this legislation. The point is to silence dissent and shut down debate through fear, intimidation and overregulation.

Americans already feel they cannot engage in healthy debate. A Cato Institute poll released last summer found 62% of respondents don’t believe they can express opinions publicly.

It’s obvious why. There is a growing list of people who have been harassed, doxed, or worse, over their views – from well-known politicians being yelled at on planes, to truck drivers getting fired for contrived social media controversies.

We want moms starting groups to advocate for homeschooling, we want church-goers effectively petitioning government to reopen, we want taxpayers advocating for more reasonable tax rates. They won’t if they fear for their personal safety and security.

It is a disgrace that the rights of Americans to associate with and support organizations are under threat more than 60 years after the Supreme Court rebuked Alabama’s attempt to get the private information of NAACP supporters.

It is clear that privacy is core to our freedoms of speech and association.

There is still bipartisan opposition. The ACLU slammed H.R. 1 in 2019 saying, ""They will have the effect of harming our public discourse by silencing necessary voices that would otherwise speak out about the public issues of the day.""

Democrat leadership doesn’t care. H.R. 1 is their top priority and defeating it should be Republicans' top priority.

Fortunately, the American people understand what is at stake, and they believe in their right to privacy and security: 70% of voters support private giving and 70% don’t think anyone has a right to know what groups they contribute to, according to a People United for Privacy survey.

Many Republicans have not been as strong in defense of speech as they should. Now is the time for all right-of-center elected officials, organizations and voters to unite on this issue.

185,Norquist,Grover,nationalinterest,"Norquist: ""We have a fairly good idea of how Biden’s economic policies will perform as they are the opposite of Trump’s and the mirror image of Obama’s.""

President Joe Biden promises to raise taxes on America. Then what?

Biden promised as a candidate that he would, “on day one,” repeal the entire Republican “Tax Cuts & Jobs Act” enacted in 2017.

He has also promised to tax energy: a “carbon” tax. To re-impose the Obamacare individual mandate tax. To tax capital gains as ordinary income and double the top rate. To hike the death tax. To end the step-up in basis if you inherit a house or business from a relative. To revive the Alternative Minimum Tax. To impose a $200 gun tax.

What would that do to the United States? How would it affect job creation, income growth, investment and our ability to compete with China, Japan and Europe?

One way to predict the future is to reverse engineer the past four years. What did the tax cuts do for the US economy? Repeal those tax cuts and you reverse the progress of the past few years.

Biden and Obama handed off to President Trump a corporate tax rate of 35%, higher than China’s 25%. The highest in the world. The Republican tax cut of 2017 reduced the corporate rate to 21% and ended the double taxation of American corporate earnings abroad. Before the 2017 tax cut American corporate earnings in France were taxed by France and if returned to the US were subject to US taxation also.

America today has a “territorial” tax system that only taxes business economic activity within our borders. Like every other nation, except Eritrea. (The USA still double-taxes its citizens who work overseas, that is a project for a future presidency.)

From the day Trump won the 2016 election (the date the corporate rate was certain to be reduced) until just before COVID hit, the Dow Jones average increased from 18,848 to 29,398. Unemployment fell from 4.8 percent to 3.5 percent. The labor force participation rate increased from 62.9 percent to 63.3 percent.

In 2019 -- the second year of the tax cut -- the median household income increased 6.8%.

International investors could in 2017 choose to invest in an America that would take only 21% of earnings rather than the previous 35%. Reversing that tax cut would send the opposite signal to investors. We would be stuck with the very tax policy that led to many American companies “inverting” and moving overseas to avoid the high corporate rate and the uniquely destructive worldwide tax system in the USA pre Trump. In 2014 alone, American companies with combined assets of $319 billion announced plans to invert.

Deregulation and a focus on energy production in the US saw US oil and natural gas production increase and worldwide prices fall. Russia, so dependent on oil and gas exports, lost revenue and political muscle.

Trump reveled in lower energy prices that made American goods more competitive than highly taxed energy in Germany or Japan. Biden promises/threatens to hike energy costs in order to force the American economy away from low cost oil and gas to higher cost, subsidized, and intermittent wind and solar.

The Biden economic policy mimics that of Obama: Raise marginal tax rates and spend borrowed money at the federal level. The Obama “recovery” beginning in June of 2009 was the weakest recovery since World War II. Reagan’s recovery based on some spending restraint and lower marginal income and capital gains taxes was the strongest recovery since WWII in jobs, income and GDP.

We have a fairly good idea of how Biden’s economic policies will perform as they are the opposite of Trump’s and the mirror image of Obama’s.

The one difference between Reagan’s and Trump’s approach is that Reagan relied much less on protectionist policies and tariff wars. Trump’s tariff wars were wars of choice. They were expensive. It is yet to be determined how Biden will deal with the economic equivalent of Afghanistan and Iraq—lingering wars of choice that lasted longer and produced less than once promised.

186,Norquist,Grover,foxbusiness,"President Joe Biden’s inaugural address on Wednesday began by asserting his election was a triumph of democracy itself—a significantly more grandiose claim that those who insist their personal electoral win was a triumph for the nation itself.

He then stressed the importance of “unity.” This is a gentle demand that everyone else should do what the speaker wants.

Biden focused on no issue where the two parties are in agreement. All his previously announced policies are backed by most Democrats and opposed by almost all Republicans—raising individual income taxes, hiking the corporate income tax rate higher than China’s, taxing energy (gasoline, home heating), giving the Democrat party control of the now-bipartisan Federal Election Commission, and abolishing the Right to Work Laws that protect workers in 27 states from being forced to pay dues as a condition of employment.

The Senate is divided 50/50. Republicans gained seats in the House of Representatives, only seven seats shy of capturing the majority. Republicans control the state legislatures in 31 states and Democrats in 18.

BIDEN'S FIRST 100 DAYS IN OFFICE TO BE MET WITH 'HEAVY LOADS ON HIS BACK': KARL ROVE

Published reports say that President Biden has prepared 53 executive orders to be imposed before February 10. Executive orders are unilateral action that requires no input for any Republicans or any member of Congress at all.

Trump, denounced by critics as an autocrat, did 11 executive orders in that period. Biden on his first day killed the Keystone XL pipeline from Canada. This action will raise the cost of energy for Americans, cost thousands of jobs and empower Russia and China.

Biden is so sure of the unity behind his major policy plans that he described none of them in his inaugural address.

BIDEN'S FIRST 100 DAYS TO TARGET COVID-19 RELIEF, ECONOMIC STIMULUS

He might have given an example of some non-partisan efforts that he might support. President Trump moved criminal justice reform — The First Step Act — which reduced overlong sentences during his term. For years this had bipartisan support but no one drove the issue across the finish line.

Biden could not list a single policy that now has widespread bipartisan support that he would make a presidential priority.

The key legislation Biden has endorsed, such as HR1, is a Democrat wish list of limits on speech, exposing donors to attack by the cancel culture.

He also endorsed the PRO Act, ending Right to Work and ending the option of freelance work or independent contracting. Last Congress, Democrats passed it through the House with almost no Republican support.

187,Norquist,Grover,spectator,"Donald Trump and the Republican Congress brought the U.S. economy to life after Barack Obama gave us eight years of the weakest recovery since World War II. The partial shutdown of the economy driven by COVID fears reversed those gains, and yet by Election Day 2020, unemployment had fallen from a high of 14.7 percent to 6.9 percent, the stock market rebounded, and GDP growth exploded with a V-shaped recovery.

Republicans turned the economy around once, and then again. What will it take to keep us on pace to keep China and Europe in the rear-view mirror?

When President Trump was elected in November 2016, the S&P 500 jumped 5 percent before he even took office. Investors knew he planned to reduce business and individual taxes and that the threatened spending, taxes, and regulations of a Hillary Clinton presidency had evaporated.

The late 2017 tax bill brought the corporate tax rate from 35 percent — the highest in the world — to 21 percent, below China’s 25 percent but above Ireland’s 12.5 percent. The Trump tax cut also ended the U.S. policy of a worldwide corporate income tax that taxed profits of American companies when they brought their earnings back to the U.S. and after they had already paid taxes on those earnings in other nations, such as France or Japan. Several trillions of dollars in U.S. profits held in limbo overseas were made available for investment in the United States.

The lower corporate income tax drove stock prices up, and investment capital flowed to U.S. firms. Employers created new jobs, expanded operations, and increased wages, benefits, and bonuses. Walmart raised its starting wage to $11. No minimum wage law required — rather real, sustainable growth.

Individual tax rates were reduced at every tax bracket. The per-child tax credit was doubled from $1,000 to $2,000 and extended from twenty-two million to thirty-three million American families. The median income family of four received a $2,000 tax cut. The median income single parent with one child got a $1,300 tax cut.

Repealing the Trump tax cut would gouge the American middle-class family.

With Trump, regulations were significantly reduced, and the Obama–Biden–Clinton plans for ever more regulatory costs were brought to a halt.

The good news after the 2020 election is that a likely Republican Senate means Biden cannot repeal or reduce the pro-growth value of the 2017 tax cuts. Some of those tax cuts were enacted for ten years, and some, like the corporate income tax rate reduction, were made permanent. That is the base of a strong pro-jobs, pro-investment environment upon which we can build.

For the next two years, a Republican Senate will likely stand between Biden and Pelosi and their ability to repeal the GOP tax cuts. Executive orders and regulations will dribble out, slowing growth and killing too many jobs. But in 2022, Pelosi’s House, with its greatly reduced Democrat majority, will run for reelection with the millstone of their radical rantings and House legislation that never passed the Senate around their necks. As in 1994 in reaction to Clinton’s leftward lunge and 2010’s reaction to Obama, the Republicans will retake the House and strengthen their majority in the Senate.

Then, when Biden wants anything, the Republicans will have a wish list of pro-growth policies that they can demand for any spending plans Biden hopes to enact.

The following policies have wide support in the Republican caucus and would help us build on the GOP’s and Trump’s progress on tax reduction and deregulation:

End the taxation of inflation in capital gains. Today, Americans pay capital gains tax on the gain they earn when they sell a home, building, land, or stock. They pay tax on the real increase in value and the accumulated inflation. By executive order the president could rule that capital gains taxes would only be levied on the real, non-inflation gain of any sale.

End the double taxation of Americans who work abroad. We fixed the double taxation of American companies earning profits abroad. But individual Americans who work in, say, France pay both French income taxes and American income taxes. Only two countries do something that stupid: Eritrea and the United States. Ending this would make Americans working overseas more competitive.

Protect the three million students now in charter schools from the teachers’ unions’ demands that charter schools — free of union control — be defunded. Republicans saved the Washington D.C. Opportunity Scholarships from Obama. They can save charter school students across the nation from Biden and the NEA.

Don’t allow infrastructure spending without reforming the permitting process to reduce the time to build a new road or bridge. This would greatly reduce the cost of new construction.

Protect independent contractor laws from the demands of labor unions that everyone has to have a boss and be a target of unionization. Labor unions and Democrats enacted Assembly Bill 5, the California law banning ride-sharing and delivery drivers from being self-employed, independent contractors. Californians sent a shot across the bow of the Democrats and union bosses by scaling back that law through the initiative process on Election Day 2020.

End or restrict the Jones Act and the Davis–Bacon Act. The Jones Act increases the cost of shipping goods between American ports, and the Davis–Bacon Act mandates union wages on any federally funded construction.

Rein in the runaway cost of entitlements with the Paul Ryan reform that blocks grants for all welfare programs to the states and limits their growth to the increase in wages (once we have a GOP House, Senate, and White House). This would have happened already, but we lost that Senate seat in Alabama, weakening the Senate majority.

Put a knife in the politics of envy and class hatred by expanding the investor class. Already there are more than one hundred million Americans with a 401(k) or IRA. Fifty-three percent of U.S. families have such an account, and they see that the strength of corporate after-tax earnings is highly correlated with the increase in their lifetime savings. One hundred million owners of IRAs or 401(k)s are a less appealing target than “the 1 percent.”",2,https://spectator.org/covid-economy-american-spectator-print-magazine/

WHAT SHOULD America’s economic and foreign policy look like in the next two years, four years, and the next generation?

Herewith a baker’s dozen policy recommendations:

Don’t change the rules. The modern Democrat Party is facing a secular decline. The Janus Supreme Court case ruled that twenty-three blue states could no longer require government workers to pay union dues (or fees). That is a body blow to Democrat political funding. Private sector unions now take dues from only 7 percent of workers—down from 35 percent in the 1950s and 20 percent in the 1980s.

Increasing numbers of Americans own stock and are repulsed by class warfare arguments. The Supreme Court is no longer pushing the nation leftward. Democrats outlined a “Hail Mary” agenda to put themselves back into the semi-permanent majority they wielded in Congress from 1932 to 1994 when in sixty-two years Republicans controlled the House for only four years and the Senate for only ten years. The “must have” new rules included: packing the Supreme Court; expanding the number of states to gerrymander the U.S. Senate; abolishing the filibuster, which required supermajority (60 percent) support for major change; making elections more open to fraud by not requiring ID to vote or signatures on mail-in ballots; and so on. Without one party control of the House, Senate, and White House, Democrats cannot change these rules. But Republicans must be careful to examine all legislation for hidden changes in the rules.

Maintain the lower corporate and personal income taxes enacted in 2017. This part is easy as long as the GOP holds a majority in the Senate and/or House. Most Republicans have signed the Taxpayer Protection Pledge, promising their constituents that they will “oppose and vote against” any and all tax increases. The reduction of the corporate rate from 35 percent (higher than communist China’s 25 percent) to 21 percent in 2017 led to strong economic growth. The median family income rose in 2018 alone by 6.8 percent. The unemployment rate for all Americans fell to a historic fifty-year low of 3.5 percent by spring 2020, just before the coronavirus-inspired economic shutdown unemployed 20 million Americans. Yet, the underlying low-tax, reduced regulatory environment allowed the economy to recover quickly. By election day 2020, unemployment fell from 14.7 percent to 6.9 percent. That compared favorably to Obama’s unemployment rate of 7.9 percent as he ran for re-election in 2012.

The 2017 tax reform also eliminated the tax deductibility of state and local taxes of more than $10,000 from one’s taxable income for federal income tax purposes. This ended a significant subsidy for high-tax cities and states at the expense of states with low taxes. This puts pressure on high-tax states like California, New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut to limit their abusive tax rates, which has driven 12 million of their residents to other states over the past decade.

End the double taxation of Americans working overseas. The United States and Eritrea are the only two countries that tax individuals for work they do while living in another country. The United States has a worldwide tax system. The rest of the world, minus Eritrea, has a territorial tax structure. Republicans ended the double taxation of American corporate income in the 2017 bill. Several trillion dollars of U.S. corporate earnings were trapped overseas, unable to be repatriated to the United States lest they pay an American tax penalty. That ended, and trillions were made available for investment in the United States.

Now America should leave Eritrea all alone and end the double taxation on individuals. There are 5 to 8 million Americans working overseas, and they pay billions each year in excess U.S. taxation. As a result, it costs more to hire an American than a German in France because the American must be compensated for his higher (American worldwide) tax burden.

Protect the three million students now in charter schools and help the one million more hoping to go to a charter school. Joe Biden and every Democrat running for president promised the teachers’ unions that he would end federal support for charter schools. The unions are hoping to close such schools and force parents back into the unionized public-school system they worked so hard to leave.

Pass a highway bill only once the lengthy permitting delays have been cut in half. It now takes four-and-a-half years to build a new road or even widen one. Reducing the unnecessary permitting time would save taxpayers billions. The Trump administration urged a reduced permitting time to two years. That is the start of any reform to “infrastructure” spending.

Restore America’s immigration advantage. In the past, nations built navies and fought wars over control of silver, gold, coal, and oil. Today, the most valuable commodity for a nation to accumulate is talent—human capital. And America has an advantage: the most talented, educated and trained men and women on the planet want to come to America to work and live. We do not need to conquer land or control sea lanes. We just need to say yes, and welcome the flood of talent prepared to come to America and create wealth and jobs for America and themselves.

End identify politics/racial discrimination and quotas. On election day, the largest state in the nation, California, voted 55-45 to maintain their stated ban on racial discrimination in employment and education. The ban was enacted by a popular initiative in 1996 known as Prop 209. With this rejection of racial quotas in a vote of the people, the Supreme Court is more likely to be comfortable ruling that all racial quotas and discrimination by the government is unconstitutional. This would be a body blow to the identity politics of the Left.

Protect independent contractor law. The Democrat House in 2020 passed the PRO Act which rewrites independent contractor law and effectively bans Uber drivers, freelancers, and gig economy workers from being self-employed. They would have to have a boss. California’s legislature voted on such a ban at the state level and this November 3, Californians overwhelmingly rejected the attack on independent contractor status. This makes it less likely other states will follow California’s model and is a shot across the bow of similar efforts reviving in Washington.

Broaden the investor class. The politics of class division and hatred aimed at the “one percent” has become less viable as we now have more than 100 million Americans with a 401k or IRA or other tax-advantaged defined benefit pension plans. Donald Trump’s tax cut reduced the corporate rate. As a result, 100 million Americans saw their life savings increase. A Biden tax hike on corporate income would reduce the life savings of those 100 million. The number of Americans with visible life savings vulnerable to attack by higher taxes on businesses know that to damage Bill Gates, Biden would first have to step on their retirement savings.

Index capital gains to inflation. President Trump has the authority to define the “cost” of an asset when calculating capital gains taxes as the original sale plus inflation. The average stock sale price is 40 percent inflation gain. There is no reason people should pay capital gains taxes on inflation.

End Wars of Choice, including trade wars. Tariff wars are wars of choice. Tariffs are taxes. American tariffs are paid by American consumers. All the casualties in a trade war are hit by friendly fire. Yes, we should work to get China to stop stealing our intellectual property. But our weapons should be ones that impose costs on the Chinese government, not the American consumer.

Anti-Appropriations Committee. We have a Senate and House appropriations committee dedicated to spending money. Congress should restore the “anti-appropriations” committee which, during World War II, recommended budget cuts to Congress. These eliminated the Civilian Conservation Corps and the Works Projects Administration, and saved $40 billion in today’s dollars.

Rein in entitlement spending. This requires a GOP House, Senate, and presidency. A project for the 2024 election. Former Speaker Paul Ryan’s plan would block grant the major welfare programs to the states.

Contain China and wait. The United States, since the Revolutionary War, has never fought a nation that had more than 40 percent of our GDP. China is a different threat than Germany or Japan in WWII, or even the Soviet Union. China is, however, facing a demographic change, where from 2015 to 2040 the number of Chinese below age 55 will fall by 250 million and the number older than 55 will increase by 250 million. Fewer workers, more retirees.

If they vote for Democrat challengers Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, they will be voting for Democrat control of the U.S. Senate and the Biden-Harris agenda of tax increases on American families and businesses.

Joe Biden and congressional Democrats have been very clear what that means.

President-elect Joe Biden has promised to impose $4 trillion in new or higher taxes and has repeatedly promised to repeal the Republican-passed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) on ""day one.""

CAL THOMAS: REPUBLICANS HAVE A PERFECT PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE FOR 2024 — AND IT'S NOT TRUMP

This would result in a $2,000 tax increase for a family of four earning the median income of $73,000. A single mother with one child with annual income of $41,000 would see a $1,000 tax hike.

According to Americans for Tax Reform’s analysis of the most recently available IRS data, middle-class Georgians saw the greatest reduction in tax liability after the TCJA was enacted.

Georgia households with adjusted gross income (AGI) between $50,000 and $75,000 saw a 11.5% reduction in federal tax liability. Similarly, Georgia households with AGI between $75,000 and $100,000 saw a 12.8% reduction in federal tax liability.

Families with AGI of between $50,000 and $100,000 saw a tax cut of roughly double what families with AGI of over $1 million received.

Biden has also promised to reinstate the ObamaCare individual mandate tax, a highly regressive tax that forced American families to purchase government approved health insurance or pay a $2,085 tax. If reinstated, this tax would hit over 100,000 low- and middle-income Georgia families.

In 2017, this mandate tax hit 143,180 Georgia households – 89% of those households had annual income of $50,000 or less, and 94% of those households had annual income of $75,000 or less

A vote for Warnock and Ossoff is a vote for the Biden-Harris tax hike agenda that would kill jobs.

Biden’s tax hikes would mean Georgia families pay a top tax rate of 55.09% when factoring in payroll taxes and state income taxes.

A vote for Ossoff and Warnock would also lead to higher taxes on American businesses as Biden has promised to raise the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%. This would make the U.S. tax rate higher than Communist China’s 25% corporate rate and harm workers, jobs and wages as we look to continue rebuilding from the coronavirus pandemic.

Biden’s Cabinet nominees support a host of additional new tax increases, so the Biden $4 trillion tax hike could be just the start.

Biden’s Treasury nominee Janet Yellen supports a $2 trillion carbon tax that would increase costs for middle-class families due to higher costs of cooling and heating, transportation and groceries. Biden has already indicated he would support this tax hike, even though it would break his pledge not to raise taxes on Americans earning less than $400,000 per year.

In addition, Biden’s pick to lead the Office of Management and Budget, Neera Tanden, supports a soda tax that would disproportionately impact low-income Americans. Heather Boushey, one of Biden’s picks for the Council of Economic Advisers, wants to change the Constitution to impose a wealth tax.

Xavier Becerra, Biden’s nominee to run the Department of Health and Human Services supports ""Medicare-for-all,"" which would lead to trillions of dollars in middle-class tax increases.

While a vote for Warnock and Ossoff will be a vote for tax increases, Republican incumbent Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler are staunch defenders of taxpayers. Perdue voted for the TCJA and has been a consistent advocate of middle-class and small-business tax cuts. While Loeffler was not in Congress at the time, she is a consistent voice for tax cuts and a Taxpayer Protection Pledge signer, a written commitment to her constituents to oppose any and all tax increases.

A vote for Warnock and Ossoff is a vote for the Biden-Harris tax hike agenda that would kill jobs and harm small businesses and middle-class families across the country.

192,Norquist,Grover,spectator,"In the media’s burbling about Joe Biden’s emerging administration, we hear such astonishing descriptions as “not political,” “experienced,” and “lifelong public servants.” These are the gauzy phrases of a press corps that equates liberalism with “competence.” In fact, most of Biden’s choices are notorious incompetents — liberal activists whose “experience” consists of pushing long-failed ideas at the expense of the country’s strength.

Even Biden’s supposedly “reassuring” and stolid picks are drenched in left-wing ideology. His “economists” sound more woke than hard-headed. Take the flaky introductory remarks of Janet Yellen, his choice for Treasury secretary:

We risk missing the obligation to address deeper structural problems — inequality; stagnant wages; racial disparities in pay, job opportunities, housing, food security, and small business lending to deny wealth-building to communities of color; gender disparities to keep women out of the workforce and keep our economy from running at full force.

It is no wonder Elizabeth Warren praised Yellen’s selection. The two sound alike. Another telling addition to Biden’s economic team is Neera Tanden as head of the Office of Management and Budget. An open and aggressive liberal activist, she is the antithesis of a green eye-shaded bean-counter. Were Biden set on steering a cautious and centrist course, she is the last person he would select for what is typically a staid position.

Still another bad sign is Biden’s selection of Brian Deese, a climate change activist, as his top economic aide. An Obama administration retread, Deese had a large hand in negotiating the business-crushing Paris Climate Accord.

From Yellen to Deese to John Kerry, Biden’s personnel picks are all supplicants at the altar of extreme environmentalism, on which they will sacrifice countless American jobs. Social and environmental policy, not the goal of economic revival, animate them.

Whatever moderation they display, it is no more sincere than Biden’s. They are all tax-and-spend Democrats, for whom economic policy is simply an extension of their leftist worldview. On the campaign stump, Biden vowed that the first thing he would do is “eliminate the Trump tax cuts.” In panting after higher taxes, Biden revealed himself as a redistributionist at heart, no different than Bernie Sanders. Both Biden and Sanders see taxation as an instrument of social leveling. Explaining his call for higher taxes, Biden said, “Number one — we have the greatest income inequity in the history of the United States of America since 1902. And the fact of the matter is, there is plenty — plenty! — of money to go around.”

By endorsing the socialist rationale for taxation, Biden forecast the direction of his administration. It will seek to lay new burdens on already overtaxed Americans, all in the name of amorphous goals of “justice.”

Yellen is on record in favor of a carbon tax. As Grover Norquist, head of Americans for Tax Reform, points out, that puts Yellen to the left of Hillary Clinton, who “refused to endorse such a tax when she ran for president in 2016 because her studies showed a carbon tax would devastate low and middle-income households.”

Contrary to his campaign rhetoric, Biden has every intention of squeezing the middle class, which his selection of Yellen underscores. She opposed Trump’s tax cuts for the middle class and supports Biden’s plans to increase rates on their capital gains, notes Norquist:

The liberal Yellen will gladly carry out Biden’s tax hike plans. Biden wants to double the top capital gains rate to 40 percent, the highest since Jimmy Carter in 1977. He wants everyone — “every single solitary person” — to pay capital gains taxes at ordinary income tax rates. Biden also wants to impose yet another middle-income tax hike by eliminating the step-up as the basis for capital gains. When you try to leave an asset to your spouse or children, he will force an immediate capital gains realization upon transfer of the asset.

As the propagandistic arbiter of “what is normal,” the media is casting Yellen and company as competent centrists. Don’t believe it. They are neither competent nor centrist. They are, like Biden himself, adherents to a stale liberal ideology, who have learned nothing from its failures and made it even worse by combining it with all the new obsessions of wokeness.",2,https://spectator.org/biden-administration-competence-leftism/

(Bloomberg) -- China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group Ltd.’s expansive pop-up showroom sits at the heart of Shanghai’s National Exhibition and Convention Center. With nine models on display, it’s hard to miss. The electric car upstart has one of the biggest booths at China’s 2021 Auto Show, which starts Monday, opposite storied German automaker BMW AG. Yet its bold presence belies an uncomfortable truth -- Evergrande hasn’t sold a single car under its own brand.China’s largest property developer has an array of investments outside of real estate, from soccer clubs to retirement villages. But it’s the recent entry into electric cars that’s captured investors’ imaginations. Shareholders have pushed Evergrande NEV’s Hong Kong-listed stock up more than 1,000% over the past 12 months, allowing it to raise billions of dollars in fresh capital. It now has a market value of $87 billion, greater than Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Co.Such exuberance over an automaker that has repeatedly pushed back forecasts for when it will mass produce a car is emblematic of the froth that has been building in EVs over the past year, with investors plowing money into a rally that briefly made Elon Musk the world’s richest person and has some concerned about a bubble. Perhaps nowhere is that more evident than in China, home to the world’s biggest market for new energy cars, where a mind-boggling 400 EV manufacturers now jostle for consumers’ attention, led by a cabal of startups valued more than established auto players but which have yet to turn a profit.Evergrande NEV was a relatively late entrant to that scene.In March 2019, Hui Ka Yan, Evergrande’s chairman and one of China’s richest men, vowed to take on Musk and become the world’s biggest maker of EVs in three to five years. Tesla Inc.’s Model Y crossover had just had its global debut. In the two years since, Tesla has gained an enviable foothold in China, establishing its first factory outside the U.S. and delivering around 35,500 cars in March. Chinese rival Nio Inc. earlier this month reached a significant milestone when its 100,000th EV rolled off the production line, prompting Musk to tweet his congratulations.Read more: Nio, Xpeng Exude Optimism as EVs Boom: Shanghai Auto ShowDespite his lofty ambitions and Evergrande NEV’s rich valuation, Hui has repeatedly pushed back car-production targets. The tycoon’s coterie of rich friends, among others, have stumped up billions, but making cars -- electric or otherwise -- is hard, and hugely capital intensive. Nio’s gross margins only flipped into positive territory in mid-2020, after years of heavy losses and a lifeline from a municipal government.Speaking on an earnings call in late March after Evergrande NEV’s full-year loss for 2020 widened by a yawning 67%, Hui said the company planned to begin trial production at the end of this year, delayed from an original timeline of last September. Deliveries aren’t expected to start until some time in 2022. Expectations for annual production capacity of 500,000 to 1 million EVs by March 2022 were also pushed back until 2025. Still, the company issued a buoyant new forecast: 5 million cars a year by 2035. For comparison, global giant Volkswagen AG delivered 3.85 million units in China in 2020.It’s not just Evergrande’s delayed production schedule that’s raising eyebrows. A closer look under the company’s hood reveals practices that have industry veterans scratching their heads: from making selling apartments part of car executives’ KPIs, to attempting a model lineup that would be ambitious for even the most established automaker.‘Weird Company’“It’s a weird company,” said Bill Russo, the founder and chief executive officer of advisory firm Automobility Ltd. in Shanghai. “They’ve poured a lot of money in that hasn’t really returned anything, plus they’re entering an industry in which they have very limited understanding. And I’m not sure they’ve got the technological edge of Nio or Xpeng,” he said, referring to the New York-listed Chinese EV makers already deploying intelligent features in their cars, like laser-based navigation.A closer look at Evergrande NEV’s operations reveals the extent of its unorthodox approach. While it’s established three production bases -- in Guangzhou, Tianjin in China’s north, and Shanghai -- the company doesn’t have a general car assembly line up and running. Equipment and machinery is still being adjusted, according to people who have seen inside the factories but don’t want to be identified discussing confidential matters.In a response to questions from Bloomberg, Evergrande NEV said it was preparing machinery for trial production, and would be able to make “one car a minute” once full production is reached.The company is targeting mass production and delivery next year of four models -- the Hengchi 5 and 6; the luxe Hengchi 1 (which will go up against Tesla’s Model S); and the Hengchi 3, according to people familiar with the matter. The company has told investors it aims to deliver 100,000 cars in 2022, one of the people said, roughly the number of units Nio, Xpeng Inc. and Li Auto Inc., the other U.S.-listed Chinese EV contender, delivered last year, combined.Its workers are also being asked to help sell real estate, the backbone of the Evergrande empire.New hires are required to undergo internal training and attend seminars that drill them on the company’s property history and have nothing to do with car making. In addition, employees from all departments, from production-line workers to back-office staff, are encouraged to promote the sale of apartments, whether through posting ads on social media or bringing relatives and friends along to sale centers to make them appear busy. Managerial-level staff even have their performance bonuses tied to such endeavors, people familiar with the measure said.Meanwhile, the ambitious targets have Evergrande NEV turning to outsourcing and skipping procedures seen as normal practice in the industry, people with knowledge of the situation say.While it’s hiring aggressively and recently scored Daniel Kirchert, a former BMW executive who co-founded EV startup Byton Ltd., the firm has contracted most of the design and R&D of its cars to overseas suppliers, some of the people said. Contracting out the majority of design and engineering work is an unusual approach for a company wanting to achieve such scale.14 Models At OnceOne of those companies is Canada’s Magna International Inc., which is leading the development of the Hengchi 1 and 3, one of the people said. Evergrande NEV has also teamed with Chinese tech giants Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Baidu Inc. to co-develop a software system for the Hengchi range. It will allow drivers to use a mobile app to instruct the car to drive via autopilot to a certain location and use artificial intelligence to switch on appliances at home while on the road, according to a statement last month.A spokesperson for Evergrande said it was working with international partners including Magna, EDAG Engineering Group AG and Austrian parts maker AVL List GmbH in developing “14 models simultaneously.” Representatives from Magna declined to comment. A Baidu spokesperson said the company had no further details to share, while a representative for Tencent said the software venture is with a related firm called Beijing Tinnove Technology Co. that operates independently. Tinnove didn’t respond to requests for comment.Rather than staggering model releases, Evergrande NEV appears to be rolling out every type of car all at once under its Hengchi brand, which sports a roaring gold lion on the badge and translates loosely to ‘unstoppable gallop.’ The nine models being launched span almost all major passenger vehicle segments from sedans to SUVS and multi-purpose vehicles. Prices will range from about 80,000 yuan ($12,000) to 600,000 yuan, although the final costs could change, a person familiar said.That’s a completely different product development strategy to EV pioneers like Tesla, which only has four models on offer. Nio and Xpeng have also chosen to focus on just a handful of marques, and even then are struggling to break into the black.“The market has proved the effectiveness of the ‘one product in vogue at one time’ strategy,” said Zhang Xiang, an automobile industry researcher at the North China University of Technology. “Evergrande is offering many products and expects a win. There’s a question mark over whether this will work.”Without any long-term carmaking nous, Evergrande has issued uncompromising directives to meet its latest production targets, according to the people. Two models, including the Hengchi 5, a compact SUV that rivals Xpeng’s G3, are targeting mass production in a little over 20 months. To hit that timing, certain industry procedures, like making mule cars, or testbed vehicles equipped with prototype components that require evaluation, may be skipped, people familiar with the situation said. Evergrande told Bloomberg it has entered a “sprint stage toward mass production.”As it is, Bloomberg could only find one instance where the Hengchi 5 has been showcased in public, in photos and grainy footage released by Evergrande in February as the cars drove around a snow-covered field in Inner Mongolia. The company’s shares surged to a record.Glossing over those steps is unusual, said Zhong Shi, a former automotive project manager turned independent analyst.“There’s a standard engineering process of product development, validation and verification, which includes several laboratory and road tests” in China and everywhere else, Zhong said. “It’s hard to compress that to shorter than three years.”While there’s no suggestion Evergrande’s approach violates any regulations, its stock-market run could be in for a reality check. After similarly hefty market gains, some EV startups in the U.S. that have yet to prove their viability as revenue-generating, profitable entities have lost their shine over the past few months amid concern about valuations and as established carmakers like VW move faster into EV fray.Read more: The End of Tesla’s Dominance May Be Closer Than It AppearsThe industry’s multi-billion dollar surge also hasn’t escaped Beijing’s attention. Evergrande NEV shares dipped lower last month after an editorial from the state-run Xinhua news agency highlighted concerns about how the EV sector is evolving. Of particular worry are companies that are shirking their responsibility to build quality cars, a blind race by local governments to attract EV projects, and high valuations by companies that have yet to deliver a single mass-produced car, according to the missive, which named Evergrande specifically in that regard. “The huge gap between production capacity and market value shows there is hype in the NEV market,” it said.Still, Evergrande NEV’s stock has gained 18% since then, buoyed by the outlook for China’s electric-car market. EVs currently account for about 5% of China’s annual car sales, BloombergNEF data show, with demand forecast to soar as the market matures and electric-car prices fall. EV sales in China may climb more than 50% this year alone, research firm Canalys said in a February report.With competition also on the rise, some outside Evergrande NEV’s loyal shareholder base remain skeptical.“The market is getting crowded but unless you have a preferred lane, there’s not much chance to win,” Automobility’s Russo said. “Maybe there’s some synergy with the property businesses but right now it’s an EV story, and a pretty expensive one.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",2,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/janet-yellen-treasury-secretary-mean-153002764.html
194,Norquist,Grover,foxbusiness,"President-elect Joe Biden announced Monday that he will nominate Janet Yellen, a former chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank, to be his Secretary of the Treasury.

What does that mean to American taxpayers?

To start, it means your personal income taxes will increase, your 401k will drop in value as the Biden administration and Yellen increase the corporate tax on the corporate stocks in your 401k, and your cost of gasoline and energy will increase.

Most telling, Yellen has previously stated her opposition to the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, also known as the ""Trump tax cuts"" which reduced the corporate income tax and personal income tax.

BIDEN PICKS YELLEN FOR TREASURY SECRETARY, DEMOCRATIC OPERATIVE TANDEN FOR OMB DIRECTOR

She wrote in a co-bylined op-ed in the Washington Post in 2018 that there was no need for a tax cut because, “the economy was already at or close to full employment and did not need a boost.”

Americans who found jobs after the enactment of the tax cuts would disagree. After the tax cuts were signed into law in December 2017, the unemployment rate dropped from 4.1% down to 3.5% just before the pandemic hit. African American unemployment dropped from 6.7% to 5.8% and Hispanic unemployment dropped from 5.0% to 4.4%.

5,122,000 jobs were created from December 2017 to February 2020. The labor force participation rate rose from 62.7% to 63.4%.

Median household income increased by $4,440 or 6.8% in 2019 -- the largest one-year wage growth in history.

All that will run backwards by repealing the tax cut that gave us the growth and jobs.

Biden and Vice Presdient-elect Kamala Harris said repeatedly during the 2020 presidential campaign that they will “eliminate” the Trump tax cuts on “day one.” Such a repeal would impose a $2,000 annual tax hike on a median-income family of four and a $1,300 tax hike on a median income single parent with one child.

WHO IS JANET YELLEN?

Repeal of the tax cuts also means the individual mandate tax will come back into force, hitting five million households with a $695 - $2,085 tax. 75% of these households make less than $50,000 per year.

The liberal Yellen will gladly carry out Biden’s tax hike plans. Biden wants to double the top capital gains rate to 40%, the highest since Jimmy Carter in 1977. He wants everyone -- “every single solitary person” -- to pay capital gains taxes at ordinary income tax rates.

Biden also wants to impose yet another middle-income tax hike by eliminating the step-up as the basis for capital gains. When you try to leave an asset to your spouse or children, he will force an immediate capital gains realization upon transfer of the asset.

7 FINANCIAL PLANNING TIPS TO ACT ON BEFORE THE END OF 2020

Trump permanently lowered the U.S. corporate income tax to 21% which finally made America competitive with other nations on tax policy. Yellen will be tasked with helping Biden raise the corporate tax rate to 28%, even higher than Communist China’s 25%.

The Treasury also oversees the IRS, so look for Biden and Yellen to increase the IRS enforcement budget so more agents can audit your small business.

Choosing Yellen tells us that Biden will keep his promise/threat to impose a tax on energy. Yellen is a longtime supporter of placing a tax on energy.

She has endorsed an energy/carbon tax of $40 a ton which translates into a 40-cent increase in the cost of a gallon of gasoline when you fill your tank. This energy/carbon tax will also increase the cost of your home heating oil, natural gas, and the cost of all products shipped to stores or your home by truck, plane, or rail.

Once in law, the Yellen carbon tax automatically ratchets up each year. A tax increase every year, on autopilot, without a vote from congress. A new gusher of your tax dollars pouring into Washington DC, a politician’s dream.

Even former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton refused to endorse such a tax when she ran for president in 2016 because her studies showed a carbon tax would devastate low and middle-income households. And picking Yellen also signals that it is full speed ahead on increasing spending.

Rather than enact the $500 million COVID-focused legislation from the Republican senate, Yellen and Biden support the $3 trillion spending spree to subsidize states and big cities that bankrupted themselves due to decades of overspending and mismanagement plus gold-plated pension for unionized government workers.

Promising to nominate Yellen to lead the Treasury Department, an advocate of higher income taxes and new taxes on energy/gas demonstrates that Biden will follow through on his threat to raise taxes at least $4 trillion and did not mean a word of his promise to never raise a penny of any tax on taxes on anyone who earns less than $400,000. Let's be honest, most people filling up their tanks with gas make somewhat less than $400,000.

195,Norquist,Grover,washingtonpost,"Take the drug-legalization initiatives that passed across the country. This is an area of policy legislators tend to view as too hot to handle until voters make their preferences impossible to ignore or oppose.

Continuing a trend, four states voted to legalize recreational cannabis: South Dakota, Montana, Arizona and New Jersey. Mississippi approved medical marijuana. D.C. effectively decriminalized psychedelic mushrooms and Oregon effectively decriminalized possession of all drugs — yes, including heroin and cocaine. This means 19 states have used the initiative or referendum process to enact medical marijuana laws and 13 states have legalized recreational use of the drug via ballot measures. Only Vermont and Illinois have legalized recreational use of marijuana and cannabis through the legislative process.

If the drug initiatives suggested that Americans want the government to stay out of their recreational activities, voters in Michigan spoke for the nation, saying they want officials to stay out of their lives online, too. Nearly 89 percent of Michigan residents voted to amend the state constitution to require authorities to get a search warrant to access a person’s electronic data and communications.

And voters in a range of states expressed skepticism about paying more in taxes, even as state and local governments face serious cash crunches induced by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

In California, voters narrowly defeated the legislature’s efforts to weaken Proposition 13, an amendment to the state’s constitution passed by ballot initiative in 1978, that limited how rapidly property taxes could rise, tying those increases to inflation and limiting them to a maximum of 2 percent a year.

Voters, even in blue states, continued to express support for flat or single rate taxes. Illinois voted by a nine percentage-point margin against moving from its present constitutionally mandated “flat tax” of 4.95 percent to a “graduated” or “progressive” tax system that would have allowed the legislature to divide Illinois citizens into income brackets and tax them at different rates. In Colorado, progressives planned an initiative to replace the state’s flat tax with different rates for different brackets. They were not able to get enough signatures to put that measure before voters. Instead, a counter-initiative to reduce the Colorado flat income tax from 4.63 percent to 4.55 percent passed by a margin of 57.7 percent to 42.7 percent.

These results were a further reminder that it’s hard to move away from a flat-tax system. Even Massachusetts has five times voted down moving to a graduated income tax. Taxpayers value being treated equally. They also know that a politician promising to tax the rich has not finished the sentence. They will tax the rich first, and then everyone else. They may also believe in their own upward mobility and fear progressive taxation schemes will eventually put them in the crosshairs.

Colorado voters went further and strengthened their TABOR, Taxpayer Bill of Rights, which requires a vote of the people for any tax hike. Now many fee hikes will also require a vote of the people, a crucial distinction to make because some enterprising politicians had made a habit of renaming their favorite taxes as “fees.”

Two significant tax hikes demonstrate just how slippery the language around taxation can be. Arkansas Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson led a successful campaign to make a temporary sales-tax hike from 6 percent to 6.5 permanent. How? The governor argued it wasn’t really a tax hike. Arizona amended the state constitution to increase its already-progressive income-tax top rate from 4.5 percent to 8 percent by a vote of 51.8 percent to 48.2 percent. How? Advocates claimed it would only hit the rich, when it largely hits small businesses.

Two other California votes are worth watching, if only as a preview of debates to come — and as proof that loyalty to a party on a national level can disguise more nuanced political perspectives. Though deep-blue California voted overwhelmingly for President-elect Joe Biden, those same voters pulled the lever to maintain the state’s ban on the use of racial preferences in California state and local government contracting, employment and education.

And in a hard-fought, expensive battle, Californians voted to allow ride-hailing drivers to continue working as independent contractors. This statewide rebuke of these limits on independent contractors may serve as a powerful signal to Congress that independent contractors have political support.

Voters didn’t back radical change this year, either in the candidates they selected, or the ballot initiatives they considered. But politicians looking for guidance might do well to listen to voters who want to control the substances they use, the money they earn and the ways they earn it. That’s the real mandate Americans voted for.",2,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/11/11/real-mandate-americans-voted-is-be-left-alone/
196,Norquist,Grover,wsj,"Taxation was on the ballot last week, and not only in the presidential race. Voters in California and Illinois rejected ballot measures that would have raised their taxes, while those in Arkansas and Arizona approved tax hikes. Coloradans voted for a tax cut.

In fiscally strapped Illinois, one of nine states with a flat income tax, Gov. J.B. Pritzker led a campaign for a constitutional amendment to allow a graduated or progressive tax. Mr. Pritzker promised it would hit only the rich and threatened voters with budget cuts and other broad-based tax increases. Illinoisans called his bluff, voting 55% to 45% against the tax hike.

In Colorado, all the left’s spending interests and structures tried and failed to get enough signatures for a constitutional ballot measure to allow a progressive income tax. But a countervailing effort led by Jon Caldara of the Independence Institute did get enough signatures. This was a simple reduction in the state income tax, from 4.63% to 4.55%. It passed, 57% to 43%.

Colorado voters also passed Proposition 117 to close a loophole in the state’s Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights. That 1992 amendment to the state constitution, known as Tabor, limits the growth of government by tying it to inflation and population growth and requires the people to vote on any state or local tax increase. Over time, clever politicians found the courts would let them relabel tax hikes as “fees” not requiring voter approval. Coloradans voted 52.3% to 47.7% to close this loophole. Taxes by any other name will require a vote of the people.

California produced the original tax revolts of the 1970s and ’80s, and this year faint echoes could be heard of a time when ordinary Californians weren’t so complacent about Sacramento’s insatiable appetite for revenue. Golden State voters opted to protect Proposition 13, the 1978 amendment to the California constitution that limits annual increases on property-tax rates. Rates on residential and commercial property are capped at 1% of assessed value, and assessments can increase by no more than 2% annually. Democratic lawmakers, who hold supermajorities in both houses of the state Legislature, sought to raise $12 billion by abolishing those protections for commercial properties while maintaining them on residences. Homeowners realized that this was merely Act I of a two-act play and their protection against ever higher property taxes would be up next. California rejected this tax hike, 52% to 48%.",2,https://www.wsj.com/articles/voters-mostly-reject-tax-hikes-11604867685
197,Norquist,Grover,realclearhealth,"Throughout the 2020 campaign, voters have looked for candidates who will strengthen financial security for the American people and deliver health care choice and access to families.

While there are many proposals that could help achieve these goals, one simple way to do so is by expanding Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) so that Americans can pay for their health care tax-free during the duration of the pandemic.

Newly released polling data conducted by McLaughlin and Associates found that voters support this policy by a margin of four to one with 67 percent of respondents supporting the policy and just 15 percent opposing it. Importantly, support for HSA expansion is bipartisan – the policy is supported by over 65 percent of independents, 70 percent of Democrats and nearly 65 percent of Republicans.

This proposal can be enacted by passing S.3546/H.R. 6338, the Pandemic Health care Access Act, a one-page bill introduced by Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Congressman Ted Budd (R-N.C.).

Today, 30 million American families and individuals use HSAs to pay for common health care expenses, including doctor’s visits, prescription drugs, and hospital care. However, hundreds of millions of Americans do not have access to an HSA because of the government requirement that says Americans only qualify for an HSA if they have a high deductible health plan (HDHP).

The Pandemic Health care Access Act suspends this requirement for as long as the coronavirus emergency declaration is in effect.

While the Cruz-Budd proposal is simple, it will have significant benefits for the American people.

The legislation will increase access to health care by making HSAs available to self-employed Americans including the millions of gig-economy workers, every American that receives health care through their employer, Americans on Medicare and Medicaid, and those that receive care through the VA, Indian health plans, and ObamaCare.

It will help individuals pay for their deductible or any increased health care costs, for direct primary care, and for telemedicine.

In addition, because HSA funds are owned and managed by the individual, this reform will encourage efficient health care spending. Research has shown that families and individuals with an HSA tend to spend less on health care and use fewer medical services without forgoing necessary primary and preventative care.

Not only will HSA expansion help Americans pay for their health care, it will also cut taxes for families by allowing them to save, invest, and spend health care dollars tax-free.

Any money contributed to any HSA is tax-deductible, any money invested in an HSA can grow tax-free, and any money spent on qualified health care expenses from an HSA is tax-free.

These tax benefits mean HSAs help Americans saving for retirement and long-term health care costs in the same way that 401(k)s are used by roughly 100 million Americans to build a nest egg.

While policymakers will rightly scrutinize the revenue or spending cost of any policy proposal, HSA expansion should be weighed against the cost of health care expansion proposals pushed by the left, all of which would result in billons or trillions of dollars in new spending.

For instance, Democrat presidential nominee Joe Biden’s proposal to lower the Medicare eligibility age to 60 and impose a “public option” would increase spending by anywhere from $1.8 trillion to $2.2 trillion.

The “Medicare for All” plan pushed by socialists like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) would cost $32 trillion and lead to trillions in middle-class tax increases.

It is also important to note that HSA expansion is a tax cut – not a spending increase. In other words, HSA reform means the government is taking less money from people.

In addition, HSA expansion can be scaled up or down. A proposal could permanently expand HSAs for everyone, or simply expand it to those on Medicare or the self-employed.

As we near the end of the 2020 election cycle, American families are looking for solutions that will improve their financial security and strengthen health care choice and access.

Expanding HSAs so that Americans can pay for their health care tax free through the pandemic is one way that policymakers can achieve these goals. Not only will this cut taxes and improve health care for Americans, but there is strong bipartisan support for this policy, as new polling data confirms.

Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have been working hard to make voters forget the full agenda they have repeatedly touted in appearances, debates, and online. An agenda that we now know would cost Americans $36 trillion over 10 years, according to the new Battleground States 2020 study by the James Madison Institute.

Biden and Harris are pretending they don’t support banning fracking. They have vowed 22 times to “eliminate” the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, while pretending they would not raise taxes on middle income households.

The reason for all this cognitive dissonance? Joe Biden needs the votes of Americans who live in battleground states. He’s spending big on ads in key states and touring the rust belt. But to get those votes, he must paper over his own agenda, which would take a big chunk out of the wallets of the very voters he’s courting.

At the top of the agenda is a $4 trillion tax hike. The former vice president wants to repeal the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, cut the child tax credit in half, get rid of the small business deduction, double the corporate income tax to over 40 percent, and add a 15 percent minimum tax on businesses.

For middle class voters, this should be especially alarming as taxpayers earning between $50,000 and $100,000 annually saw a greater average tax cut than those earning over $1 million.

In Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan, those earning $50,000 to $75,000 received an average tax cut of over 13 percent.

Biden wants to take those savings away. He vowed to “eliminate” the Trump tax cuts on “day one” and said he would raise the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 28 percent, higher than China’s 25 percent. This will mean “a smaller capital stock, lower labor productivity, lower wages, and lower total output for businesses and reduced ownership of capital assets and reduced savings for individuals,” says the James Madison Institute report.

While the burden of $4 trillion in tax increases is bad enough, Biden’s plans to hammer taxpayers don’t stop there.

He has signaled support for Medicare for All, which drives a health care agenda that would cost $32.6 trillion; that would be a lower, but still substantial $2.15 trillion if Biden only pursued expanding Medicare and Obamacare. Biden’s education proposals add up to $1.25 trillion. Green New Deal-style policies drive a climate agenda that would cost $2.0 trillion, JMI researchers also hit Biden’s green agenda for killing jobs, “a solution to carbon emissions that causes a depression is not only unnecessary, it’s reckless.”

The impact of these Biden proposals and some others, combined with the tax hikes, would cost each Ohioan $12,300, each Pennsylvanian $10,605, each Michigander $8,142, each Wisconsinite $9,020, and each Floridian $9,389 annually. That rises to four times as much for a family of four.

The economy and job growth would suffer. During a Biden administration, Ohio would add 79,000 fewer jobs than projected under a Trump second term. Florida would add 144,000 fewer jobs, Michigan 73,000 fewer, Pennsylvania 82,000 fewer, and Wisconsin 40,000 fewer.

Voters who might have switched to a new job, or who have a family member getting ready to join the workforce, might find those potential jobs don’t exist during a Biden presidency.

This is especially potent in Pennsylvania, where natural gas extraction has sparked a job boom as the state climbed to the second largest producer in the nation. Yet, both Biden and Harris have vowed to ban fracking, destroying these jobs.

On wages, the difference between Trump and Biden is “a direct differential impact of $69 billion of household income” JMI researchers note.

It’s no wonder Harris and Biden keep trying to distance themselves from their own positions down the home stretch. Joe Biden’s plans will mean tens of thousands of missing jobs, thousands of dollars in new government burdens for families, and even lost revenue for state governments. That is an offer battleground state voters can refuse.

199,Norquist,Grover,nationalinterest,"Democrats may be aiming at “the one percent” but the collateral damage of shooting at Jeff Bezos is measured in hundreds of millions of people.

If former Vice President Joe Biden wins the presidential election and Democrats hold the House and win the Senate, then the economic policies of the United States for the past four years will change dramatically.

What does that mean?

The short list: if you are a taxpayer, then your taxes will go up. If you are one of the tens of millions of independent contractors, then your chosen work structure will be illegal. Uber and Lyft are gone. If you are a worker in one of the twenty-seven Right to Work states, then you will find that you can now be forced to join a union as a condition of employment. And if you are an employer opposing unionization you will find your statements may have “go to jail” criminal penalties. And if you are one of one hundred million Americans with a 401K or IRA your life savings will decline. And everything you buy will be more expensive as the energy/gas/carbon taxes will increase the cost of all transportation and production. And if you are in the health insurance, oil, natural gas, or coal industries you may soon be out of a job.

Your taxes will go up: a lot.

Biden promises to increase total federal spend by $11 trillion over the next decade. And to increase taxes by $4 trillion. The deficit will go up $7 trillion by his higher spending and your taxes will increase $4 trillion. This is what he is willing to admit. California Sen. Kamala Harris has endorsed the Green New Deal with a price tag of $89 trillion in more spending over the next decade. Biden’s accord with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders endorses—in deliberately vague wording—much if not all of that Green New Deal and its costs. How much of a surrender was it? Sanders pronounced himself very pleased. That much.

What Taxes has Biden specifically said he would raise?

Both Biden and Kamala Harris have repeatedly stated that they will repeal the entire Trump tax cut of $1.5 trillion over a decade.

Repealing the Trump tax cut would jump the U.S. federal corporate income tax from its present rate of 21 percent all the way up to 35 percent. During the Obama/Biden years, the United States had the highest corporate income tax in the world. China takes 25 percent of corporate earnings. The UK 19 percent, Canada 15 percent, Ireland 12.5 percent.

A corporate rate higher than China’s corporate rate would tell investors that the tax issue alone (never mind lower wages and minimal environmental regulations) would argue for new investment to flow into China and away from the United States.

Biden’s staff have sometimes said that their real goal is a 28 percent rate, not the 35 percent Biden and Harris had repeatedly demanded in televised speeches. Still higher than China, the UK, Canada, etc.

Biden would also restore the Obama/Biden tax system of a worldwide corporate income tax. The rest of the world imposes taxes only on corporate income earned within their borders. The United States imposes taxes on American business earnings in France and then taxes the earnings again if they are returned to the United States. The Trump tax cut allows foreign earnings to return to the U.S. tax-free. That means the United States no longer punishes companies from repatriating earnings. They are now less likely to take those foreign earnings and build factories abroad.

Between 2004 and 2017, too many companies—representing $510 billion in assets—moved out of America or were bought by overseas firms. The tax issue alone made Burger King worth more as a Canadian firm than as an American company. No less a wise investor than Warren Buffett managed that tax-driven “Benedict Arnold” corporate inversion.

If you do not own a corporation or multinational corporation, then how will this affect you?

About 100 million Americans invest their life savings in a 401K fund or Individual Retirement Account. They represent 53 percent of all American households. These people will see the value of their life savings drop.

When Trump was elected on Nov. 8, 2016, the stock market began an upward drive to increase by 56 percent by March 2020, just before the coronavirus. The life savings of most Americans young and old grew dramatically. They fell during the coronavirus shutdown, but never to a low as when Biden and Obama were in charge. Now the stock market has restored most of the losses as the underlying tax and regulatory structure are favorable.

As an individual taxpayer, your per child tax credit will be cut in half. The Obama tax credit was $1,000 allowed to twenty-two million families. The Trump tax cut doubled the credit to $2,000 and made it available to thirty-six million families.

And you will become acquainted with the cheerful Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) which now hits two hundred thousand but will swing back to the Obama target list of five million.

Your standard deduction will shrink from $12,000 for a married couple now to the lower $6,000 tax deduction under Obama.

The death tax will start to bite at $5.5 million down from today’s $11 million. And the step-up in basis in capital gains will be repealed, imposing a significant cost and paperwork burden.

Biden has also said that “every single solitary person” will pay capital gains taxes at ordinary income tax rates. The rate will be doubled to 39.6 percent, which is the highest since Carter in 1977. Plus the 3.8 percent Obamacare NIIT tax—so the federal cap gains tax bite will be 43.4 percent. Add the burden of state capital gains taxes which directly stack on top and many Americans will pay over 50 percent on capital gains tax. Californians will pay 56.7 percent.

And if you are one of the five million Americans hit with the ($695-$2,085) Obamacare tax penalty (75 percent of whom earned less than $50,000) Biden has promised to re-impose that tax.

If you are the median income earner with a family of four, then your personal income taxes will go up $2,000. Every year. A median income single parent with one child will see their taxes increase $1,300 per year.

Your work will change.

Labor law changes are to be found in the PRO Act already passed by the Democrat House and endorsed without reservation or qualification by Biden and Harris.

It eliminates the right to be an independent contractor . . . like screenwriters in Los Angeles that work for many studios or musicians who play for many bands. Or Uber or Lyft drivers. The unions find it hard to unionize independent contractors who they demanded any Democrat who wanted union support to sweat to vote for/sign the PRO Act. There is not a Democrat that will win on election day who did not make that bargain and sold their vote already for the PRO Act that includes all the anti-independent contractor bans found in AB5—the legislation already passed in California at the state level.

The cost of all goods and services will change:

The deregulation enacted by the Republican party will be undone. This will reduce the hundreds of billions in savings consumers have only begun to appreciate. The cost of your next car will increase, your energy costs, your food purchases will all become more expensive.

This is simply a list of promises or threats (depending on how you look at it) that Biden and Harris have made publicly. Just as we “do not deserve” to know if they would pack the Supreme Court there are spending plans and tax plans that have not been transparent to voters.

But the one hundred million Americans with an IRA or 401K should keep in mind that there is not one single proposal by Democrat lawmakers or presidential candidates that would increase the value of your life savings. All their promises to the unions, trial lawyers, government employees and their unfunded pensions will reduce the value of the corporate stock inside your life savings.

They may be aiming at “the one percent” but the collateral damage of shooting at Jeff Bezos is measured in hundreds of millions of people.

200,Norquist,Grover,huffpost,"The charter for the Ex-Im bank expires on September 30 of this year. Congress must decide whether to continue the bank or not. Here are a few reasons why the Bank must go:

1. Cost: Accounting gimmicks and lofty assumptions hide the real costs the Export-Import Bank poses to taxpayers. While the Bank's authorization dropped to just under $30 billion last year, the amount of risk assessed for the Bank's activities has steadily grown. According to Veronique de Rugy at the Mercatus Center, the risk to which taxpayers are exposed amounted to $114 billion last year. What's more, the Congressional Budget Office tells us that if the Bank's activities were gauged using realistic projections, it would end up costing taxpayers $2 billion over the next ten years.

2. Our government likes to gamble: So long as taxpayers are on the hook for the costs, proponents of the Bank argue it fills a critical role by supplying financing that the private market has deemed too unsafe to undertake. Unbelievably, the Bank's charter actually directs it to take on risky projects in untested sectors, such as dubious green energy ventures. These narrowly tailored directives illustrate that Ex-Im serves to bankroll political agendas, not fill a vacuum in the free market.

3. Racing to the bottom on bad economic policy: That foreign governments leverage their citizens' tax dollars to manipulate export markets does not make it sound economic policy for the United States to do the same. Academics and government scorekeepers such as the Government Accountability Office and Congressional Research Service have stated that export subsidies may promote activity in the privileged sectors that receive support, but do little to increase overall production in the economy.

4. All together, Ex-Im is NBD: In total, the Bank plays a role in approximately 2 percent of all American exports. This belies the argument that the bank itself represents a critical component for maintaining U.S. competitiveness in export markets.

5. Hitting American workers when they're down: By enticing buyers with sweet financing deals, the bank lowers the cost of capital for foreign firms, allowing them a competitive advantage in the global economy. Laboring under the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world, businesses in the United States already face extraordinary barriers to creating and expanding job opportunities. American workers will face fewer opportunities as long as their tax dollars are used to slant the deck in favor of foreign multinationals.

6. It is a myth that the bank helps small businesses compete against the titans of industry. The miniscule role the Bank plays measured against the entire universe of U.S. exports shows the benefits of the bank are isolated. Data from the Mercatus Center shows that a whopping 76 percent of the Bank's activities directly benefit fewer than ten well-known corporations. In fact, a CRS analysis in 2011 showed that 60 percent of the Bank's funding went to one firm. Meanwhile, research shows that Ex-Im financing goes to less than .04 percent of small businesses.

7. Rife with corruption: the business of doling out taxpayer-funded sweeteners is a lucrative one. This summer, several Ex-Im employees were removed for allegedly accepting kickbacks or working to influence contracts for well-connected companies. The concentration of the Bank's activities in certain industries and amongst specific beneficiaries is suspect. Perhaps worse, there exists no consistent and transparent accounting of how contracts are awarded. Institutions that exist to promote the collusion between Big Government and Big Business are always a bad deal for taxpayers.",2,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/seven-reasons-to-abolish-exim-bank_b_5792502

204,Norquist,Grover,claremontreviewofbooks,"It is time to repeal the 16th Amendment, the constitutional provision that authorizes the federal income tax. As its critics predicted when the amendment was passed in 1913, the income tax has become “a terror and torment to the honest citizen.” It is absurdly complicated, inefficient and intrusive. Overzealous bureaucrats and politicians frequently abuse it.

The income tax has another major fault: It undermines the Constitution’s arrangements for limiting government. The Internal Revenue Service simply has no proper place in our constitutional system.

The Founders who designed our Constitution sought to balance the power of the federal government against the states in order to keep both in check. The national government was thus originally prohibited from collecting taxes from individuals. Article I, Section 9 of the Constitution states: “No capitation, or other direct Tax, shall be laid unless in Proportion to the Census or Enumeration.” This meant that the federal government could collect revenue from the states according to population, but had to leave the methods of collection to them. The federal government was to collect revenue in other, less intrusive ways (tariffs, excise taxes, consumption taxes) so as to limit the amount of money it could raise by its own authority.

For many of the Founders, the very idea of taxing individuals (as opposed to objects, as with a sales tax) was highly offensive. These “capitations” or “head taxes” were regarded as options of last resort, only to be imposed in war or other emergency. The first federal income tax was imposed during the Civil War; it was soon repealed. Not until the 1890s did Congress assess a peacetime income tax. The Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional in 1895. Referring to the explicit prohibition against direct taxation in Article I, the court argued that the income tax would excessively enhance federal power in relation to state power.

The court explained that the rule against direct federal taxation was intended to “promote prudence and economy in expenditure,” and, quoting Alexander Hamilton, to ensure that “the abuse of this power of taxation [would be] provided against with guarded circumspection.”

The Supreme Court’s ruling was nullified when an overwhelming majority in Congress and three-fourths of the state legislatures ratified the 16th Amendment. The votes came amid a frenzy of “soak the rich” rhetoric, which overwhelmed considerations of broader constitutional interests. But experience has taught us that the rich are hard to tax, because it is easy for them to put their money where it does not yield much income. Anyway, most of the money in America belongs to the middle class. Lacking access to sophisticated shelters, we are easy to tax.

Although the first income tax in 1913 was very limited–it applied to just 2% of the labor force, and its highest rate was 7%–it prepared the way for the federal government’s almost unlimited access to revenue. It thus provided an almost unlimited ability to fund programs that are properly state matters–crime fighting, education, welfare–and to pressure the states into conforming to a national standard in matters that should reflect regional differentiation, like speed limits and drinking ages.

The new welfare block grants to states are certainly a step in the right direction of getting the federal government out of the business of making everything its business. But wouldn’t it be better just to keep all that money in the states in the first place? The federal government collected more than $600 billion in personal incomes taxes in 1996–about half its total revenue-but it spent more than that on welfare, health, education, transportation and housing programs. All these matters properly should be left to the states.

Repealing the income tax would still leave many areas in which the federal government could collect revenue for its proper functions, like defense, while limiting its ability to overreach.",2,https://claremontreviewofbooks.com/digital/repeal-the-16th-amendment/
205,Norquist,Grover,conservativedailynews,"Federal spending is growing. The national debt is growing.

In 2000, federal spending was $1.79 trillion. In 2010, it rose to $3.46 trillion. This year it will go higher than $4.8 trillion. The federal debt in the same 20 years grew from $5.6 trillion in 2000 to $26 trillion this year. If changes are not made, both spending and debt will climb further.

In 2000 and again in 2016, we elected a Republican Congress and a Republican president. Republicans are supposed to fight to limit government spending and borrowing. But do they? It is true that when the Democrats won control of both Congress and the presidency in 1992 with Clinton and again in 2008 with Obama, spending did surge. And, yes, when Republicans retook the Congress, they were able to slow the Democrat spending plans.

Still, to date, Republican control of Congress and the White House has not been enough to turn the tide. Why? What must, what can, be done to reduce federal spending, borrowing and debt?

Here are six steps we can take to restore fiscal sanity to our country.

Focus on the right metric

The true cost of government is total spending plus the imposed cost of regulations as a percentage of the total economy. (A properly run U.S. government will still be larger than the Canadian government.) Spending is the number to be wrestled to the ground.

“The deficit” is the unimportant number that is the difference between two very important numbers: how much the government spends and how much it takes in taxes. Democrats are always willing to “fight the deficit” by raising taxes. That does not rein in spending—it feeds it.

Keep your eye on the goal: Government spending should decline as a percentage of the economy.

Reform entitlement spending. Block grant welfare spending to the states

Our government is not too large because of defense spending. Pentagon spending cost taxpayers approximately $730 billion last year or 3.4% of GDP. And that is down from 10% in 1955 and 6% in 1986. (And yes, more can and should be done.)

Nor is the challenge federal spending on roads and bridges, NASA, education grants or other spending voted on each year. (And yes, that can and should be reduced.)

The key factor driving overspending is the collection of “entitlement” programs whose cost is mandated by law and grows each year without a vote by Congress or signature of the president.

Former House Speaker Paul Ryan proposed sending each state a block grant for the cost of all “means tested programs” or welfare programs such as food stamps, Medicare and traditional welfare. We have an example to follow: Then-President Bill Clinton signed a Republican-passed welfare reform in 1996 that block granted spending on Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and limited its growth. States could try 50 different approaches to targeting welfare to those who really need it and requiring that able bodied people work.

Block granting all welfare programs and limiting their growth to the wage increases of taxpayers would save trillions over the next 75 years. Block granting Medicaid alone would save $700 billion over a decade.

End unfunded liabilities by making all government pensions “defined contribution” like an IRA or 401(k).

Too many government pensions are Ponzi schemes. They promise today — to pay tomorrow — large pensions to employees who will retire years after generous politicians have retired or passed away. Today, state and local government have overpromised by $5.2 trillion.

Most Americans working in the real economy have a defined contribution pension such as an IRA or 401(k) where you put away money for retirement and it is under your control and you know exactly how much there is. Newer federal employees now have such pensions. The military is moving over to defined contribution and states such as Utah have moved all new hires over to the fully funded worker-controlled IRA-like pension plans. Over time, this will end unfunded liabilities and the debt and taxes they create.

The final three actions to limit government spending are changes in the structure and culture of Congress.

Term Limit Appropriators

The painful joke in politics is that while there are two political parties in America, there are actually three political parties in Washington DC: Republicans, Democrats, and Appropriators – the members of the 24 House and Senate Appropriations (or spending) subcommittees.

To keep good Republicans from “breaking bad” their time on a spending committee should be limited to six years. We do that now for committee chairs and it has changed congress for the better.

Keep and strengthen the earmark ban

Earmarks are the currency of corruption in Washington and state capitals.

Congressmen are given “earmarks” — targeted spending for special interests in their districts — in return for voting for massive spending bills. This once “legal” bribery is now banned. Not surprisingly, some appropriators want to end the ban.

Bring back the “anti-appropriations committee” to combat the appropriations committees

Lastly, we can recreate a successful model of how America once kept spending (somewhat) in check.

To help reduce federal spending so the nation could focus on winning World War II, then-Virginia Sen. Harry F. Byrd demanded the creation of the “Joint Committee on Reduction of Nonessential Federal Expenditures.” He chaired the committee from 1941 to 1965.

The committee had 14 members: three from each of the House and Senate Appropriations committees, three from the House Ways and Means Committee, and three from the Senate Finance Committee. There were eight Democrats and four Republicans, as the Democrats held the majority in Congress. The Treasury secretary and the director of the bureau of the budget also served on it. The committee could recommend budget cuts and the Congress would vote on them.

The Work Projects Administration (WPA), the National Youth Administration and the Civilian Conservation Corps were downsized and then abolished. If these programs had not ended in the 1940s they would today be multi-billion dollar, immortal and unchallengeable “entitlements.”

From 1941-1945, the committee made recommendations that resulted in real savings of $2.5 billion or almost $31 billion in today’s dollars. (The committee’s work cost only $45 million. Nice ratio.)

Young, ambitious congressmen and women today gravitate to the spending committees as the way to “make friends and influence people” (and raise campaign funds). An anti-appropriations committee would offer another path to fame, fortune and higher office: recommending ways to reform government to cost less. Year after year.

We can stop the march to bankruptcy and over-taxation. We have to. We will.

The good news is that we have small successes in the past that we can build on. We can wait and implement such reforms after the crash. Or we can act now to avert a looming national disaster.

206,Norquist,Grover,dailycaller,"Federal spending is growing. The national debt is growing.

In 2000, federal spending was $1.79 trillion. In 2010, it rose to $3.46 trillion. This year it will go higher than $4.8 trillion. The federal debt in the same 20 years grew from $5.6 trillion in 2000 to $26 trillion this year. If changes are not made, both spending and debt will climb further.

In 2000 and again in 2016, we elected a Republican Congress and a Republican president. Republicans are supposed to fight to limit government spending and borrowing. But do they? It is true that when the Democrats won control of both Congress and the presidency in 1992 with Clinton and again in 2008 with Obama, spending did surge. And, yes, when Republicans retook the Congress, they were able to slow the Democrat spending plans.

Still, to date, Republican control of Congress and the White House has not been enough to turn the tide. Why? What must, what can, be done to reduce federal spending, borrowing and debt?

Here are six steps we can take to restore fiscal sanity to our country.

Focus on the right metric

The true cost of government is total spending plus the imposed cost of regulations as a percentage of the total economy. (A properly run U.S. government will still be larger than the Canadian government.) Spending is the number to be wrestled to the ground.

“The deficit” is the unimportant number that is the difference between two very important numbers: how much the government spends and how much it takes in taxes. Democrats are always willing to “fight the deficit” by raising taxes. That does not rein in spending—it feeds it. (RELATED: Federal Deficits Don’t Matter, But Federal Spending Certainly Does)

Keep your eye on the goal: Government spending should decline as a percentage of the economy.

Reform entitlement spending. Block grant welfare spending to the states

Our government is not too large because of defense spending. Pentagon spending cost taxpayers approximately $730 billion last year or 3.4% of GDP. And that is down from 10% in 1955 and 6% in 1986. (And yes, more can and should be done.)

Nor is the challenge federal spending on roads and bridges, NASA, education grants or other spending voted on each year. (And yes, that can and should be reduced.)

The key factor driving overspending is the collection of “entitlement” programs whose cost is mandated by law and grows each year without a vote by Congress or signature of the president.

Former House Speaker Paul Ryan proposed sending each state a block grant for the cost of all “means tested programs” or welfare programs such as food stamps, Medicaid, and traditional welfare. We have an example to follow: Then-President Bill Clinton signed a Republican-passed welfare reform in 1996 that block granted spending on Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and limited its growth. States could try 50 different approaches to targeting welfare to those who really need it and requiring that able bodied people work.

Block granting all welfare programs and limiting their growth to the wage increases of taxpayers would save trillions over the next 75 years. Block granting Medicaid alone would save $700 billion over a decade. (RELATED: Ignoring the National Debt Means Massively Burdening Future Generations)

End unfunded liabilities by making all government pensions “defined contribution” like an IRA or 401(k)

Too many government pensions are Ponzi schemes. They promise today — to pay tomorrow — large pensions to employees who will retire years after generous politicians have retired or passed away. Today, state and local government have overpromised by $5.2 trillion.

Most Americans working in the real economy have a defined contribution pension such as an IRA or 401(k) where you put away money for retirement and it is under your control and you know exactly how much there is. Newer federal employees now have such pensions. The military is moving over to defined contribution and states such as Utah have moved all new hires over to the fully funded worker-controlled IRA-like pension plans. Over time, this will end unfunded liabilities and the debt and taxes they create.

The final three actions to limit government spending are changes in the structure and culture of Congress.

Term Limit Appropriators

The painful joke in politics is that while there are two political parties in America, there are actually three political parties in Washington DC: Republicans, Democrats, and Appropriators – the members of the 24 House and Senate Appropriations (or spending) subcommittees.

To keep good Republicans from “breaking bad” their time on a spending committee should be limited to six years. We do that now for committee chairs and it has changed congress for the better.

Keep and strengthen the earmark ban

Earmarks are the currency of corruption in Washington and state capitals.

Congressmen are given “earmarks” — targeted spending for special interests in their districts — in return for voting for massive spending bills. This once “legal” bribery is now banned. Not surprisingly, some appropriators want to end the ban.

Bring back the “anti-appropriations committee” to combat the appropriations committees

Lastly, we can recreate a successful model of how America once kept spending (somewhat) in check.

To help reduce federal spending so the nation could focus on winning World War II, then-Virginia Sen. Harry F. Byrd demanded the creation of the “Joint Committee on Reduction of Nonessential Federal Expenditures.” He chaired the committee from 1941 to 1965.

The committee had 14 members: three from each of the House and Senate Appropriations committees, three from the House Ways and Means Committee, and three from the Senate Finance Committee. There were eight Democrats and four Republicans, as the Democrats held the majority in Congress. The Treasury secretary and the director of the bureau of the budget also served on it. The committee could recommend budget cuts and the Congress would vote on them.

The Work Projects Administration (WPA), the National Youth Administration and the Civilian Conservation Corps were downsized and then abolished. If these programs had not ended in the 1940s they would today be multi-billion dollar, immortal and unchallengeable “entitlements.”

From 1941-1945, the committee made recommendations that resulted in real savings of $2.5 billion or almost $31 billion in today’s dollars. (The committee’s work cost only $45 million. Nice ratio.)

Young, ambitious congressmen and women today gravitate to the spending committees as the way to “make friends and influence people” (and raise campaign funds). An anti-appropriations committee would offer another path to fame, fortune and higher office: recommending ways to reform government to cost less. Year after year.

The good news is that we have small successes in the past that we can build on. We can wait and implement such reforms after the crash. Or we can act now to avert a looming national disaster.

On Election Day, Americans will cast their vote for President of the United States. While easily the most high-profile thing on the ballot, this is not the only important decision voters will be making. State politicians -- rather than reform government to cost less -- are angling for higher taxes.

In Arkansas, for example, voters will be asked if they want to write a permanent sales tax increase into the state constitution. If “YES” wins the vote, the people of Arkansas will see their state sales taxes hiked by about 9%, taking roughly $300 million a year away from residents and shoveling it to the Arkansas Department of Transportation (ARDOT).

Back in 2012, special interests convinced voters to support a “temporary” 0.5 percentage point sales tax increase on the promise that it would be used for “roads and bridges.” Over the last several years, that ballot measure – now known as Amendment 91 in the state constitution – has given ARDOT about $2 billion in additional funding and, predictably, there is little to show for it.

Now, taxpayers are being asked to support another measure that would give even more of their hard-earned money to this unelected, unaccountable government agency. Issue 1, which will appear on the November 3rd ballot, would amend the state constitution to make the “temporary” sales tax hike – which took the state sales tax rate from 6% to 6.5% – permanent.

Proponents of the tax hike have been trying to downplay its magnitude by saying things like “it is only a half a percent” or “taxpayers are already paying it, so it is not really a tax increase.” Those claims are a terrible misrepresentation of the facts.

Under current law, the state sales tax rate is scheduled to drop from 6.5% back down to 6% “when there are no bonds outstanding to which tax collections are pledged as provided in this amendment.” This is expected to occur in 2023, meaning Arkansas taxpayers will very soon see a smaller sales tax bite on their purchases.

If Issue 1 is adopted, however, current law would change, and taxpayers would be stuck with the higher 6.5% rate. Permanently. This is, in fact, a tax hike, and not just a small one, as advocates of Issue 1 would like voters to think. Taking the rate from 6% to 6.5%, a 0.5 percentage point increase, is actually an 8.33% tax hike. That increase is much greater than “just half a percent.”

Before the 2012 “temporary” sales tax hike took effect (on July 1, 2013) Arkansans were already burdened with the 6th highest combined state and local sales tax rate in the country. A state sales tax rate of 6.5% means Arkansas will continue to fight with Louisiana and Tennessee (Tennessee is one of nine states that do not impose taxes on wage income) for the unwelcome distinction of highest combined state and local sales tax rate in the nation.

Arkansas taxpayers are already facing higher taxes at the pump thanks to Act 416, which recently imposed a wholesale sales tax on fuel. This past October, Arkansas’s excise tax on diesel increased by six cents to 28.5 cents per gallon and its excise tax on gas increased by three cents to 24.5 cents per gallon. It is likely that much of this “gas tax” money will be siphoned off to spending interests—not used to improve roads and bridges.

Politicians across the nation have a favorite trick: pass a “temporary” tax hike, then years later, when taxpayers are “used” to carrying this higher burden, announce it will be permanent. The politicians hope Arkansans have forgotten their lie that the tax hike would be “temporary.”

On Election Day, Arkansas taxpayers will have the opportunity to avoid the fate of Pennsylvanians, who are still stuck paying a “temporary” tax imposed after the Johnstown Flood of 1936.

They can say NO. NO more lying Arkansans into higher taxes.

209,Norquist,Grover,realclearhealth,"Now Is the Time to Fight the Government Takeover of Health Care, Not Surrender to It

The Trump administration will soon issue an executive order on drug pricing and it is expected that this will include proposals tying the prices we pay for drugs to the prices in foreign, socialist countries.

This proposal, known as a most favored nation (MFN) clause or an International Pricing Index (IPI), would slow medical innovation, threaten American jobs, and undermine conservative opposition to Medicare-for-All.

President Trump has repeatedly railed against government-takeover health care policies like the Medicare-for-All plan pushed by Democrats in Congress and on the campaign trail. As recently as his 2020 State of the Union Address, the President promised “We will never let socialism destroy American health care.”

Trump is right to oppose socialized health care– these policies would result in trillion dollar a year tax increases, would destroy medical progress, and would end health care plans used by 180 million Americans.

However, rather than fighting these socialist policies, an MFN or IPI would adopt them. This will have disastrous consequences to the economy and health care system and to the broader effort to fight against the government takeover of health care.

An IPI or MFN Clause Will Reduce Access to Cures

The U.S. is the best in the world when it comes to developing innovative, lifesaving and life preserving medicines. Because of this, the U.S. is leading the way when it comes to developing COVID-19 vaccines, with several promising candidates entering the final stages of medical development.

In contrast, foreign countries have been freeloading off this American medical innovation for decades through crushing price controls and other market distorting government rules and regulations.

Adopting foreign price controls will result in the same negative outcomes to our health care system as those overseas—less medical innovation leading to fewer cures and health care shortages for American patients.

This is not hypothetical—of the 290 new medical substances that were launched worldwide between 2011 and 2018, Americans had access to 90 percent. By contrast, citizens in the United Kingdom had access to only 60 percent of these medicines, Japan had 50 percent, and Canada had just 44 percent.

Studies have also shown that price controls used in Europe delay new drugs coming to market by an average of 14 months.

Imposing Price Controls Threatens the Economy

Adopting price controls through an IPI or MFN clause will also harm the U.S. economy because of a decline in American R&D.

Medical innovation is enormously beneficial to workers and to the economy. Manufacturers invest over $100 billion in the U.S. economy every year, directly supporting over 800,000 jobs.

When indirect jobs are included, this innovation supports 4 million jobs and $1.1 trillion in total economic impact. Pharmaceutical jobs are also high paying – the average compensation is over $126,000 – more than double the $60,000 average compensation in the U.S.

Adopting Foreign Price Controls Does Nothing to Stop the “Freeloader” Problem

In addition to harming the economy and the health care system, an IPI or MFN does nothing to address the real problem and hold foreign countries accountable for price controls.

Supporters of the international pricing index have claimed the concept is a free market proposal that will incentivize manufacturers to negotiate better deals. Really? This theory is based on the idiotic assumption that American manufacturers were not fighting as hard as they could against foreign price controls in past years.

The administration has recognized the fact that adopting foreign pricing would damage American innovation, as noted in a report released in February 2018 by the president’s Council of Economic Advisors:

“If the United States had adopted the centralized drug pricing policy in other developed nations twenty years ago, then the world may not have highly valuable treatments for diseases that required significant investment.”

Moving forward, we need policies that further encourage American innovation through tax and trade policies, like renegotiated trade deals and a competitive business tax system.

Imposing Drug Price Controls Paves the Way for Medicare-for-All

By adopting foreign drug price controls, an IPI or MFN would move us close to a government takeover of health care, which the left often calls “Medicare-for-All.” This would result in price controls on the entire health care system.

Price controls are anathema to conservatives because they utilize government power to forcefully lower costs in a way that distorts economically-efficient behavior and the natural incentives created by the free market.

In contrast, progressives embrace price controls as a way to expand government control over the free market.

If the left had their way, Medicare-for-All would be the law of the land, an outcome that would lead to significant middle-class tax increases at a time that the U.S. economy and American families and businesses across the country are struggling.

It would also lead to health care shortages, as has occurred in other nations that have socialized health care, like Canada and the United Kingdom. In the UK for instance, there was a shortage of 10,000 doctors and 43,000 nurses in 2019, with 9 in 10 managers in the National Health Service saying that too few doctors and nurses presented a danger to patients. At any one time, 4.5 million patients were waiting for hospitalization.

Imposing foreign price controls through an IPI or MFN clause is the wrong proposal for the administration to consider. It will harm the U.S. economy and the health care system, does nothing to hold foreign trading partners accountable, and paves the way for socialist Medicare-for-All.

210,Norquist,Grover,foxbusiness,"In the next coronavirus relief bill, Democrats want to spend more money while Republicans want to reopen and restore the economy with further tax reduction and liability protection so the trial lawyers do not sue the economy into the ground.

What else can Congress do? Amid the inevitable clamor for special interest spending there is one very good idea.

The Pandemic Healthcare Access Act (S.3546/H.R. 6338), introduced by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Congressman Ted Budd, R-N.C., addresses both the economy and our health.

This simple, one-page piece of legislation allows Americans to pay for their health care tax-free during the duration of the pandemic by expanding Health Savings Accounts (HSAs).

MNUCHIN SAYS LEADERS ARE 'STARTING WITH ANOTHER TRILLION DOLLARS' FOR NEXT CORONAVIRUS STIMULUS BILL

Currently, there is a government requirement that HSAs can only be offered to Americans that have a high deductible health plan (HDHP). The Pandemic Healthcare Access Act suspends this requirement for as long as the coronavirus emergency declaration is in effect.

This will increase access to health care by making HSAs available to hundreds of millions of Americans including those on Medicare and Medicaid, and those that receive care through the VA, Indian health plans, ObamaCare and any employer plan.

It will also help individuals pay for their deductible or any increased health care costs, allow HSA funds to pay for direct primary care, and allow telemedicine below the deductible.

TOP REPUBLICANS MEET WITH TRUMP TO NEGOTIATE NEXT CORONAVIRUS STIMULUS PACKAGE

It will also reduce taxes for millions of Americans.

An HSA allows Americans to save, invest, and spend health care dollars tax-free. Any money contributed to any HSA is tax-deductible, any money invested in an HSA can grow tax-free, and any money spent on qualified health care expenses from an HSA is tax-free.

This is a tax cut, not a spending increase. HSA reform means the government is taking less money from people.

Moreover, HSA expansion can be scaled up or down. A proposal could permanently expand HSAs for everyone, or simply expand it to those on Medicare.

In addition, the “cost” of expanding HSAs should be weighed against the cost of health care expansion proposals pushed by the left, all of which would result in billons or trillions of dollars in new spending.

SENATE GOP SEEKS COVID-19 LIABILITY PROTECTIONS FOR SCHOOLS, BUSINESSES

For instance, presumptive Democrat presidential nominee Joe Biden’s proposal to lower the Medicare eligibility age to 60 and impose a “public option” would cost American taxpayers at least $2.25 trillion.

The “Medicare for All” plan pushed by socialists like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez D-N.Y. and Bernie Sanders I-Vt. would cost $32 trillion and lead to trillions in middle-class tax increases.

Even the proposals being pushed by Congressional Democrats right now to expand Medicaid and ObamaCare would cost hundreds of billions of dollars.

HSAs are already a successful model of health care and can be a way for conservatives to contrast their policies with the policies of the left to expand the government’s role in health care.

HSAs were created over 15 years ago and are currently used by 30 million American families and individuals to pay for common healthcare expenses, including doctor’s visits, prescription drugs, and hospital care.

HSAs are controlled by the individual, not the government.

Because of this, HSAs lead to more efficient health care spending. In fact, research shows that families and individuals with an HSA spend less on health care and use fewer medical services without forgoing necessary primary and preventative care.

At least 30 conservative groups are backing the Cruz effort to expand HSAs.

We know Democrats will propose spending more money. Republicans should contrast this by pushing proposals to cut taxes and increase health care freedom by expanding HSAs by allowing Americans to pay for health care tax-free during the pandemic.

211,Norquist,Grover,spectator,"President Trump and the Republicans in Congress are now working to breathe life back into the economy for the second time in four years.

Their first effort was a smashing success. The week after Trump defeated Hillary Clinton, the Dow jumped 950 points — 5 percent — reflecting people’s belief that a Republican House, Senate, and White House could begin to dismantle many of the regulations that, had Hillary been elected, would have gone into effect and further slowed the recovery. And the market reacted well to Trump’s plan to bring the corporate income tax rate of 35 percent — the highest in the developed world, higher than communist China’s 25 percent — down to 15 percent.

In the final tax reform/reduction legislation, the corporate rate was permanently dropped to 21 percent, and business investment was immediately expensed for five years. The standard deduction for a couple was doubled from $12,000 to $24,000, the child tax credit was doubled from $1,000 to $2,000, the Alternative Minimum Tax was mostly wiped out, and everyone received a reduced marginal tax rate. A median income family of four saw their burden reduced by $2,000 each year.

The economy surged.

The Congressional Review Act was employed sixteen times to tear out entire Obama regulations imposed in the final six months of his presidency. Other deregulation required the long march through the bureaucracy to undo the damage. The Department of Transportation reduced the cost of Obama’s plans to increase the mandated CAFE standards. This will save the American people $200 billion in total costs over the lifetimes of the vehicles and $100 billion in regulatory costs.",2,https://spectator.org/comeback-2-0-trump-economy-presidential-election-in-print-summer-2020/

213,Norquist,Grover,washingtonexaminer,"The pandemic hit the United States just as most people were preparing their 2019 tax returns for April 15. To make life a little less complicated, the Treasury Department postponed Tax Day from April 15 to July 15.

Now, the July 15 deadline that once seemed so far off is closing in. What should be done now? Should the due date for filing taxes be delayed again? Might those taxpayers who owe money be given a few more months to pay?

Delaying the date for paying owed taxes into 2021 would make it easier for hard-hit workers to make it through 2020. File your tax returns on July 15 and receive your refund for any overpayment made in 2019 — or if you have underpaid for 2019 and owe the IRS money, then that payment should be able to be made in April 2020. No penalties. No interest.

That makes a great deal of sense.

But some have suggested, trying to be helpful, that the Treasury should delay the tax filing deadline to Oct. 15 or other dates. This would actually hurt many people, as they would delay receiving tax refunds that they are owed.

According to current IRS data, millions of taxpayers who have not yet filed are actually owed a refund. There is a lot of money being held by Uncle Sam that belongs to every day people — the number of refunds issued so far this year has dropped by 12% over last year, and the amount of refunds issued is down by $30 billion.

Many people could use their part of that $30 billion to pay bills.

In any given year, almost 3 in 4 people receive a tax refund averaging $3,000. Delay filing deadline and you delay that $3,000 to a family.

Many people have busy lives and wait until the last minute to file every year. Based on prior years, an estimated 35 million people (25% of all tax filers) wait until the last two weeks of tax season (April 1-15) to file. Of these 35 million taxpayers, more than half receive a refund averaging $2,000.

It is personally expensive, and yet many individuals procrastinate filing their taxes because they don’t like doing the paperwork, even if it means a delay in receiving their refund.

Any effort to further extend the tax filing deadline past July 15 would benefit the government, at the cost to individuals, by giving the IRS a de facto extension on the interest-free loan that it receives from many individuals when they overpay their taxes throughout the year.

Extending tax filing past the 2020 election would also conceal the benefits of the Trump tax cuts for millions of families. Thanks to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the typical family of four has seen a tax cut of more than $2,000, equating to a nearly 60% reduction in federal income taxes.

Joe Biden has vowed to repeal these tax cuts, raising taxes on 90% of the country.

Keeping the tax deadline now and ensuring it is before the 2020 election is an opportunity to highlight the lower taxes and contrast it with the higher taxes that families and individuals will pay under a Biden presidency.

People should be required to file by July 15, but there is no reason to demand they pay additional owed taxes right now. The Treasury should consider extending tax payment deadlines to offer liquidity to individuals and businesses.

In July, businesses and individuals will be required to make roughly $1 trillion in tax payments to the IRS. This starts with roughly $50 billion in excise tax payments due July 1 but will also include estimated tax payments for the first and second quarter of the year and income tax payments for individuals and small businesses.

This is a significant transfer of cash from the private sector to the federal government and will deprive taxpayers of much-needed liquidity as they look to recover from the economic damages of COVID-19.

This doesn’t need to be the case. As noted by a coalition of conservative groups that recently wrote to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury can step in and help taxpayers through this crisis by using its regulatory authority to defer tax payments through the end of the year. This will allow businesses to prioritize paying workers and meeting expenses over making tax payments and will help individuals and families make ends meet.

This is a modest step toward providing emergency liquidity, as these taxes will eventually be repaid.

The pandemic and the reaction to it by the various governors have damaged the financial well-being of businesses and workers across the country. The federal government has spent a great deal of money to reduce this damage. Moving forward, Mnuchin should build on this success not by tossing more tax dollars in the air but by delaying tax payment deadlines through the end of the year.

He should also ensure that the tax filing deadline is kept in place so that people are encouraged to file and receive the refunds that they are owed.

Your view

New Mexico is facing a budget deficit due to the combined forces of Gov. Lujan Grisham’s shut down of the New Mexico economy and reduced oil production. It is of the utmost importance that the Legislature not increase the economic pain by raising taxes.

Despite plummeting revenues, the Legislature still saw fit to increase spending this year. New Mexico is currently set to spend $7 billion, more than $1 billion more than it will take from taxpayers: $5.9 billion.

When the 2021 Legislative session convenes, significant budget challenges will remain even with the national economy regaining jobs (May saw an increase in employment of 2.5 million, the highest monthly gain in history.) The easy, traditional response to overspending is to blame the taxpayers for not sending in more cash. The Legislature will look at their own overspending and standing on their heads call it a “revenue shortfall.”

Under normal circumstances, tax increases of any kind result in economic harm. After months of “nonessential” businesses being forced to close and many people being out of work, tax increases would be devastating.

During these difficult times, families across New Mexico have had to tighten their belts. The Legislature should control its appetite. It should not say of taxpayers: “let them eat cake.” (Heavily taxed cake.)

This should not be too hard for them to do. If they are serious. Over the years, New Mexico’s spending has increased well beyond the rate of population and inflation. Government spending has increased faster than the paychecks of taxpayers. And that is before the current big-spending Gov. Lujan Grisham and her legislative allies came into office.

Based on data from the National Association of Budget Officers’ State Expenditure Report from 2011 and 2019, total state spending in New Mexico increased roughly 33.6% from 2010 to 2019. Over that same time period, New Mexico’s population increased just 1.8%, according to a report from the United States Census Bureau, and inflation increased 17.2%.

State government in New Mexico has grown a whopping 14.6% faster than population and inflation did over the last decade. There is absolutely no “need” to raise taxes. Particularly not after last year, when a $350 million tax hike — which some are calling the largest in state history — was heaped on top of a $1 billion surplus.

New Mexicans cannot afford higher taxes. A 2018 report from the Mercatus Center measured and ranked all 50 states based on various tax and budget data. On the issue of “service-level solvency” — how high taxes, revenues, and spending are when compared to state personal income — the Mercatus report found that New Mexico was the state least able to raise taxes without harming the economy. New Mexicans couldn’t afford higher taxes in 2018 when the economy was booming. They certainly can’t handle higher taxes now.

Americans oppose tax hikes as the nation struggles to recover economically from COVID-19. A recent Wallethub poll found that just 28% of Americans “think that tax rates should increase to fund coronavirus recovery efforts.” Overwhelmingly — a whopping 72% — people do not think taxes should rise. Even former Gov. Bill Richardson (D) has voiced his opposition to tax increases during this time:

“Don’t raise taxes of any kind. We need to attract new businesses and, if anything, get rid of the onerous double Social Security tax,"" he wrote in a column for the Albuquerque Journal.

Struggling businesses are doing everything they can to avoid cutting hours and laying off employees. Some have already had to move forward with these difficult decisions. Individual taxpayers and families are already seeing their paychecks dwindle.

The last thing the people of New Mexico need right now is to hand more of their paychecks over to the politicians.

E-cigarettes have exposed the fraud of public-health advocates.

For years, people claiming to be public-health advocates have pushed for higher tobacco taxes. They argued that if you were to increase taxes on tobacco, consumers would be forced to kick their unhealthy habits and quit smoking cigarettes. And if you continued to increase prices, you could continue to accomplish the same results over and over again. In fact, over the past 13 years, federal and state governments have increased cigarette “sin” taxes more than 120 times. Smokers who didn’t quit were forced to fork over more and more, providing sizeable amounts of revenue to growing governments.

But recently, public-health do-gooders have found a new target for tax increases: e-cigarettes and vapor products. This new fight has exposed the movement for what it always was: nothing more than an attempt to extract more money from consumers. This was clear when President Obama violated his “firm pledge” not to raise any form of taxes on people making under $250,000 per year just 16 days into his presidency by signing a 156 percent increase in the federal cigarette tax. The do-gooder movement was never about public health; it was always about money.

Since 1998, governments have collected more than $500 billion in cigarette taxes and payments from smokers. In 2013, Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) payments and taxes helped the government rake in nearly $44 billion. No such punitive tax regime exists for e-cigarettes. Each time a smoker picks up an e-cigarette in Michigan, the state loses $2, and the federal government loses $1.01 per pack; in Illinois, $1.98; and in New York, $4.35. It adds up quickly, and for big spenders in state capitols, that’s a problem.

This potential for significant revenue loss is driving some legislators mad. State governments are addicted to smoking. Their extreme reliance on tobacco revenue has made them the single biggest beneficiary of America’s smoking habit. Nearly all tobacco revenue that was supposed to be spent persuading people to quit smoking has been spent on anything but. It went to new transportation projects, teacher raises, public-employee pensions, and a long list of special interests. The same people who spent years demonizing smokers and cigarettes turned around and gleefully pushed for new programs and spending projects with the revenue they were able to extract from consumers.

Now many states are at a crossroads. They realize they can’t continue to raise cigarette taxes, because people increasingly purchase cigarettes across state lines, turn to the black market, or are quitting altogether. Budgets, though, rely on this significant revenue stream. Here the fraud that has always been the public-health push for cigarette taxes is exposed, in their quest to tax e-cigarettes out of existence.

In 2014 alone, more than 15 states considered applying the cigarette or Other Tobacco Products (OTP) tax to e-cigarettes and vapor products. In Washington, legislators considered imposing a 95 percent tax on the products. In Ohio, Governor Kasich proposed increasing taxes on e-cigarettes by 700 percent. Fortunately, efforts to protect the state’s monopoly on the tobacco market have mostly failed.

They have failed because e-cigarettes and vapor products are the Uber of the product industry. They’re a disruptive and innovative technology that has the support of hundreds of thousands of passionate consumers. Proponents of higher taxes on e-cigarettes have behaved like the taxi cartel in many cities where Uber has thrived. They’ve thrown fits, lobbed outrageous accusations, and demanded that competing products be regulated out of existence.

Before e-cigarettes, the choice to quit came down to the cold-turkey approach, gum, or a patch, which for many simply didn’t work. Before Uber, urban commuters had only public transit or the unreliable taxi cartel. Everything is different now.

E-cigarettes provide an alternative to traditional tobacco cigarettes and have the potential to solve a problem that social engineers could not achieve through stiff taxation and regulation. The free market is going to solve America’s addiction to smoking.

Hundreds of thousands of vapers are joining the Leave Us Alone coalition, fed up with government bureaucrats and lawmakers looking to nickel-and-dime every new industry that threatens their monopoly on steady streams of revenue. These passionate consumers are attending town halls and legislative-committee hearings, and many, for the first time, are voting. Unlike cigarette smokers, vapers aren’t sitting idly by as a product they use is under assault.

The biggest beneficiary of this new multi-billion-dollar market isn’t Big Tobacco. It’s Main Street USA, paved with storefronts filled with new businesses, employees, and products, all of which are contributing to local and state economies. Manufacturers of e-liquids, vapor devices, and other products aren’t shipping jobs overseas; they’re shipping products overseas. Who would have thought this would happen again?

Thousands of good-paying jobs are being created by an industry that is probably going to save hundreds of thousands of lives. The only thing that can stop it is people claiming to be public-health advocates. These are people who pushed for tobacco taxes to discourage smoking and are now pushing for the same new taxes on products that achieve what they never could: getting people to quit. But their fraud has been exposed. They were never about public health; they were always about the money.

New Mexico is facing a budget deficit due to the combined forces of Gov. Lujan Grisham’s shut down of the New Mexico economy and reduced oil production. It is of the utmost importance that the Legislature not increase the economic pain by raising taxes.

Despite plummeting revenues, the Legislature STILL saw fit to increase spending this year. New Mexico is currently set to spend $7 billion, more than one billion dollars more than it will take from taxpayers: $5.9 billion.

When the 2021 Legislative session convenes, significant budget challenges will remain even with the national economy regaining jobs (May saw an increase in employment of 2.5 million, the highest monthly gain in history.) The easy, traditional response to overspending is to blame the taxpayers for not sending in more cash. The Legislature will look at their own overspending and standing on their heads call it a “revenue shortfall.”

Under normal circumstances, tax increases of any kind result in economic harm. After months of “non-essential” businesses being forced to close and many people being out of work, tax increases would be devastating.

During these difficult times, families across New Mexico have had to tighten their belts. The legislature should control its appetite. It should not say of taxpayers: “let them eat cake.” (Heavily taxed cake.)

This should not be too hard for them to do. If they are serious. Over the years, New Mexico’s spending has increased well beyond the rate of population and inflation. Government spending has increased faster than the paychecks of taxpayers. And that is before the current big-spending Gov. Lujan Grisham and her legislative allies came into office.

Based on data from the National Association of Budget Officers’ State Expenditure Report from 2011 and 2019, total state spending in New Mexico increased roughly 33.6% from 2010 to 2019. Over that same time period, New Mexico’s population increased just 1.8%, according to a report from the United States Census Bureau, and inflation increased 17.2%.

State government in New Mexico has grown a whopping 14.6% faster than population and inflation did over the last decade. There is absolutely no “need” to raise taxes. Particularly not after last year, when a $350 million tax hike – which some are calling the largest in state history – was heaped on top of a $1 billion surplus.

New Mexicans cannot afford higher taxes. A 2018 report from the Mercatus Center measured and ranked all 50 states based on various tax and budget data. On the issue of “service-level solvency” – how high taxes, revenues, and spending are when compared to state personal income – the Mercatus report found that New Mexico was the state least able to raise taxes without harming the economy. New Mexicans couldn’t afford higher taxes in 2018 when the economy was booming. They certainly can’t handle higher taxes now.

Americans oppose tax hikes as the nation struggles to recover economically from COVID 19. A recent Wallethub poll found that just 28% of Americans “think that tax rates should increase to fund coronavirus recovery efforts.” Overwhelmingly – a whopping 72% – people do not think taxes should rise. Even former Governor Bill Richardson (D) has voiced his opposition to tax increases during this time:

If President Biden and Sen. Sherrod Brown raise the corporate tax rate, Ohio households and businesses will get stuck with higher utility bills. Democrats plan to impose a corporate income tax rate increase to 28%, even higher than communist China's 25%.

Customers bear the cost of corporate income taxes imposed on utility companies. Corporate income tax cuts drive utility rates down, corporate income tax hikes drive utility rates up.

Electric, gas, and water companies must get their billing rates approved by the respective state utility commissions. When the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act cut the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, utility companies worked with officials to pass along the tax savings to customers, including at least 10 Ohio utilities.

As noted in a July 2019 First Energy Corp. Press Release:

“Ohio Edison, Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company and Toledo Edison – announced today that the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) approved a comprehensive settlement agreement that will return additional savings to customers related to federal income tax law changes and includes investments to modernize the electric distribution system with advanced automation equipment, real-time voltage controls and smart meters.

“FirstEnergy's Ohio customers will receive 100 percent of the tax savings created by the federal Tax Cut and Jobs Act, which includes tax savings already credited to customers since last year. As a result of the additional tax savings, a typical residential customer using 1,000 kilowatt hours of electricity could expect to see a reduction of over $4 in monthly bills.”



""We are pleased to resolve the tax reform issues and will pass along the tax savings to customers,"" said Samuel L. Belcher, senior vice president and president of FirstEnergy Utilities. ""We look forward to modernizing our electric system with advanced equipment that will help reduce the number and duration of power outages. Smart meters also will allow our customers to make more informed decisions about their energy usage.” – July 17, 2019 First Energy Corp. press release

Dominion Energy Ohio passed along their savings to customers as well:

The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) today adopted an agreement that authorized Dominion Energy Ohio (Dominion) to establish a credit on gas customer bills to reflect the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 on its rates.

Dominion will credit residential customers the amount it has over collected, plus interest, since Jan. 1, 2018 under the previous corporate tax rate. The $50.9 million credit will be passed back to all customers over a 12 month period.

Dominion will return to customers annually approximately $18.9 million, which reflects the remaining tax savings not currently accounted for in rates, on a going-forward basis, until the Commission approves updated rates through a distribution rate case. Dominion is expected to file an application with the PUCO for its next distribution rate case in 2024.

Dominion will return to customers normalized excess deferred income tax (EDIT), estimated by the utility to be approximately $416 million, over a federally prescribed time period of approximately 38 years.

Dominion will credit customers non-normalized EDIT, estimated by the utility to be approximately $181 million, over approximately a six-year period.

A residential customer will see a bill reduction of approximately $5.80 per month for the first year, a $3.15 reduction in years two through six and a $1.55 reduction in year seven and beyond. – Dec. 5, 2019 WKTN article.

Duke Energy Ohio, Inc passed along their savings to customers as well:

Duke Energy Ohio customers will receive approximately $20 million in annual tax savings on their electric bills beginning this month. The bill reduction is a result of the recent Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which federal lawmakers passed in late 2017.

""The tax act provides a unique opportunity for us to reduce customers' bills by millions of dollars,"" said Jim Henning, president of Duke Energy Ohio and Kentucky. ""And that's exactly what we're doing here – delivering real savings to our customers.""

Duke Energy Ohio also plans to lower its customers' natural gas bills by about $3 million beginning in May – subject to the approval of proposals filed with state regulators.

""The tax act reduced our corporate tax rate – and that's a benefit we are pleased to pass along to our customers,"" said Henning. ""However, the impacts on our business and customers go far beyond the reduction in the corporate tax rate. While some of the changes reduce our federal tax liabilities over time, others could actually increase our tax obligations.

""We considered all of these scenarios as we determined the best ways to pass along the benefits of the tax act to our customers. And we continue to work through various regulatory proceedings in our efforts to ensure that our customers receive the benefits of this new law."" – April 13, 2018, Duke Energy Press Release

South Central Power Co. passed their savings along to customers as well:

As some of the year’s highest electric bills are hitting consumers’ mailboxes thanks to near-record heat this summer, South Central Power members are getting a one-time break on transmission charges that could decrease the average member’s July bill by around $10.

The bill reduction is a result of the recent Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which federal lawmakers passed in late 2017. “Thanks to tax savings realized by our transmission provider, we received a credit of roughly $1.7 million toward our transmission costs,” said Allison Saffle, VP of member service for South Central Power. “We’ve passed those savings directly on to consumers, who will see them reflected in lower transmission charges on this month’s bills. Going forward, the impact of the lower tax rates will be passed directly on to consumers, who will see transmission costs lowered by roughly $1 per month.” – July 24, 2018 South Central Power Co.

220,Norquist,Grover,pressdemocrat,"Norquist: Policing for profit must end

Why has there been a history of conflict between local communities and the police hired to protect them?

One big factor was exposed after the 2014 death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, at the hands of police.

A key reason Ferguson police were despised is that the politicians had turned the police into tax collectors for the city. Not sales taxes and income taxes, but fines, fees, forfeitures and traffic tickets.

The reports released by the Department of Justice and the Commission on Civil Rights confirmed that officers’ primary use of arrests and tickets were not for public safety, but as revenue generators.

Not stopping law breaking, but profiting from it.

By 2013, one-fifth of the municipal operating budget of Ferguson came from court fine collections. It increased ticketing, and the city’s municipal court issued 32,975 arrest warrants in 2013 for a city of only 21,135 residents. The city’s budget reached roughly $13 million, with the amount coming from citations, fines and forfeitures jumping to about $2.5 million. In other words, the share of the city’s operating budget coming from those fines and fees spiked from 13% in 2011 to 20% in 2013.

Since the report, Missouri passed legislation limiting fines, fees and court costs to a total of $300 and preventing cities from jailing people simply because they couldn’t pay. Missouri also passed legislation lowering the cap on the percentage of a city’s budget that could come from fines and fees from 30% to 20%.

Missouri state Rep. Robert Cornejo shepherded the legislation, which initially pushed for a 12.5% cap statewide, saying, “If you want to provide services to your taxpayers, then you need to be willing to go to your taxpayers and ask if they’re willing to pay for those services, and not just rely on catching people driving through your municipalities.”

While a cap of 20% on the percentage of budget that can come from fines and fees is better than 30%, it is not good enough. Percentages are floating dollar totals. The result still allows local governments to increase fines and fees revenue accordingly to compensate for budget increases.

Not only is it wrong to potentially ruin someone’s life over small infractions, but pursuing an individual can oftentimes cost the government more money as they waste resources on people who pose no threat to the community. The Brennan Center analyzed counties in New Mexico and Texas, finding they spent “41 cents of every dollar of revenue they raise from fees and fines on in-court hearings.”

Chicago has experienced similar difficulties with excessive ticketing and suspension of driver’s licenses over fines and fees. An outdated city sticker came with a $200 penalty and a person could receive a ticket for the same offense multiple times in one day. In February 2018, a Chicago Jobs Council report found that of survey respondents with non-driving-related suspensions, 72% reported owing more than $500, and 31% owed over $3,000 before it was possible to get a valid license. For many residents, setting up a payment plan was impossible due to initial payment requirements reaching as high as $1,000 and would instead file bankruptcy.

In September 2019, Chicago finally addressed the issue by stopping the practice of suspending licenses for unpaid parking and vehicle compliance tickets; issuing payment plans that start between $35 and $50 instead of $1,000; and ending same-day or consecutive day ticketing for license plate registration or city stickers being expired. Chicago and Illinois as a whole have a ways to go, but these are important steps toward ending the subversive practice of using police as tax collectors, which leads to increased criminalization, targeting of minorities and the breakdown of community relationships.",2,https://www.pressdemocrat.com/opinion/11046191-181/norquist-policing-for-profit-must

A key reason Ferguson police were despised is that the politicians had turned the police into tax collectors for the city. Not sales taxes and income taxes, but fines, fees, forfeitures and traffic tickets.

The reports released by the Department of Justice and the Commission on Civil Rights confirmed that officers’ primary use of arrests and tickets were not for public safety, but as revenue generators.

Not stopping law-breaking, but profiting from it.

By 2013, one-fifth of the municipal operating budget of Ferguson came from court fine collections. It increased ticketing, and the city’s municipal court issued 32,975 arrest warrants in 2013 for a city of only 21,135 residents. The city’s budget reached roughly $13 million, with the amount coming from citations, fines and forfeitures jumping to about $2.5 million. In other words, the share of the city’s operating budget coming from those fines and fees spiked from 13% in 2011 to 20% in 2013.

Since the report, Missouri passed legislation limiting fines, fees and court costs to a total of $300 and preventing cities from jailing people simply because they couldn’t pay. Missouri also passed legislation lowering the cap on the percentage of a city’s budget that could come from fines and fees from 30% to 20%.

Missouri state Rep. Robert Cornejo shepherded the legislation, which initially pushed for a 12.5% cap statewide, saying, “If you want to provide services to your taxpayers, then you need to be willing to go to your taxpayers and ask if they’re willing to pay for those services, and not just rely on catching people driving through your municipalities.”

While a cap of 20% on the percentage of budget that can come from fines and fees is better than 30%, it is not good enough. Percentages are floating dollar totals. The result still allows local governments to increase fines and fees revenue accordingly to compensate for budget increases.

Not only is it wrong to potentially ruin someone’s life over small infractions but pursuing an individual can oftentimes cost the government more money as they waste resources on people who pose no threat to the community. The Brennan Center analyzed counties in New Mexico and Texas, finding they spent “41 cents of every dollar of revenue they raise from fees and fines on in-court hearings.”

Chicago has experienced similar difficulties with excessive ticketing and suspension of driver’s licenses over fines and fees. An outdated city sticker came with a $200 penalty and a person could receive a ticket for the same offense multiple times in one day. In February 2018 a Chicago Jobs Council report found that of survey respondents with non-driving-related suspensions, 72% reported owing more than $500, and 31% owed over $3,000 before it was possible to get a valid license. For many residents, setting up a payment plan was impossible due to initial payment requirements reaching as high as $1,000 and would instead file bankruptcy.

In September 2019, Chicago finally addressed the issue by stopping the practice of suspending licenses for unpaid parking and vehicle compliance tickets; issuing payment plans that start between $35 and $50 instead of $1,000; and ending same-day or consecutive day ticketing for license plate registration or city stickers being expired. Chicago and Illinois as a whole have a ways to go, but these are important steps toward ending the subversive practice of using police as tax collectors, which leads to increased criminalization, targeting of minorities and the breakdown of community relationships.

“The imposition of fines and fees on poor people and minorities as a method of revenue generation is a major component of mass incarceration,” said Myesha Braden, director of the Criminal Justice Project at the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. “The harmful results of this practice, including the incarceration of individuals for no other reason than their poverty, undermines the basic principle of our criminal justice system — equal justice for all.”

But this tendency of cities to derive a substantial portion of their annual revenue from citations and fines handed out by law enforcement agencies is poison nationwide. Access to courts and due process should not depend on race or income, and court-imposed financial penalties should consider a person’s ability to pay.

California faced similar issues with fees for falling behind on parking tickets, which often result in a suspended driver’s license. On top of a $100 base fine for a suspended license, the state tacks on 10 fees, including a state penalty assessment ($100), court operations assessment ($40) and DNA fund ($50). The real cost of a suspended license, then, comes to $490. And if you can’t afford that? In the end, the fees for failing to appear or pay on time amount to $815.

California responded by implementing a Traffic Amnesty Program in 2015 spearheaded by state Senate Majority Leader Robert Hertzberg. After the 18-month amnesty window closed, they found that 255,306 amnesty cases had been resolved, 246,300 driver’s license reinstatement requests were submitted to the DMV by courts, and over $30 million in net revenue was collected.

In 2017, as a result of the program’s success, California ended the practice of suspending driver’s licenses for unpaid fines and fees and found an 8.9% increase in payments, demonstrating that revoking a person’s ability to get to work and opening them up to criminal liability for driving on a suspended license is truly counterproductive.

States and localities must put an end to this modern version of debtors’ prison where centuries ago men and women who fell into debt would be imprisoned until they paid their debts. How were these unfortunates expected to come up with the money to pay their debts?

In modern America, how do we expect anyone to earn money to pay for traffic fines if one is under effective house arrest and unable to drive a car to work?

222,Norquist,Grover,foxbusiness,"When the coronavirus hit America, Congress reacted quickly. It spent money. Lots of money.

The federal budget, which already includes hundreds of billions for health care, was spending a total of $4.7 trillion this year. Congress added more than $2 trillion on top of that after the pandemic hit.

CONSERVATIVE LEADERS URGE TRUMP TO REIN IN CORONAVIRUS SPENDING AS US DEFICIT SWELLS

Now Speaker Nancy Pelosi wants to spend another $3 trillion on top of that.

Every lobbyist in Washington, every corrupt and bankrupt mayor is demanding more cash to subsidize failure. Governors who have spent money they cannot pry from their citizens want Washington to give them other people’s money. Now. Immediately. Again.

The Republican Senate and President Trump have suggested we wait until July to decide how many trillions more to spend. That is a good first step. When the Democrat house passed the $3 trillion cash tsunami they believed that the US economy would lose an additional 7.5 million jobs in May.

We now know America gained 2.5 million jobs in May. As governors begin to open up the economy and decriminalize restaurants and dentist visits the Dow Jones reacted by jumping from the low of 18,591 to 26,289.

FED WARNS ECONOMIC DAMAGE FROM CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC COULD BE 'QUITE PERSISTENT'

This despite the damage Congress did when they added $2,400 a month to the unemployment payments each of the 50 states already paid out. That added federal spending means that 63 percent of Americans can make more money on unemployment than going back to their own jobs. CBO has said that 5 in 6 Americans on unemployment are making more than they did in their job. Washington created a large disincentive for many Americans to get a paycheck.

Every lobbyist in Washington, every corrupt and bankrupt mayor is demanding more cash to subsidize failure. Governors who have spent money they cannot pry from their citizens want Washington to give them other people’s money. Now. Immediately. Again.

That $2,400/month continues through the end of July. After it expires, we will see employment increase more rapidly.

What do we want?

We want the strong economy we created over the last three years that crested—before the virus—with unemployment at 50-year lows for all Americans. Wages rising, with those earning less seeing the largest increases in take-home pay.

The opposite of the previous eight years. The stock market hit a historic high of 29,398 in February. More than 158 million Americans were at work.

The Dow Jones increased from 18,332 on the day Donald Trump was elected to more than 29,000 in February -- increasing the value of your life savings by 60 percent.

US JOB GROWTH ROARED BACK IN MAY: THESE INDUSTRIES SAW THE BIGGEST GAINS

How did we get those jobs created, higher incomes, more lifetime savings? By increasing federal spending? Certainly not. Trump and the Republican Congress went the other direction.

Taxes were reduced, regulations repealed and reformed to cost consumers and workers less. When Biden was vice president, the United States had the highest corporate income tax in the developed world, 35 percent.

Communist China only takes 25 percent in corporate income taxes. Our tax policy pre-Trump drove investment, jobs, and growth overseas. The Republican tax cut brought the business tax to 21 percent. All business investment was expensed—bringing trillions of dollars of investment capital to the USA.

WHAT HAPPENS TO YOUR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS IF YOU REFUSE TO GO BACK TO WORK?

America became energy dominant with fracking and new exploration for oil and natural gas. America is on track to produce more oil than Russia and Saudi Arabia combined by 2025.

We want to return to the strong economy we lived in in 2017, 2018, and 2019. To get there we already know the path. Lower taxes, less regulation. Avoiding overseas wars.

The path offered by Nancy Pelosi of “spend more money” and “borrow more money” has been tried in other nations in other decades and always ended poorly. If Nancy Pelosi was right Argentina and Venezuela would be rich and successful and growing.

Some are suggesting we should pass legislation to build “infrastructure,” a $1 trillion “stimulus” package. But Obama did that and America got the weakest, slowest recovery since World War II. That did not work out well for American workers.

US DEBT SET TO EXCEED NATION'S GDP FOR FIRST TIME SINCE WORLD WAR II, WATCHDOG WARNS

What if they promised to actually build roads this time? Well, the Democrats control the House. No legislation can be enacted without Nancy Pelosi’s approval. And if she wanted roads they would have had roads back in 2009 when the Democrats owned the White House, Senate and House. The Green New Deal is all about everything except roads. That is why Dems call it “infrastructure.” Instead of a “highway bill” as in the past.

What might help? Well, I signed a letter along with noted economists like Arthur Laffer and free-market leaders such as Stephen Moore and Steve Forbes suggesting that the federal government repeal the Social Security payroll tax for the rest of this year. That would increase the take-home pay of every worker by 7.5 percent. And businesses would not have to pay their 7.5 percent, reducing the cost of hiring new workers.

What we don’t need is any legislation that Nancy Pelosi would permit through the House. Any truly pro-growth idea could not pass the House without Nancy Pelosi loading it up with budget-busting, growth-killing taxes, spending and regulations. Any truly pro-growth idea would be held hostage to the demands of the hard left’s job-killing agenda.

We know how we got to a strong economy: lower tax rates, more savings, fewer one size fits all regulations from Washington. The path back to prosperity is the same path we followed to get there.

As we can see the sun rising before us as jobs return, let us not be fooled into walking backwards down the path of tax and spend. That leads to a weaker economy and we left that sad place only a few years ago.

225,Norquist,Grover,washingtonexaminer,"America must be strong, powerful, rich — and lead the world in technology and science.

But just what makes a nation powerful, strong, and rich? Centuries ago, the answer might have been mines of gold or silver. Later, coal to fire the engines of warships and factories. Then oil for the same reasons. In a word: resources.

Today, resources are still the source of a nation’s wealth, but our greatest resource is talent and human capital. Trained minds and competence are the new gold and silver, coal and oil.

Today, we need not sacrifice blood and treasure on conquests of resources abroad. Instead, we can mine the best minds of the world by importing them, and simultaneously, cultivating and enriching the best minds here at home.

Unless the government foolishly pushes talented people and their families away.

I doubt that in the past there was a political lobby against accumulating gold and silver. But, oddly, today there is a lobby against importing talent into the United States.

Some senators actually urged the administration to halt all new guest worker visas for 60 days and to limit the issuance of visas strictly until unemployment returns to normal levels. Programs in question include H-1B and H-2B visas as well as the Optional Practical Training Program. Other senators rightly argue, however, that these temporary work visas will lead to economic recovery.

In 2019, we know that nearly half (223) of all American Fortune 500 companies were founded by immigrants and their children. Foreign-born individuals founded 101 of these companies, while 122 were founded by the children of immigrants.

In 2016, 51%, or 44 out of 87, of America’s $1 billion startup companies yet to go public had at least one immigrant founder and created about 760 jobs per company.

But those are just numbers. Intel was founded by Andrew Grove from Hungary; eBay, by Pierre Omidyar from France; Google co-founded by Sergey Brin from Russia; and Instagram co-founded by Mike Krieger from Brazil.

We should never stop the flow of talent into America. We want the innovative companies of the future to be founded on American soil, not abroad. We should not erect barriers to prevent future founders from coming to America to enrich our country.

If highly productive workers can no longer work in the U.S., the U.S. economy as a whole is worse off.

Nonimmigrant visas for high-skilled guest workers are known as H-1B visas. H-1B workers create new products and drive American wages up. IT workers on H-1B visas from India alone increased the wages of American workers by $431 million in 2010. Efforts to ban or restrict these workers are misguided. A better approach to reforming guest worker visas would be to scale back existing regulations that prevent guest workers from starting businesses and moving between jobs.

The coronavirus has not hit all industries equally. Coronavirus-related job losses in the U.S. are overwhelmingly concentrated in leisure and hospitality. Meanwhile, the tech industry, the most common employer of H-1B workers, has about 910,000 unfilled American tech jobs. Digital conference apps, social media companies, and digital marketplaces have seen soaring profits in recent months, and there is no shortage of jobs to meet the rising demand for tech products. Arbitrary restrictions on hiring will only hamper our national recovery.

H-1B visa holders disproportionately work in STEM fields and hold advanced degrees. They patent at double the rate of native-born Americans and account for 25-30% of total American patents. High patenting rates are a proxy of productivity at the national level; as we restart the economy, we should be eager to import innovation.

H-2B visas, which permit seasonal nonagricultural guest workers, can only be obtained when there are not enough American workers capable of performing the job; H-2B workers do not compete with Americans for employment opportunities. A blanket suspension would only impede the hiring and recovery process for American businesses.

For the same reasons, we should not suspend the Optional Practical Training Program, which allows foreign-born recent graduates to work in the United States for one to three years. This would force skilled and highly educated individuals to take their talents elsewhere while the American economy suffers. Daniel Di Martino notes that a 60% reduction of the OPT Program would result in a loss of 255,000 American jobs over the next decade, along with a decrease in wages.

The premise of the Senate proposal is that employment is a zero-sum game; when a foreign-born worker takes a job, an American loses an opportunity. In reality, highly skilled guest workers create jobs and increase wages across the board.

Talent, no matter its origin, creates increased opportunities for all Americans.

226,Norquist,Grover,washingtonexaminer,"A tax cut designed to provide businesses with crucial liquidity during the COVID-19 pandemic is under assault by Democrats and the media.

Why is this news? To start with, Democrats in the House and Senate unanimously voted to enact this tax cut in March, which allowed businesses to carryback net operating losses incurred in 2018, 2019, and 2020 for five years.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is now proposing to repeal net operating loss carrybacks retroactively in the Democratic “Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions (HEROES) Act,” a proposal that will raise taxes on struggling businesses by $250 billion.

The shift by Pelosi is particularly difficult to explain because expanding net operating loss carrybacks is a commonly used tax cut designed to help businesses in times of economic downturn. This tax cut has historically had bipartisan support and has even been praised by Pelosi in the past.

In 2009, the Democratic-controlled Congress passed and former President Barack Obama signed into law the “Worker, Homeownership, and Business Assistance Act of 2009” legislation, which allowed businesses to carryback losses incurred by businesses in 2008 and 2009 back five years.

Pelosi specifically highlighted the expansion of net operating loss carrybacks while speaking on the House floor in support of legislation: “The bill also has the net operating loss carryback, which businesses tell us is necessary for them to succeed and to hire new people, and also to mitigate some of the damage that has been done to the economy from past policies.”

She was not alone in supporting this tax cut.

The Obama White House hailed the net operating loss tax cut as a fiscally responsible provision that would allow the government to “recoup the majority of that funding in the coming years as these businesses regain their strength and resume paying taxes.” Several years later, in 2012, Sen. Chuck Schumer proposed five-year net operating loss carrybacks as part of Hurricane Sandy recovery legislation.

Now, Pelosi and House Democrats are planning to repeal net operating loss carrybacks retroactively, a plan that will harm businesses at a time when they are trying to keep the lights on and continue paying their workers.

Although this tax cut has been described by the media as a “stealth bailout” for oil and gas companies and a “tax-break bonanza” that benefited corporations over small businesses and individuals, this criticism is off base.

Net operating loss carrybacks are not a handout to specific industries — they are available to any company and are expected to be industries that have been particularly hit hard by COVID-19, such as restaurants, retailers, and airlines.

They are also not a bailout. Businesses are already able to deduct operating losses under the tax code in the year the losses are incurred and can carryforward losses indefinitely to future years.

As a result, net operating loss carrybacks largely change the timing of taxes paid. In fact, the Joint Committee on Taxation finds that a majority of the revenue loss incurred to the government in the first couple of years that this provision is enacted will be offset because companies will eventually deduct fewer losses throughout the 10-year budget window.

Some have raised concerns that the current net operating loss carryback law allows businesses to receive an excessive windfall as they are able to allocate losses incurred today under the 21% rate against income earned before 2017 when the corporate rate was 35%.

However, this is not an argument against net operating loss carrybacks, but an argument against tax cuts that are perceived to be “too generous.” This also ignores the fact that the pandemic represents a threat to the economy not seen in decades. Experts have predicted unemployment of 20-25% and fear a “flood” of bankruptcies, so businesses clearly need help.

Despite newfound opposition from the Left, the net operating loss tax cut is a commonsense, commonly used provision that helps businesses to keep the lights on and help workers keep their jobs.

As our focus turns towards reopening the country and restarting the economy, we should ignore the Pelosi plan to repeal the bipartisan tax cut, which will harm our economic recovery and businesses across the country.

227,Norquist,Grover,realclearhealth,"Would more government control of heath care have protected us better against the Coronavirus?

Leading Democrats like Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York say “yes.”

A recent poll showed that Americans disagree by nearly two to one. 38% of Americans believe that a socialized health care system like Britain or Canada has would have responded less well to COVID-19. Only 22% believe a government monopoly would have performed better than our present health care system.

Who is right?

This is an important question as Medicare-for-All would, according to conventional estimates, raise taxes by $29 Trillion to $35 Trillion over the next decade. How can we judge if this tax increase would be worthwhile?

We could start by looking at how those nations that have socialized health care have fared in the wake of COVID-19.

The pandemic has created a surge in health care demand that has tested every nation’s ability to meet the needs of their patients.

Even before the virus, other developed nations with government-run health care systems had understaffed hospitals and long waiting lines for even basic treatment.

In 2019, The United Kingdom had a shortage of 10,000 doctors and 43,000 nurses, with 9 in 10 managers in the National Health Service saying that too few doctors and nurses presented a danger to patients. At any one time, 4.5 million patients were waiting for hospitalization.

Closer to home, in Canada, the typical patient had to wait a record 21.2 weeks – or five months – to receive treatment from a specialist after being referred by their general practitioner in 2017.

Before the pandemic, the U.S. had 35 intensive care unit beds per 100,000 people – nearly three times the 12 beds Italy and five times the 7 ICU beds in the UK.

How did the USA avoid the virus overwhelming our ability to provide ventilators, hospital beds and care? Did we centralize control? Move towards Medicare-for-All?

No, the Trump Administration moved in the opposite direction by removing bureaucratic roadblocks and ending government monopolies.

The federal, state and local governments together abolished or suspended over 500 rules and regulations since the pandemic began. Less government red tape allowed hospitals, medical research centers, pharmaceutical companies and doctors and nurses to respond to the ever-changing challenge of the virus.

This deregulation has spurred medical innovation, allowing America to lead the way on the development and production of a Coronavirus vaccine.

Regulatory relief has also protected and expanded access to health care for American patients. Doctors were allowed to more easily move across state lines. Telemedicine was allowed to speed up health care while lowering costs.

If we had socialized health care, we would look more like Britain, Canada and Italy.

Adding insult to injury, Medicare-for-All would lead to significant middle-class tax increases at a time that the U.S. economy and American families and businesses across the country are struggling.

The Committee for A Responsible Federal Budget finds that “impossibly high taxes on high earners” would raise just one third of the total cost. The rest—some $20 Trillion would come from us.

Even Bernie Sanders admits that the middle class will take it on the chin to pay for Medicare-for-All. His plan includes a new, $3.9 trillion, 4 percent payroll tax on workers, as well as trillions of dollars in taxes on employer benefits and businesses. And it still falls trillions of dollars short of paying for the full cost of the program.

There is reason to suspect that Democrats are under-stating the taxes they plan to impose on middle income Americans. In 2007, candidate Obama promised that he would NEVER raise any taxes on any American earning less than $250,000.

What happened?

Obamacare imposed at least 7 taxes on the middle class. Getting anywhere close to the $30 trillion in new spending will require trillions of dollars in new taxes on middle class families and small businesses. That will cost most Americans more than the virus ever did. Every year.

To protect us against the next virus we need to say “no” to the single payer system that has failed in Europe.

In the short term, lawmakers must protect against efforts to incrementally move the U.S. health care system toward more government control. This means opposing proposals that impose price controls on medicines including efforts to adopt foreign price controls. It also means rejecting plans to impose price fixing on the health care system as a “solution” to surprise medical billing.

Lawmakers must also prevent COVID-19 from forcing an expansion of government health care. Almost 40 million Americans have recently lost their jobs, and with it their employer provided health care. Congress should step in and offer a bridge for these workers to retain their employer health care so they are not forced onto Obamacare or Medicaid, an outcome that would strengthen the effort of socialists to expand the federal government’s role in health care.

The Coronavirus pandemic has not changed the fact that socialized health care is a bad idea. It would harm medical care and lead to trillions in higher taxes for American families.

The lesson from the pandemic should be that the costs and failures of government control of health care—higher taxes, more spending, wage and price controls and innovation killing regulations—are clearer to all Americans.

Such lessons are most expensive if we fail to learn from them.

229,Norquist,Grover,newsweek,"Sometimes a crisis can wake up a sleepy government bureaucracy and change the world—for the better.

In the past, it has taken an average of 12 years for a new medicine to make it to patients. Seven of those years are spent in clinical trials after the drug was invented. During those seven years, people get sick and die.

For years, politicians have talked about reducing that unnecessary pain—and those unnecessary deaths.

When the coronavirus hit, the Trump administration determined it would do things differently. They changed the rules in order to help vulnerable Americans.

This time, 48 hours after the results of a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial found Gilead's Remdesivir ""had a 31 percent faster time to recovery than those who received a placebo,"" the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization allowing potentially tens of thousands of coronavirus patients to benefit from the new drug right now.

The (relatively) rapid speed in which the FDA moved in this case to provide access to the new drug is just one example of how the Trump administration has removed regulatory blockades to better allow America to rapidly respond to the coronavirus threat.

On another front of this war, a waiver allowed the deployment of new game-changing decontamination systems to the frontlines. These new machines allow single-use personal protective equipment (PPE) to be sanitized for re-use up to twenty times; they can also clean 80,000 pieces at a time. Certainly, innovations like these are welcomed by frontline healthcare workers who have found their crucial stocks of PPE to be in short supply, jeopardizing their ability to safely care for patients.

Thanks to this approach, programs like the FDA's Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program have allowed the innovation floodgates to open. To fight coronavirus, there are now over 600 clinical trials taking place around the world testing 247 unique treatments, 75 of which use novel compounds. There are at least nine vaccine candidates. A few are even pioneering breakthrough mRNA technology.

Ultimately, finding a workable vaccine is a numbers game. From discovery through clinical trials, a new medicine has historically cost, on average, more than $2.5 billion. And only 12 percent of medicines make it through to FDA approval.

Fortunately, even with repeated bureaucratic snafus, the United States has laid the groundwork for a global private enterprise system that allows innovators to share their work, compete in advancing science and collaborate with government incubators like the Department of Health and Human Services' Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority.

Underpinning this system has been the normalizing of high-level intellectual property rights protections with our trade partners. These IP rights do for scientists what proper PPE does for doctors and nurses: get them to work.

Enabled by these property rights, an unprecedented amount of knowledge is rapidly being generated by the global scientific community and shared with peers and public partners to reach a singular goal. And thanks to the robust IP protections secured in the United States specifically, scientists here have been able to get all their hands, clothed in latex gloves, on deck.

That's not the case in other nations. According to the International Property Rights Index, the United States, along with Western Europe, leads the world in protecting intellectual property rights.

Such protection creates progress. U.S. labs generate 80 percent of all medicines in the global research and development (R&D) pipeline, launch nearly 70 percent of all new medicines and capture 58 percent of global pharmaceutical R&D.

Sadly, some politicians do not understand this. Rather than focus on creating more life-saving drugs, they want to take away the property rights for coronavirus vaccines or treatments. Some activist groups in other nations want to allow foreign countries to seize American inventions through something called ""compulsory licensing.""

World Health Organization director general Tedros Ghebreyesus expressed support for an idea that could weaken Americans rights when they invent vaccines, diagnostic tests, medical equipment and medical treatments. ""We cannot invent these things, so we will steal yours,"" goes the logic.

But we know what works. Market-driven R&D, supported by intellectual property rights, is the only proven system to solve the two main challenges facing the scientific community: how to invent new medicines and how to manufacture and deliver them to the world quickly and efficiently.

Removing these historic protections, which are enshrined in the U.S. Constitution and our trade agreements alike, would not only cause a setback in our coronavirus response—it would also undermine our ability to respond to the next pandemic.

And Americans are a tad tired of having their inventions stolen by foreign governments when we invent medicines that save lives around the world.

230,Norquist,Grover,cato,"In addition to the existing legal immigration system, every member of Congress should receive 100 green cards to distribute each year. Members would have complete discretion over which 100 individuals they would grant legal permanent resident status to. Senators or representatives could design whatever selection criteria they prefer and implement it immediately without needing a majority of the House, 60 votes in the Senate, and the president to agree.

According to the Supreme Court, Congress can establish whatever admission criteria that it wants, and this scheme would not violate the separation of powers because executive agencies would still effectuate each nomination.91 The executive branch would still conduct screenings to exclude immigrants who are inadmissible under other criteria, such as national security or criminal concerns, and issue documents. But senators or representatives would sponsor them, rather than employers or family members, who currently select most immigrants.

Congress has 541 members—100 senators, 435 voting representatives in the House, and 6 nonvoting representatives. The combined effect of the program would be to increase legal immigration by just 54,100 annually— about 5 percent of the total number of green cards issued in 2018. Any members of Congress who fail to use their allotments in a given year would have their unused green cards distributed among the rest of their states’ congressional delegations. Notwithstanding its size, this program would have an outsized effect on the immigration debate and be much more likely to grow than other immigration program.",2,https://www.cato.org/publications/publications/chapter-7-building-congressional-constituency-immigration-through
231,Norquist,Grover,washingtontimes,"ANALYSIS/OPINION:

2019 was a rough year for disgraced Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam.

Mr. Northam’s yearbook photo resurfaced, which depicted him either in a Ku Klux Klan outfit or in blackface. After apologizing for the decision to appear in the photo, Mr. Northam then walked back his apology, but not before offering to moonwalk out of his press conference to prove his innocence.

Everyone who witnessed this disturbing sequence of events was left wondering why Mr. Northam didn’t resign. Now, we know the answer: Mr. Northam is the Virginia Democratic party’s hostage. He has a job, a paycheck and silence about his despicable behavior as long as he delivers on their most radical liberal priorities.

In the year since the scandal erupted, Mr. Northam and the Democrats — who won control of Virginia for the first time in more than 20 years this past November — imposed a number of tax increase and dozens of costly labor laws and regulations.

Unfortunately for Virginians, these policies will add to the economic damage from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Without a Republican-controlled legislature to protect Virginians from Mr. Northam’s left-wing agenda, he was able to enact 16 state and local-option tax hikes. The state gas tax, for example, is now set to increase 10 cents per gallon by 2022 and then automatically increase with inflation year-over-year. This will hurt Virginians every time they fill up their tanks.

When liberal Massachusetts tried to automatically increase its gas tax by tying it to inflation, the law was overturned by a vote of the people. Virginia is now to the left of Taxachusetts.

Mr. Northam also raised taxes on cigarette and tobacco products — which will result in Virginians shopping in North Carolina and other states with lower rates — and applied the tobacco products tax to liquid nicotine products. Taxing vaping products is especially stupid, as many Virginians have switched to e-cigarettes as a safer alternative to traditional cigarettes.

In addition, Mr. Northam made it easier for localities to raise taxes. He lifted the local meals tax cap from 4% to 6% and removed the voter referendum requirement to raise the rate. He also gave localities the authority to impose a 5-cent tax on plastic bags, which is particularly concerning now, as reusable bags are at risk of spreading COVID-19 and other diseases.

On top of tax increases, Mr. Northam imposed a “clean” energy mandate that will result in Virginians facing higher electricity costs.

This law, the Virginia Clean Economy Act, requires all coal-fired plants to close by the end of 2024, and Dominion Energy Virginia and Appalachian Power to be 100 percent carbon-free by 2045 and 2050. The State Corporate Commission has estimated that, once fully implemented, this new law will add $333 in annual costs for a typical Dominion Energy residential customer.

These “clean” energy policies, which are nothing more than a subsidy for billionaire investors, will be particularly burdensome to low-income households, who spend more of their paycheck on electricity.

Mr. Northam enacted several costly labor laws that will benefit union bosses at the expense of workers and taxpayers.

The state minimum wage is set to increase 31%, from $7.25 to $9.50 an hour on May 1, 2021, then $12 by 2023, and potentially $15 by 2026 pending additional legislative approval. Throughout history, the costs of minimum wage hikes is offset by hiring fewer workers.

Mr. Northam is also permitting localities to engage in collective bargaining with local employees, repealing a prohibition first signed into law by Democratic Gov. Doug Wilder. This change will raise the cost of local government — and increase taxes — substantially.

Luckily, not all of Mr. Northam’s tinpot schemes have come to fruition. Mr. Northam’s most recent attempted power-grab was tacking on an amendment to the state budget that would have moved the municipal elections from May 5 to November.

In the process, Mr. Northam called for destroying the ballots that Virginians already cast for the May election, disenfranchising thousands of his constituents and raising important constitutional questions. After bipartisan uproar, Senate Republicans were able to stop the despotic proposal dead in its tracks.

Ultimately, Mr. Northam is a governor in name only. Even though Mr. Northam tries to flex his muscle with hare-brained power plays, he is nothing but an errand boy for the far-left Virginia Democratic Party. The moment Mr. Northam is no longer useful, the left will chew him up and spit him out.

Sadly, it is Virginians who will pay the price of Mr. Northam’s tax-and-spend policies for years to come.

Democrats want to take $80 billion from taxpayers to create a new Washington bureaucracy to shovel money to politicians who think they are qualified to run a broadband network.

Funding, subsidizing or otherwise creating a government “competitor” does not work. The last time politicians tried to sell this to Americans they claimed state and municipal governments could build and run high-speed broadband profit-making centers.

They tried and failed again and again. These massively subsidized efforts attracted corruption, often failed to deliver on promises, and were bailed out with even more taxpayer dollars. Google KentuckyWired or iProvo.

Much of the Democrats’ proposed $80 billion would go to prop up these failures. Another failure: Former President Barack Obama’s regulators imposed “net neutrality” rules in 2015 that treated all internet providers as regulated public utilities. What happened? Capital investments from internet service providers declined for the first time since 2008-09.

When the FCC repealed net neutrality in 2017, broadband providers immediately increased investment, with $80 billion pouring into the networks in 2018 alone. And that $80 billion did not come from taxpayers.

OUR VIEW:In a pandemic, the digital divide separates too many Americans from relief

Meanwhile, Europe has continued to regulate and subsidize. And? European operators reported an investment of only $104 per capita compared to the U.S.’s $249, which means a long road ahead to reach parity with America.

Wireline broadband connections are accessible to about 94% of Americans, and 80% can access gigabit speeds.

What about the 6% of Americans without fixed broadband? The Democrats are late to the game. Plenty of new high-speed competitors are lined up.

The FCC under Ajit Pai has already approved satellite launches for next-generation satellite internet service and is on the cusp of approving the TV White Spaces Order. Both will bring a slew of new private competitors that cover the entire USA.

Wanna bet on who will reach rural America first — the new satellite competitors or the plans of politicians?

233,Norquist,Grover,thehill,"The coronavirus has taken a sledge hammer to the strongest economy in history. Businesses across the country have been closed by government policy to mitigate the spread of the disease, leaving grocery stores and pharmacies open to the public. As the country slowly starts to reopen, businesses now face the uncertainty of coronavirus lawsuits.

As our economy struggles to stand up and walk forward, we cannot allow frivolous lawsuits to kick us back into the dirt. Companies are doing the best they can to keep both customers and employees safe by following guidance that seems to change every day. Businesses are struggling to make ends meet and pay their employees, and employers are worried about having to close down forever if the pandemic continues.

It is clear that businesses are in this untenable situation through no fault of their own. The coronavirus is a global health crisis that has completely disrupted everyday life. Your local grocery store or gas station should not be held liable for doing the best they can to serve their communities. But where Americans see this as a tragedy, trial lawyers see an opportunity to cash in by shaking down vulnerable businesses with frivolous torts. Under current law, reopening the economy in the midst of a global health crisis will create a number of serious liability risks for businesses.

One area of liability is exposure, where trial lawyers will claim their clients caught the coronavirus at a specific location as a result of negligence by a company. It is virtually impossible for anyone to prove where they caught any illness. But exposure claims will begin a costly and drawn out process that could drive many businesses and industries to bankruptcy. Even silly lawsuits can cost them millions of dollars to defend against.

Trial lawyers can also go after employers for laying off their workers as a result of mandated closures. This means employers would be held liable for a decision they were forced to make because of the reaction of their own government to the global health crisis. These avenues for predatory litigation only add to the tremendous burden that employers face today during this crisis. So in order to protect companies and small businesses from these scenarios, Congress needs to urgently add liability protection for businesses in any future federal coronavirus legislation.

The concept behind liability protection is simple. If companies have taken reasonable steps to keep customers and employees safe, they should be protected from greedy trial lawyers looking to cash in on the crisis. Since the government mandated the closure of most businesses to mitigate the spread of the disease, the government has a clear responsibility to protect companies from such negative consequences of reopening.

If trial lawyers are allowed to proceed with their greedy agenda, that will undermine the ability of businesses to carry out basic functions. Frontline workers are already second guessing themselves as trial lawyers mobilize to shake down their industries. Doctors and nurses are now worried about legal ramifications of making difficult but necessary health care decisions. Workers in hospitals and in nursing homes are also afraid that trial lawyers will swarm to attack the quality of all their care in courtrooms.

Failing to enact liability protection will also complicate the reopening of nonessential businesses and further slow the recovery. States are already beginning to gradually ease their social distancing requirements to pave the way for a return to normal life. Businesses like bars, gyms, salons, and restaurants will soon have to make plans to reopen that involve following guidelines to keep customers and employees safe. These businesses may decide to remain permanently closed if the prospect of reopening could bring on an expensive lawsuit that could take years to resolve.

Fortunately, officials are adamant about including liability protections with the potential phase four of coronavirus legislation. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has now drawn a “red line” over liability protections and will insist that the provision is included in future relief packages. National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow has said that businesses should not have to deal with any “trial lawyers putting on false lawsuits.”

As our national focus turns toward restarting the economy, policymakers should enact proposals that encourage businesses to reopen as safely as possible. Protecting businesses from frivolous coronavirus lawsuits is part of that effort and needs to be included in future relief packages.

Deregulation has been the most effective tool in dealing with the coronavirus pandemic. As of this writing at least 350 regulations at the national and state level have been waived to help fight COVID-19.

Regulations can make things worse. A well-named regulation can do great damage. Regulations sometimes do the opposite of what was promised or hoped for.

APPLE, GOOGLE TO TRACK CORONAVIRUS INFECTION VIA SMARTPHONES

The recent Trump deregulatory actions continue the progress made by Trump appointees since 2017.

We saw this when the Federal Communications Commission had the regulatory humility to repeal one of the most onerous regulations of all - Title II public utility-style regulation of the internet. This regulation was called “net neutrality” which sounds good. But it gave federal, state and local governments excessive powers to meddle with the internet’s infrastructure.

For the two years the Obama-era “net neutrality” was in place, the regulations reduced investment in the internet infrastructure. Costs did not fall. There was no improvement in quality. But some self-appointed activists claimed that repealing the “net neutrality” regulations would bring about the end of the internet as we know it and even the end of democracy.

The COVID-19 crisis calls the bluff of so-called net neutrality advocates who claimed the internet would load a single word at a time, in order to continue their vast fund-raising efforts to “save the internet.”

Despite the gnashing of teeth on the left, the internet—without “net neutrality” regulations -- is thriving even as COVID-19 causes a huge uptick in internet traffic and more than 700 companies have pledged to keep Americans connected through the crisis. More people are connected, as companies offer free access and reduced rates, while networks deftly handle increased traffic from work-at-home, school-at-home, health-at-home, and entertain-at-home.

The networks have been able to handle, in some instances, a 70 percent surge in at-home internet traffic. Wireline broadband providers report that total traffic increased by a range of 17.3 to 37.4 percent, with an average increase of 25.5 percent.

Over the major wireless carriers, mobile voice traffic during COVID has increased between 7 and 24.3 percent compared to average usage pre the crisis, while mobile data traffic usage has increased between 0.7 and 9.2 percent compared to average data traffic over mobile networks. For example, AT&T reported wireless voice up 28 percent and Wi-Fi calling minutes are up 84 percent from the pre-crisis average usage baselines.

All of this is largely possible because of the 2017 Restoring Internet Freedom vote where the FCC reclassified internet service providers as a Title I information service, not a Title II public utility. In 2015, the Obama FCC majority called a law designed to regulate public monopolies like taxi medallions and power plants “net neutrality” and tried to end the open internet consensus harkening back to the 1990s.

The Title II “net neutrality” regulations were an outlier in the history of U.S. Internet policy. Before Obama administration imposition of Title II regulations in 2015, the internet was mostly free from government regulation.

For nearly 20 years, the U.S. employed a light-touch regulatory framework and where providers build their own networks over which they provide services, known as facilities-based competition. As a result, broadband investment maintained an upward trajectory in the U.S. – except for its downward blip under the 2015 public-utility style net neutrality rules.

While the public utility-style net neutrality rules were in effect from 2015-2017, annual capital investments from internet service providers declined for the first time since 2008/2009. After the repeal, broadband providers immediately increased investment with approximately $80 billion pouring into the networks in 2018 alone.

Meanwhile, Europe continues to impose public utility-style “net neutrality” regulations and its infrastructure investments continue to lag. The European Telecommunications Network Operators reported its members invested significantly less per capita in 2018, EUR89 (~104USD), compared to US companies investing EUR213.3 (~249USD) per capita, and said it would be a long road ahead to reach parity with the likes of the U.S. and Japan.

The European Commission actually had to require Netflix and YouTube to degrade quality. That is what over-regulation looks like.

The COVID-19 crisis calls the bluff of so-called net neutrality advocates who claimed the internet would load a single word at a time, in order to continue their vast fund-raising efforts to “save the internet.”

Life during and after COVID-19 will rely even more on internet connectivity. Telework and telehealth will be a larger part of new norms. American ISPs are at the forefront of keeping America connected and our technology companies are at the forefront of getting us back to work.

What we have learned in this crisis is that it imposing “net neutrality” was a politically driven mistake and repealing it was vital for consumers, the internet, and the flexibility of the American economy.

235,Norquist,Grover,washingtonexaminer,"In the midst of the pandemic, American businesses and workers are delivering for the people. The men and women who make possible overnight delivery to those of us locked down at home, and the workers at stores allowed to be open, are heroes. Businesses are defying the odds by both protecting the safety and health of their workforce and ensuring that people have life’s necessities.

But there are a few politicians who see the COVID-19 crisis not as a time to serve and protect others but as an opportunity to exploit the crisis for sordid financial and political gain. Someone once urged these types to never let such a crisis go unexploited.

On March 23, House Democrats and Speaker Nancy Pelosi introduced the dishonestly named “Take Responsibility for Workers and Families Act.” The legislation has nothing to do with N95 masks, social distancing, or avoiding the virus. If enacted into law, this bill would damage the fight against the virus by giving great power to labor union bosses at the expense of workers and businesses.

Included in the legislation was a provision tying business aid to a laundry list of longstanding union demands, including limiting free speech during union certifications, eliminating the ability to renegotiate contracts during a financial crisis, and increasing the minimum wage in a time of record unemployment growth. Nowhere in the legislation were protections against COVID-19 or the pandemic's economic effects found. The hastily thrown together legislation is a hodgepodge of special interest demands that have been on the wish lists of labor union bosses for quite some time.

Democrats are also trying to use the crisis to cripple their political opponents.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren led a group of Democrats to attack Deutsche Bank in a joint letter for the “crime” of loaning money to the Trump organization — the president’s family business. This ham-handed and obvious political targeting is one of the many obscenities in the Democrats’ demands.

Trader Joe’s has long been targeted by labor unions. For years, workers have made it clear they don’t want a union. But this crisis allows the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union to try once again to force all Trader Joe’s employees to pay union dues. It’s not likely to be successful, though. Trader Joe’s has been strong in implementing safety measures and has been fulfilling a key role in serving the community. They’ve shortened their opening hours, are providing up to two weeks of additional paid sick leave for employees, and have implemented new cleaning protocols.

Walmart and Amazon have been special targets of the Left as they are successful, largely nonunion companies. In a rude and offensive April 7 letter, Rep. Chuy García of Illinois attacked both Walmart and Amazon, claiming “negligence” in their responses to the virus. The unions’ most intense hatred seems targeted at Amazon. On March 27, Rep. Ilhan Omar and Sen. Bernie Sanders, together with 12 other Democrats, once again attacked Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, falsely claiming that he had failed to protect his workers.

Amazon responded by once again listing its measures to protect Amazon employees: increasing the frequency and intensity of cleaning at its sites, providing hand sanitizer, and making changes to ensure social distancing. Amazon requires employees to stay home if they become sick or have been exposed to someone who did, but those workers receive up to two weeks of emergency paid leave. They are increasing the pay of hourly workers by $2, to at least $17 per hour, with double their rate for overtime, adding up to $350 million in higher wages.

At a time of job losses, Amazon is hiring 100,000 new employees for full- and part-time positions. They will receive benefits immediately if they are scheduled to work more than 20 hours per week. Amazon’s Relief Fund also now has $25 million to help its delivery drivers, contractors, and Amazon Flex participants who are in financial distress due to the pandemic.

What’s more, at the behest of the AFL-CIO, the Service Employees International Union, and the teachers’ unions, Democrats are now loudly calling for the reinstatement of Christian Smalls, who violated his paid quarantine period in a union-backed stunt to attempt a strike (with little backing) during a time of crisis. Rewarding that kind of behavior isn’t improving anyone’s safety.

Democrats’ real problem is the one that became clear over a year ago during the Amazon HQ2 search: Democrats say Amazon is insufficiently unionized.

Businesses in the food and delivery sectors are helping their workers keep us alive and safe. Businesses are dealing with this crisis remarkably well. The Democrats’ problem is that these heroic workers have repeatedly made it clear they don’t want to give union bosses the power to define their jobs and to take union dues from them. The Democratic Party receives hundreds of millions each election cycle from union bosses. In return, Democratic congressmen push for laws to force more workers to pay more and more in union dues. It is a quid pro quo for the union bosses and the Democrat leadership.

This has nothing to do with the coronavirus pandemic. It has everything to do with money — political money and lots of it.

237,Norquist,Grover,spectator,"Barack Obama’s chief of staff famously explained that one should “never let a crisis go to waste.” Heeding that advice, long-time proponents of government-controlled health care are now claiming the COVID-19 pandemic makes the case for Medicare for All.

But the 50 governors and federal agencies such as the CDC and the FDA are wisely moving in the opposite direction. They are getting rid of long-standing rules, regulations, and laws that slow down America’s response to the coronavirus. Most of these regulations were not necessary in the first place.

Americans for Tax Reform is maintaining a list of government-imposed barriers that have been suspended or repealed due to COVID-19. Here are some of the ways governors are deregulating their states in order to expand health-care access and lower health-care costs.

Suspend Certificate of Need (CON) Laws

Governments used to hand out money to hospitals based on how many beds or medical devices, such as X-ray machines, they owned. So, hospitals wanted many, even if there was no demand.

Lawmakers reacted to this by requiring permits to expand health-care capacity. In the 36 states with CON laws, existing and potential health-care providers are required to get permission from government to establish or expand certain health facilities, equipment, or services.

CON applicants often spend several years and hundreds of thousands of dollars trying to prove that the community “needs” what the applicant is hoping to offer. While CON laws may have sounded like a good idea when they were implemented, they slow down, or even block, access to vital medical care.

To avoid shortages during COVID-19, Govs. Kim Reynolds (R-Iowa), Jay Inslee (D-Wash.), and more than a dozen others have suspended at least some of the CON laws in their states.

Bring Health Care Up to the 21st Century with Telemedicine

At least 10 governors, including Govs. Chris Sununu (R-N.H.) and John Bel Edwards (D-La.), have expanded the use of telemedicine in their states during COVID-19. Telemedicine has alleviated the burden on medical facilities, while also reducing the number of coronavirus cases that would have otherwise been contracted or spread in a doctor’s office or hospital.

Telemedicine is also making health care more accessible to patients, particularly for those in rural areas or who need specialists, as the nearest provider may be several hours away. Decades after the invention of the phone and the internet, one should not have to trudge down to the doctor’s office to ask a question.

Allow Medical Professionals to Practice Across State Lines

Despite the fact that those licensed to practice in one state are just as capable as those licensed to practice in another, state laws make it very difficult for them to help out in areas that may be more overwhelmed by COVID-19. To address this problem, several governors have called for some form of licensing reciprocity.

Govs. Jared Polis (D-Colo.) and Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.), for example, are letting certain health-care professionals who are in good standing in states where they are licensed temporarily practice in Colorado and Florida. This is a slightly different approach from legislation that was approved by the Florida legislature last year, which allows medical professionals licensed to practice in other states to provide telemedicine services in Florida without a Florida license.

A driver’s license is good in all states. Professional sports players do not need to prove in every state that they can play baseball or football or basketball. Why do medical professionals need a license in every state?

Expand “Scope of Practice”

“Scope of practice” refers to the activities a practitioner is legally authorized to engage in. Often, these protectionist laws do not reflect a practitioner’s full capabilities.

Physician’s Assistants (PAs) and Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (APRNs), for example, are highly trained, thoroughly educated medical professionals who can examine, diagnose, and treat injuries and illnesses. They can prescribe medication and can be primary care providers. Despite this, many states limit their ability to practice by requiring them to have collaborative agreements in place with physicians.

Gov. Tony Evers (D-Wis.), like many others across the country, has temporarily relaxed or suspended these unnecessary requirements during COVID-19. Getting these pointless barriers out of the way will allow PAs and APRNs to fill in where there is need, preventing provider shortages.

Similarly, Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D-N.Y.), in his proposed state budget, called for extending the authorization for pharmacists to administer all vaccines that the CDC’s advisory committee on immunizations practices recommends for adults.

This idea should be copied in more states. Allowing people to receive vaccines from pharmacists, who are trained in vaccinations and have a strong understanding for the pharmacology of medicines, would make easier for them to receive the COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes available.

Usually, the result of crisis is more government, more government control, and higher taxes. But this time, states have been taking deregulatory actions to avoid overwhelming the health-care system.

Governors and legislators should expand upon these ideas to further eliminate the red tape and protectionist policies that drive up costs and reduce access to health care. And they should make these deregulatory reforms permanent.

Longstanding, destructive regulations are always stupid. But in this environment, the COVID-19 pandemic, they kill.

238,Norquist,Grover,townhall,"The opinions expressed by columnists are their own and do not necessarily represent the views of Townhall.com.

While passing last week’s Coronavirus relief package, Congress opened the door for a government takeover of the airline industry.

Intended to pull the airline industry out of a nosedive, the package provides $50 billion in aid to air carriers, split evenly between loans and grant programs designed for payroll support. However, that money comes with significant strings attached.

In order to receive assistance, the airlines must refrain from involuntary furloughs or reductions in compensation until the end of September. Additionally, the bill prevents airlines who receive aid from performing stock buybacks or issuing dividends for 18 months while also freezing the compensation of executives who made over $425,000.

These provisions are a bipartisan compromise ensuring that during the partial shutdown of the airline industry taxpayer dollars are used for covering operating costs and keeping workers on payroll. This aid for the airline industry is in line with the core goals of the broader relief package to keep paychecks coming to American families and businesses afloat while the country waits out a pandemic.

However, Congress included an additional condition for the aid to airlines which would allow the government to take an ownership stake in the companies themselves.

Buried in the text of the legislation is a provision allowing the Treasury Secretary the “sole determination” to receive “warrants, options, preferred stock, debt securities, notes, or other financial instruments” from airline companies as compensation to the government for providing assistance. Secretary Mnuchin could turn taxpayer money into government ownership of an airline.

Sending $50 billion of taxpayer funds to large corporations was a tough pill for conservatives to swallow. But nobody signed up for a potential government takeover of private companies.

Support of the relief package from conservatives and small government advocates hinges on the notion that the government has a responsibility to compensate businesses and individuals for its necessary intervention in the marketplace. Right now, an estimated 294 million Americans across 37 states are being instructed by government officials to stay home. The Trump administration has closed the Canadian border and enacted a host of restrictions and bans on travel across the globe. As a result, airlines have been forced to slash flights by up to 90%.

The best available comparison to the current situation is eminent domain, in which the government must compensate individuals compelled to abandon their property to achieve a necessary public good. The airline industry is approaching insolvency due to an understandable governmental response to a public health emergency. The relief bill was an appropriate function of government in this case. Conditioning that support in exchange for further government expansion and increased control over private companies betrays the very reasoning of the rescue aid.

As the editorial board of the Wall Street Journal highlights, the current low valuations of airline companies paired with large employee payrolls means the government could even become a majority shareholder should the government require compensation for temporarily funding payroll. The scale of the problem could mean that airlines decide to reject federal assistance and file for bankruptcy instead, likely costing thousands of workers their jobs in the process.

Furthermore, the legislative text does not prohibit the government from voting with its shares. This thought should terrify conservatives given the absurd list of demands made by Democrats during the bill’s negotiation. They ranged from costly green regulations requiring ""carbon offsets"" to new price controls on tickets and mandates on passenger seat sizes. Now imagine a Joe Biden presidency in which Treasury Secretary Elizabeth Warren controls a partial or majority ownership of the airlines themselves. This is a scenario that can be prevented right now.

Thankfully, we don’t have to go down this road. The language of the bill provides that the Treasury Secretary “may” include warrants as a condition for financial assistance rather than using the term “shall” which would require the Secretary to do so under law. The decision is up to Secretary Mnuchin, he can alleviate these concerns by making clear that warrants will not be part of the program.

Stopping the government from owning any stake in a private company is the obvious choice.

239,Norquist,Grover,washingtonexaminer,"In 1997, I testified before Congress supporting the Security and Freedom Through Encryption Act, which would have codified the already Fourth Amendment-guaranteed freedom to use strong encryption. I said then that “I worry about an America in which the FBI director lies to Congress and has to be corrected by his own inspector general. These guys want to assign me my digital signature and keep my key on file with them or someone they designate?”

That worry has not dissipated with time. Following the shooting at a Navy training base in Pensacola, Florida, Attorney General William Barr pressured Apple and other technology firms to create backdoors for authorities to access devices.

Giving the government the capability to unlock your iPhone is like letting the government put a camera in every room of your house with a promise not to turn it on unless you’ve been bad. And of course, if the government or companies can access backdoors, foreign-backed hackers and other bad actors would figure out how to exploit intentionally inserted vulnerabilities as well. A backdoor into one device is a backdoor into all devices.

The government already has more than adequate opportunities to spy on taxpayers, take their money, and otherwise ruin their lives. Giving the federal government the ability to access every electronic device in the United States didn’t make sense in 1997, and it doesn’t make sense now.

Anti-encryption advocates claim that it’s a tool to shelter criminals. But it’s important to recognize that encryption is not just a way to hide things. U.S. businesses of all stripes need encryption to protect themselves from attacks and theft. Without encryption, countries or malicious competitors could break into businesses’ systems to access trade secrets, intellectual property, and other vital information. Healthy competition is a boon for our economy, but the game could get dirty if companies can’t effectively protect their assets.

Hackers with nation-states backing them regularly go after retailers and financial institutions to steal customers’ data. In Target’s massive data breach, hackers stole customers’ encrypted bank PINs, but they didn’t have the key, meaning they couldn’t decrypt the data. Imagine if this had happened in a world with encryption backdoors. Millions of Americans’ bank accounts would have been compromised.

More sophisticated encryption protects Americans even further. For example, Apple Pay allows individuals to make purchases with just their phones, which is more secure than paying with a traditional plastic credit card because both Apple and the retailer aren’t able to store the card number on the device or their servers. With Apple Pay, a bank or card issuer sends Apple an encrypted device account number, or token, for the card. This token is useless to make purchases without the device in hand and thereby useless to hackers.

This issue boils down to ensuring our property rights, privacy, and security. Quite frankly, encryption is the last bit of protection individuals have against a totalitarian state. Countries with troubling civil rights track records consistently attack citizens’ use of encryption — just look at Russia’s (failed) attempts to ban the encrypted messaging app Telegram.

Government officials are urged to use hypersecure devices to ensure they will not be hacked — and for good reason. It’s certainly interesting that at the same time, some government officials are calling to limit encryption on regular Americans’ phones.

I sympathize with authorities’ efforts to keep us safe, but I must point out that encryption is not the bad guy here. Compelling companies to weaken their devices or services intentionally would only put Americans at risk without providing the benefits that anti-encryption advocates have promised.

The bottom line is that encryption secures our critical infrastructure, promotes innovation, and protects both American citizens and businesses from cyberthreats or government overreach. The government shouldn’t meddle with that.

240,Norquist,Grover,washingtontimes,"ANALYSIS/OPINION:

Michael Bloomberg wants to raise taxes. Again.

Before former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced he was running for president, he was most famous for bragging about the wonders of taxing low-income Americans.

Taxes could be used as a cattle prod to make “them” (as he so kindly referred to the less well off) behave as he wishes.

On April 19, 2018, at an International Monetary Fund meeting Mr. Bloomberg reveled with the IMF’s Christine Lagarde about the power of taxes to control the poor.

Mr. Bloomberg gleefully told Ms. Lagarde and the audience, “Some people say, well, taxes are regressive. But, in this case, yes they are. That’s the good thing about them because the problem is in people that don’t have a lot of money and so, higher taxes should have a bigger impact on how THEY deal with themselves.”

If Mr. Bloomberg doesn’t think the peasants should be allowed to do certain things, he’ll tax them ‘til they cannot afford it anymore.

Mr. Bloomberg has pushed taxes and even bans on soft drinks, popcorn, salty food, cigarettes, vaping and energy use. Al Gore keeps flying on corporate jets, but taxes on “carbon” (energy) will keep the less well-heeled back in the busses.

But now Mr. Bloomberg is no longer just a busybody billionaire, but a candidate for the nomination of the Democratic Party. Yes, bullying the poor to learn to live with more expensive (and less) air conditioning in the summer and costly heat in the winter and higher gas prices year round is still on the agenda. But now Mr. Bloomberg must also compete in the envy and covetousness part of the primary contest.

Here Mr. Bloomberg is an awkward amateur compared to the professionals led by Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. He knows the words if not the melody.

Mr. Bloomberg’s opening bid in the envy race to the bottom is to restore the top personal income imposed by Barack Obama: 39.6 percent. When Ronald Reagan left office, the top rate was 28 percent. The economy grew 4.2 percent after Reagan’s tax cuts. It grew 1.8 percent in the years after President Obama took the top rate to 39.6 percent.

But that is just the start. Mr. Bloomberg adds to the 39.6 percent another 5 percent, so a total of 44.5 percent to those earning $5 million a year — Jimmy Carter, 1980 territory. And like the 1969 AMT or Alternative Minimum Tax that was supposed to only hit 155 Americans and then grew to threaten tens of millions one can be certain this 5 percent will be coming to an income bracket near you — sooner rather than later.

Second, Mr. Bloomberg would raise the death tax. He wants to widen its net to hit more Americans, more family business and farms. The last time the Democrats were in charge the death tax hit anyone stupid enough to die with life savings of more than $650,000.

Third, Mr. Bloomberg targets 32 million self-employed, family businesses known as “pass throughs” as these generally smaller businesses pay the personal income tax rates rather than the corporate rate. Today, companies like Mr. Bloomberg’s pay 21 percent. He would raise the tax on such smaller businesses to as much as 39.6 percent. It was one of the great steps forward when the Trump Republican tax cut of 2017 brought relief to smaller firms. Now, small firms are taxed only a little bit more than big businesses like Mr. Bloomberg’s. That relief for smaller firms will be gone under Billionaire Bloomberg.

Fourth, to get the ax are growing companies that expand and upgrade their equipment. Mr. Bloomberg would end the “like-kind” provision that postpones the capital gains tax if you sell your smaller tractor and buy a new larger tractor as your farm expands. Ditto for smaller businesses expanding to larger buildings. Mr. Bloomberg would hit such growing business with body-blow taxes as they try to grow as he once did with his firm. (Sorry chumps you were born after I was.)

Fifth, your IRA or 401K, your life savings for retirement will get it in the neck. In the past three years, the 100 million 401Ks and 50 million IRAs and other saving programs have expanded in value protecting the retirement income of more than half the nation. The Dow Jones increased from 18,332 on the day Donald Trump was surprisingly elected to more than 29,000 today — increasing the value of your life savings by 60 percent.

Mr. Bloomberg threatens to increase the tax on those companies whose stocks are in your 401K by 33 percent — from 21 percent to 28 percent. And since every other Democrat running for president has demanded repealing the entire Trump tax cut — which would raise the tax on businesses to 35 percent, we would see a return to the smaller 401Ks and IRAs of the Obama years. Good luck retiring when Mr. Bloomberg is through with your life savings. He is fine, however, if you were concerned.

Every proposal put forward here by Mr. Bloomberg has in the past reduced employment and reduced the value of every 401K or IRA.

There is, however, one last idea Mr. Bloomberg presents that would increase employment: He promises to increase the number of IRS agents.

No kidding. He does have a sense of humor. Gallows humor, perhaps.

Good luck.

241,Norquist,Grover,spectator,"The Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017 is the Trump administration’s greatest legislative triumph. It was the first major tax reform since Reagan’s Tax Reform Act of 1986 brought what was then 14 personal income tax rates ranging from 11 percent to 50 percent down to two — 15 percent and 28 percent — and the corporate rate fell from 46 percent to 34 percent.

So what is the next step for tax reform? And must we wait another 31 years?

There are three potential paths forward: one if the Democrats gain control of the Senate and White House; a second if Republicans win back the House, restoring unified Republican government; and a third if the government continues to be divided, with Republicans or Democrats holding at least one legislative body — the present gridlock.

The future depends on who wins the November 2020 elections.

The Democrat plan is clear. First, repeal the Trump tax cuts. Raise the corporate rate from 21 percent back to 35 percent, once again the highest in the world. Increase the personal income tax rate for all taxpayers. End the 20-percent exclusion for small businesses and return to the double taxation on income earned overseas by",2,https://spectator.org/fortune-telling-the-future-of-tax-reform/
242,Norquist,Grover,spectator,"Some politicians want to ban vapes, water vapor products that millions of Americans now use instead of smoking combustible cigarettes. Who decides who will run your life — you or the government? This is the running argument that created America.

The American Revolution began when the colonists feared losing key liberties to the British crown. Small tax hikes, new mandates, and regulations sparked the war that won our independence.

Today, Washington takes more from us and meddles more in our lives than King George did. Total taxes in 1774 were 1 to 2 percent of personal income. Today we lose a third of our income to taxes. Are we at peace with the new normal of big government?

No.

As a political organizer for the center-right and the president of Americans for Tax Reform, I can report the good news that Americans can and do still focus like a laser on new threats to our freedoms.

Indeed, the Trump–Reagan Republican Party, the modern conservative movement, is best understood — and most accurately described — as a coalition of voters who, on their vote-moving issues, want the same thing from government: they wish to be left alone.

Homeschoolers and parents with children in charter schools and private schools want to protect their children’s educational opportunities. Nineteen million Americans with concealed-carry weapons permits want their Second Amendment rights left unmolested. Small businesspeople, the self-employed, and independent contractors fight to be left alone. The many communities of faith disagree on who and how one gets to heaven, but they link arms and look to the First Amendment’s commitment by the government to leave churches, synagogues, temples, and mosques alone.

Taxpayers have long been active in the “Leave Us Alone” coalition, from the 1773 Boston Tea Party to California’s 1978 property tax revolt to the Tea Party movement of 2009.

But there are new recruits to the forces of liberty whenever government oversteps its constitutional limits.

One of the most amazing and powerful new additions to the fight for liberty is the 13-million-strong vaping community. Millions of adults have stopped smoking tobacco cigarettes or greatly reduced their smoking by vaping to get nicotine instead. Vaping is like a nicotine patch, but it’s twice as effective at getting people to quit smoking cigarettes.

As smokers moved to vaping, politicians at the state and local level have tried to tax vaping. They hate that smokers no longer buy as many cigarettes and tobacco tax revenue has fallen. The pols want to tax and regulate vaping to protect their addiction to the cash flow from smokers. (Their health be damned.)

I first noticed the political power of the vaping community back in 2014, when hundreds of vapers flooded state legislative hearings to oppose taxes and regulations that would reduce or deny their ability to improve their health. That year, vapers defeated 13 out of 15 state tax hike attempts nationwide, an incredible feat.

After extensive research, the Royal College of Physicians and Public Health, England concluded that vaping was at least 95 percent less harmful than combustible cigarettes and urged all smokers to switch to vaping.

It should not surprise us that 13 million American adults who know they have made a healthier choice that will extend their lives and improve their day-to-day health will go to the mattresses to defend that freedom.

In 2014, nanny-stater Liz Thomson, a state representative from New Mexico, proposed taxing vaping and was defeated in the next election with nationwide opposition focused on her attacks on adult vapers’ health.

Two years later, the Republican attorney general of Indiana ran for Congress but was defeated in part because of his regulatory attacks on vapers. In November 2016, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson announced on election night that he won his come-from-behind (way behind) victory thanks to vapers. Every single vape shop in Wisconsin was organized in support of his candidacy. Sen. Johnson ran 70,000 votes ahead of Donald Trump in Wisconsin. Johnson visited vape shops throughout the campaign and made it clear he would fight regulatory assaults that would shut down the shops and deprive the customers of a life-saving product.

According to the Department of Labor, the fastest-growing part of the entire retail industry is vape shops, with 12,000 new stores in the past 10 years. They sell flavored vaping products, which are used by 87 percent of adults who vape to quit smoking.

Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has committed $160 million to fund politicians and “public health” bureaucrats to ban flavors. He wants to close as many as 14,000 small businesses. A handful of governors have imposed policies that shut down vape shops including Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Michigan. The televised news reports of their empty shelves and fired employees and destroyed small businessmen and women are a powerful testimony to the damage a flavored vaping ban does to lives — and to the health of those adults denied vaping and forced to return to tobacco.

The modern American vape shop is where smokers go for a support system among peers looking for a way to quit. This is especially true in small towns and close-knit communities with above-average tobacco use. An entire public health movement has been built by small businesses improving the lives of millions of adults. That progress is all currently under assault.

President Trump has said that he does not want to destroy those thousands of businesses and deny vaping flavors to adults. Still, some staffers in the government think they are working for Mayor Bloomberg rather than the parents and spouses who are saving their lives thanks to vaping.

Thirteen million vapers. Eighty-three percent tell pollsters in swing states that they will vote against any politician who will take away their ability to protect their own health with flavored vaping.

This is a political movement for liberty, self-control, and self-improvement that will, among other things, reduce health-care costs and needless deaths. It is a tidal wave that could well decide who is the next president of the United States and replace some governors, senators, and congressmen who want to play Puritan and bully citizens rather than leave them alone to run their own lives for the better.

244,Norquist,Grover,washingtonexaminer,"Nearly two years ago, Republicans passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. As President Trump signed this bill into law, Democrats claimed that it would only benefit “the rich” and corporations. Then-House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi declared that any benefits to the middle class would be “crumbs.”

So, what actually happened?

Immediately following passage of the GOP tax cuts, businesses large and small responded by giving pay raises, 401(k) increases, bonuses, and other employee benefits.

For instance, AT&T announced a $1,000 bonus for 200,000 U.S. employees, while Pfizer announced $100 million in bonuses to nonexecutive employees.

Visa doubled its 401(k) employee contribution match to 10% of employee pay, while Boeing pledged to spend $300 million equally divided among charitable donations, workforce development, and infrastructure improvement.

Many small businesses did the same. Five Senses Spa, Salon, and Barbershop, based in Peoria, Illinois, gave $500 bonuses to its 20 employees and added employee benefits. Firebird Bronze, an Oregon-based manufacturer, was able to afford giving its nine employees health insurance for the first time. Anfinson Farm Store, a family-owned business in Cushing, Iowa, (population 223) gave its employees $1,000 bonuses and raised wages by 5%.

The Left dismissed these benefits as temporary and inconsequential. That has proven to be false.

A family of four earning the median annual income of $73,000 saw a federal income tax cut of $2,058, reducing their tax bill nearly 60%. This is not a one-time reduction and will recur annually.

More than 93% of taxpayers are now taking the standard deduction, leading to drastic tax simplification.

Twenty-two million families have benefited from the child tax credit doubling from $1,000 to $2,000, while 4.5 million people no longer have to pay the alternative minimum tax.

In addition to this tax reduction, everyone is benefiting from a thriving economy.

Since Trump took office, 7 million jobs have been created, and 24 states have seen record low levels of unemployment.

Annual hourly earnings have grown by 3% for the past 16 months, and real median household income has grown by $5,525 since the start of the Trump presidency, according to findings by Sentier Research. The ratio of unemployed persons to job openings is at a record low of 0.8. The unemployment rate hit a 50-year low last month and has been at or below 4% for 20 consecutive months.

The stock market is also strong. At the time of the 2016 election, the S&P 500 sat at around 2,100. Today, it has increased to roughly 3,100, an increase of almost 50%.

These gains directly benefit the 100 million people who have a 401(k) through work, the 42.6 million households that have an individual retirement account, and the nearly $4 trillion in public pension funds, half of which is being invested in stocks.

Stronger economic growth has already “paid for” 80% of the costs of the tax cuts, according to nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates before and after the law was enacted.

Despite the strong economy, Democrats are pushing policies that would undo this growth and impose new taxes on families and businesses.

In addition to repealing the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the Left wants to impose a government monopoly “Medicare for all” healthcare plan that would outlaw your individual health insurance plan and require approximately $32 trillion in new taxes to finance.

It will inevitably require tax hikes on the middle class — a fact that Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders frequently point out. In fact, draconian tax hikes on “the rich” would pay for no more than 30% of the cost of these plans, according to existing estimates. The rest will come from us.

In addition, the tax hikes would return us to the Obama years of slow job and income growth. Elizabeth Warren is proposing numerous tax increases: taxes on stock trades, a global 35% corporate tax, a tax on wealth, and a tax on workers.

In contrast, Trump and Republicans want to build on the success of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

Ahead of the 2020 election, Trump plans to release a second tax cut that will offer further middle-class and small-business tax reductions that ensure the economy remains strong.

Today, the successes of the Trump GOP tax cuts are clear: higher wages, more jobs, and stronger growth. Democrats promise that if they win power in Washington, they would erase these gains with an agenda of higher taxes and slower economic growth.

Grover Norquist (@GroverNorquist) is a contributor to the Washington Examiner's Beltway Confidential blog. He is the president of Americans for Tax Reform.",2,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/two-years-in-the-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act-is-a-clear-and-obvious-success
245,Norquist,Grover,dailycaller,"Democratic candidates for president are running on a socialist agenda of higher taxes and vast new government spending programs. These candidates have proposed countless tax hikes on families and businesses including income tax increases, new payroll taxes, capital gains tax increases, corporate tax increases, and death tax increases.

Democrats in Congress share this obsession with higher taxes. Impeachment aside, Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s top priority is a drug pricing proposal that would impose a fine of up to 95 percent on revenue from drugs that companies failed to offer insurers at rates negotiated with the federal government. The fine could hit hundreds of medicines, including drugs that treat cancer, hepatitis C, epilepsy and multiple sclerosis.

This tax hike plan will restrict access to vital cures and harm the ability of manufacturers to create new life-saving innovations. It could cost thousands of American jobs and surrender American’s competitive advantage as a global leader in research and development.

This proposal, known as H.R. 3, the “Lower Drug Costs Now Act,” imposes this fine on the sales of up to 250 drugs if the manufacturer does not agree to government set prices.

Under this plan, a manufacturer selling a drug for $100 would owe $95 in fines in addition to corporate taxes owed. Unlike many other taxes in the code, this tax is not deductible when determining income taxes so could conceivably result in a manufacturer owing over 100 percent of their total sales in taxes.

This means that a manufacturer selling in Pelosi’s home state of California would still be liable for the 21 percent federal corporate tax and the 8.84 percent state corporate tax. The fine is also applied retroactively, so if enacted, would hit manufacturers for decisions already made.

If fully imposed on the top 250 drugs in Medicare Part D, Pelosi’s plan would impose a $112 billion tax hike on seniors’ medicines, based on data compiled by Patients for Affordable Drugs. This tax applies to total sales, not just Part D sales, so the overall tax could be far higher.

The Pelosi plan’s 95 percent tax on seniors’ medicines could result in drug shortages in the U.S. This is not fear mongering – the Pelosi drug tax is so onerous that the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office predicts that that a manufacturer will either comply with government price setting (which will not trigger the tax) or leave the U.S. market entirely (resulting in a zero liability as the tax is on U.S. sales).

Additionally, the Pelosi legislation will harm jobs. American pharmaceutical manufacturers lead the world in medical development and account for almost 60 percent of global R&D. This innovation supports 3.8 million jobs directly or indirectly. This could cost $1 trillion a year and prevent 100 lifesaving medicines from being created over the next decade, according to a report by the Council of Economic Advisors.

Pelosi’s plan could result in the loss of 700,000 jobs across the country including 135,448 in Pelosi’s home state of California.

Politically, Pelosi’s 95 percent fine represents another step toward the ultimate goal of the left — a complete takeover of the U.S. health care system.

A majority of Democrats in the House and Senate already support proposals to create government-controlled health care, often branded as “Medicare-for-all.”

Under socialized medicine, 180 million Americans would be forced to give up their current plan, and 25 million Americans would lose their Health Savings Account. Care would be arbitrarily apportioned and rationed by the government.

Worse, the costs of this plan would be borne squarely by middle class families. It would require between $30 and $35 trillion in tax hikes, according to the Urban Institute.

The Committee for A Responsible Federal Budget estimates an “aggressive set of tax hikes” on the wealthy and corporations, including a wealth tax and doubling existing capital gains, individual, and corporate income rates would raise just $10 trillion — or roughly 30 percent of the cost.

Pelosi’s 95-percent tax plan does not represent a good-faith effort to lower drug prices. Rather, it is akin to confiscation of property.

While reasonable efforts to lower drug costs should be considered, Pelosi’s plan is an unabashed proposal to move U.S. health care toward socialism. If enacted, it will harm American innovation, destroy hundreds of thousands of jobs across the country and reduce access to life-saving medicines.

Millions of low- and middle-income households would again be stuck paying the Obamacare individual mandate tax. Utility bills would go up in all 50 states as a direct result of the corporate income tax increase.

Small employers would face a tax increase due to the repeal of the 20% deduction for small-business income. The United States would have the highest corporate income tax rate in the developed world. Taxes would rise in every state and every congressional district.

The death tax would ensnare more families and businesses. The alternative minimum tax would snap back to hit millions of households. Millions of households would see their child tax credit cut in half. Millions of households would see their standard deduction cut in half, adding to their tax complexity as they are forced to itemize deductions and hassle with the shoebox full of receipts on top of the refrigerator.

Federal taxes are too high. Federal spending is too high. Both should be reduced by reforming government to cost less.

To begin with, when you earn your paycheck — you earned it. Confiscation of your income is a big step, and the government must justify that decision.

We know from experience that when tax rates are reduced the economy grows faster, more jobs are created and paychecks fatten. Higher taxes hurt the economy.

In the last two and a half years since Trump was elected and reduced the tax burden, the median family income has grown by $4,000 to $65,000. In the 7½ years of President Barack Obama (after the recession ended), the median household income grew only $1,000.

Presidents Calvin Coolidge, John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan, and Donald Trump all cut taxes and the economy grew. When Obama raised taxes we had the slowest, weakest recovery in 60 years.

Last year the federal government took away $3.3 trillion from the American people, nearly 17% of GDP. That is more than enough for the national government to raise and spend on the limited number of expenditures allowed by our Constitution.

Defense spending, which is mentioned in the Constitution, consumes about one-sixth of the federal budget. Total spending on national defense is $649 billion, or 3.2% of GDP.

The problem our nation faces is that the federal (and state and local) government spends too much, not that it fails to take more of our time, our lives, and our life savings each year.

Politicians begin to focus on reforming government to cost less only when we as citizens take “raise taxes” off the table. Tax hikes are the alternative to reformed and limited government.

Economic growth increases tax revenue, not by hiking taxes but by having more Americans working with higher wages. The same tax rates bring the government more money.

Some people like the idea of taxing “the other” to punish successful people. But that damages all Americans as jobs, income, and growth fall. Envy leads to very bad decisions. It is a character flaw, not a political program.

Government should focus on its own failure to reform itself rather than shove its fat hand into your family’s savings — again.

247,Norquist,Grover,tri,"Yes: It's time to try a new approach

We’ve been cutting taxes on the wealthy for two generations, and the results have been dismal.

Economists, who started as generally supportive of the tax cut experiment, have seen enough. By 2017, only 2% of the University of Chicago's Economics Expert Panel agreed the Trump tax cuts would lead to faster economic growth. The 98% were right.

The economy is growing slower, and budget deficits are rising faster than tax-cutters promised. Yet the same people are arguing for more tax cuts to solve the problem. We don't need another drink to steady our nerves before we get behind the wheel. It's time to sober up, raise taxes on the wealthy, restore our progressive tax system and get our economy growing again.

How could the economy grow faster with higher taxes? It’s hard for most Americans to remember how radically different our tax code was during the glory days of the U.S. economy, but we used to tax the rich, much more, and we taxed the super-rich much more still.

From the end of World War II into the 1970s, the United States experienced rapid, broadly shared growth under a dramatically more progressive tax system than we have today. Between 1945 and 1980 we had an average of 24 different tax brackets (there are seven today) with a top income tax bracket starting at 137 times higher income than the lowest bracket (today that number is closer to 30), and a top rate between 70 and 90%.

Halfway through the tax cut experiment, it was possible to believe it could work, but with an additional 20 years of data we know more about how tax cuts — and tax cutters — work. And it’s hard to take either seriously.

Real economic growth was faster in each of the three decades before 1980 than in any decade since, both for overall GDP growth and after adjusting for population growth. After the failure of the 1980s tax cuts, George W. Bush passed large tax cuts for the rich in 2001 and 2003, and growth slowed further, all before the great recession and a lost-decade of income growth.

The good news is we don’t need brilliant insights to get out of this hole, we can just stop digging. Raising taxes on the wealthy, which is extremely popular, will allow us to make the important investments in our future — in education, in career and family supports, in scientific research and physical infrastructure — that we’ve been short-changing for a generations. We can get back to relying on innovation for economic growth that’s broadly shared and makes all our lives better.

Another bonus is that the people who have bothered to look have confirmed the failure of tax cuts for so long that there are numerous good ideas for leveling the playing field without raising a dime from middle-class families. There are proposals for millionaire (and multi-millionaire!) surtaxes, wealth taxes, mark-to-market capital taxes and inheritance taxes, just to name a few. All have the benefit of checking the power of wealthy Americans and corporations, and reversing some of the burden of funding the important functions of government off of lower-income Americans who have been backfilling the lost tax payments from the wealthy with higher sales and payroll taxes.

This is no doubt worrying for tax cutters, who have grown used to winning the argument with disingenuous claims about unpopular policies. But tax cutters can relax because all along they’ve had the power to close their eyes, tap their heels together three times and go back to Kansas... where they can enjoy the catastrophic effects of a different tax cut experiment gone horribly wrong.

For at least 15 years now, it’s been the right time to raise taxes on the wealthy. It will lead to a fairer, stronger economy that will grow faster as we make the public investments we’ve been delaying for decades. And as economists have gotten more sophisticated about taxes, evidence for taxing the wealthy has gotten much stronger. The only thing that’s easier to predict is that the usual characters will claim the solution to the harms begotten by decades of tax cuts for the wealthy is a Shiny New Tax Cut. It’s our fault if we believe them.

In the last two and a half years since Trump was elected and reduced the tax burden, the median family income has grown by $4,000 to $65,000. In the 7.5 years of Barack Obama (after the recession ended) the median household income grew only $1,000.

Calvin Coolidge, John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump all cut taxes and the economy grew. When Obama raised taxes, we had the slowest, weakest recovery in 60 years. Last year the federal government took away $3.3 trillion from the American people, nearly 17% of GDP. That is more than enough for the national government to raise and spend on the limited number of expenditures allowed by our Constitution.

Defense spending, which is mentioned in the Constitution, consumes about one-sixth of the federal budget. Total spending on national defense is $649 billion, or 3.2% of GDP.

The problem our nation faces is that the federal (and state and local) government spends too much, not that it fails to take more of our time, our lives and our life savings each year.

Politicians begin to focus on reforming government to cost less only when we as citizens take “raise taxes” off the table. Tax hikes are the alternative to reformed and limited government.

Economic growth increases tax revenue, not by hiking taxes but by having more Americans working with higher wages. The same tax rates bring the government more money.

Some people like the idea of taxing “the other” to punish successful people. But that damages all Americans as jobs, income and growth fall. Envy leads to very bad decisions. It is a character flaw, not a political program.

Government should focus on its own failure to reform itself over the past decades rather than shove its fat hand into your family’s savings. Again.",2,https://www.tri-cityherald.com/opinion/national-opinions/article237677474.html
248,Norquist,Grover,yellowhammernews,"Taxpayers should not be forced to subsidize passenger trains

There is no shame in being the first to try out a new idea that ends up failing.

There is great shame, however, in politicians wasting hard-earned tax dollars on an idea that has been tried and failed repeatedly. Unfortunately, the latter scenario is playing out right now on the Gulf Coast.

The Southern Rail Commission – an Interstate Rail Compact authorized by Congress – is actively working to revive an old Amtrak service that was suspended after Hurricane Katrina. Travelers preferred other modes of transportation to the passenger train, and it was decided that wasting even more scarce public dollars on restoring the passenger rail service did not make sense.

But lack of interest in that old train service – and the failures of numerous other passenger rail lines throughout the country over the years, such as the Hoosier Line in Indiana – has not deterred the SRC. Their proposal, also known as the Gulf Coast Rail Project, includes two daily round trip trains running between New Orleans and Mobile with stops in Bay St. Louis, Gulfport, Biloxi and Pascagoula.

The SRC claims the price tag for this undertaking is $65.9 million in capital costs, though this amount only covers the rail’s initial studies and minor projects. When rail infrastructure projects, and long term operational and maintenance costs are included, it will likely end up costing taxpayers much more.

So far, the SRC has secured roughly $60 million, with the Federal Railroad Administration flushing away $33 million from federal taxpayers, big-spending Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards promising $10 million from Louisiana taxpayers, and the Mississippi Department of Transportation handing over almost $16 million from Mississippi taxpayers.

Alabama Governor Kay Ivey remains the hold out on funding. And for good reason.

For one, as was the case with the old Amtrak service running along the Gulf Coast, this project will surely turn out to be a terrible deal for taxpayers. “Amtrak’s business model is to lose money,” explains Dr. Jameson Taylor, director of Policy at the Mississippi Center for Public Policy. “Amtrak has never made a profit since its inception in 1970.”

Indeed, over the years, Amtrak has received $46 billion in federal subsidies and it loses money on basically all of its routes. In light of this trend and past experience on the Gulf Coast, there is no reason to think the Gulf Coast Rail Project will turn out differently. Buttressing this point, in its own study, Amtrak projected that the Gulf Coast Rail Project would attract just 26 riders per train.

Making matters worse, the Gulf Coast Rail Project would also interfere with jobs and industries along the coast. That is because freight trains currently carry many materials and products along the same line that the proposed passenger rail would use.

As things currently stand, this line is already very congested. Adding two daily round trip passenger trains to this line – which means four one-way trains each day – would cause these freight trains to experience frequent delays, especially because federal law requires passenger rail to take priority to freight trains.

Such interference with existing operations will result in delays, create unreliable supply chains, and could even cause transportation costs for the industries that rely on freight rail service to increase.

Taxpayer-funded trains are a tried and failed experiment. There is no justification for pouring millions of limited tax dollars into the Gulf Coast Rail Project, particularly when there are plenty of other transportation options available and private sector industries, jobs, and wages could be jeopardized.

Grover Norquist is president of Americans for Tax Reform (ATR), a taxpayer advocacy group he founded in 1985 at President Reagan’s request. ATR works to limit the size and cost of government and opposes higher taxes at the federal, state, and local levels and supports tax reform that moves towards taxing consumed income one time at one rate.",2,https://yellowhammernews.com/taxpayers-should-not-be-forced-to-subsidize-passenger-trains/
249,Norquist,Grover,yellowhammernews,"Dale Jackson: It’s Sgt. Jackson to you!

For far too long I have allowed civilians to get away with not properly addressing me by my military rank.

Until Lt. Col. Alex Vindman’s testimony Tuesday in which he corrected U.S. Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA), I had forgotten how important it is that I am addressed as Sgt. Dale Jackson.

This is obviously an important distinction, because it now means that nobody can ever again question a single thing I say.

Apparently this is how things work now.

Any time anyone wears a military uniform, they are automatically beyond reproach. You cannot question their motives, and everything they say must be taken and accepted as absolute truth.

For anyone who has ever served in the military, you know idiots like this, and you know how absurd this is.

We all know the blue falcon who tells the waitress at Pizza Hut, “That’s Lieutenant,” when the waitress addresses him without respecting his rank. (True story)

Everybody that acts like this is universally hated in the military.

If you served in the military and you disagree with this, I am talking about you.

And let me let you in on a little secret: People who served in the military can be scumbags, too. They can lie and do all sorts of stupid things.

The idea that anyone that has served their country, no matter how honorably, can’t be questioned on anything is a horrible take.

Furthermore, it is a disgrace to use your military service as a shield.

When asked why he wore his uniform to testify when he normally wears civilian clothing in his day-to-day operations, Lt. Col. Vindman explained that he felt like people tweeting at him had diminished his military service.

So he showed those very relevant people on Twitter just how important he was by wearing his dress uniform to testify that the president had made him feel uncomfortable.

Effectively, Vindman used his uniform and rank as a shield from criticism.

We know from his testimony that Vindman disagreed with and then disregarded the chain of command, and it is pretty obvious that he had colluded with the whistleblower even after being advised that he should not disclose what he knew.

Vindman was upset that the president had not used his talking points on Ukraine and had decided to go in another direction, which is his prerogative as Commander in Chief. So Vindman decided to lash out at President Donald Trump.

For this reason alone, the media and their Democrats will hail this guy as a hero.

But being in opposition to President Trump does not make you a hero.

Vindman’s actions were cowardly, and he should in no way be rewarded for it. His testimony should be considered as the petty, partisan garbage that it really is.

250,Norquist,Grover,foxnews,"The 2020 presidential campaign is dominating media coverage, but in just a few days, on Nov. 5, the voters (not a poll) of the battleground state of Colorado will determine the future of the nation’s strongest and most effective tax and expenditure limitation measure, known as the Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR).

Approved by more than 53 percent of voters in 1992, Colorado's TABOR mandates that state revenue cannot grow faster than the combined rate of inflation and population growth. State revenue collected in excess of the TABOR cap is refunded to taxpayers. TABOR also requires lawmakers to get voter approval for all tax increases.

It is projected that Colorado state government will have to refund roughly $500 million to Colorado taxpayers in 2020 due to revenue collections coming in above the TABOR cap. The progressive Democrats who run Colorado’s state legislature and Democratic Gov. Jared Polis are working to prevent those and all future refunds from happening with a measure referred to the November 2019 ballot that seeks to kill the Taxpayer Bill of Rights.

GROVER NORQUIST: ELIZABETH WARREN WANTS TO RAISE TAXES FOR MIDDLE-CLASS AMERICANS — NOT JUST THE RICH

Proposition CC, which will appear on the statewide ballot in Colorado this fall, asks Colorado voters to allow state government to keep money that is supposed to be sent back to taxpayers in accordance with TABOR. Passage of Proposition CC would mean the end of the TABOR and the result would be a significantly higher tax burden in perpetuity for individuals, families, and employers across Colorado.

However if Colorado voters were to reject Proposition CC this November, it would send a strong message that should concern politicians looking to raise taxes, which includes every Democrat running for president. Rejection of CC would send the message that Colorado voters, who elected a Democratic-controlled state government less than a year ago, support the Taxpayer Bill of Rights and want politicians to stop cooking up new ways to kill it.

Polis and the other Boulder progressives who run the Colorado legislature complain that TABOR prevents them from implementing their plans for higher taxes and new spending. That is a feature of TABOR, not a bug.

""If Proposition CC passes on November’s ballot, gutting the public’s right to consent, Colorado’s economy will suffer,” the Colorado Springs Gazette editorial board wrote earlier this summer. This is correct. TABOR is key to Colorado’s economic success.

Colorado’s state government is run by Democrats who want California-style high tax rates and heavy regulation. TABOR acts as a fiscal straight jacket, preventing the far-left Democrats who run the show in Denver from passing their craziest ideas for siphoning more revenue out of the productive economy and growing state government.

“TABOR’s restraint on ... out-of-control tax and spending habits is the driving factor in attracting business investment and talented people to Colorado,”Jon Caldara, president of the Independence Institute, pointed out in a June 28 Denver Post column. Even those who once sought to weaken TABOR in the past, such as former Republican Gov. Bill Owen, recognize that Proposition CC would do serious harm to the Colorado economy.

“Having served as governor when Referendum C passed in 2005, I understand the difference between short-term adjustments during funding crises and permanent blank checks that the state government too often wishes it could write itself,” said Owen. “Proposition CC is the latter, and for the sake of future generations of Colorado taxpayers, I urge voters to reject it in November.”

Presidential contenders and others running for federal office should pay attention to what happens in Colorado this November. Every Democratic candidate for president has promised massive tax increases if they win. If a battleground state that just elected a progressive-run state government votes to uphold the nation’s strongest taxpayer protection measure, it will indicate that plans to run on a platform of raising taxes is not the smartest approach for 2020 hopefuls to take.

254,Norquist,Grover,foxnews,"Elizabeth Warren wants to raise taxes on middle-class Americans, but she won’t admit it. Even the establishment media are getting fed up with her evasive answers.

Warren wants you to think she will only raise taxes on “the wealthy.” But her “Medicare-for-all” plan would impose massive tax increases on the middle class.

When questioned by the press as to whether her plan will involve higher middle-class taxes, Warren continues to bob and weave and dodge the question.

STUDY: EXORBITANT TAXES ON RICH AND CORPORATIONS WOULD COVER LESS THAN HALF OF 'MEDICARE FOR ALL'S' COSTS

In advance of the last debate by Democratic presidential candidates, Americans for Tax Reform released a video compilation of Warren’s middle-class tax dodges. It shows Warren dodging the question on at least 17 different occasions, all around the country. During the after the debate, she dodged the question another eight times.

Big media names on the left are growing exasperated as Warren refuses to level with them.

“Why don’t you want to answer the question?” said MSNBC’s Chris Matthews after trying to get an answer out of her on seven times in a row. Finally, he threw in the towel and said: “I’m not getting anywhere.”

During an interview with Stephen Colbert, Warren was asked: “How are you going to pay for it? Are you going to raise the middle-class taxes?""

As Warren ramped up her usual long-winded dodge, Colbert cut her off and said: “I've listened to these answers a few times before, and I just want to make a parallel suggestion for you about how you might defend the taxes that perhaps you're not mentioning.""

Even Warren’s Democratic primary opponents are finally calling her out. The day after the last debate, former Vice President Joe Biden said her evasiveness is raising questions about “whether or not she’s going to be candid and honest with the American people.”

Warren fashions herself a serious policy person who will level with the American people. But she’s just another tax-and-spend liberal who has a problem telling the truth.

As it turns out, Americans know they already pay enough in taxes. They also know the games Democrats play with tax rhetoric: A promise during the campaign to only raise taxes on a tiny part of the very wealthiest Scrooge McDucks.

But once in office, the Democratic politicians “discover” by golly that they, in fact, will be imposing tax increases on nearly everyone.

Warren has extraordinarily expensive big plans, funded courtesy of your wallet. Her plans will intrude into every aspect of American life.

It’s no wonder Warren has already endorsed a long list of tax increases including a carbon dioxide tax – a new national energy tax that will drastically increase costs for Americans.

A carbon tax is so toxic with voters that even the 2016 Hillary Clinton presidential campaign purposefully steered clear of it. Her campaign wrote an internal memo noting that a carbon tax would “disproportionately impact low-income households.”

Millions of low- and middle-income households would again be stuck paying the Obamacare individual mandate tax. Utility bills would go up in all 50 states as a direct result of the corporate income tax increase.

And when is that future? It was a 31-year wait between the bipartisan tax reform act of 1986 and the Republican-only Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017.

Will America wait another 30 years?

Both parties have strongly held and public positions on “what is to be done,” but neither party can enact their vision until they win the trifecta — one-party control of the House, Senate and White House. Even a narrow majority in the House and Senate suffices as budget reconciliation rules allow a simple majority in the Senate to enact tax reform without the threat of a filibuster. The limit placed on reconciliation legislation is that after a stated period of time — Republicans picked 10 years in 2001 and 2017 — any tax cuts vanish unless they are “paid for” with real budget reductions or real tax hikes.

Republican tax reforms in 1981, 1986, 1997, 2001 and 2003, and 2017 focused on reducing tax rates. The next Republican tax cut/tax reform will be more of the same.

One cannot fund much of the Democratic Party’s announced spending plans by just taxing the rich.

A Republican Congress would make the Trump tax cuts permanent, lower the corporate rate to 15 percent per Trump’s original plan and index capital gains to inflation to increase the value of stocks inside everyone’s IRA and 40l(k) — the target audience is the 100 million Americans with such savings accounts. (It polls off the charts for undecided voters.) The Republican focus will be on increasing economic growth to reduce the demand for welfare spending and increase revenue through higher employment and higher wages. They will point to the new census data that shows the real median household income has increased $4,144 since Trump’s election (compared with a $400 gain in the eight George W. Bush years and $1,000 in the seven-and-a-half post-recession Barack Obama years) and the falling unemployment numbers. September’s 3.5 percent unemployment is the lowest in 50 years.

The Democrats have also telegraphed their punches.

Their stated goals are to tax energy to discourage its use, tax wealth to reduce inequality and increase total tax take to pay for their plans to dramatically increase federal spending.

Every major Democratic 2020 presidential candidate has promised to repeal the entire Republican tax cut of 2017. Immediately. And to impose a carbon tax with an automatic increase that allows the tax to be low pain at first and then ramp up without any annoying public votes on each jump in the tax.

How high will the carbon tax go? If it has to pay for Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s Green New Deal, that could add up to more than the entire current federal budget of $4.4 trillion.

If one paid only for “Medicare for All,” it requires $32 trillion over a decade, almost doubling the cost of the federal government.

Nineteen times in television interviews, Elizabeth Warren has refused to answer if her plans would raise any middle-income Americans’ taxes. Can the rich be made to pay for her plans? Confiscating 100 percent of the income of anyone earning more than $500,000 would raise $14.3 trillion over a decade. That projection does require a questionable assumption that those so expropriated would continue to work after year one.

One cannot fund much of the Democratic Party’s announced spending plans by just taxing the rich. So why the focus on a (possibly unconstitutional, considering the income tax required by the 16th Amendment) wealth tax?

Magicians refer to it as misdirection or legerdemain. Talk all day about taxing the rich so that the middle class will object less when they are saddled with an energy tax. This is the European model.

European nations have much larger public sectors than we do in the United States. They fund it with the value-added tax as high as 20 percent of almost everything one buys. This is a dramatically regressive tax. The energy tax is a VAT on training wheels. Over time the energy taxes being discussed would not raise enough revenue to fund Medicare for All or the Green New Deal or any significant part of them. The “base” of the tax will inevitably be widened to all products — possibly keeping the energy tax higher than the tax on “everything” to maintain the sense that it is an environmental project.

Warren’s wealth tax of 2 percent on those with $50 million in their lifetime savings and 3 percent on those with more than $1 billion in assets would raise $2.75 trillion over a decade. This could be a more significant revenue generator if the government reduced the thresholds. The personal income tax was introduced in 1916 with a top rate of 7 percent hitting those earning more than $11 million in today’s dollars. The threshold was soon reduced and the rate increased dramatically and permanently.

The Washington Post highlighted Warren’s twin to the wealth tax — the exit tax to keep those who have created a great deal of lifetime savings from leaving the nation. Twelve European nations have imposed an exit tax in recent years and eight have repealed them. There were also exit taxes in Weimar Germany, Rhodesia and South Africa.

Of the “solutions” Elizabeth Warren is touting on the campaign trail, her proposal to spend $85 billion federal dollars on government-owned broadband is the most laughable. Government-owned broadband networks (GONs) are a tried and failed experiment.

It seems Warren is not the only politician uninterested in learning from the dozens of cautionary GON tails that have piled up over the years. Elected officials in the city of Redding, California recently agreed to spend $30,000 tax dollars on a “study” of the feasibility of a GON.

For much less than $30,000, one could take a train to Chattanooga, Tennessee and learn where a GON leads. Chattanooga received a $50 million loan from the city’s electric power division, $162 million in local revenue bonds, and a one-time $111.5 million subsidy from the federal government. The return on investment for this GON has been so poor that it’s estimated to take more than 680 years to break even.

Proponents of GONs often try to distract from these facts with claims that Chattanooga’s network has created jobs and been a boon to the local economy. However, a 2019 independent assessment by the Phoenix Center – a Washington, D.C.-based think-tank – finds otherwise.

The report, The Rewards of Municipal Broadband: An Economic Analysis of the Labor Market, concluded, “[W]e find almost no statistically significant effects for a wide range of important labor market variables, with the possible exception of a reduction in labor force participation. “Employment status, wages, information technology employment, self-employment, and business income appear unaffected by the introduction of a government-owned broadband network.”

One could also buy a train ticket to Provo, Utah for much less than $30,000 to learn what happened to its GON, iProvo. When iProvo was first started back in 2004, proponents claimed it could be built for $39.5 million. Including bond interest, however, this amount ballooned to almost $67 million.

By 2011, after iProvo managed to rack up $10 million in operating losses, the city tried to bail it out by charging a $3.35 tax on the monthly electric bills of all households – including those that were not using the network. Two years later, iProvo was sold to Google for $1 and taxpayers were left on the hook for $3.2 million in bond payments over 20 years.

The City of Redding is headed down this same path. According to the report included in the council agenda, the city’s network may be funded by charging all citizens a monthly rate regardless of their interest in using the city’s network.

Redding thinks they can minimize that by operating a so-called “Open Access” system and leasing space on their network to private internet service providers. Good idea? Well, this is exactly what iProvo tried. High-quality providers were not interested in the deal, customer service suffered, and consumers cancelled iProvo subscriptions.

Redding already has access to fast internet speeds thanks to the private sector, and government monopolies have a sorry history of failure. Britain pre-thatcher. Eastern Europe before the wall came down.

Rather than pouring millions of hard earned tax dollars into a GON, Redding officials should focus their efforts on getting government out of the way and allowing the private sector to thrive.",2,https://townhall.com/columnists/grovernorquist/2019/10/08/government-broadband-is-a-disaster-for-taxpayers-n2554368
261,Norquist,Grover,foxbusiness,"How are middle-income Americans doing two and a half years after President Trump took office?

Better than ever.

The real median household income — the household income where half of Americans earn more and half earn less, or the dead center — is now at a record high $65,084.

This is an increase of $4,114 in real 2019 dollars since Trump took office.

How does this compare with Barack Obama’s time in office? In the seven and a half years after the recession ended in July 2009, the real median household income increased by the grand total of less than $1,000.

Because the median income rose about $400 in the Bush years and fell roughly $400 in the first six months of Obama -- the even more depressing takeaway is that from the first day of George W. Bush’s administration to the last day of Obama’s the median income increased about $1,000.

This explains why voters – particularly middle class voters — were in a sour mood in November 2016. Trump promised to change the policies that up until then led to 16 years of little growth in the average incomes.

These numbers come from the Census Bureau’s monthly surveys and were recently published by Sentier Research.

In just two and a half years, these Americans have seen a $4,000 pay raise in real, after inflation dollars, and a tax cut of between $1,400 and $2,900. - -Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform

But it gets better.

The Heritage Foundation calculates that the average American household benefited from a $1,400 tax cut, thanks to the GOP-enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. And if your household included a married couple with two children, then the tax cut was $2,900

262,Norquist,Grover,washingtonexaminer,"The fast-approaching gubernatorial elections in Kentucky, Mississippi, and Louisiana will determine if these states will build upon the economic growth from the federal tax cuts and regulatory reform.

Of these states, Mississippi is the only one without an incumbent on the ballot. Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves, who is a Republican, is running against Attorney General Jim Hood to succeed Gov. Phil Bryant, a Republican who will be termed out of office this year.

Reeves and Bryant worked together in 2016 to deliver the largest tax cut in Magnolia State history, and Reeves has made clear that he will continue this pro-taxpayer record as governor. Reeves has promised the taxpayers across Mississippi, in writing, that if elected, he will oppose and veto all tax increases. Hood refuses to make this same commitment to Mississippi taxpayers, indicating that tax hikes will be on the table if he is elected. Election Day in Mississippi is Nov. 5.

Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin, a Republican, is running for his second term against Attorney General Andy Beshear. As with Reeves in Mississippi, Bevin has fought all efforts to raise taxes. He vetoed a $400 million tax hike last year that was unfortunately overridden by the legislature. Election Day in Kentucky, like Mississippi, is Nov. 5.

Meanwhile, in Louisiana, Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, is seeking reelection with a record that is very different from that of Reeves and Bevin. He said he would not raise taxes when he ran for governor in 2015.

Edwards won. Then he raised taxes. A lot.

The first $1.5 billion tax hike imposed by Edwards came in 2016 in the form of a “temporary” 25% sales tax increase. The state sales tax rate was increased from 4% to 5%. That tax increase, the largest in Pelican State history, was supposed to expire on June 30, 2018. Predictably, that tax hike has been more permanent than originally advertised.

Edwards called three special sessions in 2018, costing taxpayers more than $1.5 million in total at an average of $42,921 per day, until enough lawmakers eventually agreed to renew $0.45 of the “temporary” penny sales tax hike. This tax increase, which amounts to roughly $465 million a year, will remain on the books until June 30, 2025.

Unfortunately for Louisianians, the sales tax renewal was not the only tax hike Edwards demanded in 2018. Without legislative approval, he also imposed a more than $300 million income tax hike.

Louisiana is one of a handful of states that allows taxpayers to deduct their federal taxes when calculating their income for state tax purposes. Due to this policy, the federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which reduced federal income taxes for 90% of taxpayers, resulted in an unintended tax hike at the state level in Louisiana.

Edwards could have easily prevented this income tax hike by enacting rate-reducing tax reform, such as the reforms done by Republican Govs. Kim Reynolds of Iowa and Nathan Deal of Georgia, to ensure their constituents were able to benefit from their entire federal tax cut. But Edwards took the cash.

While Edwards was busy raising taxes in Louisiana, practically every other state in the region has been reducing them. In addition to the tax cuts enacted by Bryant in Mississippi with the help of Reeves, governors in Texas, Arkansas, Georgia, and Florida have all enacted tax cuts in recent years.

As such, it is not surprising to learn that Louisiana is the only state in the South that has been missing out on the job growth fueled by federal tax cuts and regulatory reforms. From July 2018 to July 2019, Louisiana lost 1,000 jobs, making it the only state in the entire country to have lost jobs during that time period.

During this same time period, Texas gained 323,300 jobs, Oklahoma gained 14,500, Arkansas gained 12,100, Mississippi gained 19,000, Alabama gained 12,100, and Florida gained 227,200.

Edward’s dismal record has attracted two major Republican challengers: businessman Eddie Rispone and Congressman Ralph Abraham. Primary Day in Louisiana is Oct. 12, and under Louisiana’s jungle primary system, all candidates, regardless of party, will appear on the same ballot. Unless one candidate wins more than half of the vote, the top two will go to a runoff on Nov. 16.

The gubernatorial elections this fall will determine what the next four years will have in store for Kentucky, Mississippi, and Louisiana. Will these states build upon the growth that has stemmed from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act by enacting tax relief of their own, or will they raise taxes and expand the role of government at the expense of jobs, wages, and opportunity?

Federalism, a founding principle of our nation, is still a good idea. It allows the states to be laboratories of democracy and to compete for citizens, investment and job-creating businesses. Different state policies help the nation see what works and what does not work.

In the area of cannabis regulation, public preferences are trending toward some kind of decriminalization or legal status in many states. But not in all states.

Congress shouldn’t have federal laws gutting the ability of states to experiment. The best way to have a conversation about how cannabis should be treated is to have the 50 states experiment and learn from the results.

Unfortunately, the federal government does interfere with state experimentation on cannabis policy through heavy banking and tax regulations.

There are now enough states with legalized cannabis -- 22 states have legalized medical use and 11 states plus the District of Columbia have legalized non-medical use -- that banking for these businesses should not be a stumbling block maintained by Congress.

Today, most banks will not allow state-legal cannabis businesses to deposit money into bank accounts because of federal prohibition. This makes it extremely difficult for these companies to pay electric bills, leases, and other expenses. It also forces them to hold large sums of cash, leaving them more vulnerable to robberies.

With a total of 33 states and the District on the books with some level of legalized cannabis and more expected to come on board through ballot initiatives, including Florida, Arizona, Missouri, New Jersey, New York and Ohio, this discrimination against the cannabis industry needs to go. People need to be able to bank in local banks and not have a cash-only business, but a business where you can use credit cards and checks – for safety and security reasons. These are legitimate businesses. They are not money launderers or drug smugglers.

But if Congress doesn’t solve the banking problem now, these businesses could be a target for illicit activity. Cash-only businesses are notorious for being used to launder money or for being robbed.

Conflicts between federal and state law not only create an inability to safely store capital, but also produce burdensome regulations and extortionary tax rates that put the cannabis industry at a serious disadvantage compared to other sectors of the economy.

In spite of unfavorable federal headwinds, the cannabis industry is growing. In 2018, legal cannabis sales were $10.8 billion nationwide, a 34% increase from the previous year. The legal cannabis industry now supports more than 211,000 full-time jobs. This growth isn’t included in Bureau of Labor Statistics numbers on job and economic growth because the industry isn’t legally recognized at the federal level. But that doesn’t mean the growth isn’t there and that it won’t continue.

There is good news. Congress is preparing to take action on the SAFE Banking Act of 2019, a bipartisan bill that would allow cannabis companies to bank safely, by providing federal protections for banks that work with state-legal cannabis companies. First introduced by Ed Perlmutter (D-Colo.), the bill now has 206 cosponsors in the House of Representatives and 33 cosponsors in the Senate, sponsored by Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) and Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.). This bill would solve the safety and security problems resulting from companies’ inability to safely store capital.

There are still issues for Congress to address when it comes to cannabis. Specifically, section 280E of the tax code prevents businesses connected to “illegal” drug sales from using ordinary and necessary deductions. This means that state-legal cannabis businesses across the nation are unfairly discriminated against and even face income tax rates as high as 90 percent.

In addition to providing well-paying jobs, a secured American cannabis industry will erode the market share currently held by the Mexican cartels.

Meanwhile, if a state says no cannabis legalization, then a state says no. But when they do say yes, then it should be respected. Congress doesn’t have to decide that cannabis prohibition was completely wrong at all times and in all places to recognize there’s no reason to have these additional impediments on a legal business in a state.

Passage of the SAFE Banking Act isn’t the end of the line. Cannabis companies will continue to face scrutiny, federal interference, and an imbalanced regulatory climate. However, the bill is a positive step for federalism, safety, and the economy.",2,https://townhall.com/columnists/grovernorquist/2019/09/24/draft-n2553582
264,Norquist,Grover,utahpolicy,"Guest opinion: 'Tax reform' won’t solve Utah’s budget problem

Utah state government has several problems. It spends too much money, and taxes are too high and poorly designed, so they slow economic growth.

Unfortunately for taxpayers, fixing these problems is made more difficult by two bad decisions Utah made back in 1931.

First, Utah chose to impose a state income tax. To date, nine states avoided that mistake. And those nine no income tax states – which include Texas, Florida, and Tennessee – attract businesses, jobs, and talent.

Second, Utah voted to silo all state income tax into spending on “education.” This means the most powerful lobby in Utah – the teacher’s union – is an opponent of all pro-growth reductions in the state income tax burden.

Due to this silly arrangement, recent claims that Utahns are starting to purchase fewer goods and more services – which are not subject to the state sales tax – have been causing some panic, as many wonder if government spending programs will have to reduced or eliminated in the future.

Undoubtedly, there are ways to make Utah run on fewer tax dollars. But lawmakers have a remarkable inability to cut spending, so many are rallying around another “solution.” Net tax hikes disguised as tax reform.

The Tax Restructuring and Equalization Task Force was created at the end of the 2019 legislative session following the failure of the House Bill 441, also known as the Utah Tax Equalization and Reduction Act. HB 441 would have applied the state sales taxes to services – lots of services – and reduced the sales tax rate, though not very much. Had HB 441 been implemented, it would have resulted in a massive net tax hike.

HB 441 was also a tough sell politically, though that should not have been a surprise. Florida Governor Bob Martinez learned that lesson back in 1987, when he enacted a 5% tax on services, including advertising, legal fees, construction, accounting, pest control, and architecture.

Martinez subscribed to the belief that “modernizing” the code to tax services was the only way to put the state on firm financial footing, but as he quickly learned, taxpayers disagreed. Polls found that almost eight in 10 voters opposed the new tax and Gov. Martinez’s popularity plummeted.

Less than six months later, Gov. Martinez called for a special session to repeal the services tax. Unfortunately for Gov. Martinez, the damage was already done, and he ended up losing his re-election bid to a Democrat in 1991.

Just last year, Arizona voters reminded politicians just how unpopular services taxes are. On November 6, 2018, Proposition 126, the Prohibit New or Increases Taxes on Services Initiative, which prohibits the state and local governments in Arizona from imposing new taxes or increasing existing tax rates on services, was approved overwhelmingly, capturing just over 64 percent of the vote.

While Utah’s tax task force has made clear that HB 441 is not the starting point of their discussion, their assignment to “address Utah’s outdated tax structure” is likely to land them in a similar spot.

The allegedly shrinking sales tax base is not even the real issue. Utah has a revenue allocation problem. This year, Utah experienced a $1 billion surplus, but because that revenue came from the income tax, under present law it can only be spent on “education.”

The arbitrary requirement that all income taxes must be spent on public education turns the state teachers union in to a lobby for higher income taxes and certainly into an opponent of reducing the state income tax. Somehow nine states manage to run their government without any income tax. Utah’s 5% income tax rate is no longer considered low. Heck, for 2019, Massachusetts flat tax rate is being reduced from 5.10% to 5.05%.

Tax policy should fund appropriate spending and avoid slowing economic growth. Income taxes are the greatest drag on job creation and investment. The sequestering of funds from the income tax to the education lobby is a big mistake. Failure to address this issue will drive further errors.

265,Norquist,Grover,washingtontimes,"ANALYSIS/OPINION:

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is surrendering to the radical, socialist wing of the Democratic Party on health care, according to her new, $32 trillion drug-pricing proposal leaked last week.

The Pelosi plan takes a sledgehammer to the Medicare system at the expense of patients, innovators and free enterprise and puts the U.S. health care system firmly on a pathway toward Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s and Sen. Bernie Sanders-style socialized medicine.

The proposal empowers government bureaucrats to set the prices of the top 250 prescription medicines. If a manufacturer does not agree with this price or refuses to “negotiate,” the government will hit it with a 75 percent excise tax on the gross sales of a drug from the previous year — not a 75 percent tax on profits, but a 75 percent tax on sales.

The pan would also impose foreign price controls on American drugs by forcing manufacturers to calibrate prices of lifesaving medicine to those of half-a-dozen nations from Australia to Germany.

The bill would impose a retroactive inflationary penalty for drugs covered under Medicare Parts B and D. This retroactivity (which goes back to 2016) is particularly egregious because it would punish manufacturers for past decisions made, the U.S. Constitution’s prohibition on ex post facto laws be damned.

The Pelosi plan does not constitute a good-faith effort to negotiate lower prescription drug prices. Instead, the proposal represents a giant step toward government controlling the means of production within the pharmaceutical industry — a textbook example of state socialism.

Medical innovation only exists because manufacturers are able to invest significant time and money in research and development. This is especially important to senior citizens, whose quality of life is often governed by access to lifesaving medicine.

On average, it takes more than a decade to bring a new drug to market. Of all the experimental drugs under development, 90 percent do not receive approval from the Food and Drug Administration and never come to market. In 2016 alone, American drug companies invested $90 billion for therapy research and development of drugs, more than three times the R&D money spent by the National Institutes of Health.

This process is inherently risky — more than 150 experimental Alzheimer’s therapies have been tried over the past 20 years. Despite these challenges, American innovators continue striving toward a cure for Alzheimer’s. This persistent search for a cure contributes significantly to the estimated $300 billion in annual costs associated with the disease.

Prescription drugs comprise just 14 percent of health care spending. Hospital services comprise 30 percent of health care spending, and is growing at a faster rate than pharmaceutical care.

The United States is a world leader and accounts for almost 60 percent of medical innovation in the world.

This innovation means more lifesaving and life-preserving medicines, and contributes to a strong U.S. economy and supports high-paying jobs across the country.

Mrs. Pelosi’s plan to impose punitive taxes, foreign price controls and retroactive penalties would cause research on drugs to fight Alzheimer’s and other diseases to come to a screeching halt.

Mrs. Pelosi’s plan helps achieve the left’s real goal — complete government takeover of the nation’s health care system. If Mrs. Pelosi and the left succeed in passing this bill, it will not be the last health care measure they pass that will dramatically increase spending and taxes, limit choice and access, and put control of personal decisions in the hands of bureaucrats. Over time, they will try to take employer-provided health care away from over 150 million Americans. The majority of House Democrats already support this step.

Speaker Pelosi’s draft plan for prescription drugs is an unabashed attempt to impose greater government control on the health care system. The Pelosi plan will wreck scientific innovation and ultimately harm the people who rely today or tomorrow upon new drugs to save their lives and those of their loved ones.

266,Norquist,Grover,washingtonexaminer,"On Election Day 2016, President Trump offered an unequivocal statement on how our elections should be run: “There’s something really nice about the old paper ballot system,” he told Fox News. “You don’t worry about hacking.”

Trump’s view is increasingly becoming the consensus position. There’s growing agreement that the United States needs action to ensure verifiable elections with paper ballots and audits — as well as to patch cybersecurity vulnerabilities and to upgrade dangerously old election infrastructure.

Leading Republican lawmakers, including the chairs of the Senate Judiciary and Intelligence Committees and the leader of the House Freedom Caucus, have advocated strongly for this agenda. Top Democrats in the House have come around to the position as well. And as of this past month, even the CEO of a major election machine vendor — a player with the most at stake in paperless systems — expressed this view.

So here’s the question: Why hasn’t Congress yet passed legislation to secure America’s elections from foreign interference? It’s up to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and his colleagues to ensure we take action in time for 2020.

The risks are now clear. The Department of Homeland Security has notified 21 states that their election systems have been probed by overseas hackers. This isn’t just another disputed Russia issue. Looming threats could be from China, North Korea, Iran, extremist hacker groups like Anonymous or other enemies, foreign or domestic.

American elections are a soft target. Leading computer security experts have studied a range of electronic voting infrastructure — including touch screen machines, optical scanners, electronic poll books, and registration database systems — and found significant vulnerabilities that could enable a range of hackers to threaten election integrity. A survey of over 250 election officials in 37 different US states discovered that a strong majority need to replace their outdated voting machines, but most did not have adequate funds to do so.

There’s a plain and simple solution to safeguard our elections: paper ballots and cost-effective audits to check results. In the last Congress, Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina, co-chair of the House Freedom Caucus, introduced a bill to standardize these sensible reforms. Meadows’ PAPER Act enabled cost-sharing with states to replace vulnerable electronic equipment with new systems that produce a voter-verified paper record.

The Freedom Caucus bill also laid the groundwork for states to implement risk-limiting audits — processes to check small and random samples of paper ballots to quickly provide assurance about election results. Rep. Rodney Davis, the lead Republican on the House Administration Committee, just released a plan to provide new security funding to states . Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma, had a far-reaching piece of legislation focused on funding and prudent standards — the Secure Elections Act — that was gaining serious bipartisan momentum at the end of the last Congress.

This summer, the Senate Appropriations Committee has an opportunity to apportion funds for essential security upgrades to states that cannot currently afford them. We believe Senate Republicans should lead the charge — so long as funding is offset to be deficit-neutral and so long as legislation stipulates that no funding can go to insecure electronic voting systems.

Congress made a down-payment on election security funding last year and, according to estimates from the Election Assistance Commission, more than 85% of those funds will be spent on replacing vulnerable systems in time for 2020. But a range of states — including Pennsylvania, Alabama, Kentucky, Indiana, and Oklahoma — still have critical unfunded election security reform needs.

As conservatives, we are naturally skeptical of any new government spending or any federal actions that could usurp state and local responsibilities. Yet it’s time for lawmakers to accept that this is a matter of national security. Just as federal agencies in national security assist state law enforcement in dealing with terrorist threats, the federal government has a role in supporting states and addressing election security risks, through federal funding, coupled with increased security coordination. Dollar for dollar, these are some of the most cost-effective investments we can make in America's security. Informed estimates show that we can replace all insecure paperless systems in the nation for close to the cost of a single F-22 fighter jet.

Republicans — as advocates of accountable government and national defense — should lead on election security. The technical solutions are clear. The political will is present. It’s time for Senate Republicans to act.

267,Norquist,Grover,twincities,"It is wrong to tax inflation.

Last week, President Donald Trump agreed. He endorsed the idea of indexing capital gains so that no American would be taxed on the inflation gain on the sale of a house, land, a small business, stocks or assets of any kind. Trump said, “Many people like indexing, and it can be done very simply. It can be done directly by me.”

One day later, Trump told a press gagglethat he’s “not looking to do indexing. … But if I wanted to do it, I believe I could.”

The press gasped at the sudden shift from “I will” to “I won’t.” Greenland was ours for longer. But those who have worked to end the taxation of inflation in capital gains for almost 30 years noticed what did not change. The president stated and restated his view that his administration could define the cost of an asset for tax purposes as cost plus inflation. No vote by Congress required. This could happen whenever Trump chose.

That is a game-changer.

The present capital gains tax is particularly brutal to older Americans who bought a home, built a small business or invested in the stock market before the hyperinflation of the late 1970s. Older Americans who have lived through many years of even modest inflation are increasingly paying taxes on mostly imaginary “gains.”

Those damaged most? Older voters. Rural voters. Midwest voters. Homeowners. Self-employed small-businessmen and women. Aka: Trump voters in swing states. Inflation is a larger part of the capital gains taxes they pay.

How important would this change be for Americans?

If you bought a share of IBM stock in 1970 for $14.81 and sold it today for $134.42, you would pay $28.47 in capital gains taxes. Eliminating the inflation over that period reduces your tax bill by 70 percent.

Texas farmland averaged $722 an acre in 1986. In 2019, that land was nominally worth $2,815, for a capital gains tax owed of $482. Take out inflation and the tax falls to $247 per acre — a 50 percent reduction.

Ending the taxation on inflation for capital gains would immediately increase the value of every asset — land, homes, stocks, business — in the United States. A signature by the Treasury Secretary would make the United States wealthier. For the few? Well, 99.5 million U.S. individuals own mutual funds, and about 78 million Americans own homes. There are millions of farmers and ranchers. More than 30 million small businesses. The stale rhetoric of tax cuts benefiting only the “1 percenters” rings hollow.

Twenty-four million American households had a capital gains filing in 2016. And 56 percent of those households earned less than $100,000 per year. More than 80 percent earned less than $200,000.

The other gain from indexation is deregulatory. Dan Clifton of Strategas Research Partners points out that trillions of dollars of land and buildings are held by corporations but not sold solely because of the heavy inflation tax. End that tax, and companies would offload “sticky capital” that remains underutilized. Those assets would be liberated to be put to highest and best use — a massive increase in productivity nationwide. And the deficit? Clifton predicts “a gusher of revenue from trillions of dollars’ worth in older corporate assets sold as quickly as the contracts can be written.” Scott Hodge, president of the Tax Foundation, told this writer that the Tax Foundation’s model “and every model I am aware of” misses this seismic shift because they assume (counter-factually) that all capital is perfectly allocated already.

Trump says he’s “not looking to do indexing.”

He will.

Economic growth has declined from 3 percent annually toward 2 percent: President Barack Obama’s average. Trump would like to increase growth. Four options. One, get the Fed to reduce interest rates. Two, get House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., to agree to a pro-growth tax cut. Three, win or end the trade war with China. And four, index capital gains. The first three depend on the cooperation of the Fed, Pelosi or China. After a while, Trump will refocus on the one lever solely under his control: indexation of capital gains.

Is Trump correct that he has the authority? Well, things have changed since 1992, when the George H.W. Bush administration decided it could not change the definition of “cost” from “historical cost” to “real cost.” In 2002, the Supreme Court ruled in Verizon vs. Federal Communications Commission that the word “cost” was “protean” and can be defined by regulators as they wish. Further, two months ago, in Kisor vs. Wilkie, the court reaffirmed the authority of federal agencies to interpret legislative language.

The Democratic presidential candidates will likely denounce the move and promise to rescind it. But this would allow all Americans to calculate exactly what they have to lose if a Democrat wins the presidency in 2020. More than 100 million Americans will note that the difference between Trump and the Democrats can be measured in thousands or tens of thousands of dollars. A powerful incentive to vote. Worth a ride to the polls.

Grover Norquist is president of Americans for Tax Reform. He wrote this column for the Washington Post.",2,https://www.twincities.com/2019/08/29/grover-norquist-indexing-capital-gains-helps-more-than-the-rich/
268,Norquist,Grover,realclearmarkets,"The Bureau of Labor Statistics earlier this month released its July jobs numbers confirming that we remain in the midst of the longest economic expansion in U.S. history. The expansion is clearly paying off for Americans of all walks of life.

Just look at the mounting evidence.

Unemployment is at a 50-year low. Family incomes are on the rise, increasing by 3.2 percent over the past year. Businesses are investing more in our local communities, creating 2.6 million jobs just last year. Perhaps this is why “most Americans remain confident about the U.S. economy and in their own financial situation,” crediting many of the policies President Trump and the Republican-led Congress have championed, as a recent CBS News poll found.

Some policymakers in Washington are content to stop there. And some are bent on turning back the clock altogether.

But many are not interested in resting on our laurels or worse, forfeiting the progress that has already improved the lives of hardworking families across the country.

There is still much untapped potential across our economy, and we’re committed to unleashing it.

One such way to do that is by eliminating the unfair “inflation tax,” a practice that penalizes Americans of all walks of life – from workers saving for retirement to farmers and ranchers selling off a parcel of land to acquire capital for new equipment and machinery that would help grow their family business.

Here’s how the “inflation tax” works today. When a taxpayer sells a capital asset, they pay taxes on their gains—the difference between the basis and the sale price. Under current rules, Treasury determines the basis by looking at the sticker price at the time of purchase without consideration of the inflation-adjusted cost of the asset in today’s dollars.

So what does that mean for taxpayers? You end up being taxed on illusory income as the result of economy-wide price-level increases.

Imagine, for example, a taxpayer who purchased one share of Coca-Cola stock in 1998 for $32.38. If they sold the stock earlier this year at $48.13, they would have a nominal gain of $15.76 and be taxed $3.75. The inflation-adjusted basis in today’s dollars, however, would be $50.50. That means the taxpayer would have to pay $3.75 in taxes on a $2.38 loss. Even when a taxpayer experiences a real gain, the effective capital gains rate can easily double the statutory rate passed by Congress.

In other words, taxpayers are being punished for the mere existence of inflation. That’s why over the years, other provisions in the tax code, including income tax brackets, the standard deduction, and the Earned Income Tax Credit, account for the effects of inflation. Treating capital gains taxes the same way should be a no-brainer.

Of course some on the Left have a different take. Their entire expansive, big government agenda is based on raising your taxes. Indeed, when one of us sent a letter with 20 U.S. senators urging the administration to use its authority to make this change, the media seized the opportunity to amplify Democrats’ alarmist rhetoric, labeling the policy a tax cut for the one percent (where have we heard this false claim before?).

Last week, President Trump publicly repeated that he has the legal authority to make the change ending the taxation of inflation in capital gains by administrative action. Two recent Supreme Court decisions in 2002 and 2019 make that clear. The president did express concern that Democrats would attack the reform as only helping the wealthy. But history and basic economic facts make it clear that this action would benefit tens of millions of Americans directly through more jobs and income.

Here are some points Democrats conveniently fail to mention.

The Republican-led Tax Cuts and Jobs Act actually made the tax code more progressive. Millionaires saw the share of federal taxes they pay go up (from 19.3 to 19.8 percent), while those making less than $50,000 per year saw their share of federal taxes go down (from 4.4 to 4.1 percent).

Indexing capital gains to inflation continues that progress. In the near term, not only will this change directly benefit the 54 percent of Americans that own stocks, it will also benefit the 55 million Americans who own a 401k.

Over the longer term, a capital gains tax cut spurs the growth of new businesses, increases the wages of workers, enhances consumer purchasing power, and grows the economy at large, resulting in more overall gains to be taxed.

It’s no wonder the Democrats supported the policy in the past.

Even Senate Minority Leader Schumer said as a Member of the House in 1992 that “if we really want to increase growth, there are proposals that we can do. I would be for indexing all capital gains and savings and borrowing.”

We agree, and we urge the administration to do just that.",2,http://www.realclearmarkets.com/articles/2019/08/29/to_keep_the_economy_growing_index_capital_gains_to_inflation_103886.html
269,Norquist,Grover,startribune,"It is wrong to tax inflation.

Last week, President Donald Trump agreed. He endorsed the idea of indexing capital gains so that no American would be taxed on the inflation gain on the sale of a house, land, a small business, stocks or assets of any kind. Trump said, “Many people like indexing, and it can be done very simply. It can be done directly by me.”

One day later, Trump told a press gaggle that he’s “not looking to do indexing. … But if I wanted to do it, I believe I could.”

The press gasped at the sudden shift from “I will” to “I won’t.” Greenland was ours for longer. But those who have worked to end the taxation of inflation in capital gains for almost 30 years noticed what did not change. The president stated and restated his view that his administration could define the cost of an asset for tax purposes as cost plus inflation. No vote by Congress required. This could happen whenever Trump chose.

That is a game-changer.

The present capital gains tax is particularly brutal to older Americans who bought a home, built a small business or invested in the stock market before the hyperinflation of the late 1970s. Older Americans who have lived through many years of even modest inflation are increasingly paying taxes on mostly imaginary “gains.”

Those damaged most? Older voters. Rural voters. Midwest voters. Homeowners. Self-employed small-businessmen and women. Aka: Trump voters in swing states. Inflation is a larger part of the capital gains taxes they pay.

How important would this change be for Americans?

If you bought a share of IBM stock in 1970 for $14.81 and sold it today for $134.42, you would pay $28.47 in capital gains taxes. Eliminating the inflation over that period reduces your tax bill by 70%.

272,Norquist,Grover,ozy,"If the past is any guide … don’t hold your breath for a quick or easy fix.

How will the federal government react to the next recession? The safest answer to this question since 1929 has been: “It’ll make it worse, deeper, longer.” But that wasn’t always the case.

Remember the Great Recession of 1921? Between 1920 and 1921, gross national product fell by 24 percent, unemployment topped 15 percent, industrial production fell nearly 32 percent and wholesale prices fell by 20 percent.

Compare this to the milder but hysterically named “Great Recession” of 2007–09, when gross domestic product dropped by 2.4 percent (not 24 percent as in 1921). Unemployment reached 10 percent in 2009, nowhere near 15 percent, and prices fell 2.4 percent (not 20 percent).

Perhaps you don’t remember the 1921 Great Recession because President Warren G. Harding and his Republican House and Senate didn’t try to throw money at it, raise taxes, fix wages or prices or control credit. They did a pretty good approximation of “nothing.” Harding balanced the budget, unleashed no “stimulus spending” and kept interest rates at 5 percent from 1920 to 1921. Result: The downturn lasted just 18 months.

Panic does not become a recession or depression unless the government jumps in to fix things.

By 1923, unemployment was down to 2.4 percent, and real output had recovered — not unlike many of the “panics” in the decades before. The takeaway? Panic does not become a recession or depression unless the government jumps in to fix things.

Herbert Hoover and Franklin D. Roosevelt did a bipartisan tag team of tax, spend and regulate in reaction to the economy beginning to shrink in August 1929 and the collapse of the stock market on Black Thursday, Oct. 24, 1929. Hoover passed the protectionist Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act. In 1929, American exports totaled $5.5 billion but fell to $1.7 billion after 60 nations enacted counter-tariffs.

Hoover hiked government spending, which economist John Maynard Keynes suggested might work. From 1930 to 1931, the federal government’s share of the GNP increased by about a third. Price controls were placed on farmers, and unemployment topped 12 percent after all this fixing. And as a Parthian shot, Hoover enacted the Revenue Act of 1932, reducing tax exemptions, ending the earned income tax credit and hiking tax rates. The top rate rose from 25 to 65 percent. Corporate rates rose from 12 to north of 14 percent, and the death tax — imposed to fund the Civil War — was increased. A 10 percent gas tax was also imposed.

FDR arrived to do more of the same with similar results. He devalued the dollar by 40 percent, seized all gold held by Americans and established federal regulation of prices, wages and work hours. His reemployment agreement suggested a minimum wage, a 35-hour workweek for industrial workers and 40 hours for management.

FDR increased the top tax rate to 79 percent. Excise taxes were placed on alcohol, cigarettes, candy and soft drinks. His Agricultural Adjustment Act gave farmers subsidies, and 10 million acres of crops were pulled out of production, while 6 million pigs were slaughtered — all thanks to the government’s prowess in production planning.

Government spending surged, but so did unemployment while the economy continued to shrink. Never before or since has the government done so much to end a contraction. Never before or since has the recession lasted that long.

How long did the Great Depression last? Civilian unemployment did not fall below the 1929 level of 3.2 percent until 1943. The stock market did not regain its Jan. 1, 1929, level until January 1953. The economy did grow at 8 percent in 1939 after contracting 3.3 percent in 1938.

So what will the feds do in the next recession? What we have learned is that it depends very much on who is running the government.

The Democrats have 20 candidates running for president promising to replay the “reforms” of FDR. Pro-union labor laws. Higher tax rates. More spending. The Green New Deal could cost more than all current federal spending combined, which this year is $4.4 trillion.

This was FDR’s approach, and while it did not lead to economic growth, it did cement the Democratic Party into power in Congress for 60 years. Labor unions were forced onto much of the workforce. Union dues were recycled into Democratic Party coffers. Business, once a robust political player, was neutered as the Securities and Exchange Commission, Federal Communications Commission, Federal Trade Commission and a host of regulatory agencies held a Damoclean sword over businesses, enforcing submission. Between 1934 and 1994, Republicans won control of Congress, the House and Senate, only twice for a total of four years (1946–48 and 1952–54) of the sixty-year period. It was not very good economics, but it was wonderful politics for the Democratic Party.

Democrats today would react to any slowdown just as FDR did because it’s the route to controlling the state, not because they are unaware of the history of economic failure.

In 2012, Barack Obama insisted the George W. Bush tax cuts lapse for those earning more than $450,000 a year. The Congressional Budget Office certified that this would increase revenue by $620 billion over the next 10 years. A nice nest egg to spend on good stuff. But the CBO had to readjust its estimates due to slower growth. They had assumed hiking taxes on “the rich” would not slow growth. By 2017, the 12 revisions showed the federal government losing $3.1 trillion over a decade, not gaining $620 billion.

This suggests that plans by today’s Dems to pay for “everything” with taxes on the rich might not work as planned. (But the politics might.)

And Republican plans in the event of a recession? The Donald Trump Republican party has shown its hand. More tax cuts, less regulation, more energy production, attempts at spending restraint. History shows these tools work pretty well for workers. But before you get too complacent, Trump does have one arrow in his quiver that he borrowed from Hoover: tariffs.",2,https://www.ozy.com/opinion/history-shows-us-how-government-will-respond-to-next-downturn/96001

274,Norquist,Grover,washingtonexaminer,"A handful of politicians in red states are bizarrely pushing for taxpayer-funded “bullet trains” that seem like something right out of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s Green New Deal. Despite the fact that Americans consistently prefer to drive, fly, and use other modes of transportation, some officials in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama are still pushing for taxpayer-funded passenger trains in the Southeast.

Such trains have a history of failure. Amtrak’s Hoosier State Line between Indianapolis and Chicago just had its last trip on June 30. Residents were not satisfied with the experience of the government-run and taxpayer-subsidized train. Annual ridership collapsed by more than a thousand riders a year — losing about 10,000 riders over the last eight years.

So in April, Indiana lawmakers decided to stop throwing good money after bad, and opted to pull the plug on the $3 million state subsidy it had been providing for this passenger rail line. For context, the line operates on a $3.2 million annual budget, also getting yearly funds from county and city taxes along the route. Essentially, its funding was all subsidy, and almost no real customers.

Meanwhile, the Southern Rail Commission — a board made up of representatives from Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama that promotes passenger trains — is actively trying to revive an old Amtrak line that ran in the Southeast. Their proposal, sometimes called the Gulf Coast Rail Project, is to have two passenger trains run between New Orleans and Mobile.

It seems the SRC has forgotten that similar government-supported passenger trains connecting Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama were discontinued for reasons all too similar to the Hoosier State Line: They were slower, less convenient, and more expensive than other forms of transportation.

Including the $33 million recently given by the Federal Railroad Administration, the $10 million from Louisiana’s big-spending Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, and the $16 million promised by Mississippi’s Department of Transportation, it looks like the SRC has pulled together roughly $60 million in hard-earned taxpayer dollars for initial studies and a couple of up-front projects. The truth is that when added to the other rail infrastructure projects, as well as long term operational and maintenance costs for this line, it will likely end up costing taxpayers much more.

And all for what?

A study by the Gulf Coast Rail Project’s own rail carrier admits that this new line would attract just 26 riders per train. Considering a Megabus trip between New Orleans and Mobile, which costs around $14 per ticket, takes 2.5 hours and the same trip on the proposed passenger trains is estimated to take more than three hours, these findings are not very surprising.

Why do government expenses keep soaring? Why are taxes going up? Why is government productivity stagnant? Well, it’s this type of foolish cronyism that’s to blame.

Meet Jim Mathews, CEO and president of the Rail Passengers Association. He likes the idea of a heavily-subsidized, little-used rail line along the coast. He explains his philosophy:

We have to get away from this idea that Amtrak has to make a profit. It does not have to make a profit. Amtrak is not a profit-making entity. It is a government-supported enterprise funded with taxpayer dollars to serve a mission of mobility around the country.

But consumers lose when government throws money at “services” Americans are not willing to pay for. Taxpayers lose when they have to pay for politicians' bad ideas and pet projects. After all, everyone likes small children, but politicians are decidedly less popular. Why? Well, when kids play with trains they don’t spend taxpayer money, dig up the roads, or mess with traffic.

Passenger trains are low demand, money-losing projects. The SRC should kill the Gulf Coast Rail Project before any more taxpayer dollars are wasted.

276,Norquist,Grover,washingtonexaminer,"Ohio state lawmakers are on the verge of negotiating final, two-year budget legislation, after the Senate and House both passed competing budget bills. The great news is that both chambers want to reduce taxes.

The House proposed an income tax cut that would put over $100 million back in taxpayers’ pockets. The Senate bill does them one better, with further reductions in income taxes adding up to over $300 million in tax savings just in year one. More money in taxpayers’ pockets is always a good thing, but it is especially important in Ohio after a significant gas tax increase was enacted in the transportation budget earlier this year.

Estimated to bring in $830 million in year one, Ohio’s new gas tax will take effect July 1, likely right after the general budget legislation is passed. So legislators must pass as much tax relief as possible in the general budget to make up for the gas tax increase, lest constituents get slapped with a big bill.

They ought to start by removing some of the costly and misguided tax policies included in current budget proposals. For instance, the House budget makes changes to small-business tax deductions and also removes a 3% cap on their tax rate for income over $250,000. This would cost Ohio businesses and entrepreneurs over $1 billion in the end, according to the National Federation of Independent Businesses.

The House also hikes taxes on booking travel, imposing occupancy tax on service fees for online travel agent services such as Expedia, Travelocity, and others. Though for some (possibly crony) reason, the big hotel companies themselves are exempted.

This is an unnecessary tax hike, as these platforms already collect tax on the cost of a room. The House would be adding tax to service fees on top of what is already being paid. The result would hurt restaurants, shops, and local businesses by driving up costs for visitors – and Ohioans traveling within their home state.

In both plans, internet sales tax language requiring online marketplaces to collect and remit sales taxes will, perhaps unintentionally, ensnare ride-sharing. This means Ohioans will pay more for their next Lyft or Uber ride — all thanks to the sales tax.

This is a form of double taxation. Ride-sharing drivers are already paying income tax on their earnings, and now they will have to deal with sales tax too. This burden will only make life tougher for drivers and make traveling more expensive for consumers.

The budget also includes a misguided tax hike on vaping. E-cigarettes and vapor products are at least 95% less harmful than traditional combustible cigarettes. Driving up their costs keeps people smoking cigarettes and also risks shuttering small businesses in vape shops.

While removing these policies will help, the big relief is in income tax cuts. Legislators should push the Senate’s proposal, which offers more than $200 million in added savings compared to the House. Aside from tax policy, the Ohio Senate budget also includes a Trump-style regulatory reform rule that would require two regulations be trimmed for any one new regulation that is introduced.

This would be a big win, since Ohio ranked behind only New York and Illinois in number of regulations on the books out of 37 states analyzed by the libertarian-leaning Mercatus Center. A 2015 Pacific Research Institute analysis of the best state regulatory environments for small business shows Ohio at a mediocre 27th, while neighboring Illinois ranked far better.

School choice is also a winner in the Senate plan, with millions in additional support for school choice programs. More families in Ohio will have the chance to control where their children go to school, giving them a shot at a brighter future.

So it’s clear if Ohio legislators build off of the state Senate’s tax cuts and make some improvements, this budget will be a huge win for taxpayers.

278,Norquist,Grover,sfchronicle,"U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-San Francisco, recently traveled to Boston to accept the 2019 John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award, which has been given out by the JFK Presidential Library since 1990.

“The John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award was created in 1989 by members of President Kennedy's family to honor President John F. Kennedy and to recognize and celebrate the quality of political courage that he admired most,” the JFK Library website says of the award’s origin and goal. “The award recognizes a public official (or officials) at the federal, state or local level whose actions demonstrate the qualities of politically courageous leadership in the spirit of ‘Profiles in Courage,’ President Kennedy’s 1957 Pulitzer prize-winning book, which recounts the stories of eight U.S. Senators who risked their careers by embracing unpopular positions for the greater good.”

A review of the list of past JFK Profile in Courage Award recipients shows an interesting trend: when the JFK Profile in Courage award is not given to a progressive or liberal Democrat, it will often go to a Republican politician who recently raised taxes or betrayed their constituents in some other manner.

A look at the Republicans who won JFK Profile In Courage Award and why provides a case study documenting how much liberals admire tax-hiking Republicans. The basis of the “courage” award given to many Republicans over the years, it turns out, is lying to voters and caving to spending interests.

Ten years ago the JFK Profile In Courage Award went to California Assembly Speaker Karen Bass, Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg, both Democrats, and two of the four Republican California state legislators who helped facilitate what was the largest state tax hike in American history at the time it was enacted by then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2009.

Those two Republican state legislators, Sen. Dave Cogdill and Assemblyman Mike Villines, in exchange for their campaign pledge-breaking votes, could not “even point to the kind of meaningful reforms in state government that you would expect the Democrats to offer up in return for Republicans votes for massive income, sales and car taxes that will ... cost every family in California an average of well over $4,000,” Jon Fleischman, publisher of the California Flash Report, wrote at the time of the 2009 tax hike’s enactment.

One of the earliest JFK Profile in Courage Awards went to a famous Republican tax hiker in 1992, when it was awarded to then-Connecticut Gov. Lowell Weicker Jr. because he, according to the JFK Presidential Library, “shocked many residents of the state by proposing a first-time ever personal income tax as part of his fiscal year 1992 budget package.”

When Weicker enacted that income tax nearly three decades ago, he made Connecticut the last of the 41 states with an income tax to pass theirs. Weicker’s act ushered in a quarter century of further state tax hikes, economic decline and population out-migration from a state that used to serve as a tax haven for those looking to escape New York’s high tax rates.

Connecticut, thanks to Weicker’s legacy, demonstrates how once a new a tax is put in place, the rate tends to subsequently go in one direction: up. In 1991 Weicker signed into law the initial flat 4.5% state income tax. In the ensuing three decades, the rate has been raised many times and a progressive rate structure installed. Today, Connecticut has seven income tax brackets with a top rate of 6.99%, a 55% increase from the original rate enacted by Weicker.

What happened after Weicker imposed Connecticut’s income tax also demonstrates how new forms of taxation beget larger government. The imposition of Connecticut’s income tax in 1991 was followed by a noteworthy uptick in the size of state government.

The size of Connecticut government, using state spending as a percentage of GDP as the metric, is more than 32% larger today than it was the year the income tax was put in place by Weicker. When the income tax went into effect in 1992, state spending in Connecticut as a percentage of state GDP was 8.9%. As of last year state spending in Connecticut was 11.9% of state GDP, meaning that the size of Connecticut state government has grown by more than 22% since Weicker imposed Connecticut’s income tax.

The action that won Weicker his JFK Profile in Courage Award has done real damage to the Connecticut economy, has chased thousands of people and employers out of the Nutmeg State, and has made Connecticut less important to the national economy today than it was before state lawmakers enacted the state income tax.

Connecticut’s income tax first took effect in 1992, the same year that Americans booted President George H.W. Bush, another JFK Profile in Courage Award winner, from the White House in large part due his broken read-my-lips/no-new-taxes promise, widely recognized as among the most famous broken promises in American political history.

Even Republicans who try, but fail, to raise taxes have put themselves in the running for the JFK Profile in Courage Award. That’s what happened to former South Carolina Congressman Bob Inglis in 2015, when he won the award simply because he now lobbies for a carbon tax, a regressive levy that would disproportionally harm low-income households.

Former Congressman Carlos Curbelo, R-Fla., who lost re-election last November and now lobbies for a federal carbon tax, might not have a vote in Congress anymore, but he is certainly a contender to win a future JFK Profile in Courage Award. Frankly, he should be miffed he did not win it this year.

Perhaps the award committee can change it up next year so that both a Democrat and a Republican receive the award in 2020 and every year moving forward. The award given to the Democrat can continue to be called the JFK Profile in Courage Award, but the Republican will be given the JFK Profile in Taxpayer Betrayal Award. Based on history, that sounds fitting.

280,Norquist,Grover,thehill,"Stephen Moore Stephen MooreFormer Trump economic adviser praises 'blowout' jobs report As nation freezes, fossil fuels are keeping the lights and heat on Economist Moore says he's not sure US needs 'massive stimulus bill' MORE is a friend and a leader in the free market movement. He understands trade policy. “I am a free trader and I hate tariffs,” he declares in the first sentence of a recent opinion piece in The Hill. But he then goes on to endorse the use of tariffs to “negotiate” with China. We respectfully disagree that now is a good time for the United States to erect punitive trade barriers with China in an effort to “hit their vulnerable economy.” His aim is off. The people being hit by these punitive tariffs are Americans.

All trade wars are wars of choice. American tariffs are paid by American consumers. Chinese tariffs are paid by Chinese consumers. Tariffs are hurting our farmers and manufacturers who are seeing markets closed off, supply chains disrupted, and costs inflated by a trade war. China is the third largest export market for the United States. Americans sell more than $170 billion in goods and services in China, and exports had been growing over the past few years. This trade has added to our prosperity.

Americans are enriched by imports even more than by exports. “More exports increase wealth only because they allow Americans to buy more imports and give non-Americans greater incentives to invest” in the United States and to help grow our economy, the Mercatus Center has noted. Trade is not a one way street. Trade is people in China and people in the United States engaging in the voluntary exchange of goods and services to their mutual benefit, whether Americans are importing or exporting. Consumers are helped, not hurt, when companies in other countries choose to sell us goods that we want at an affordable price.

ADVERTISEMENT

While we certainly have legitimate concerns about abusive Chinese trade practices, including the theft of our intellectual property, these issues should be dealt with through international institutions such as the World Trade Organization, where the United States wins 85 percent of the cases it brings. This work requires a scalpel, but tariffs are a club. They hurt our efforts to address Chinese misbehavior when we impose them on key allies such as Canada, Mexico, Japan, and Europe. We should be creating a united front instead of alienating those with similar challenges.

Moore articulates this crucial point himself when he argues that “what free traders should be doing, if they want to be constructive, is to help the Trump administration” pass the United States Mexico Canada Agreement. But it is the president, not “free traders” and not Congress, who imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum on our closest partners. A prerequisite for approving the United States Mexico Canada Agreement is eliminating those tariffs, a step the Trump administration finally took this month.

This trade brinkmanship is a dangerous game. Some argue it is a risk we should be willing to take because there is light at the end of the tunnel. This is well intentioned yet strategically flawed. The Trump administration indeed deserves tremendous credit for our strong economy today, but this strength is no justification for imposing tariff policies that Americans, not the Chinese, end up paying for. The lessons of history demonstrate that a trade war between the two largest economies on the planet will do no good and plenty of harm. Even White House chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow Larry KudlowMORE acknowledged that “both sides will suffer” in a trade war.

Instead of ignoring the lessons of economics and history, we should learn from them. This time will not be different. Protectionist policies make everyone less well off. Trade enriches us. This is why we choose trade.

281,Norquist,Grover,washingtonexaminer,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats have a strategy to destroy the Trump legacy and defeat him in November 2020. It’s a trap that has worked once before.

President George H.W. Bush’s administration had no shortage of accomplishments. He managed the collapse of the Soviet Union. He drove Iraq out of Kuwait without getting stuck occupying it for a generation. He enhanced a 7-year economic boom started by President Ronald Reagan. At one point, his approval rating hit 89%.

And then, in November 1992, he lost re-election.

He didn’t just lose — he was humiliated. He was defeated by the little-known governor of Arkansas and won a smaller percentage of the vote (38%) than Goldwater had in his historic defeat.

How did this happen? It was simple. Democrats talked Bush into signing a tax hike.

Democrats framed it as a necessary move to reduce the deficit. To sell it, they promised to cut spending by $2 for every $1 of tax increases. To no one’s surprise, taxes were raised. But to the public’s dismay, federal spending actually increased, and increased by more than previously planned. All of the tax hike went towards new spending programs, and the deficit increased.

Bush’s tax hike ended his presidency. It slowed the economy and eclipsed the significance of all his previous accomplishments. Today, Bush’s presidency is best remembered for three infamous words from his campaign: “ Read my lips .”

Pelosi and Chuck Schumer have similar plans for President Trump.

This time, the tax hike they seek is not to “fix the deficit.” After Obama's extravagant stimulus and healthcare packages, Democrats are smart enough to know that the notion they care about deficits is laughable. This time they will do it for “infrastructure.” (That is a French word that means “everything except roads.”)

Once they’ve gotten Trump to agree to a tax-hike for infrastructure, Democrats will wield it as club and bash Trump as a hypocrite for raising taxes. They will take the additional revenue and spend it on everything other than building roads. Meanwhile, Trump’s popularity will plunge with his base for breaking his promise on taxes.

Trump is a better negotiator than George H.W. Bush. He should know the only interest Pelosi has in an infrastructure deal is using it to cripple his administration.

But Trump has a challenge. He campaigned on cutting taxes and he campaigned on an infrastructure overhaul.

The good news is that there’s bipartisan legislation in Congress that funds infrastructure spending without hiking taxes. We can have more roads and bridges without increasing taxes.

Introduced by House Freedom Caucus and Congressional Black Caucus members, the Generating American Income and Infrastructure Now Act would authorize the Department of Agriculture to sell off distressed assets and use the proceeds to fund infrastructure investments in urban and rural communities living below the poverty line.

Though the bill only involves loans in the Department of Agriculture, the agency has a whopping $155 billion in non-guaranteed debt on its books. Lawmakers can and should use the GAIIN Act as a blueprint to go agency-by-agency, selling off loans to fund infrastructure.

For perspective, federal agencies currently hold more than $2 trillion in debt-and-lease assets that can be easily sold off. The federal government shouldn’t be in the money-lending business to begin with. Sitting on a pile of uncollected loan payments totaling trillions of dollars is strong evidence that politicians make poor moneylenders.

Instead, the government should sell off these loans to private lenders and use the revenue to fund infrastructure. Doing so is a proposal that keeps Trump’s commitment to lowering taxes and reducing the size of government.

While the approach is creative, it also has historical precedent. During the Reagan Administration, Congress used the same approach to cover revenue gaps in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 to pay for tax reform.

The politics surrounding the proposal are ideal for the president as well. The bill’s cosponsors include Republicans of the House Freedom Caucus and Democrats of the Congressional Black Caucus, two groups not afraid to buck their own leadership. Support on an infrastructure proposal backed by the CBC could turn the tables on Pelosi and pressure Democratic leadership to come to the table. Any policy idea that allies the Congressional Black Caucus with the House Freedom Caucus in this highly polarized political climate should not be ignored. There is real momentum here.

In the first year of his administration, Trump kept his word and signed historic tax reform into law. A strong economy driven by those same tax cuts will be the selling point of Trump’s reelection campaign.

George H.W. Bush struck a deal with Democrats to raise taxes and lost the White House. Trump won’t make the same mistake.

282,Norquist,Grover,foxnews,"President-elect Donald Trump campaigned on cutting taxes for Americans of all income levels. This year he has the opportunity to do so multiple times.

Most notably, Trump in the White House means that comprehensive, pro-growth tax reform is now a priority in the first hundred days of the new administration.

But this is not the first tax cut Congress will send to Trump’s desk. By passing legislation repealing ObamaCare through budget reconciliation, lawmakers have an opportunity to remove nearly 20 taxes which will save taxpayers more than one trillion dollars over the next decade.

Repealing these taxes is a huge win for middle class taxpayers, who were hit with an avalanche of tax increases despite Barack Obama’s “firm pledge” not to sign “any form of tax increase” on any American making less than $250,000.

The trillion dollars in higher taxes have restricted health care choice, increased costs, made saving more difficult, and granted government more control over care at the expense of individual control. Below are just some of the tax wins that will come from repealing ObamaCare:

1. Individual and Employer Mandate Taxes

ObamaCare enforces many of its provisions through stiff tax penalties both on individuals and on businesses.

Any individual that fails to purchase “qualifying” health insurance – as defined by President Obama’s Department of Health and Human Services – must pay an income surtax totaling more than $2,000 for a family of four. Close to 7.5 million households paid this tax – which the Obama administration refers to with the Orwellian name “shared responsibility payment.” Most make less than $250,000.

Similarly, the law forces employers to pay a $2,000 penalty per full time employee if that fail to offer qualifying insurance. This mandate increases taxes on businesses by $166.9 billion over a decade.

2. Taxes on Health Insurance, Prescription Medicine and Medical Devices

At the same time ObamaCare mandates insurance coverage, it directly drives up the cost of that insurance through a massive tax totaling $130 billion over the next decade. This tax is borne by small businesses, individuals and families through higher premiums.

The ObamaCare health insurance tax will increase premiums by up to $5,000 per family over a decade, according to the American Action Forum. The tax will directly impact 1.7 million small businesses, 11 million households that purchase through the individual insurance market and 23 million households covered through their jobs.

The tax could cost up to 286,000 new jobs, and $33 billion in lost sales by 2023, according to research by the National Federation for Independent Businesses.

This is just one of the many ObamaCare taxes that drives up health care costs. The law imposes billions of dollars more in taxes on prescription medicine and medical devices, and imposes a 40 percent excise tax on employer-provided insurance that will hit more than 40 percent of plans within a decade.

People -- not businesses – bear the burden of these taxes, so this is billions of dollars in higher taxes that are passed on to consumers who rely on life-saving and life-bettering products.

3. High Medical Bills Income Tax

In addition to increasing the costs of health care through higher prices and stifling mandates, ObamaCare directly increases taxes on Americans with high medical bills.

Prior to passage of ObamaCare, Americans facing high out of pocket medical expenses were allowed an income tax deduction to the extent that those expenses exceeded 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income (AGI). The law increased this threshold to 10 percent of AGI, making it more difficult for families to claim this deduction and widening the net of taxable income.

Around 10 million families used this deduction before ObamaCare, with the average taxpayer earning just $53,000 in 2010. Based on this information, the average family is paying $200 to $400 in higher income taxes each year.

4. Taxes on Savings Accounts

ObamaCare imposed several taxes that hit the tens of millions of Americans who use Health Savings Accounts and Flexible Spending Accounts. Specifically, the law forbid families from using HSA and FSA dollars for over the counter medications. Families had been making such household medicine cabinet purchases for years – cold and flu medicine and hundreds of other medical products. ObamaCare also hikes taxes on FSAs by imposing a cap ($2,500) on the amount of income families can contribute to FSAs and increases the tax penalty on early withdrawals from HSAs.

These tax-preferred savings accounts are used in conjunction with insurance plans, which tend to cover large and/or unexpected health events and allow individuals to make choices that best fit their needs. Expanding and protecting these savings accounts is one component to ensuring Americans have access to patient centered health care that best fits their needs and keeps costs low. Repealing these taxes will take power away from the federal government and increase the choices available to consumers.

Since it was passed into law in 2010, ObamaCare has resulted in greater costs, less choice, and higher taxes. By voting to repeal ObamaCare, lawmakers are taking step one toward lower taxes for American families and businesses across the board.",2,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/grover-norquist-why-the-repeal-of-obamacare-means-a-giant-tax-cut-for-the-middle-class

284,Norquist,Grover,ozy,"Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, is in the thick of politics more than most. Here’s what he has to say about the impact of the Mueller report.

Attorney General William Barr summarized the Mueller investigation saying it “did not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it, conspired or coordinated with the Russian government to interfere with the election despite multiple offers from Russian-affiliated individuals to assist the Trump campaign.” Ouch.

We have lived with the huge promise of the Mueller investigation for 675 days. We watched it on TV. Read about it daily. From May 17, 2017, to March 22, 2019, The Washington Post published 1,184 Mueller investigation stories, The New York Times 1,156 and CNN 1,925, according to Republican National Committee research. Add in MSNBC’s coverage and these four outlets alone published an average of 13 Mueller-related stories every single day for 675 days.

Leading Democrat congressmen appeared on CNN to tell their base that they “knew” Trump colluded with Russia. Leaks, predictions and hints told us that the investigation would prove that the 2016 election was a fraud. That Trump was illegitimate. Democrats running for president, from Beto O’Rourke to Bernie Sanders, ran against the “colluder-in-chief.” Democrat audiences cheered.

Watching cheerleaders on CNN is not preparing for the Super Bowl scheduled for November 2020.

Republicans and Democrats spent those 675 days differently.

In between tweets trashing Democrats, President Donald Trump nominated — and the Republican Senate confirmed — two Supreme Court justices, 36 circuit court judges and 53 district judges. Today, over 10 percent of all federal judges were picked by President Trump and five of the 13 circuit courts have Republican-appointed majorities. The 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals flipped this month.

Then the tax cut brought economic growth from 2.1 percent in 2016 to 2.9 percent in 2017 and 3.1 percent in 2018 (based on fourth quarter percentage gains). Before the Trump win, the Congressional Budget Office projected that gross domestic product (GDP) growth would be only 2.3 percent in 2017 and 1.9 percent in 2018. But since Trump’s inauguration, 6 million jobs have been created. Trump has reversed Obama’s anti-fracking policies, and the U.S. now produces more oil and gas than Saudi Arabia. Republicans were told to go out and tell the world of these achievements.

Democrats were told to hold still and wait for the Mueller report, which would make everything all right. But that was just a “shiny thing” giving hope of an easy victory — a rewriting of the 2016 election. It was the middle paragraphs of Ambrose Bierce’s short story, An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge: false hope.

Yes, there is a cost to the credibility of Democrats who promised collusion and some in the media who insisted their sources “knew” that Mueller would shut down the Trump administration. But more damaging was the opportunity cost of pinning one’s hopes on Mueller.

Democrats had hoped to beat Trump in 2020 by running against a tweeter-in-chief who had been mortally wounded by Mueller. Any candidate with a pulse could defeat that. Any policy program would work in a “not Trump” election.

And so 16 Democrats are already or soon-to-be running. What could go wrong? Pick one.

In 1972, Nixon was behind in the polls, so much so that Watergate made sense to his desperate campaign. But the Democrats picked McGovern and the election was no longer “not Nixon” but “Nixon rather than McGovern.” Heck, even the AFL-CIO refused to endorse McGovern.

The Democrats could still choose a strong candidate. But their policy positions are already being largely written — at least in public perception — by a freshman congresswoman from New York City. No airplanes. Really? A spending bill of $94 trillion added to the present debt in one decade?

The cost to the Democrats of “Waiting for Mueller” was failing to develop and promote a credible set of policies that America would turn toward. Where is the list of judges that the Democrats would appoint? Trump provided one in 2016. Where is the middle-class tax cut to contrast with the GOP cut in 2017?

Watching cheerleaders on CNN is not preparing for the Super Bowl scheduled for November 2020.

A few years back, a handful of conservatives (and Trump) embarrassed themselves by demanding to see Barack Obama’s birth certificate — the so-called “birthers.” After the Mueller report’s dead cat bounce, leading Democrats are still insisting that there is a smoking gun somewhere that Mueller missed, after 675 days, 2,800 subpoenas, 500 search warrants and with 19 lawyers. Plus 28 congressional hearings.

The positions are now reversed. Now the Republicans have the presidency and it’s the Democrats who are clinging to conspiracy theories.

The believers in the Mueller report’s “promised” regime change sound like Monty Python’s Michael Palin in the “Dead Parrot” sketch frantically explaining to John Cleese that the dead parrot in his hand is “just resting” and “pining for the Fjords.”

This end game reminds Americans that Democrats tried to invalidate the Ronald Reagan election with the claim that Reagan colluded with Ayatollah Khomeini to defeat Jimmy Carter. Democrats spent 12 months insisting that the Bush 2000 Florida election count was a fraud. Another stolen election. Not until Nov. 12, 2001, did the media consortium announce that their own investigation found that Bush had, in fact, won the election. Denial is not an attractive trait for a party or candidate. Reagan swept up in 1984, Iran or no Iran. Bush won midterms in 2002 and in 2004 despite “Florida.”

Mueller was a costly distraction. He cost the Democrats almost two years that could have been spent preparing candidates and an agenda for November 2020.",2,https://www.ozy.com/opinion/the-mueller-investigation-was-costly-but-to-whom/93452
285,Norquist,Grover,dailycaller,"Politicians love to play with trains. And your money.

In Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s “Green New Deal,” she suggests that high speed rail should be built out across the country and used in place of air travel. But California’s “bullet” train is just one of several examples that demonstrate why tax dollars should not be wasted on these types of projects.

California’s bullet train, which was intended to run between Los Angeles and San Francisco, was originally estimated to cost $33 billion. However, the one-party state of California recently decided to pull the plug on this undertaking due to the fact that after 11 years and basically nothing to show for it, the real cost of the bullet train had climbed to $98 billion in state and federal tax dollars.

A round-trip flight from Los Angeles to San Francisco can be purchased for $149, and the flight takes 90 minutes. The bullet train was an expensive non-solution in search of a problem.

Meanwhile, some politicians in Mississippi, a predominantly Republican state, think it just might be a good idea to shovel taxpayer money to a proposed passenger train in the Southeast. As in California, this proposal — formally known as the Gulf Coast Rail Project — would soon turn into a massive taxpayer boondoggle.

Unfortunately for taxpayers in Mississippi, the Gulf Coast Rail Project is shaping up to be the same disaster. Given the California example, it is much harder to pretend ignorance.

While the total cost for this project, which calls for two daily passenger trains to run between New Orleans, Louisiana and Mobile, Alabama, is hidden, taxpayers will be on the hook for long-term operational and maintenance costs in addition to the infrastructure enhancements, including new train stations.

Estimates have shown that a one-way rail trip on these passenger trains would take more than 3 hours, and would require a subsidy of $180 per passenger. Today, a person wanting to travel between New Orleans and Mobile can get a ticket on Megabus, a 2.5-hour trip, for $14. For the $180 subsidy, the state could give 12 free bus tickets per passenger. In fact, hiring an Uber, a 2-2.5 hour trip, would often be less expensive than $180.

Recognizing the longer length of the train trip, it is reasonable to assume that it would be the least popular choice of commuters. In fact, the rail carrier’s own analysis projects the Gulf Coast Rail Project would attract just 26 riders per train. That is just two more than there are “blackbirds baked” in Mother Goose’s pie.

It gets worse. The Gulf Coast Rail Project would put jobs and potential new jobs at risk. The passenger trains would run on a line that is now being used by freight trains. Since passenger trains get preference over freight trains and the line is mostly single tracked, the Gulf Coast Rail project will interfere with freight traffic industries along the Mississippi Coast. How many companies would decide to build new factories along a hobbled freight rail line?

Mississippi lawmakers should learn from the California bullet train fiasco, as well as the lessons closer to home: similar state-supported trains that once ran between New Orleans and Mobile in the past were discontinued because they were slower, less reliable, and more expensive than other existing modes of transportation.

As Randal O’Toole, senior fellow at the Cato Institute and author of Romance of Rails: Why the Passenger Trains We Love Are Not the Transportation We Need, has exposed:

Today, air travel is far less expensive than train travel, with airfares averaging under 14 cents a passenger mile, barely more than a third of Amtrak fares even though Amtrak receives much bigger subsidies, per passenger mile, than the airlines.

There is no justification for wasting millions of hard-earned tax dollars on yet another expensive, inflexible and unneeded train. Today planes, buses, Uber, and Lyft do much more, much better for much less.

289,Norquist,Grover,dailycaller,"The government took away a woman’s car in Detroit after she dropped off her friend at a bank, where her friend made eye contact with other drivers in the parking lot. She had no criminal record. The justification used for confiscating the car? Police mistook her friend for a prostitute.

It turned into a living nightmare. She fought for her car and eventually got it back after paying over $1,000 in fines and fees, even though she didn’t break any laws.

Billions of dollars in assets are seized every year by the government with little to no justification whatsoever. Many people never see their stuff again.

The government can do this through civil asset forfeiture and the scary part is that you could be targeted next, even if you’ve never committed a crime.

In forfeiture cases, convicted criminals receive more promises of legality and fair proceedings with due process than those who aren’t even charged with a crime.

In criminal asset forfeiture cases, an individual is convicted of a crime, the property is directly related to the crime and the property is confiscated after the conviction. But under civil asset forfeiture, the government can still take your property even if there isn’t a criminal conviction, or charge. As a result, victims of civil asset forfeiture are held to a complicated process where they are forced to prove the innocence and legality of their property.

Civil asset forfeiture cases outpace criminal forfeiture. From 1997 to 2013, 87 percent of the DOJ’s forfeitures were civil asset forfeitures. The combined forfeiture funds of the DOJ and Treasury Department raked in $29 billion from 2001 to 2014, a 1000 percent increase in annual revenue. The problem is so pervasive that in 2014, the government reportedly stole more than burglars. It is clear that the government leeches off of lower burdens of proof to confiscate assets.

Police should be able to collect evidence and confiscate property and wealth that was generated illegally. But seizures also should be limited to convicted criminals so innocent individuals do not lose their entire livelihoods with little evidence of wrongdoing under civil asset forfeiture.

Some states like North Carolina, New Mexico and Nebraska did the right thing and abolished the practice altogether. Numerous other states have passed other reforms to limit civil asset forfeiture. Nevertheless, the federal government still works around state laws through what is called an “Equitable Sharing Program” which allows state and local law enforcement to keep up to 80 percent of assets if they give the rest to the federal government.

The federal government briefly imposed some limits on civil asset forfeiture under Attorney General Eric Holder. At the time, the Justice Department set a policy that prohibited federal government from accepting civil assets seized by state and local governments unless the property was connected to a convicted crime.

But, the federal government quickly shifted course under Attorney General Jeff Sessions by reviving the Justice Department’s Equitable Sharing Program that allows state and local agencies to seize assets and transfer them to federal control, even if states have laws that prevent civil asset forfeiture. The controversial program is still on the books.

With the First Step Act passed in January, the U.S. is moving in the right direction on criminal justice reform. But we must keep up the momentum by eliminating civil asset forfeiture. Confiscation of property without due process of law directly contradicts our founding principles of life, liberty and property.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act brought the corporate income tax rate down from 35 percent to 21 percent, relieving the U.S. of the long-held distinction as home to one of the world’s highest corporate income tax rates. Now, CEOs and investors are bullish on the U.S. relative to other potential destinations for their capital.

However, once the decision is made to bring new capital to the U.S., either by relocating or expanding operations stateside, business owners and investors then must decide among the 50 states.

Last year, Gov. Kim Reynolds and legislators in Des Moines made significant strides with Senate File 2417, which returned the excess revenue Iowa would have otherwise collected as an unintended consequence of conforming to the new federal tax code back to taxpayers in the form of pro-growth tax reform.

This new tax law in Iowa will reduce the corporate tax rate to 9.8 percent from 12 percent by 2021, and the top individual income tax rate to 6.5 percent from 8.98 percent by 2023 if revenue triggers are met. While this was an excellent start, there are still plenty of opportunities to improve, as Iowa’s personal and corporate tax rates will still be among the highest in the country and its neighbors will continue to enjoy a competitive advantage. South Dakota, for example, has no state income tax. Zero.

In addition to continuing to lower individual and corporate income tax rates, lawmakers in Iowa should also do everything in their power to keep local tax bills in check, as high local taxes are also a deterrent to businesses and investment. One way to accomplish this is to implement local spending limits that require spending growth to be no more than population growth and inflation. While that reasonable growth limit would have equated to property tax growth of 56 percent since 2000, Iowans have instead seen the amount of property taxes collected grow by over 100 percent over that same time period.

Under the status quo in Iowa, the state Legislature is limited to spending 99 percent of the revenue the state collects each year. Even better, a 2019 constitutional amendment has been proposed to “limit the annual increase in (state) spending from year to year to the lesser of 99 percent of the estimated revenue for that fiscal year, or 4 percent above the prior year’s revenue.”

It is said that if enacted in 2017, this proposal could have saved taxpayers in Iowa nearly $500 million between 2012 and 2017. Imagine how much money could be saved if similar restrictions were enacted at the local level.

Unfortunately, many state legislators are afraid to tackle this important issue because there exists this myth that “local control” is a constitutional or conservative principle. Nonsense. States created both the federal government, granting it only so many powers, and local governments as well. In many cases, state laws are, and by extension, state control is, the most appropriate way to protect the rights of individuals.

The argument for local control is often misunderstood to mean that local government should never be subjected to oversight or limited by state government. When local governments' spending grows faster than it should, it leads to higher taxes and more debt— and they should not be immune from spending limits.

As such, in addition to providing additional tax relief at the state level this year, lawmakers should also consider reining in local government spending. Iowans believe that changes should be made. In a scientific poll commissioned by Iowans for Tax Relief just last month, over two-thirds of the 800 Iowans polled agreed that the Legislature should review the issue of property taxes during the 2019 session.

Local spending limits would significantly reduce the “need” for local tax increases, and thus help make Iowa a more attractive place to live, invest, and do businesses. And more importantly, allow the hardworking people of Iowa to keep more of their hard-earned money.

292,Norquist,Grover,ozy,"Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, is in the thick of politics more than most. Here’s what he has to say about President Trump’s legacy.

President Trump has proved the ultimate political “disrupter.” But will his disruptions become the new normal, or is he an easily discarded New Coke?

Two years of a GOP Congress and a Trump presidency went a long way to repealing many of Obama’s “I have a pen and a phone” executive orders and guidance letters. The tax code is now Trump’s handiwork, not Obama’s. Spending priorities have shifted — and Trump has appointed new judges. As a result, much of Obama’s presidency has been erased. Will this happen to Trump and his works?

Taxes reduced can be increased if the Democrats win both the Congress and the presidency. Regulations imposed by agencies can be repealed the same way. Guidance letters, often with the power of regulation, can be withdrawn. So what sticks? Has Trump bent the arc of history or built sandcastles below high tide?

The following are the changes made by Trump that are unlikely to be undone.

First, in May 2016, Trump revealed a list of judges and legal scholars that he said he would choose from in appointing a Supreme Court judge. This had never been done before, and from now on, no candidate running for president will fail to unveil such a list early in his or her campaign. This practice may even be expanded to lists for secretaries of defense, state and the treasury.

Trump’s administration has proved it’s possible to speed up the approval of new generic drugs.

Second, Trump’s Supreme Court appointees Brett Kavanaugh, 53, and Neil Gorsuch, 51, now provide votes four and five for a series of groundbreaking decisions that the high court has been inching toward for decades. Decisions on issues such as banning racial quotas and preferences will have a strong impact for years to come.

In early 2018, the court’s Janus decision said state and local employees could not be forced to pay union dues or fees as a condition of employment. The ruling has already cost the “left” some $250 million in lost fees, and the experience of Wisconsin and Michigan (which recently enacted “right to work” protections for government employees) suggests that within a few years 20 to 30 percent of government workers will choose to stop paying union dues or fees. That would cost unions and their allies more than a billion dollars a year.

Next up, the Uradnik case could end the idea that workers have to live under one-size-fits-all, union-written contracts. How many young workers, for example, would sign contracts based on a seniority system? And within a year, “Chevron Deference,” an earlier decision that says courts should defer to the bureaucracy as it expands its own powers and interprets laws as the agencies see fit, will be reversed in whole or in part. This change will shift power from the permanent government in Washington, D.C., and force Congress to actually vote for any and every regulatory burden they wish to impose. There will be less micromanagement of individuals and the economy from then on.

Also, Trump signed an expansion of 529 college savings plans so that the funds can also be used for K-12 education. Obama had tried to effectively end 529 college savings plans to please the teachers union. He was stopped. The Republican 2017 tax cut expanded 529s, explicitly making them available for K-12. This will never go away. Ron DeSantis, the newly elected Republican governor of Florida, believes he won with the unexpected votes of more than 100,000 African-American women. Why? Because they had Republican-passed vouchers/tax credits. The Democratic gubernatorial candidate, on the other hand, had pledged to end them.

Also, Trump’s administration has proved it’s possible to speed up the approval of new generic drugs. Last year, Trump’s Food and Drug Administration approved nearly 800 generic medicines, a whopping 90 percent more than Obama did in 2014.

Meanwhile, the 21 percent corporate income tax might drift upward if Democrats win the trifecta. But just as Dems from 1993–95 and 2009–11 never returned the personal income tax rates to 90 or 70 percent, the corporate income tax rate will likely never return to 35 percent. At 35 percent, the United States had the highest tax rate on corporate income. At 70 percent, the U.S. would be the only nation with a personal income tax bracket that high. Other nations lowered their top marginal tax rates after Reagan reduced America’s top income tax rates from 70 percent in 1980 to 50 percent in 1981 and then to 28 percent in 1986.

Also, with regard to treatments, the “right to try” legislation that allows critically ill parents to access medicine that the FDA finds safe but has not yet deemed “effective” passed in 41 states and then nationally by Congress. That expansion of freedom will not be withdrawn.

And finally, while some regulations put in place through “phone and pen” can be ended just as easily, the 16 major regulations that were eliminated through a congressional vote and the president’s signature using the Congressional Review Act (CRA) can never be replaced by a future agency or executive action. Only an act of Congress can reimpose anything like them.

294,Norquist,Grover,foxnews,"Sixty days ago President Obama submitted a fiscal year 2012 budget to Congress.

Today, candidate Barack Obama gave a nice talk about “hope and change” commenting on the passing scene in Washington and bemoaning the overspending and debt and runaway spending that have somehow gotten much worse over the past two years.

Obama’s FY 2012 budget called for $2 trillion in higher spending by the end of this decade. It increased taxes by about $1 trillion dollars. There were no real reforms in entitlements or rollbacks of the one trillion dollar increase over the decade in increased domestic discretionary spending enacted in 2009. Its goal was to lock in the vast spending increase of 2009 and 2010 that brought federal spending up from the traditional 20% of GDP to 25% of GDP. He hoped to be a moderate because after the spending binge he would stabilize the spending at his “new normal. “

The speech today seemed to endorse the handiwork a commission appointed by Obama a year or so ago. Sort of. You can read the whole speech and remain unclear about where the president plans to cut spending and which and how much taxes will go up.

But if he means to enact his original budget and mesh it with the Simpson-Bowles Commission proposals, it results in the following:

-- The tax revenue target will rise from 18-19 percent of the economy (historical) to 21 percent of the economy.

-- Net taxes will be raised by $1 - $3 trillion over the next decade. (According to Simpson-Bowles itself, their proposal is a net tax hike of $1 trillion. Paul Ryan believed the actual tax hike was closer to $2 trillion. The Heritage Foundation said $3 trillion.)

--A tax hike “trigger” will take effect to pay for higher levels of government spending.

-- The rate at which two-thirds of small business profits face taxation will rise from 35% to 39.6%. You can’t raise the tax rate on households making more than $250,000 per year without also raising the tax rate at which most small business profits face taxation.

-- The tax rate on capital gains and dividends will rise from 15% to 23.8%. The combination of the Obama budget tax hike and the Obamacare “surtax” on investment results in the highest capital gains tax in a generation.

-- The death tax rate will rise from 35% to 45%, and the exemption will be cut from $10 million to $3.5 million. This is the result of Obama’s budget, and would certainly be needed to raise taxes by as much as he would like to.

-- The higher taxes of Obamacare will be kept in place. By cementing Obamacare in place, President Obama’s plan keeps the 20 new or higher taxes in that jobs-killing law.

What else did we learn from the speech?

First, Obama the candidate is back. The President has gone into hibernation. This speech was about what he would do if he was President, not what he will actually do. The hard decisions are put off until, conveniently, after 2012 and 2014. Tax hikes will be automatically triggered if the budget is not kept down. Imagine. All congress and the president have to do is keep spending and an automatic tax hike will hit Americans. No fingerprints on a tax hike vote. The perfect zipless tax hike. This goes into the politician Hall of Fame.

Second, the President’s advisors are scared of the Paul Ryan budget proposal that will be voted through the House of Representatives this Friday. Congressman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin has actually gone to the work of writing down a budget. The President’s speech today was an endorsement of sorts of a series of essays written by retired politicians Simpson and Bowles. The White House had told itself for months that the Republicans would come up with a budget that would be a political liability for all Republicans in 2012. The Democrats hoped that Ryan would rush to balance the budget by cutting and slashing programs. Instead Ryan put forward a well thought out series of reforms that slash nothing in the short run, but instead reform spending programs to slow growth and reduce overall spending over time.

The Ryan budget takes the lessons of welfare reform and applies them to Medicaid, food stamps and almost all means-tested welfare programs. How does the Democrat party attack the very strategy that Bill Clinton signed into law to reform welfare? (Yes, Bill Clinton vetoed the welfare reform plan twice, but that has been written out of the Democrat narrative that praises welfare reform as a Clinton victory.

If Obama hoped to attack Republicans for reforming Medicare, they are on thin ice. Obama’s own health care legislation slashed $500 billion from Medicare. Ryan’s reforms will not affect anyone over the age of 55. Those near or at retirement will see no change….except the threat of Obama’s budget slash without reforms. How can the Democrats scare older voters when there is no real “threat”?

Third, Obama and the Democrats are desperate to create a new concept—“spending in the tax code” that is the new phrase for Teddy Kennedy’s “tax expenditures”. This is the theory that if the government fails to take a dollar from you it has in fact given you the dollar. In Obama’s world he owns all your income and if through a tax credit or deduction he deigns to let you keep some he has just “spent” that money.

Tax increases then become “spending cuts”.

Nice trick.

So now when you read an Obama speech you never know if he intends to raise your taxes or actually cut the federal budget when he promises to “reduce spending.” But you have a pretty good idea he intends to eliminate a tax credit or deduction—the largest four being 1.charitable deductions, 2. the deductibility of your home mortgage interest, 3. the deductibility of state and local taxes you pay and 4. the deductibility of your employer-provided health insurance.

With Obama’s reasoning no one will ever raise your taxes again. The government will simply reduce “spending through the tax code” by slashing your personal exemption or child deduction and call it a spending cut. Don’t you feel better already?

295,Norquist,Grover,foxnews,"Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, D-N.Y., recently announced that Democrats should increase the top personal income tax rates as high as 70 percent. That would be the highest income tax rate in the developed world, higher than all of our major trading partners and competitors.

For decades polls have shown that most Americans believe no one should pay more than 25 percent of their income in taxes. (That is how much serfs paid in the Middle Ages.)

Ocasio-Cortez is not alone. The Democratic Party in the House chose to begin 2019 demanding higher taxes. They have already voted down an amendment offered by Republican Ways and Means ranking member Kevin Brady to make the standard deduction and child tax credit permanent (Now they expire in ten years like the Bush tax cuts of 2001.)

If Democrats allow all of the personal income tax cuts in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to lapse, it will result in a significant tax hike of $2,058 per year for a family of four earning $73,000.

Then Democrats got rid of the Republican House rule that required a three-fifths majority vote to hike taxes. Democrats refused to require a three-fifths vote to hike taxes on low or middle-income Americans. They made it easier to raise taxes on all Americans.

Ocasio-Cortez was a toddler when the Democrats controlled the House, Senate, and White House in 1993. They raised the income tax—not to 70 percent—but to 39.6 percent. The Democrats then lost the House and Senate in 1994.

Ocasio-Cortez was 19-years-old in 2008 when once again the Democrats won the House, Senate and presidency. Obama and Pelosi (who should now know better) raised the income tax top rate to just over 40 percent and lost the House and their Senate supermajority in 2010.

History is about to repeat itself in 2020. The Democrats are showing bared teeth and American taxpayers have a history of responding poorly to tax hikes dating back to 1773.

It gets worse

Ocasio-Cortez’s income tax hike is only one of several tax hikes being threatened.

Congressman John Yarmouth, D-Ky., now the chairman of the House budget Committee told Politico that he expected Democrats to push to raise the corporate income tax from 21 percent to 25 or 27 percent. Add in our average state corporate income taxes and America would tax its business more than China (25 percent) or Germany (25 percent).

But wait, there is more. The Democratic party platform calls for a tax on carbon dioxide, an energy tax. One “carbon tax” plan introduced by Democrat congressman Ted Deutch of Florida would increase taxes on energy by $1 trillion over the next ten years and that energy tax would automatically increase without any vote by Congress.

Should we care about the threat to hike the top personal income tax rate to 70 pecent? Ocasio-Cortez promises that her top rate would only hit those earning more than $10 million a year. Maybe most of us are safe?

Let's first look at some history. The personal income tax was imposed in 1913. The top tax rate on the very rich was 7 percent. We were all promised then that the new income tax was “a tax on the rich.” The one percent. In today’s dollars that 7% rate only hit those earning more than $11 million (sounds like the plan Democrats like AOC are pushing.) But within a few years, the lowest rate went above 7 percent. Today the bottom rate is 10 percent -- higher than the punitive tax rate that was supposed to hit only the Kennedy and Rockefeller kids.

New taxes are often imposed on “the rich” or “them.” Then over time, they trickle down to hit all of us. That is what happened with the personal income tax. Once targeted to the top one percent but now hitting half of Americans.

Then there was the Spanish American War tax, a tax on long distance phone calls in 1898 when only the very rich owned phones. Over time all Americans had phones at home and we all paid the federal excise tax on every long-distance phone call—for one hundred years.

Tax hikes on the rich never stay so focused. They slip down to hit the rest of us.

Promising to “soak the rich” is a popular ruse to misdirect the attention of voters to ignore taxes.

Politicians like to misdirect your attention by talking about “taxing the rich” while they are enacting energy taxes that hit everyone who drives a car, heats their home or uses lights or air conditioning. And taxes on businesses are simply hidden taxes placed into the higher cost of everything we buy each day.

Bill Clinton promised he would only raise taxes on the top 2 percent of earners. He then raised gas taxes on everyone.

Obama promised, over and over, that he would never raise ANY taxes on ANYONE earning less than $250,000. But ObamaCare included at least seven direct tax increases on Americans making less than $250,000.

Ocasio-Cortez’s 70 percent income tax rate is the opening shot in a renewed war against middle class taxpayers. One might hope she is alone in this effort. But to date, not a single elected Democrat has denounced this opening gambit in the drive for higher income taxes, business taxes and energy taxes.",2,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/grover-norquist-ocasio-cortezs-70-income-tax-rate-is-the-opening-shot-in-a-renewed-war-against-taxpayers

Yet, while taxpayers are benefiting from the reduction in federal taxes, Arizona taxpayers face the prospect of an increase in state income taxes unless the governor and Legislature act to prevent it.

“When federal changes to the tax code – particularly definitions of adjusted gross income in the case of Arizona – ‘broaden the tax base,’ they also expand taxable income at the state level,” explains Jonathan Williams, chief economist and vice president for the Center for State Fiscal Reform at the American Legislative Exchange Council, in his recent Washington Times column. “If state lawmakers conform with the federal changes, in many cases, states see a windfall of unbudgeted and ongoing revenue.”

Follow these states' leads on taxes

While conforming Arizona’s tax code to the federal code would simplify tax season for Arizonans, conformity alone would be a huge mistake, as the benefits of simplicity would be far outweighed by the associated $300 million net state tax increase.

Instead, Gov. Doug Ducey and the Legislature should quickly follow the lead of lawmakers in other states, who decided to return the new revenue they received as an unintended consequence of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to individual taxpayers, households, and employers in the form of pro-growth tax reform.

For example, in Iowa, Gov. Kim Reynolds protected her constituents from the massive tax increase that would have resulted from conforming to the federal code by enacting legislation that, among other things, will lower individual income tax rates across the board.

Georgia provides another example, where Gov. Nathan Deal offset the excess revenue the Peach State would have otherwise collected from tax conformity by enacting legislation that, among other things, doubles the standard deduction and will reduce the corporate and top marginal individual income tax rates from 6 percent to 5.75 percent.

Similar reforms would greatly boost the competitiveness of Arizona. Under the status quo, Arizona has a top marginal income tax rate of 4.54 percent and a top marginal corporate income tax rate of 4.90 percent.

Meanwhile, its regional competitors Nevada and Texas do not impose taxes on individual or corporate income (though they do impose gross receipts taxes on businesses), and Colorado has a lower top marginal corporate tax rate of 4.63 percent.

It could make Arizona more competitive

Federal tax reform has presented a unique opportunity to make Arizona a more attractive place to live, invest and do business without making any changes to the state budget or negatively impacting state revenues.

But it will take leadership from the governor and Legislature to make it happen. And the sooner state leaders take action, the better. Any delay has the effect of leaving taxpayers with uncertainty heading into tax-filing season.

Rather than squandering the excess revenue the state will collect from conforming to the federal code and wasting it on ineffective spending programs, as was done by Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards, whose economy ranks among the worst in the nation, Arizona lawmakers should return it to the hardworking people of Arizona in the form of commensurate reductions in overall state income taxes.

Such reforms would bring Arizona up to speed with its neighbors and other states that are more taxpayer friendly and economically competitive, and more importantly, ensure the people of Arizona do not get stuck with an even greater state tax burden.

297,Norquist,Grover,washingtontimes,"ANALYSIS/OPINION:

“Patience and fortitude conquer all things”

— Ralph Waldo Emerson

The courage and the patience that so many justice reform advocates have shown in the effort to reform the federal criminal justice system has been rewarded as the U.S. Senate and House have passed and President Donald Trump has signed the First Step Act into law.

Efforts to reform the federal justice system have been years and even decades in the making. Organizations such as Prison Fellowship were working in Washington and in state capitals across the country in the 1980s and 1990s to educate government officials on better ways to administer justice.

Individuals such as Prison Fellowship Founder Chuck Colson and Pat Nolan of the American Conservative Union not only worked with elected officials to change draconian sentencing laws and improve prison programming to provide second chances to incarcerated citizens, but they also worked within federal and state prisons to help inmates turn their lives around.

Just over three years ago our organizations came together to push the federal government toward a conservative, smarter approach to crime by instituting more proportionate punishment for non-violent crimes, and to increase public safety by ensuring that released prisoners are returning to society without drug or alcohol addictions, and with the education and life skills to become productive members of their community.

In 2015 we wrote that the federal government should follow the lead of conservative red states who have effectively and efficiently reformed their prison and justice systems and now that goal will be achieved as the First Step Act becomes law.

As a result of these efforts and as a result of the work of justice reform champions in Congress such as Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, and the support of forward-thinking leaders such as Senate Judiciary Chairman Senator Chuck Grassley, House Speaker Paul Ryan, and Sen. John Cornyn, federal justice reform is more than a concept it is a reality.

The election of President Donald Trump was a real game-changer in the fight for criminal justice reform. Along with President Trump’s support for reform, and specifically, his support for the First Step Act, presidential advisor Jared Kushner and his staff in the White House Office of American Innovation helped guide the legislation through Congress.

Now, through endless iterations of justice reform legislation, and thousands of meetings with members of the U.S. House and Senate and officials from multiple Presidential administrations, conservative justice reform advocates finally have a substantial federal policy victory.

The First Step Act promotes public safety and provides inmates access to the transformational programming they need to earn back the public’s trust and to return home as good spouses, parents and neighbors by giving credits for an earlier release for inmates who enroll in job training, faith, and drug and alcohol rehabilitation programs. Conservative-leaning states such as Texas and Georgia enacted such programs, and as we argued in 2015, are proven to reduce recidivism and provide inmates with the life skills they need to succeed on the outside.

The First Step Act is the most critical federal justice system reform since 2010, and everyone who contributed to its passage deserves congratulations and credit for legislation that will indeed change thousands of lives for the better.

However, this is no victory lap. Passage of the First Step Act is a monumental accomplishment, but as the name implies, it is merely the first step on a path to smarter, more effective federal sentencing and prison programming policies.

298,Norquist,Grover,thehill,"President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE was elected on his promise to stop other nations from taking advantage of the United States. Our allies let us pay for most of their own national defense needs. Treaties allowed once poor countries to hit American products with tariffs and trade barriers. The Paris agreement on climate change burdened our manufacturers and workers, while letting China and India build and expand without such onerous restrictions.

Trump highlighted that nations steal our intellectual property through piracy and use their monopoly power as a buyer to force our innovative drug industry to sell American products at cut rate prices or have their patents stripped. This is extortion plain and simple. Trump is right to fight to reform all these abuses of our generous nature. But in one of these fights the administration is talking about surrendering instead. The administration recently proposed an international pricing index for the calculation of physician administered drugs under Medicare Part B.

ADVERTISEMENT

Instead of fighting for American exports and fair prices that respect our investment of billions of dollars in research and development of new lifesaving drugs, the plan would import socialist style price controls. This is failed policy dating back to the Roman Empire and beyond. The Medicare Part B system is based off market pricing in which costs are calculated through a formula that accounts for the “average sales price” in the United States, which also includes the discounts negotiated between hospitals and insurers. This system has been proven to work, as prices of top Medicare Part B drugs fell by 0.8 percent, while Amgen lowered the cost of an innovative cholesterol drug by over 60 percent.

In contrast, other nations freely use market distorting price controls and other heavy handed government policies within their health systems. There is no negotiation with foreign governments forcing manufactures to accept artificially lower prices in a “take it or leave it” proposition. While these policies lower costs in the short term, in the long term they ration access to important medicines, suppress the development of the next generation of cures, and ultimately increase the costs of global health.

Adopting these policies threatens the role of the United States as the leader in medical innovation. This innovative environment is enormously beneficial to Americans and to the economy, as well as the efficiency of our health system in the long run. This is no exaggeration. An estimated $90 billion is spent on research and development of medicines in the United States each year, which creates thousands of high paying jobs.

As a result, a majority of new medicines are developed in the United States and are often launched here years before other developed nations have access to them. In fact, the United States had access to 95 percent of the dozens of cancer drugs launched between 2011 and 2018. By comparison, Britain had access to 74 percent, Japan had access to 49 percent, and Greece had access to 8 percent of these cancer drugs.

The proposed international pricing index of the administration will undermine this success and cause future damage to our overall health system and to American innovation, a fact that the White House Council Economic Advisers warned of in a report published earlier this year: “If the United States had adopted the centralized drug pricing policy in other developed nations 20 years ago, then the world may not have highly valuable treatments for diseases that required significant investment.”

Supporters of the international pricing index have claimed the rule is a free market proposal that will incentivize manufacturers to negotiate better deals. However, this assumes countries now have an incentive to let manufacturers get a better deal and that manufacturers did not negotiate the best outcome already. In reality, there is nothing “free market” about this system, which is why the proposal mirrors legislation released by Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersOvernight Energy: Treasury creates hub to fight climate change through finance | Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez introduce 'Green New Deal for Public Housing' | Don't attack Zoom for its Bernie Sanders federal tax bill Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez introduce 'Green New Deal for Public Housing' MORE. The Democratic senator has also supported allowing the unchecked importation of foreign price controlled medicines into the United States. This would in fact be the importation of the socialist policy of price controls and leads to important unsafe and untested drugs.

While the international pricing index is concerning on its merits, the plan is being administered through the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, an agency established under ObamaCare that some scholars say acts in violation of the Constitution. As a result, the agency is exempt from the legislative appropriations process and is prone to being used as a tool for the executive branch of government to usurp the role of Congress in setting policy. It will harm both patients and providers.

Utilizing the federal agency to push the international pricing index opens the door to future efforts by the left to dramatically expand government control over our health system through the Center for Medicare and Medicaid. Although the administration is right to focus on efforts on lowering drug costs, the international pricing index will not achieve this goal. Instead, the proposal will adopt foreign socialized health care policies to the detriment of the American people and the economy.

299,Norquist,Grover,washingtonexaminer,"People are angry about the high cost of healthcare and health insurance.

Many voters told pollsters healthcare was the top of their concerns when they voted in November’s congressional elections.

Voters worried about cost, availability, and access to healthcare for themselves and their families.

People are understandably upset. Barack Obama promised in 2008 to pass legislation that would reduce the cost of a family’s health insurance by $2,500 a year. Instead Obamacare, or the Affordable Care Act, reduced the options families have, took away the ability to keep your doctor, and increased the cost of health insurance by $2,500.

In the next month, Republicans have an opportunity to reduce some of the damage done by Obamacare. After the Democrats take control of the House, that opportunity disappears for two years.

Congressional Republicans can draw a sharp contrast with this top-down, command and control model of healthcare by using the lame-duck session to pass free-market reforms that lower the cost of healthcare for families, increase consumer choice and access, and get the federal government out of the healthcare business.

They can do this by passing legislation that repeals or delays Obamacare’s health insurance and medical device taxes and expands Health Savings Accounts.

In the past few months, healthcare premiums have begun to stabilize due in in part to the policies of the Trump administration that have returned some powers to the states and empowered patient-centered healthcare.

However, if lawmakers fail to act soon, Obamacare’s $16 billion a year tax on health insurance premiums (cleverly delayed until Obama left office) will soon take effect.

More than 141 million consumers will be damaged by this new tax: consumers in the individual market, large and small group plans, Medicare Advantage, and Medicare Part D plans. Furthermore, 1.7 million small businesses would be harmed.

Premiums could increase by as much as 2.2 percent per year, equating to almost $6,000 over the next decade for a typical family of four with small or large group insurance. This tax is also highly regressive. Those earning less than $50,000 a year pay about half of the tax.

Although the tax does not take effect until 2020, insurers plan their prices months in advance, so Congress must act soon. Congressional action is also overwhelmingly popular: 77 percent of registered voters support delay or full repeal of Obamacare’s health insurance tax.

Ideally, this tax should be outright repealed to spare taxpayers from an onslaught of higher premiums and financial hardship. However, if Congress can’t repeal this harmful tax in full, it is imperative that the health insurance tax is delayed so that families and small businesses are protected from tax increases.

The health insurance tax is not the only looming tax hike. The Obamacare medical device tax is also set to go into effect in 2020. This 2.3 percent excise tax is imposed directly on manufacturers and thousands of small businesses.

Ultimately, this tax suppresses investment and costs jobs. When it was last in effect, medical device investment dropped by $34 billion in 2013 and almost 22,000 jobs were lost between 2013 and 2015.

While all Obamacare taxes should be repealed over the long term, it is crucial that Congress uses this opportunity to ensure that the health insurance tax and medical device tax do not go into effect.

In addition to preventing tax increases on the healthcare system, lawmakers should also proactively implement new reforms for families.

Today, 25 million families and individuals (and counting) utilize tax-advantaged Health Savings Accounts to save and spend their own money tax-free on a variety of healthcare expenses.

The House passed legislation earlier this year expanding these accounts centered around nearly doubling the contribution limit from $3,450 to $6,650 for an individual and $6,900 to $13,300 for a family. This reform will expand the viability of HSAs for millions of families.

The reforms will also increase the utility of HSAs by expanding eligibility to individuals with a bronze or catastrophic health plan, allow working seniors enrolled in Medicare Part A to contribute to an HSA, and allowing HSAs to be used to purchase over-the-counter medications and fitness expenses.

HSAs have a proven record in promoting consumer driven healthcare that lowers healthcare costs, increases savings, and strengthens retirement security. These simple reforms will update HSAs for the benefit of millions of families.

While there are only a handful of weeks left in the legislative calendar, the GOP can use this time to pass legislation that offers real healthcare relief to families and businesses and draws a sharp contrast with the one-size-fits all policies of the Left.

Preventing the health insurance tax and medical device tax from going into effect and expanding HSAs will strengthen access to care, lower costs, and restrain the federal government.

301,Norquist,Grover,washingtonexaminer,"Republicans banned earmarks when they won the majority in the House of Representatives in 2010. Democrats are hinting they may bring them back. If they do, the Democrats will return to a shameful period of rampant corruption.

Earmarks are when individual congressmen stick a specific goodie into a larger spending bill, usually something of personal political benefit to themselves: a few million for their alma mater or subsidies for a local developer. The Pentagon might be directed (ordered) to buy a weapons system it does not want or need but is built in the district of the congressman.

Yes, it is often corruption in the rankest sense. Campaign dollars, or just cash, flow from the beneficiary of the gift of tax dollars (a person, company) to the generous congressman.

But that is just a few tens of billions misdirected.

Earmarks are the currency of corruption and big spending. Earmarks are given to buy the vote of a congressman who gags at overspending in a large appropriations bill, but can find it in his heart to forgive and endorse and vote for this waste if it includes a lovely gift for their district. Earmarks buy bad votes.

Earmarks are used to buy the votes of congressmen who would never vote for the overall package standing alone, without a bribe.

Earmarks are used to grease the wheels of big government, and they weaken Congress as an equal branch of government.

One Republican congressman told this writer that when he arrived in Washington, he was surprised to learn that every special interest in his district called expecting him to spend the bulk of his time fighting for earmarks for local politicians and local businessmen. It is hard to focus on limiting the total cost of government while directing half your staff to chase after and grab every loose contract and grant. If everyone is shoplifting, who is keeping an eye on the cash register?

If some earmark spending actually is of value to your state or congressional district, then it is properly the responsibility of the state or local government. Why didn’t they do it? By definition a locally targeted earmark pays for something that the city, town, and state have decided not to fund year after year. If it was valuable and important, the mayor or governor would have become beloved and re-elected by funding it. But they didn’t.

Washington pundits like to argue that in the “good old days” earmarks made it easier for “everyone” to “work together” in Washington. Yes, earmarks made it easier for “everyone” to “work together” in Washington if you define “everyone” as congressmen and special interests and define “work” as expanding the size, scope, and cost of government. Earmarks lead to the worst kind of bipartisanship — when the politicians come together to fight for their class interests against taxpayers, consumers, and average people. Earmarks bring politicians together, against us, in the same way they can “work together” when raising their pay, giving themselves gold-plated pensions, oppose term limits, and write campaign finance laws to protect incumbents.

Earmarks do help congressmen and senators find lucrative jobs once they leave office. Ever wonder why politicians are often appointed to run universities? It is not a result of academic excellence or managerial skills. You don’t learn anything about managing a huge university from bossing around interns in a congressional office. Check out the “great thinkers” who have left Congress to run various universities. Connect the dots on earmarks to that university and add in the potential of lobbying their former “colleagues” for more earmarks for that university. This is prepaying your pension with taxpayer money.

The incoming speaker of the house in 2011, following the Republican gain of 63 House seats in November 2010, was John Boehner of Ohio. He had never taken a single earmark. He led the fight to end earmarks in the House. Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., led the fight to end earmarks in the Senate.

Republicans brought the reform of term-limiting committee chairs that ended decades of despotic rule of chairmen who accumulated and abused power. Now they cycle out every six years. There are no more Rostenkowskis or Dingells.

Ending earmarks was a great step forward in reducing corruption.

Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., is bringing a Democrat majority to the House of Representatives. That will bring back a penchant for spending other people’s money.

We will soon see if she intends to bring back the corruption of earmarks as well.

303,Norquist,Grover,dailycaller,"Voters should not be fooled by the so-called renewable energy initiatives being pushed by California billionaire Tom Steyer.

Steyer, who made a fortune founding and managing Farallon Capital, a hedge fund that for decades invested in fossil fuels, disguised himself as a full-blown climate advocate after being shamed by liberal activists over his investment portfolio. Now, Steyer’s NextGen Climate Action super PAC is pouring money into state ballot measures in hopes of compelling voters to support his current “green energy” venture.

Steyer’s ballot measures would force residents of Arizona and Nevada to get 50 percent of their electricity from solar and wind by 2030. There are several reasons to oppose these measures.

First and foremost, Arizona’s Prop 127 and Nevada’s Question 6 would raise energy costs, having the same effect as a regressive tax hike on Arizona and Nevada households. This should be a major point of concern for all voters in both states.

In order to comply with these mandates, electricity companies would be forced to spend tons of money. These billions of dollars in added costs would ultimately be passed onto families and businesses in the form of higher prices. A closer look at research on Prop 127 sheds some light on just how much economic devastation would come from Steyer’s misguided energy policies.

Economists at Arizona State University’s Seidman Research Institute estimate that Prop 127 would force the average household serviced by APS — Arizona’s largest electric utility, Arizona Public Service Company (APS) — to spend $1,900 in new electricity costs each year. This breaks down to more than $150 per month. Buttressing this claim, residents of California, which adopted the same energy mandate in 2015, faced charges of 20 cents per kilowatt-hour, or around $2,000 a year.

Making matters worse, research on Prop 127 shows that the harm it would inflict upon the Grand Canyon State economy goes far beyond inflated utility bills. Economists also found that in addition to doubling the cost of monthly bills, Prop 127 would cost Arizona thousands of jobs as well as $72.5 billion in GDP by 2060.

Adding insult to injury, NERA Economic Consulting’s — a “a global firm of experts dedicated to applying economic, finance, and quantitative principles to complex business and legal challenges” — study on Prop 127 finds, in short, that all of the associated economic devastation would basically be for nothing.

The study concluded that Prop 127’s mandates would have no apparent impact on public health or air quality. Ironically, Prop 127 would likely increase carbon emissions in Arizona because it would force the Palo Verde nuclear plant to close due to the measure’s exclusion of nuclear and other known carbon free energy, such as hydropower, from counting toward the 50 percent mandate.

The energy mandates would have a minimal, if any, environmental impact, but would certainly inflict a great deal of economic harm on Arizona and Nevada, creating financial hardships for the hardworking people.

Hopefully, voters see these amendments for what they really are: Massive subsidies for out-of-state millionaires that invest in solar and wind power.

304,Norquist,Grover,washingtonexaminer,"Thanks to Republican reforms like the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Americans across this country are keeping more of their hard-earned dollars and business is booming. Just this month, America was named the world’s most competitive economy. Clearly, keeping taxes low and empowering Americans and businesses works.

But as we head into Election Day, Democrats have been united in their calls for new tax hikes. Not only do they hope to take more from your hard-earned paychecks, Democrats have long looked at energy taxes as a way to fund their big-government agenda.

Not only would this raise the cost of energy for families across this country, it would place an incredible burden on small businesses and kill jobs in the energy sector.

This summer, I, Rep. Steve Scalise, introduced a resolution calling on all members of Congress to stand against a job-killing carbon tax. Most Republican members of Congress voted for this resolution, saying they would never, ever, ever, vote for carbon tax. Democrats flat-out voted against this resolution either in a sign of their support for such a tax or to publicly leave the door open.

This vote highlighted the contrast between the two parties on energy taxes. While the official Democratic platform endorses a carbon tax, the official Republican platform states unequivocally, “We oppose any carbon tax.” Voters now know where their elected representatives stand on an energy tax that would raise the cost of gasoline, home heating and air conditioning, and everyday goods at the grocery store.

Politically, the carbon tax has been viewed by many Democrats as a costless form of “oil and coal are bad” virtue signaling when they are in the minority. Under President Barack Obama and the Democratic-controlled House and Senate, there was no obvious attempt to pass a carbon tax. In 2009, House Democrats passed a more hidden energy tax, a “cap and trade” scheme. Sixty-three House Democrats lost their jobs in the 2010 election.

Democrats know the energy tax is a political loser and behind closed doors will acknowledge as much. In 2015, a carbon tax memo prepared for then-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton concluded that a carbon tax would be devastating to low-income households.

“As with the increase in energy costs, the increase in the cost of non-energy goods and services would disproportionately impact low income households,” the memo states. “The cost of other household goods and services would increase as well as companies pass forward the higher energy costs paid to produce those goods and services on to consumers.”

Hillary Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook wrote in an email, “to be clear: it’s lethal in the general, so I don’t want to support one.” John Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, put things more bluntly , writing, “We have done extensive polling on a carbon tax. It all sucks.""

A $40 per ton carbon tax would immediately increase the price of gasoline by 38 cents per gallon. As the American Enterprise Institute recently pointed out, even a smaller $25 per ton carbon tax, at a low-ball estimate, would cost the average household hundreds of dollars per year, undoing a quarter of the average household tax cut in the GOP’s historic Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Such an oppressive tax would come at a time when the United States is not only leading the world in reducing carbon dioxide emissions, but doing so at nearly twice the rate as the next closest country.

American voters can look to the examples of other nations that introduced a carbon tax and see the economic and political harm that resulted. Following Australia’s introduction of a national carbon tax in 2012, the cost of electricity rose by 15 percent in the first year and unemployment jumped by more than 10 percent. The revolt against the carbon tax cost two prime ministers their jobs, and the carbon tax was repealed in 2014.

In the U.S., proponents of the carbon tax have so far failed to enact legislation in a single state. Washington state saw a 2016 ballot initiative to implement the nation’s first carbon tax soundly defeated 59 percent to 41 percent.

In Vermont during the 2016 gubernatorial election, Republican then-candidate Phil Scott railed against his opponent Sue Minter’s support of the carbon tax as “a scheme to raise money through taxing gas and carbon fuels.” Scott won the election, becoming a Republican governor in the home state of Bernie Sanders.

It should not surprise anyone that the Scalise-McKinley resolution to condemn and repudiate any effort to enact a carbon or energy tax was organized and brought to the floor by Republicans. Every Democrat should be on record. Only seven Democrats voted for the resolution against energy taxes. Only six Republicans voted no.

Two parties with two very different policies. On one side, the Democrats supporting a major new energy tax — but won’t talk about it unless they have the presidency and Congress. On the other side, the Republican Party and President Trump firmly opposing efforts to increase the cost of energy through taxes or regulations.

Democrats hoping to win power and raise taxes should learn from shoplifters and pickpockets: It is best if you don’t telegraph your intentions.",2,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/op-eds/steve-scalise-grover-norquist-democrats-are-desperate-for-a-job-killing-cost-increasing-carbon-tax
305,Norquist,Grover,dailycaller,"We’ve long heard that Texas is the nation’s premier economic model. And rightfully so.

Texas has boasted one of the most impressive economic engines for many years. If it were its own country, Texas would have the 10th largest economy in the world. But while Texans themselves may not want to hear it, Tennessee is hot on their heels.

Both states have long been known for their free-market tendencies. Neither has an income tax on labor, both shun statewide minimum wage laws, and each state has long protected the right-to-work. And yet perhaps because of its size, Texas has always overshadowed the “other T.” But Tennessee is making a run at surpassing its long-time competitor.

Tennessee’s current unemployment rate is a half-point lower than that of Texas, and its economy has experienced steadier GDP growth over the past couple of years. As evidenced by the dozens of cranes dotting Nashville’s skyline and Chattanooga’s renaissance, Tennessee’s economy is roaring like never before.

Good economic policy has led to this recent meteoric rise.

First, Tennessee is slashing government red tape and getting out of the way of small businesses and entrepreneurs. In a recent survey on small business friendliness, Thumbtack rated Tennessee second in the nation, five spots ahead of Texas. This was primarily due to Tennessee’s overall lack of regulations on business, including labor, tax, and licensing regulations.

In fact, Tennessee is leading the nation in the reduction in government licensing barriers. It has eliminated licenses for multiple occupations in recent years and has also passed a Right to Earn a Living Act, which declares it a fundamental civil right to do a job free from unnecessary government interference.

Tennessee was also one of the first states to legalize ridesharing, preempting cities from imposing burdensome regulations.

In addition, fiscal restraint by politicians — while rare — is on display in Tennessee. The state currently has the lowest per capita debt in the nation. Texas taxpayers have nearly twice as much state debt hanging over their heads. And Tennessee just edges out Texas in overall state and local tax burdens.

According to the Tax Foundation, Tennessee’s overall tax burden is 7.3 percent compared to Texas’ 7.6 percent. With the repeal of its death tax and a full phase-out of its income tax on stocks and bonds slated for January 2022, Tennessee is continuing to find ways to return more money to taxpayers’ pockets. Since 2011, Tennesseans have benefited from more than $2.5 billion in tax cuts.

It’s true that Tennessee still has a ways to go and plenty of opportunities to improve. Tennesseans’ health outcomes are poor, parents have very limited educational options for their children and many remain stuck in generational cycles of poverty.

But state leaders can double down on good tax, fiscal, and regulatory policy, and by and large get government out of the way. And in doing so, they can ensure that Tennessee will no longer take a back seat to the state it helped found. Tennessee’s economic success is proving that maybe not everything is always bigger in Texas.

Texas has had the disadvantage of going through a lost decade over the last ten years in which Texas has not been able to implement needed free-market reforms and has lost ground to more innovative states like Tennessee, North Carolina and Arizona. The cause of this lost decade in Texas is House Speaker Joe Straus, who has made the Lone Star State’s lower chamber a graveyard for conservative reforms for years.

Why can’t Texas, a state seen as a bastion of conservatism, get rid of its egregious gross receipts tax on employers, referred to as the Margins Tax? Straus.

Why have efforts to provide school choice and educational opportunity to parents and students not been successful in Texas? Straus has played a key role in obstructing such reforms.

The good news is that Straus is retiring and won’t be returning to the state legislature next year. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) and state legislators in Austin will soon have the opportunity, beginning with the 2019 biennial session, to start keeping up with Tennessee, the nation’s new beacon for conservative reform and free market policy innovation.

307,Norquist,Grover,washingtonexaminer,"Last year, the Trump administration passed dramatic pro-growth, pro-family tax reform. Now, the administration is building on this success through a slew of new rules proposed by the Department of Labor and Department of Health and Human Services that will strengthen retirement savings, healthcare choice, and access to care for employees and employers as part of the administration’s regulatory reform.

The tax reform bill passed late last year has succeeded in raising wages and employee benefits have increased, while Americans at every income level have seen their taxes drop. The unemployment rate is at its lowest level since 1969 and small business optimism is at record high levels.

Business of all sizes are seeing tax reduction, while families and individuals will have more healthcare freedom through the repeal of the Obamacare individual mandate.

The administration is taking the next step by restoring choice and access for Americans across the country.

For instance, the Department of Labor and Secretary Alex Acosta have unveiled an association retirement plans rule that will allow small and mid-sized employers to band together to form a single retirement plan.

Today, too many workers are shut out of owning a retirement plan, which is causing a shortfall in savings. Although 42 million workers (roughly one-third of the workforce) are employed by a small business, (defined as a business with 1-100 workers), just 14 percent of these offer a retirement plan.

Nearly 75 percent of these workers have no retirement savings, according to a survey by Pew Charitable Trusts. Similarly, 25 percent of individuals ages 35-64 are likely to face a shortfall in retirement savings.

The DOL proposal will help address this problem by giving small businesses access to cost effective retirement plans that have the same protections and benefits that larger companies can offer.

More than one-third of small businesses cite cost as the main impediment, while others worry about the complexity and liability associated.

The new ARP rule will help address this problem by giving millions of workers access to individually owned retirement plans, like 401(k)s, that they can use to better prepare for their retirement.

This is just one example of the regulatory relief taken by the administration.

In contrast to the Obama administration, which pushed a healthcare model of top-down government control, the Trump administration is expanding choice and access.

The Trump Department of Health and Human Services and Secretary Alex Azar recently announced a rule expanding health reimbursement accounts so that small- and medium-sized employers can easily offer their workers an HRA to pay $1,800 of medical expenses per year.

More than 80 percent of small- and mid-sized employers offer their workers just one choice, and this rule will allow businesses more flexibility to offer their workers health insurance coverage.

In fact, the Treasury Department estimates that this will help 10 million workers and 800,000 businesses.

This regulatory relief is just one of many proposals undertaken by HHS. Earlier this year, the agency rolled out important flexibility over short-term, limited-duration health insurance plans by allowing families and individuals to purchase plans for 12 months with a total of 36 months of renewability.

These plans are exempt from Obamacare’s costly mandates and regulations, meaning more Americans will have access to affordable and flexible healthcare. As a result, these plans are expected to be 50 to 80 percent cheaper and will offer millions of Americans flexible care after several years of increasing premiums and narrowing choices in the Obamacare marketplace.

The administration has also allowed small businesses to band together and form association health plans.

Like the Labor Department's expansion of retirement plans, AHPs are giving workers the flexibility they need due to economies of scale. As an added benefit, these plans are exempt from many Obamacare regulations, which will mean lower costs and more choice for those that use them.

This dramatic deregulation over retirement savings and healthcare choice and access is just the latest Trump win.

The Trump tax cuts passed last year have resulted in a stronger economy, tax reduction for workers and businesses, and has increased take-home pay for families.

The administration’s regulatory reform will build on this success in a way that directly helps Americans plan for retirement and pay for healthcare across the country.

308,Norquist,Grover,thehill,"Just days ahead of the midterm elections, the contrast between the two political parties on taxes is as clear as ever. The Democrats are running on an agenda of higher taxes and bigger government. They have frequently promised to erode or outright repeal the tax cuts that have led to our thriving economy under President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE and the Republicans in Congress. Just this week, House Budget Committee ranking member John Yarmuth John Allen YarmuthDemocrats see political winner in tax fight McConnell knocks Kentucky Democrat over support for nixing filibuster Democrats vow to go 'bold' — with or without GOP MORE said that the Democrats will raise the corporate rate if they win the House. Senate Democrats have already proposed $1 trillion in tax hikes, including income tax increases on families and businesses.

Many candidates on the left want to go further and are proposing massive tax increases to pay for vast new federal government programs. For instance, 150 Democrats in the House and Senate and many more running for office are pushing single payer health care, a dramatic expansion of government that will require trillions of dollars in tax hikes every year. As a candidate for president in 2016, Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersOvernight Energy: Treasury creates hub to fight climate change through finance | Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez introduce 'Green New Deal for Public Housing' | Don't attack Zoom for its Bernie Sanders federal tax bill Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez introduce 'Green New Deal for Public Housing' MORE unveiled a single payer health care plan with a 6.2 percent payroll tax on every business totaling more than $10 trillion in additional taxes and a 2.2 percent payroll tax on families and individuals totaling $2 trillion over the next decade.

Even as the Democrats push higher taxes, the success of the Republican tax cut legislation is clear. Tax reform lowered our corporate rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and updated the international system of taxation so that American businesses finally have a more level playing field. Because of these effective policies, the United States has been named the most competitive economy in the world for the first time in years.

Thanks to these tax cuts pushed by President Trump, our economy expanded at a rate of 3.5 percent in the third quarter of 2018 and is on track for the strongest growth in 13 years. This success stands in stark contrast to the 1.9 percent growth rate experienced under President Obama. Wage growth is up, with lower income earners seeing especially strong growth. The labor market is strong with job openings are at a record high and more Americans are voluntarily quitting their jobs for better ones than ever before. The unemployment rate is down to the lowest level since 1969, while the rates for demographics including women, African Americans, and Hispanics are also at record lows.

Small business optimism is at the highest level in 45 years, with owners reporting more investment and spending. Similarly, manufacturer optimism has hit a record high in the past year. Because of tax reform, businesses are giving their employees raises, putting money in education and adoption programs, hiring more workers, and increasing retirement benefits, while utility companies are reducing rates across the nation.

In addition to worker benefits, Americans now have higher wages. At least 90 percent of wage earners are enjoying more dollars in take home pay because of tax reform. This year, the typical individual will save an average of $1,400, while a married couple with two children will save an average of $2,900. Over the next decade, an individual will take home an additional $26,000, while a family of four will see almost $45,000 more in pay after taxes, according to research by the Heritage Foundation. Even as the Democrats promote ideas that will erode these benefits, the Republicans have been hard at work building on continued success of tax reform.

The House has already passed a second round of tax cuts. This package of legislation promotes individual saving through the expansion retirement and education accounts as well as the creation of a universal savings account, promotes entrepreneurship, and strengthens the small business and individual tax cuts already in place. President Trump has even said he wants more tax relief focused on an additional 10 percent tax cut for the middle class. When it comes to jobs and the economy, the Republicans have a clear record. The tax cuts passed by the party have led to a strong economy, higher wages, and more jobs. The Democrats are running to erase these gains in place of increased taxes and bigger government.

309,Norquist,Grover,thehill,"Following passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) last year, Republicans in Congress and President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE have vowed to continue updating the tax code to further promote economic growth, maintain American competitiveness, and strengthen middle class tax reduction.

The House will take the first step in fulfilling this promise by taking up a package of legislation this week known as “Tax Reform 2.0.” This legislation, proposed by Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady Kevin Patrick BradyBuchanan to seek top GOP position on Ways and Means Committee The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Tax March - CDC in limbo on J&J vax verdict; Rep. Brady retiring On The Money: Senate confirms Gensler to lead SEC | Senate GOP to face off over earmarks next week | Top Republican on House tax panel to retire MORE (R-Texas), will begin where TCJA left off by making middle class and small business tax reduction permanent.

Thanks to TCJA, 90 percent of wage earners are seeing higher take-home pay. A family of four earning the median annual income $73,000 per year will see a 58 percent reduction in federal taxes, while a single parent with one child earning $41,000 will see a 73 percent reduction in federal taxes.

The standard deduction was doubled from $6,000 to $12,000 ($12,000 to $24,000 for a family), which significantly reduced taxes for the 105 million families and individuals who took the deduction before TCJA. It also will lead to dramatic simplification of the code by increasing the number of taxpayers who can file on a single page from 66 percent to 93 percent.

Tax reform further simplified the code by reducing the alternative minimum tax so that 96 percent of the 4.5 million Americans no longer need to calculate under this complex provision. The bill was also pro-family as it doubled the child tax credit from $1,000 to $2,000 benefiting the 22 million families that take the credit.

Small businesses also see tax relief in the form of a 20 percent deduction for the more than 30 million pass-through entities, while family owned businesses see relief from the death tax due to the doubling of the exemption from $5.5 million to $11 million.

Unfortunately, this tax reduction could not be made permanent because of obstruction from the left and arcane Senate rules. These constraints forced lawmakers to sunset many provisions starting in 2026. Republicans have said since passage of TCJA that they want to make these provisions permanent and tax Reform 2.0 is the first step toward doing so.

Tax Reform 2.0 is more than just a sequel to the TCJA. It contains a number of important new proposals that modernize tax-advantaged savings accounts and promote entrepreneurship and innovation. Individual retirement accounts are updated so that businesses have more flexibility to fund employee plans and individuals have more flexibility to contribute. Families will be able to withdraw $7,500 from an account to pay for the expenses of childbirth or adoption.

Universal savings accounts are created allowing families to save and invest $2,500 of their own after-tax earnings. 529 education savings accounts will be expanded so families can use these funds on apprenticeship programs and to cover home schooling expenses.

Start-up businesses will also be granted important flexibility and tax reduction so they can recover of their initial expenses and bring in new investors to retain access to important tax benefits like the research and development tax credit.

While the GOP is poised to take the next step in updating the tax code, Democrats are relentlessly running on an agenda of higher taxes on the American people. Senate Democrats have already called for a one trillion dollar tax increase, while House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiWhite House readies for Chauvin verdict House GOP's McClain responds to Pelosi calling her 'that woman' GOP struggles to rein in nativism MORE (D-Calif.) has called for full repeal of the GOP tax cuts.

Many on the left want to go further by imposing massive trillion dollars-a-year tax hikes as part of a plan to impose government controlled single-payer healthcare. When Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersOvernight Energy: Treasury creates hub to fight climate change through finance | Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez introduce 'Green New Deal for Public Housing' | Don't attack Zoom for its Bernie Sanders federal tax bill Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez introduce 'Green New Deal for Public Housing' MORE ran on this plan during the 2016 Presidential election, he proposed a 6.2 percent payroll tax on businesses that would increase taxes by $10 trillion over a decade and a 2.2 percent payroll tax on families and individuals totaling $2 trillion. The Sanders campaign also proposed trillion-dollar income tax, death tax, and capital gains tax increases.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law last year updated the tax code after three decades of the U.S. falling behind the rest of the world. This law has resulted in higher take-home pay, increases in employee benefits, and a stronger economy.

While Democrats want to erase this progress with reckless tax hikes, Republicans have pledged to continue updating the tax code and building on middle class tax reduction and pro-growth tax reform. This commitment starts with a vote on tax reform 2.0 this week.

311,Norquist,Grover,thehill,"At the end of its last term, the Supreme Court voted to strengthen the Constitution in a 6-3 vote that was a long overdue decision to end a law that said “some states are more equal than others.” The question before the court was a 1992 law that banned states from regulating and taxing sports betting except in Nevada and three other states. The court ruled instead that all 50 states have to be treated the same, and that the federal government could not tell the states what to legalize or ban. While gambling can be a contentious issue, this makes it even more appropriate for states to decide, rather than a “one size fits all” federal approach.

It is a great victory for federalism, the mechanism that limits the size and scope of government by requiring 50 states to compete to provide the best and lowest cost government. States compete for citizens who are free to move. States compete for business investment that moves quickly towards competent government, serious rule of law, lower taxes, and less regulation. Now the House Judiciary Committee plans to look into the issue and will be happy to find that the court decision is not only a victory for restoring the Constitution, federalism, and the equality of the states, but it can also create jobs and increase American wealth.

ADVERTISEMENT

A 2017 study by Oxford Economics predicts that legalizing sports betting nationwide would create more than 200,000 jobs and increase the gross domestic product by $22 billion every year. But the more important victory is for federalism that will lead to better government in all 50 states. To put this missed opportunity in perspective, an estimated $4.5 billion was spent on legal sports betting in Nevada last year. By comparison, experts think more than 20 times that amount was spent on illegal sports betting in the same year. Unsurprisingly, lawmakers across the country have been eager to bring this booming industry to their state legally.

In recent years, a handful of states had legal frameworks ready to go in preparation for the expected Supreme Court decision, including New Jersey, which brought the case, Mississippi, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia, while more than a dozen other states have bills in the deck. As lawmakers in those states and others continue to work to legalize sports betting, they should keep in mind that there are both smart and stupid ways to do this. If done correctly, the legalization of sports betting is a way for state lawmakers to raise revenue without raising taxes. As is the case with every industry, the best way to maximize the benefits of legal sports betting is to avoid imposing burdensome regulations, and costly taxes and fees, as they would remove the incentive to move things from the untaxed black market to the taxable and legal marketplace.

While it is great that four states have, in anticipation of this Supreme Court decision, legalized sports betting in their states, Pennsylvania was particularly boneheaded in its approach. The Keystone State enacted a whopping 34 percent tax on wagered revenue plus an additional 2 percent “local share assessment” tax. In addition, it also forces casino operators to pay a $10 million licensing fee if they want to offer sports gambling. By comparison, Nevada taxes sports betting at 6.5 percent of what a casino takes in from bets minus what they pay out in winnings.

It is clear that lawmakers in Pennsylvania were more interested in voting for pretend mountains of tax dollars they could spend at leisure. The Supreme Court endorsement of federalism widens the door to allow states to experiment with expanding liberty through school choice, home schooling, medical marijuana, and right to work and many other decisions that should not be driven by Washington. The only shadow cast on this good news for self government is a threat from some congressmen and senators who have suggested that Washington should regulate what they can no longer ban, which is betting on sports. That includes the threat of a federal government mandated payout to the National Football League, National Hockey League, and National Collegiate Athletic Association at the expense of fans coyly called an “integrity” fee.

The states are capable of regulating betting. They do so in other contexts and this should be no different. Government regulation to achieve a mandated payout for leagues is not a reason for federal intervention. Light touch regulation is more likely to be achieved with a free market. Let the states compete on sports betting and fans and taxpayers will win.

312,Norquist,Grover,ozy,"Ronald Reagan overcame the Soviets without spending more than 7 percent of the GDP on the military. Why isn’t a small government possible now?

How large should the government be?

Many Americans side with Henry David Thoreau’s maxim: “That government governs best that governs least.” They agree with Sam Houston’s advice to “govern wisely and as little as possible.” Critics of big government are not anarchists demanding no government — just as a diet is not a wish to disappear. Cancer doctors are not “anti-cell”; they fight cells that grow so rapidly they threaten a person’s life.

Yet, we have now lived with heavy-handed government at the national, state and local levels for so long that we might wonder if limited government would work. Would it keep us safe?

History gives us some guidance. Back in 1774, American colonists paid between 1 and 2 percent of their incomes in total taxation, compared to today’s 35 percent. The American colonies were among the wealthiest on the planet, while British taxpayers in London were paying 20 percent of their income to the crown.

Wars and the welfare state are major culprits. Address those, and you have a big piece of the solution.

How did America keep taxes low back then? Our government avoided many things other nations did. We didn’t pick your religion and burn you at the stake if you misunderstood scripture. We didn’t run an empire. We treated (most) Americans well enough that the State did not require a standing army as an occupying force.

After the taxes for the War of 1812 were repealed, successive U.S. national governments, from President Monroe to President Lincoln, ran on tariffs and land sales, with total spending across levels of government never topping 4 percent of the economy. As late as 1900, total government spending was 8 percent of the economy. It was 13 percent in 1930.

So how did our governments — federal, state and local — get so fat that they spend 35 percent of the national economy? Wars and the welfare state are major culprits. Address those, and you have a big piece of the solution.

Every war has seen government spending spike and then fail to return to its previous size. But defense spending can be reduced. Dwight Eisenhower’s presidency spent 10 percent of the GDP on the Pentagon. Ronald Reagan won the Cold War, scattered the Soviet empire and pushed Russia’s borders back 1,000 miles, never spending more than 7 percent of the GDP on the military. Defense spending is now 4 percent. We cut the cost of the heavily armed bits of the federal government by half. The rest of the Leviathan should be easier to shrink.

There was no longstanding national consensus to create and expand the welfare state. Half our national government spending was created in just four years: the New Deal years of 1934–36 and the Great Society years of 1964–66. Take away those entitlement programs, and federal spending would be 10 percent of the economy, not 20 percent. Here’s how we can reform those programs to reduce their cost:

Move all government pensions and Social Security from a defined benefit, pay-as-you-go system (some might call it a Ponzi scheme) to a defined contribution plan just as the private sector and many states have done. The Tax Foundation calculates that the average American would retire with more than $1 million in assets if he invested his and his employer’s Federal Insurance Contributions Act taxes in the stock market. Utah moved all new government hires to a defined contribution — 401(k)/IRA — pension in 2010. If all 50 states do so, the now–$6 trillion unfunded liabilities in state pension programs would phase out to zero.

Expand on Bill Clinton’s 1996 reform of more than 180 means-tested welfare programs. He block-granted Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) to the states, imposed work requirements and capped the growth of spending but otherwise allowed the 50 states to compete to provide the best government at the lowest cost. AFDC spending fell about 18 percent from 1990 to 2001. What if we had saved 18 percent, or $4 trillion, of the $22 trillion that the Great Society programs cost taxpayers between 1965 and 2015? We can, going forward.

End the post office’s legal monopoly on first-class mail. Let FedEx, UPS and others compete to move packages and mail. The post office employs more Americans than the U.S. Army does for active duty. Private competition would mean faster, more certain delivery, at lower costs. The tens of billions in taxpayer subsidies to this monopoly would end.

The Calvert bill — moved by California Republican Congressman Ken Calvert — would through attrition reduce the number of civilian employees at the Pentagon by 15 percent (108,600 employees). This would save more than $100,000 per employee in pay, benefits and pensions each year.

End all corporate welfare: The Cato Institute estimates the federal government spends more than $100 billion annually on this.

Fire deaths and damage have fallen due to smoke alarms, sprinkler systems and better housing construction, reducing the need for the fire service. Uber and — soon — self-driving cars will continue to displace government-run subways. Technology is making what government does at great expense less necessary.



Repeal the Davis-Bacon Act, which increases the cost of all federal contracting by some 25 percent by insisting on local minimum wages for public works for laborers and mechanics. Michigan, Wisconsin, Kentucky and West Virginia recently repealed mini-Davis-Bacon acts or prevailing wage laws they had enacted. This means more roads and bridges at the same cost.

And how do we get from the present welfare/warfare state, plus-size government to one that is svelte and competent? Step by step, by reforming the government to cost less over time and allowing 50 states to compete to create the most cost-effective government. Budget cuts aren’t needed. Consistent reform and restraint over time will do.

The “gridlock,” when President Bill Clinton and the Republican Congress cut the capital gains tax but could not agree on a new, more expensive budget, reduced federal spending from 19.33 percent to 17.45 percent of the GDP from 1996 to 2000. The 2011 “sequester” that President Barack Obama and a Republican Congress enacted brought federal spending down from 23.18 percent to 20.01 percent in 2014. At the state level, the California government would be spending $29 billion less today had it simply increased its spending no faster than its citizens increased their incomes.

Grow the economy at 4 percent a year — get back to Reagan-like rates, rather than Obama’s 2 percent average a year. Simultaneously, maintain budget restraint at every level of government.

The government, with these reforms in place, could use a much smaller part of your family budget. There’s no need to push full on to Ayn Rand’s Galt’s Gulch.

Freedom is addictive and contagious. America has thrived over the centuries when it moved toward “less” government and “more” freedom. That’s what it needs again.",2,https://www.ozy.com/opinion/can-america-be-a-successful-low-tax-society-again/88837
313,Norquist,Grover,tampabay,"Most people want to live in a safe, secure neighborhood. They want their politicians to be tough when it comes to fighting crime.

Floridians increasingly want their criminal justice system to be smart and rehabilitate criminals, rather than just spending money to punish them. In a recent poll commissioned by Right on Crime, a majority of voters said they believe the criminal justice system should focus on rehabilitation policies.

Yet, currently Florida sees one-in-four released inmates return to prison within three years of release. The prison population hovers around 100,000, the system is understaffed, and it's all expensive: costing over $2 billion annually.

These are clear signs the system is not delivering what Floridians want.

The good news? Being tough on crime and smart on criminal justice go hand-in-hand, presenting a big opportunity for politicians running for office to put reform on the agenda.

In recent years, right-of-center leaders in red states across the country have pursued criminal justice reforms, and their efforts have yielded lower crime, reduced recidivism, reduced prison populations, and big savings for taxpayers.

Redefining ""tough on crime"" required nothing new or groundbreaking. Instead, it meant simply applying longstanding conservative principles — fiscal discipline and bureaucratic accountability, chief among them — to the criminal justice system.

Many conservatives began asking if there was a better way to hold offenders accountable, prepare inmates for re-entry into society, and stop the vicious cycle of drug abuse, crime, and disorder that threatens the rule of law. They asked whether taxpayers were getting the best bang for their buck. After consulting the available evidence, they realized the answer was a resounding ""no,"" and then they got to work.

The first state to lead by example was Texas.

In late 2006, Texas lawmakers were warned that by 2012, the state prison system would need nearly 18,000 new beds at a cost of nearly $2 billion. To avoid this, state legislators adopted a new strategy. They used data to look at the drivers of their prison population.

Instead of spending money for more prisons, they pursued programs to divert low-level offenders from prison, offered drug and alcohol treatment in prison, expanded mental health treatment options, and supported specialty courts like Veterans Court and Drug Court, among other reforms.

Notably, Texas has raised its ""felony theft threshold"" to $2,500, among the highest in the nation, and Texas has never adopted mandatory minimum drug sentencing laws.

The results have been astonishing. Not only did Texas avoid having to build new prisons, Texas has actually closed eight adult facilities, and another eight juvenile facilities. Arrest rates are down, parole revocations are down, and fewer people are on felony probation. Most importantly, the Texas crime rate is currently lower than at any point since 1967.

Red states like Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina have also led in pursuing reform.

Florida has not. The state has expanded its criminal code, turning misdemeanors into felonies, and felonies into more severe felonies, added sentencing enhancements to those felonies, and mandatory minimums on top of the sentencing enhancements.

This has added to the billions in costs and kept Florida's prison population and crime rates above the national average.

Now is the time for Florida to adopt a smarter approach, while remaining tough on crime. State leaders can deliver the system voters desire by following the model of evidence-based reform.

A smart approach to reform would reduce recidivism to prevent crime, not just punish offenders after the fact.

It would prepare inmates — the overwhelming majority of whom will be released — for re-entry into society so they stay on the straight and narrow.

It would prioritize prison space for violent and repeat criminals, not mandate that first-time drug offenders stay behind bars for decades at a time.

And it would give law enforcement the resources to catch dangerous criminals, not waste hundreds of millions of dollars on unnecessary incarceration of low-risk offenders.

Voters should keep this in mind at the ballot box. A better justice system means lower spending, better results, and most importantly safer communities. We now have the data to pursue policies that allow for law enforcement to effectively target dangerous criminals, while providing opportunities for non-violent offenders to become taxpayers, not tax burdens. That is being tough, and smart.

For the Tribune

Montana Governor Steve Bullock’s Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) took an unprecedented step last month in its efforts to block the opening of the Rock Creek and Montanore mines in Sanders and Lincoln counties, projects that would create hundreds of jobs for Montana workers.

Bullock’s DEQ has opposed Hecla Mining Company’s attempt to open these projects on the bogus claim that Hecla Mining Company is somehow responsible for the actions of a separate company from over 20 years ago. When Phillips Baker, Hecla’s CEO, appealed to the courts to overturn the DEQ’s decision, the DEQ responded by slapping him with a counter lawsuit targeting Baker as an individual. This marks the first time the DEQ has ever applied the related statute to an individual, and this could establish a dangerous precedent. Bullock’s DEQ arrived at this flawed legal interpretation by deciding its regulatory authority exists to shill for the far-left environmental lobby.

A coalition of environmental groups, led by the organizations Earthjustice and Montana Conservation Voters (MCV), is fighting against these two mining projects by any means necessary. Earthjustice has led the lobbying effort to stop these mines long before Hecla even purchased them. The targeting of Hecla is just the latest move from the environmental lobby’s bag of tricks to shut down mining operations in Montana. In fact, it was this same coalition that first gave DEQ the idea to target Hecla’s CEO personally in hopes of halting these projects.

So, how did this environmental coalition gain so much influence within Governor Bullock’s administration? MCV is the same organization that during the 2016 election formed a political action committee to spend $500,000 on Bullock’s reelection. It’s safe to assume that Bullock owed MCV a few favors and that his bureaucrats at the DEQ took their calls.

While $500,000 may seem like a lot of money to spend killing a Montana mining project, these anti-development groups viewed this as money well spent.

For them, Baker is the ideal target because he also serves as the chairman of the National Mining Association. Trying to force Hecla’s CEO to step down would be seen as a larger victory with far-reaching national implications.

The people of Lincoln and Sanders counties are no strangers to the radical anti-development lobby operating in Montana. Libby once was home to five operational timber mills that provided well-paying jobs to the town’s residents. In the 1990s, local residents were swept up in the green lobby’s “timber wars” crusade to block logging on the National Forest lands that form much of Lincoln County. The environmentalists won and as a result Libby lost its last logging mill in 2002.

Today, the residents of Lincoln and Sanders counties struggle through economic hardship. Both counties have an unemployment rate twice the state average. Residents are rightly looking for answers and are enraged by the DEQ’s decision to block 600 jobs in their community.

Attacking these mining projects has also been politically expensive for Bullock at the local level. State lawmakers have rallied around the issue with over 50 state legislators publicly calling out Bullock over his administration’s treatment of Hecla. Local leaders have accused Bullock of holding jobs hostage for political gains.

However, Bullock’s attention is focused on national politics rather than the needs of Montana’s workers. Bullock recently spent time fundraising in Iowa and testing the waters for a 2020 presidential run. Bullock knows that to win the primary of a rapidly left moving Democratic party he will need the support of the environmental lobby and groups like Earthjustice. The simple truth is that Bullock is now more interested in donors from California and New York than he is in workers and families from Lincoln and Sanders counties.

Last year’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was a huge victory for the U.S., and we applaud the Trump administration for this historic achievement. It has already begun to spur economic growth and help our entrepreneurs create new jobs. Likewise, efforts to pare back unnecessary, burdensome regulations have been a boon to American innovation and growth. Our organizations are proud to have worked alongside President Trump and his administration on these important pro-growth economic reforms, and we look forward to continuing this partnership going forward.

It is out of this mutual dedication to improving the future of America’s economy that we are now deeply concerned about the administration’s approach to trade and international commerce. We support negotiations to reduce foreign barriers, while at the same time keeping in mind that U.S. government-imposed restrictions act as a tax on American consumers, raise costs for our manufacturers and drive our jobs to other countries. As principled advocates for free markets, our organizations oppose tariffs, quotas and other impediments to the free flow of goods and services.

Trade war hurts American businesses

We strongly support efforts to open up international markets to U.S. products, encourage other nations to reform their state-owned enterprises and urge our partners to reduce tariffs as much as possible. Nonetheless, the threat of tariffs or use of similar tactics should never carry with them the long-term intentional goal of reduced trade with our allies. Similarly, we oppose the use of trade policy to protect specific industries or companies at the expense of the larger economy. After all, it is American citizens and businesses who would ultimately pay the high costs caused by limitations on trade.

Donald Trump promised a trade war. Should we let his voters get what they asked for?

Congress should act now to limit Trump's power to wage trade wars and impose tariffs

Like the president, we believe that increasing economic growth in America is of paramount importance. The best way to continue our current economic expansion is through free market policies like low, competitive taxes, light-touch regulation and international commerce free of government-imposed restrictions. Our strong trading partnerships across the globe make not only the American economy healthier, but improve the economic condition of our allies and promote peace.

Free trade is mutually beneficial

Likewise, we share in and applaud President Trump's commitment to the American worker. They too are best served by a growing economy and the mutual gains that come from free trade. Our hard-working farmers are highly dependent on having access to international markets. And our manufacturing sector depends on the import of raw materials and intermediate goods. Businesses, workers and consumers all benefit from trade.

When it comes to reevaluating and renegotiating our trade pacts, we urge the president to expand international commerce and establish permanent deals that will allow businesses to make long-lasting investments in the American economy. The goal should be to tear down trade barriers, not erect new ones. The expansion of free trade yields mutual gains that benefit Americans and our trading partners.

We look forward to working with the Trump administration to expand free trade and continue our nation’s long-standing commitment to this essential component of free-market economics. The growth and prosperity that will ensue would be yet another great achievement worthy of applause.

316,Norquist,Grover,foreignpolicy,"Tea, Taxes, and the Revolution

When demonstrations erupted nationwide in March and April 2009 in opposition to the tax and spending policies of the just-inaugurated Barack Obama administration, the protesters named their movement and cause after the Boston Tea Party of Dec. 16, 1773, when Massachusetts colonists dumped British tea into Boston Harbor in the world’s most famous tax revolt. Thus was the ""Tea Party"" movement reborn.

The Tea Party name suggests an anti-tax protest rooted in American history and consistent with the original intent of our nation’s founding. If one is grabbing the political high ground in an American debate, this is the equivalent of placing your cannons atop Bunker Hill. (The Tea Party, it is worth noting, is assigning itself the winning team in that previous conflict.)

Is the comparison accurate or invented? How does the level and modes of taxation in modern America compare with the taxation of the British colonies, which led to an eight-year war that cost 25,000 American lives and ultimately broke apart the British Empire to create the United States of America? What parallels or paradoxes exist?

Americans often observe that our national independence was born of a tax revolt. But taxes, or the lack thereof, played a key role in the colonies long before Samuel Adams and his Sons of Liberty. The 1629 Charter of Massachusetts Bay granted settlers a seven-year exemption from customs taxes on all trade to and from Britain and a 21-year exemption from all other taxes. In 1621, the Dutch government granted the Dutch West India Company an eight-year exemption from all trade duties between New Amsterdam/New York and the mother country. Swedish settlers in Delaware were offered a 10-year tax exemption. America, in other words, was in part created as a tax haven populated with immigrants moving from high-tax nations to low-tax colonies.

By 1714, British citizens in Great Britain were paying on a per capita basis 10 times as much in taxes as the average ""American"" in the 13 colonies, though some colonies had higher taxes than others. Britons, for example, paid 5.4 times as much in taxes as taxpayers in Massachusetts, 18 times as much as Connecticut Yankees, 6.3 times as much as New Yorkers, 15.5 times as much as Virginians; and 35.8 times as much as Pennsylvanians.

Low-taxed Pennsylvania was founded by William Penn, the father of American religious liberty, who also notably refused the Pennsylvania General Assembly’s kind offer to establish an import and export tax for his personal benefit.

Taxation in the colonies consisted of property taxes, poll taxes on men over 18, excise taxes, and forced labor contributions of a few days a month to build roads and assume other ""public functions"" such as constable, assessor, or ""hog reeve"" (""an officer charged with the prevention or appraising of damages by stray swine,"" according to the Oxford English Dictionary).

Massachusetts imposed an embryonic income tax in 1634 in the form of a ""faculty"" tax. In 1643, Alvin Rabushka writes in Taxation in Colonial America, ""assessors were appointed to rate inhabitants on their estates and their faculties, which included personal abilities."" One notes with some envy that the tax came to about 1 percent of what we might call income.

Connecticut, anticipating New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s nanny-state tendencies, imposed sumptuary laws in 1676 that taxed any person who wore silk ribbons, gold or silver lace, or gold or silver buttons.

By 1775, the British government was consuming one-fifth of its citizens’ GDP, while New Englanders were only paying between 1 and 2 percent of their income in taxes. British citizens were also weighed down with a national debt piled up by years of worldwide warfare that amounted to £15 for each of the crown’s eight million subjects, while American local and colonial governments were almost debt-free. Against this backdrop, Americans watched as the British monarchy attempted to raise taxes on the colonists to pay down its war debt and pay for the 10,000 British soldiers barracked in the colonies.

The Sugar Act of 1764, a rewrite of the Plantation Duty of 1673, was designed to raise revenue rather than force the colonies to trade with England alone, and fell mostly on molasses, sugar, and Madeira wine. The colonies reacted particularly poorly to the imposition of the Stamp Act of 1765, which was an effort to impose a direct tax on the colonies rather than tax imports and exports. Benjamin Franklin and others argued to the British government that while the colonies did not object to tariffs, they did oppose direct domestic ""taxation without representation.""

The British parliament got the message, repealing the Stamp Act and responding with the Townshend Acts of 1767, which imposed duties on 72 items, including tea (the changes actually reduced taxes on tea originally imported from British colonies to combat the smuggling of Dutch tea to America). Although the British repealed most of these duties in 1770, they maintained the specific tax on tea to make the point that the crown could tax when it chose to do so. By then, however, the American colonists had stopped distinguishing between domestic and trade taxes and started opposing all taxation and control by Britain, setting the stage for the revolution.

The bottom line: American colonists were both paid more and taxed less than the British. American taxes, in fact, were low and going lower, but the very idea that they had been raised and could be raised again by a distant power was enough to send Americans into the streets to engage in civil disobedience. Regime change followed the tax revolt.

And 239 years later, what has changed?

Americans are still wealthier and taxed less than the citizens of other nations. By some measures, federal taxes are lower today than they were in the past: Today’s top marginal tax rate for individuals is 35 percent, which is higher than Ronald Reagan’s 28 percent but lower than Dwight Eisenhower’s 90 percent. State and local taxes, meanwhile, have undoubtedly been trending upward.

Three shocks to the system early on in Obama’s presidency in many ways mimicked the Townshend Acts in convincing Americans they have much to fear in the future.

The first shock came in 2009, when one-party rule by Democratic supermajorities in the Senate and House of Representatives, allied with a president of the same party, ensured that Washington could enact just about any tax or spending legislation it wished. The first of four stimulus bills, signed on Feb. 17, 2009, called for $878 billion in spending, and Congress added another $1 trillion in domestic discretionary spending over the next decade. Modern-day anti-tax activists felt as removed from control of their government as the colonists did in 1775. Promises that taxes would only be imposed on ""the rich"" were betrayed 16 days into Obama’s presidency, when legislation was enacted to increase the tax on cigarettes — a product whose consumers average $40,000 in annual income.

Second, while the economy stalled, the White House introduced a new and costly entitlement in ""Obamacare,"" which contained 20 new taxes that cost Americans between $500 and $800 billion over a decade. Seven of these taxes directly hit the middle class, and the Congressional Budget Office’s 10-year cost estimate for Obamacare officially doubled after the legislation was enacted.

Third, a series of repeatedly renewed yet ""temporary"" tax reductions were set to expire in January 2011. Left unchanged, the Alternative Minimum Tax, imposed in 1969 to punish 155 rich Americans who invested in municipal bonds, would hit 31 million Americans. The tax rate on capital gains would jump from 15 percent to 23.8 percent, while the dividend tax would increase from 15 percent to 44.3 percent. All told, taxes would increase by about $500 billion in one year alone. (This Taxmageddon was ultimately postponed by two years — until Jan. 1, 2013.)

The British imposed the de minimis tax on tea to make the point they had the power to implement such measures and more when they wished. Obama, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi passed a 2,600-page entitlement program — written not in front of C-SPAN cameras as promised, but in camera — and explained to the rabble that the government had to pass the legislation so that its subjects could learn what was in it.

The American people responded to this display of raw, unchecked power. During the week of April 15, 2009, an estimated 600,000 protesters attended more than 600 Tea Party rallies across the country. These were not student demonstrators, unburdened by jobs or family obligations, but employed, middle-class Americans, most of whom had never been to a political protest and never expected to join one.

These modern Tea Partiers performed surprisingly few ""tar and featherings,"" and yet the establishment media complained about their excessive rhetoric. Still, the protesters never quite rivaled the vehemence with which John Adam denounced the Sugar Act for imposing ""enormous taxes, burdensome taxes, oppressive, ruinous, intolerable taxes.""

In both 2009 and 1775, opposition to taxes was eventually replaced by a demand for liberty and protection against government power. The Fourth Amendment’s protection against search and seizure and ""writs of assistance"" were specifically designed to protect against the tax collectors of the day searching for smuggled goods and confiscating shipping. Today, after being at the receiving end of what Republican congressmen view as unwarranted and indiscriminate IRS investigations, Tea Partiers are demanding legal changes to prevent the government from using the IRS to police opposition groups.

The 2010 election was a middle-class revolt that ended one-party rule in Washington and gave the opposition a strong majority in the House and strength in the Senate. Obama and Reid have responded to this impertinence with their own Intolerable Acts — governing through executive orders and regulations, and adding to the spending and debt explosion of the previous two years. There has been no reform, no moderation, and no compromise. Most recently, in the Supreme Court’s ruling on Obamacare, Chief Justice John Roberts made it official that no power is beyond the federal government if taxation is used as the whip to enforce compliance.

Americans for Tax Reform

The Supreme Court decision allowing state and local governments to tax internet sales will damage American businesses nationwide. Now politicians from over 10,000 state and local taxing jurisdictions are empowered to tax out-of-state businesses, and these tax powers could be retroactive. Smaller businesses will find themselves threatened with audits and tax liens by counties they cannot pronounce. Imagine the paperwork. The number of potential tax returns is mind-boggling.

Every business large and small will be responsible for knowing the sales tax rates in all the counties, towns, cities and states in the nation.

The ruling is a Pandora’s box for expansive state taxing authority. This court decision is not limited to expanding the targets of the state sales tax. Politicians will use this court decision as a green light to export their income tax to individuals and companies in other states.

If physical nexus is no longer required to hit someone with a sales tax, there is no reason he or she has to live in your state to be the target of corporate or individual income taxes. Now, California (or any state or city that loses people fleeing high taxes) can tax people and businesses who do their best to avoid that state or city.

Worse, this decision opens up all U.S. businesses to taxation by the European Union, which is looking for excuses to export its tax burden to America’s leading innovative and profitable enterprises. And, look, the French will say, “Even the U.S. Supreme Court admits that one can tax outside one’s own jurisdiction. If California can tax a business in Missouri, so can France.”

This is wrong.

Politicians shouldn’t be able to tax people who do not live or work in their state; Americans fought a war over taxation without representation. Now it is necessary for Congress to protect Americans by establishing firmly in law that a business or person must be within a state’s physical borders in order for politicians to impose any tax.

320,Norquist,Grover,ozy,"Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, is in the thick of politics more than most. Here’s what he has to say about President Trump’s new tax plan.

There are a whopping 2.2 million American men and women living in cages. The breakdown is 225,000 in U.S. federal prisons, 1,316,000 in state prisons and 615,000 in county and city jails — at an average annual cost to taxpayers of $33,274 each. Ninety-five percent will return to the general population when their sentences end, and nearly 70 percent will be back behind bars within three years.

These numbers were not always so high. Total incarceration was 160,000 in 1950, 213,000 in 1960, 196,000 in 1970, 330,000 in 1980; it lurched upward to 774,000 in 1990, 1,236,000 in 2000 and 1,612,000 in 2010.

The political right and left have starkly different narratives as to how we got here. And yet, while Republicans and Democrats in Washington, D.C., remain gridlocked on mega issues like taxes, spending, labor law, regulations and judicial appointments; at the state level, elected officials from both parties have passed and signed into law significant criminal justice reforms that have begun to reduce the levels of incarceration in 33 states.

Texas, the state that has led the nation in executing murderers, has demonstrated that you can be both tough and smart on crime while putting fewer people in prison for shorter sentences.

So why now? Crime has for decades been one of the more divisive and politically charged issues. Richard Nixon ran on “law and order” in 1968. Ed Koch won the 1973 mayor’s race in New York City campaigning in support of the death penalty. William Horton’s furlough from a life sentence without parole for murdering Joseph Fournier and his subsequent rape of a woman in Maryland was a key factor in George H.W. Bush’s defeat of Michael Dukakis in 1992.

A few factors have enabled left/right coalitions at the state level to make progress on criminal justice reform. First, the crime rate has fallen and receded somewhat from the headlines. The number of murders has been in decline — from 7.9 per 100,000 in 1970 to 10.2 in 1980, and then 9.4 in 1990, 5.5 in 2000 and 4.9 in 2015. Second, fatigue has set in over the drug war. Today, 29 states have legalized medical marijuana, and nine states have legalized recreational use.

Third, Texas was the first state to make big moves to reform its justice system, back in 2005 when Gov. Rick Perry signed HB 1678, which incentivized drug courts to send drug users to rehab rather than prison. (Texas does not have mandatory minimum sentences.) Reform was driven in part because, without it, the Lone Star State would’ve needed to build 17,000 new prison beds at a cost of $2 billion. After the reform, Texas closed four prisons, reduced its incarceration numbers from 156,000 in 2011 to 146,000 in 2017, and the crime rate, including violent crime, fell. Which means that Texas, the state that has led the nation in executing murderers, has demonstrated you can be both tough and smart on crime while putting fewer people in prison for shorter sentences.

This Texas example had been in effect for five years when the GOP swept the 2010 elections resulting in 26 states with Republican governors and both houses of the Legislature Republican. Texas taught those states that criminal justice reform reduced costs over time, did not disrupt the declining crime rate and that no one in Texas lost an election for being “weak on crime.” The same initial success in Vermont might not have been as readily copied.

Fourth, the failures of the prison, court and justice system were ripe for reform. Civil asset forfeiture allows police to seize cars, cash and even homes if they “think” it was related to a crime. Often no conviction is needed; sometimes no formal charge is made. But how many victims take the risk of going to court and possibly spending more for lawyers than the car or cash were worth? In 2015, the Treasury and Justice Department took and kept more cash through civil asset forfeiture ($5 billion) than all the burglaries ($3.5 billion) in America.

An explosion of new crimes, owing to “overcriminalization,” has swelled the number of federal laws to 6,000 and regulations to 200,000 that could send you to prison. Many of those laws/regulations lack a mens rea (guilty mind) requirement, meaning you can go to prison for violating a law you never knew existed and for doing so without criminal intent.

Successes at reversing this trend at the state level might just lead to a win in Congress. On April 18, Van Jones (host of CNN’s The Van Jones Show) and Jared Kushner, first son-in-law, went to Congress to meet with dozens of legislators in support of the Prison Reform and Redemption Act co-sponsored by Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., and Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y. It would substantially refocus federal prison toward rehabilitation and increase the ability of inmates to win time off for successfully readying themselves for life back in the free world. The bill would also ensure that federal prisoners are housed within 500 miles of their home — making family visits and prisoner transport easier.

But what was a consensus issue heading for certain passage just weeks ago is now in doubt. A number of key Democrats are demanding that the modest reform of the federal prison system also include substantial sentencing reform that is less likely to win a House floor vote. Some have suggested that Democrats would do well to wait and see what happens in the November midterm elections before supporting first-step legislation (an approach that delayed and then killed criminal justice reform in the last two years of the Obama administration). But the debate is not entirely divided along party lines. The Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Iowa’s Sen. Chuck Grassley, is also holding firm for the more ambitious sentencing reforms, and Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, supports a clean prison reform bill.

Despite recent complications, criminal justice reform remains the most likely zone for bipartisan cooperation and progress in both the states and Congress. The newly amended and renamed First Step Act, now including some additional sentencing reform, was just approved by the House Judiciary Committee in a strong 25-5 vote. So, for now, the partisans are failing in their efforts to make the perfect the enemy of the good. We may soon have one step forward that could lead to further progress on additional sentencing reform, civil asset forfeiture, mens reas and overcriminalization.",2,https://www.ozy.com/opinion/van-jones-and-jared-kushner-walked-into-a-bar/86829

Americans are paying less in taxes

Ninety percent of wage earners around the country are already seeing increased take-home pay because of tax reform. Under the bill, a family of four with annual income of $73,000 will see a tax cut of more than $2,058, a 58 percent reduction in federal taxes. Similarly, a single parent with one child with annual income of $41,000 will see a tax cut of $1,304, a 73 percent reduction in federal taxes.

Workers are getting raises and bonuses

Immediately after passing of the GOP tax cuts bill, businesses responded by giving their employees pay raises and bonuses. AT&T announced it would provide each of its 200,000 U.S. employees with a

$1,000 bonus

. Altria is giving a

$3,000 bonus

to all of its 7,900 nonexecutive employees, and Wells Fargo has announced it will raise its minimum wage to

$15 per hour

.

Small businesses across the country have also announced increased employee pay. Harford Alarm Company in Maryland is giving a $1,000 bonus to each of its 13 employees, and Wichita Railway Services in Kansas has given bonuses between $3,000 and $6,000 to its five employees. Similarly, Anfinson Farm Store, a family-owned business in Iowa, has given its employees a $1,000 tax reform bonus and raised wages by 5 percent. Five Senses Spa Salon and Barbershop in Illinois gave $500 bonus to its 20 employees.

The country now has a fairer tax code

The tax bill implemented numerous provisions that will bring meaningful simplification to millions of families. Most notably, the tax cut dramatically expanded the standard deduction so that 93 percent of taxpayers will have a simplified tax code. The bill consolidated personal exemptions and the child tax credit, simplifying tax compliance for more than 22 million families. The threshold at which the alternative minimum tax hits taxpayers is also dramatically increased, offering relief for most of the 4.5 million Americans that pay this tax and millions more that are forced to comply with its added complexity.

The job market and economy are strong

The U.S. economy is strong because of the Republican policies of tax reform and deregulation that have emphasized promoting American competitiveness and economic growth. Under President Trump, the economy has grown at 2.9 percent annual growth in the past year, far outpacing the stagnant 2 percent economic growth under President Obama. Job openings have hit a record high of 6.6 million, while the unemployment rate is at a 3.9 percent, the lowest level since 2000. Real disposable income rose 3.4 percent in the first quarter of 2018, and nearly 800,000 jobs have been created since tax reform passed in December.

Businesses are strengthening programs

In addition to increasing employee pay, businesses are also giving their workers other benefits, including new childcare and adoption programs, as well as development programs because of tax reform. Walmart has announced it will give a $5,000 allowance for adoption expenses and 10 weeks of paid parental leave in addition to employee pay raises. Similarly, Walt Disney will spend $50 million in employee educational programs, while Boeing has announced $300 million to be spent on charitable donations, workforce development, and infrastructure improvement.

Families are getting relief from ObamaCare

The Affordable Care Act imposed a tax penalty of $695 for an individual and $2,085 for a family of four for failing to buy “qualifying” health insurance as defined by the federal government. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act repeals this unfair tax. This tax penalty is one of the most regressive taxes in the code. More than 6.6 million individuals and families paid the individual mandate tax penalties in 2015. Nearly 80 percent of taxpayers made less than $50,000 in annual income.

Utility companies are passing on savings

Utility companies across the country have responded to tax reform by lowering rates for consumers, resulting in $4.5 billion and counting in savings for 92 million customers. Commonwealth Edison Company in Illinois is passing $200 million worth of savings to consumers, while Georgia Power will provide $1.2 billion in benefits. Arizona Public Service has requested a $119 million bill reduction for customers, and Consumers Energy in Michigan will lower customer bills by around $200 million.

Business confidence is soaring to new highs

Business confidence has skyrocketed since the tax bill passed. Small business optimism has seen 18 months straight of record high optimism, based on a survey by the National Federation of Independent Businesses. More than 93 percent of manufacturers reporting a positive outlook in the first quarter of 2018, according to a survey by the National Association of Manufacturers. Optimism among middle market businesses is also at a record high. Roughly 60 percent of businesses plan to hire more workers and increase wages in the second or third quarter of 2018, while half of businesses have already increased hiring and increased wages in 2018.

Capital investments by companies are up

Since tax reform passed, capital expenditures among businesses has increased by 39 percent, the fastest rate in seven years. This good news should not be surprising. Comcast has announced it will spend $50 billion in infrastructure investments in the next five years, Merck has said it will invest $12 billion in the economy due to tax reform, while ExxonMobil will invest $35 billion in the next five years.

Americans have better retirement security

Companies are directly increasing retirement benefits because of tax reform. For instance, Visa is doubling its 401(k) employee contribution match to a maximum of 10 percent of employee pay, while Cigna is spending $30 million on 401(k) matches. At the same time, tax reform is helping the nearly 55 million Americans who own a retirement account or 401(k), and the almost 10 million American seniors that receive dividend income. Overall, our country is thriving under the latest tax reform.

The guilty plea agreement, which is under seal, could add to the legal pressure on Manafort, Trump’s former campaign chairman, who is facing two indictments brought by Mueller.

Meanwhile, the president opened a new line of attack against the ongoing investigation(s):

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 17, 2018

Trump referred to this piece in the National Review.

Subsidies and favors for producers cost consumers and workers alike — but that may be about to change.

In Washington, D.C., “special interests” are like the weather: Everyone talks about them, but rarely does anyone do something about them. Politicians campaign against special interests and run ads promising to “drain the swamp” and “end corporate welfare.” And yet, again and again, small groups wield great political muscle to win subsidies and special deals for themselves at the expense of taxpayers and consumers in the 50 states. The special interests work Washington like an ATM: We pay; they walk away with the cash.

Advertisement

But every once in a while, the good guys win. The special interests get too greedy. The backroom deals are opened to view. Taxpayers, consumers, and honest dealers in Washington focus on the money grab, and they decide — this time — to do something about it.

One big victory for consumers was won in Great Britain in 1848. (Sadly, we have to go back a long time and look thousands of miles overseas to find a good example.) The Corn Laws of that day limited grain imports, freeing domestic landowners to hike the prices paid by British consumers. Food prices were skyrocketing, manufacturing was suppressed, and the pocketbooks of citizens were being drained as their cost of living became unbearable.

In response, the Anti–Corn Law League was launched as a crusade against the skewed policy that ensured the profits of one small but powerful group of large landowners. It took a while and a great deal of work and focus, but eventually the Corn Laws were repealed, and the league’s legacy continues to this day.

The nearest rival today of those one-sided 19th-century Corn Laws is the U.S. sugar program. The program utilizes a variety of price supports, supply controls, and tariffs to achieve one goal — an inflated, guaranteed price for a handful of big sugar processors. It mandates the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to wall off imports of sugar, subdue domestic production, and safeguard processors’ profits by bailing them out if the USDA miscalculates.

Roughly $3 billion in costs are shifted to manufacturers in the form of a hidden sugar tax annually, forcing consumers to pay more for food.

The downstream effects of this program are disastrous. Roughly $3 billion in costs are shifted to manufacturers in the form of a hidden sugar tax annually, forcing consumers to pay more for food. The processors’ guaranteed profit makes the dredging up of pristine lands irresistible, harming conservation efforts. Taxpayer-funded bailouts have occurred as recently as the last farm-bill debate, in 2013, and government projections predict that they will continue.

But the sugar program costs some Americans more than higher grocery prices: it costs them their jobs. As the U.S. International Trade Administration found, the program kills three manufacturing jobs for every sugar-producing job that it protects.

Let’s look at a few painful examples. The Spangler Candy Company reports, “Today, we have about 150 people making candy for us in Mexico. In 2017, Spangler had 900 people apply for jobs at our Ohio factory. I would love to offer 250 of them a job as a candy cane maker, but our government insists that sugar processing jobs are more important than manufacturing jobs. They are picking winners and losers and our town has been the loser for many years now.”

The Atkinson Candy Company moved 80 percent of its peppermint-candy production to a factory in Guatemala that opened in 2010.

And the makers of President Reagan’s favorite candy, Jelly Belly, had to build its new 50,000-square-foot plant in Thailand thanks to the high sugar price driven by U.S. policy.

The evidence is overwhelming — this is an expensive and damaging special-interest giveaway and it must be stopped.

History has a habit of repeating itself, unless we take action and stand against this reverse Robin Hood program. Fortunately, a grand coalition of economists, manufacturers, small businesses, and consumer advocates has formed to rein in the sugar program and bring it into the 21st century.

With consideration of the 2018 farm bill approaching, Congress has the opportunity to change the course of history now. Reforms outlined in the Sugar Policy Modernization Act (H.R. 4265/S. 2086) will provide market-oriented changes that will begin to undo this damage by moving to a consumer-driven, free-market set of reforms where prices are set competitively, not through monopoly power. This legislation has support from both Republicans and Democrats in both the House and Senate. It will begin to bend American policy towards proven economics and away from a small club of vertically integrated processors.

We can learn from history.

Everyone knows the phrase “presumed innocent until proven guilty.” But unfortunately that principle does not actually apply to everyone. With one simple reform now working its way through the Michigan Legislature, we can finally fix that injustice. It is time for Michigan to require a criminal conviction for the practice known as civil asset forfeiture.

Some law enforcement agencies across Michigan are currently seizing private property from people they sincerely believe committed a crime. When some of those people turn out to be innocent, however, their property can still be forfeited to the government. And unfortunately not many can afford the lawyers and the fees to get it back. Instead, police departments sell it and keep the profits. We need to fix this.

In 2016 alone, law enforcement agencies in Michigan seized property from hundreds of people who were never charged with a crime. Hundreds more were charged but later cleared. These people did nothing wrong and still lost their car, computer, cellphone, and even their savings just because the government got it wrong. With no conviction required, that could happen to any of us.

House Bill 4158 would change that. This important reform changes our asset forfeiture laws to protect everyone other than criminals, while still allowing our police to go after the bad guys to the full extent of the law. This bill simply draws a bright red line between asset forfeiture for the innocent and for the guilty.

This bill does not change the rules regarding forfeiture for the guilty, which can be a useful tool to help police stop illegal activity. Local police will still be allowed to take assets valued higher than $50,000, which is often a sign of a major drug operation. And property that is abandoned — if police pull over a suspected drug mule and the suspect denies knowing anything about a duffel bag of cash in the trunk, for example — could still be forfeited.

But the vast majority of forfeiture cases are for much smaller amounts of money and property, and all too often they harm people who have never been proven guilty. Those people never should have had their rights or property taken away. With this reform, no innocent Michigan resident will have to go through that again. We will all be better protected by requiring prosecutors to get a conviction before asset forfeiture occurs.

Michigan has improved in this area in recent years. In 2015, the Legislature raised the standard of evidence for when a forfeiture can occur and created new transparency requirements so citizens could see what happens with the seized property. And in 2016, Michigan eliminated a 10 percent bond requirement, where citizens who had their assets seized had to pay money to even try to get their property back.

Those reforms made good progress, but they were not enough. Too many people in our state still have reason to believe that sometimes “guilty until proven innocent” is how the criminal justice system actually works. We can do the right thing and join more than a dozen other states to require a criminal conviction before civil asset forfeiture takes place.

Kansas cut taxes in 2012 and has since increased them three times — in 2013, 2015 and 2017. The last time was the largest tax hike in the state’s history. To win those tax hikes, Democrats in the Legislature, every spending interest in Kansas and the media blamed all of the Sunflower State’s problems — some pre-existing — on the original tax cut.

The national press has latched onto this food fight, proclaiming that other states should avoid cutting taxes, because “Kansas” proves that tax cuts do not create jobs, but will instead slow economic growth and “savage” education. “Kansas,” we are told, once and for all disproves supply side economics — the idea that lower marginal tax rates on labor and capital will increase work, savings and investment. And, the story goes, if tax cuts don’t spur growth, tax hikes can’t slow growth. The problem? Too much has been extrapolated from a few data points in one state. In the same time period, states like North Carolina, Indiana and Tennessee successfully cut taxes. So what did happen in Kansas?

The drama started when Gov. Sam Brownback was elected in 2010 and noted that Kansas had higher taxes than every neighboring state, except Nebraska. Each year, Kansas was losing residents to states with lower taxes, except Nebraska. Between 1977 and 2004, while the U.S. economy grew 130 percent, the gross state product of Kansas grew only 92 percent. While worker productivity nationwide climbed 38 percent between 1977 and 2004, it only increased 26 percent in Kansas, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. So Kansas has been falling behind and losing people for decades.

Those focused on “Kansas” are deliberately not looking at the other 49 states to see whether higher income taxes help or hurt economic growth and job creation.

Brownback proposed reducing income tax rates and eliminating tax preferences to reduce the total tax burden by $352 million between 2013 and 2017. The state Senate was controlled by “moderate” Republicans in league with Democrats, neither of whom favored tax cuts but wanted to be seen as pro-taxpayer ahead of the 2012 election. So the Senate removed the “pay-fors” that offset much of the loss of revenue from income tax rate reductions and increased the net tax reduction 10 times to $3,605 over five years. This was a clever move, but the more conservative House simply passed the larger Senate tax cut, certain they would negotiate down the “cost.” The Senate then refused to work with Brownback or the House, and the larger-than-intended tax cut became law.

This legislative brinkmanship is detailed in the new book What Was Really the Matter With the Kansas Tax Plan, by Dave Trabert, president of the Kansas Policy Institute.



While Brownback fought to make the larger tax cut work, the Legislature was unwilling to reduce spending or enact “pay-fors” that would reduce politically driven corporate welfare and subsidies. Over time, the tax and spenders defeated those fighting for lower income tax rates, fewer special interest tax loopholes and less overall spending. That is not new or different; it is the story of Kansas for the past 40 years and the real reason for the state’s slow growth.

But for national advocates of higher spending and taxes, Kansas became a canvas upon which they drew their preferred narrative. A Washington Post headline in September 2014 screamed “Sam Brownback’s ‘experiment’ puts state on path to penury.” The proof? The Post wrote, “Most key indicators suggest that job creation and economic growth in Kansas are lagging those of its neighbors.” True, but, as noted above, that has been true for decades. And, the editorial continued, Kansans fear “cuts to per pupil expenditures in public schools, which have dropped more than 10 percent since 2008.” One notes that 2008 was four years before Brownback’s tax cuts were passed, but the number was wrong anyway: Per-pupil spending, according to Kansas Department of Education data, was $9,707 in 2005 and had jumped to $12,656 in 2012 when the tax cuts were passed; spending increased to $12,776 in 2013 and was $12,960 in 2014. Even after cherry-picking the data, the 10 percent cut was not true.

A particularly important fib was the claim that when the final bill abolished the income tax on small businesses known as “pass-throughs,” the resulting increase in income and employment in small businesses was not due to growth but owing to corporations changing their legal status to take advantage of the change. This falsehood was pushed in a Politico op-ed in 2012 claiming that there were originally only 191,000 such firms, yet 330,000 pass-through exemptions were claimed in 2015. In 2017, the Kansas Policy Institute found that the actual IRS data showed more than 330,000 pass-throughs before and after the exemption was enacted. This was too late for the Kansas debate but stopped this error from interfering with the GOP decision in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to reduce the tax rate on pass-through entities that often pay higher taxes than C corporations.

But those focused on “Kansas” are deliberately not looking at the other 49 states to see whether higher income taxes help or hurt economic growth and job creation. This is odd, considering that data is available from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Consider these private sector comparisons between 1998 and 2016:

The states without an income tax collectively grew jobs by 40 percent while states in which tax income grew saw job growth of just 21 percent, according to the Kansas Policy Institute’s 2018 Greenbook.

Wage and salary disbursements grew 120 percent in the states without an income tax; other states grew by 89 percent.

The states without an income tax had 129 percent growth in GDP compared to 100 percent for the other states.

So do higher taxes slow growth? Between 2007 and 2014, the highest-taxed states grew at 1.3 percent, according to the Heritage Foundation, and the lowest-taxed states grew at 4.8 percent each year.

There is a reason the larger government lobby had to disingenuously cherry-pick Kansas as a test case. Every state provides the same basket of services, but the states that tax income spend 42 percent more per resident than the states without an income tax. States that spend less can pass on the savings in lower taxes, but that means less for those that profit from excessive government spending, which is why the Kansas effort had to be demonized.",2,https://www.ozy.com/opinion/whats-really-the-matter-with-kansas/86269
326,Norquist,Grover,ozy,"Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, is in the thick of politics more than most. Here’s what he has to say about President Trump’s new tax plan.

President Donald Trump and House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas, recently engaged in public banter confirming that there will be a Tax Cut Phase II. There are three competing ideas for what will constitute the next big cut.

First, Republicans will force a vote in the House and perhaps the Senate as close to April 15 as possible — the official return cutoff this year is actually April 17 — on legislation to make permanent individual tax cuts that would otherwise disappear in eight years.

These include lower tax rates for all taxpayers. The top rate fell from 39.6 to 37 percent, and the bottom rate fell from 10 percent to zero, the 15 percent rate dropped to 12 percent, the 25 percent rate to 22, the 28 percent rate to 24 and the 33 percent rate to 32. The other tax cuts that snap back in 2026 are the doubled standard deduction of $12,000 ($24,000 for families), the per child tax credit of $2,000, the lower tax rate for pass-through entities and the higher exemption for the death tax and the alternative minimum tax.

Ending the taxation of inflation for individual cap gains would in effect cut the rate from 23.8 to about 12 percent.

This is largely a messaging effort to woo voters. Now that more Americans have seen what the tax reform legislation actually did to increase their take-home pay — the Treasury Department estimated that 90 percent of Americans would see lower tax bills and higher take-home pay — it is the right time, Republicans figure, to remind voters just who supported this pay hike (Republicans) and who voted no (Democrats).

Party discipline and optimism about Democrat voter turnout in 2018 will ensure that all Democrats vote once again against lower tax bills. This allows Republicans to share this message: “Return GOP control of the Senate and House, and we will make your tax cut permanent using the budget reconciliation rule, which only requires 50 Senate votes.”

Another aspect of Tax Cut Phase II is to begin sketching larger changes in a future bill: Cut the corporate rate to 15 percent (down from today’s 21 percent) as Trump originally urged, or bring the top rate down from 37 to 28 percent — the bipartisan consensus top rate in 1986.

So what’s likely to actually happen this spring? The elimination of the taxation of inflation when taxing capital gains. Present IRS regulations set the cost of assets (land, buildings, stock, etc.) at the historical purchase price. You pay capital gains taxes on the real gain over time plus inflation.

The Treasury Department has the ability to make a definitional change from historic cost to historic cost plus inflation. In Verizon v. FCC (2002), the Supreme Court ruled that cost had no set definition and could be interpreted in different ways. Chuck Cooper, the Republican lawyer who was in the running to be solicitor general under Trump, has written two legal briefs making the case that a regular change in the definition of “cost” has become increasingly defensible since it was originally proposed in 1993.

One notes that Reagan’s 1981 tax cut reduced individual income tax rates by 25 percent and indexed tax brackets for inflation. No longer were Americans pushed into ever higher personal income tax brackets without any real income gain.

Legislation to end the taxation of inflation in capital gains was introduced in 2007 by a young congressman: Mike Pence. Co-sponsors included now Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and Brady. The drive to end the taxation of inflation within capital gains won a key supporter when Larry Kudlow joined the White House as director of the National Economic Council. Kudlow endorsed making this change through regulatory clarification in a column on Aug. 11, 2017, arguing it would “spark a wave of prosperity.”

Some business leaders suggested back in 2006 that the capital gains tax for corporate capital gains be lowered from 35 percent (there was and still is no capital gains differential in corporate taxation) to 15 percent, arguing that it would lead to $7 trillion in land, buildings and stock that were not previously sold because the buildup of inflation within those gains made a sale at 35 percent less attractive.

We have just cut the capital gains tax rate from 35 to 21 percent. The Tax Foundation estimates that 45 percent of the capital gains taxed at the individual rate is actually inflation. Ending the taxation of inflation for individual capital gains would in effect cut the rate from 23.8 to about 12 percent. But companies live longer than people and have more inflation in the value of their land, building and stock holdings. Ending the taxation of inflation on corporate capital gains could drop the effective rate to below 10 percent and set off a massive reallocation of resources to their highest and best use. And capital gains tax revenue would shoot up between today and, say, Nov. 6, 2018.

Republicans are seeing this simple regulatory change as a twofer. First, it would take the sting out of the limitation of tax benefits that disappointed two powerful and numerous lobbies — homebuilders and real estate agents. Second, it would be a shot in the arm for an already thriving economy that could overcome the headwinds of a threatened trade war — not to mention next week’s tweets.",2,https://www.ozy.com/opinion/enjoying-the-trump-tax-cut-get-ready-for-phase-two/85842

Whether the crisis is mass shootings, addiction to prescription painkillers, or rising obesity (which has resulted in a majority of Americans of prime military recruitment age being unfit to serve), lawmakers from coast to coast, but predominantly Democrats, continue to argue that higher taxes will cure the nation's gravest ailments.

On the heels of the tragic school shooting in Parkland, Fla., for example, congressional and state Democrats have responded with new tax proposals. In Congress, a new bill proposes a steep federal tax hike on ammunition and firearms. That bill, introduced by Rep. Danny Davis (D-Illinois), nearly quintuples the federal tax on ammunition and roughly doubles the federal tax on pistols and revolvers.

Meanwhile in California, a new bill proposes an undisclosed tax increase on guns and ammunition. Supporters say revenue raised from the bill, dubbed the School Gun Violence Prevention Act, would fund counselors in schools.

These types of tax hikes on guns are not new, however, the Parkland shooting is just the latest excuse being used to impose them. (For example, in Senate testimony on Sept. 30, 1993, then-First Lady Hillary Clinton endorsed a national 25% retail sales tax on guns. Congressional Democrats pushed for a similar 10% handgun tax in 2013.)

Attempts to impose gun taxes at the state and local levels have yielded inconclusive results. In August of 2015, the Seattle City Council approved a $25 tax on firearms and a 5-cent tax on ammunition. The city has yet to release data on how much money the tax raised, or how it has been spent.

But guns are not the only problem Democrats (and some Republicans) are targeting with higher taxes. While Nancy Pelosi and other Democratic leaders mock tax reform-related pay raises as ""crumbs,"" Democrats are pushing for regressive tax hikes on prescription drugs at the state level.

Legislation to impose a new tax on opioids has been introduced in at least 13 states, including New York, Minnesota, California, Kentucky, Delaware, New Jersey and Alaska. In March, the Republican-controlled Kentucky House of Representatives became the first legislative chamber to pass an opioid tax. We have not yet seen any conclusive evidence that opioid taxes will combat addiction or drug abuse. But there are indications that the cost of such a tax could be passed on to patients, and lead to higher insurance and medical costs.

Opioid taxes aren't the only tax hikes pending in state capitals this year. A handful of states are debating whether to impose carbon taxes, which opponents argue could lead to higher utility bills, gas prices, and cut into business profits. In Washington State, the legislature recently killed a carbon tax bill pending in Olympia, citing among other things potential difficulties in administering the proposal. Connecticut is weighing its carbon tax legislation, although it faces stiff opposition from business owners.

But before guns, carbon emissions and painkillers made their way into the crosshairs of money-hungry politicians, soda taxes were thought to be a potential fix for America's obesity epidemic. This effort has been financially backed in large part by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Now, a backlash is mounting.

In 2017, voters in Santa Fe, New Mexico, a city that voted heavily for Hillary Clinton in 2016, rejected a ballot measure to impose a local soda tax like the sort endorsed by Clinton. Bloomberg and other soda tax proponents suffered another defeat only months after that, in October of 2017, when the Cook County Board of Commissioners voted to repeal the local soda tax in response to intense public frustration with it.

Cook County, where Chicago is located, was previously the largest jurisdiction in the U.S. to impose a soda tax. Now it serves as a cautionary tale for other locales considering a similar tax on soft drinks, like Multnomah County, Oregon, home to Portland. A campaign in Multnomah County to get a sugary drink tax on the books has spent hundreds of thousand of dollars so far, but no proposal has come before voters yet. It seems constituents simply do not want the government penalizing their personal preferences and consumer habits.

When confronted with a crisis or epidemic, too many politicians are unable to come up with solutions that do not involve higher taxes, more spending, or larger government in general. If politicians really want to fix the country's problems, they need to come up with real policy solution that don't involve taking money out of the pockets of working Americans.

The nation’s top intelligence officers warned Congress this week that Russia is continuing its efforts to target the 2018 elections.

This should come as no surprise: A few months ago, the Department of Homeland Security notified 21 states that hackers had targeted their election systems in 2016. Yet Congress still has not passed legislation to meaningfully address election cybersecurity.

Time is running out. Lawmakers need to act immediately if we are to protect the 2018 and 2020 elections.

There’s no evidence that vote totals were hacked in 2016. But it’s obvious that hackers have been testing the waters. Our attention has focused on Russia, but future threats could also come from North Korea, China, hacking groups such as Anonymous or any other adversary — foreign or domestic.

It should also be no surprise that hackers have U.S. voting systems in their sights. They’re a relatively easy target. Researchers have studied a range of electronic voting infrastructure — including touch screens, optical scanner systems and registration databases — and found serious vulnerabilities that could allow even moderately sophisticated attackers to pose threats to voting integrity. This year, about 40 states are set to use electronic voting or tabulation systems that are more than a decade old — many of which run on software that’s too old to be serviced with vendor security patches. A survey of nearly 300 election officials in 28 states found that a clear majority report needing new voting systems.

We believe there is a framework to secure our elections that can win bipartisan support, minimize costs to taxpayers and respect the constitutional balance between state and federal authorities in managing elections. In September, Mark Meadows, R-N.C., who chairs the conservative House Freedom Caucus, introduced legislation that would help solve the problem with an elegantly simple fix: paper ballots. Meadows’ Paper Act would authorize cost-sharing with states for the replacement of insecure electronic systems with those that produce a voter-verified physical record. The bill also lays the groundwork for states to regularly implement risk-limiting audits — procedures that check a small random sample of paper records to quickly and affordably provide high assurance that an election outcome was correct.

President Donald Trump has already endorsed this framework, declaring: “There’s something really nice about the old paper ballot system. … You don’t worry about hacking.” And in the Senate, a bipartisan group of six lawmakers recently introduced the Secure Elections Act, which presents a sweeping set of security fixes including federal grants to install systems that use voter-verified paper ballots. The best estimates show that we can replace all paperless voting machines in the United States for about the cost of a single F-22 fighter jet — and in fact, the Senate bill would not add to the deficit because it offsets any new spending.

Both the House and Senate bills rightly defend the constitutional principle that states and localities should have primary responsibility over election administration. But they also acknowledge that federal authorities have a role in elections to “provide for the common defense.” Rather than creating new federal mandates, the reform proposals look to identify the best thinking on election security and create guidelines for the use of federal funds.

It’s not practical to expect local election administrators in rural Missouri or small-town Maine to go toe-to-toe with the premier government-backed cyber-mercenaries of China or North Korea. Just as federal agencies prudently provide support for state law enforcement in dealing with terrorism, federal officials should give guidance and support in dealing with the election cybersecurity threat.

If there’s one takeaway from the past year’s endless parade of high-profile cyberattacks, it’s that everyone — from consumers to small businesses to global firms — is at risk. With recent revelations of sophisticated cyberattacks against voting systems in the United States and abroad, it’s clear that anyone running for public office is at risk, too. Members of Congress should recognize that election cybersecurity reforms are in their own personal interest — and in the interest of the United States’ national security.

332,Norquist,Grover,washingtonexaminer,"Congress just proved an amazing thing happens when Republicans remember to govern as Reagan Republicans.

The most substantial tax overhaul since the Reagan years has sparked our economy. Republicans in Congress gathered the courage to face down the pro-tax media, special interests, and the opposition of every single Democrat in Congress to help families keep more of what they earn. Already tax reform has resulted in at least 285 companies announcing wage increases, bonuses, and higher 401(k) matches for 3 million workers. Utility companies are reducing rates in response to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

The decade-long economic malaise of the Obama years is finally in the rearview mirror. Apple is bringing more than a quarter-trillion dollars back to the U.S. Amgen, Goldman Sachs, and Johnson & Johnson are following suit. Companies like Walmart are giving out raises. Companies like Starbucks are giving employee bonuses.

And all Republicans had to do is what they promised to do: Get out of the way and leave us alone. Competent Republican state caucuses are following suit in states like Wisconsin, Arizona, Florida, Texas, and North Carolina. But not all Republicans at the state level are following the tried and true path of successful government: less.

Some Republican state legislators remind us that no one’s life is a complete waste — some simply serve as bad examples. One of those bad examples can be found in Colorado.

This is disappointing and surprising, as Colorado is home to the best tax and expenditure limitation in the country, called the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights. TABOR provides an exoskeleton for those elected officials that lack an endoskeleton (backbone). It should be easiest to fight taxes in Colorado.

TABOR puts taxpayers in charge of tax and debt increases. Any government in Colorado can jack up taxes as high as they like, and it’s all fine. All they have to do is ask first by putting the question on the ballot.

The word you’re looking for is “consent.” Colorado has a higher level of consent over government growth put right in their state constitution. Consent is good. Harvey Weinstein is bad.

But weak politicians don’t like asking voters if they want higher taxes because they know the answer is going to be “no.” So Colorado lawmakers found ways around asking for consent. They devised a Clintonesque way to change the meaning of simple words. They renamed taxes as “fees,” and label debt as “certificates of participation.” Clever, huh?

For years Democrats in the Colorado legislature have been drooling over a scheme to get around TABOR by raising a tax on Coloradans’ hospital stays and calling it a “fee.” Fortunately, until now the Republican-controlled State Senate has consistently stood up for taxpayers and blocked the Democrat-controlled State House of Representatives from raising taxes and debt without consent.

But in the last legislative session, Democrats found their pro-tax collaborators inside the Republican Senate caucus. Spearheaded by Senate President Kevin Grantham (a bad Republican) and the Senate Majority Leader Jerry Sonnenberg (another bad Republican), who sponsored the effort, they successfully raised taxes by $600 million a year and raised debt by $2 billion.

That alone is a cardinal fiscal sin, but blowing a hole through TABOR by refusing to bring it to a public vote makes this the largest Republican betrayal in Colorado political history.

In the shadow of Republicans slashing taxes in Washington, a full half of the Colorado Republican caucus voted for this massive tax hike and use of legalese to hide it from voters.

Of course, many of these unfaithful Republicans have their sights set on higher office. Jerry Sonnenberg wants to become Senate president. Owen Hill is running for U.S. Congress to bring his pro-tax leadership to Washington. Dan Thurlow is running for State Senate. And Polly Lawrence is running for Colorado State Treasurer.

We can only hope that some Republicans on the state level learn to actually fight for taxpayers — just like they campaigned on, and just like their partisan counterparts on the federal level have done. And who could have imagined we’d ever be saying something like that?

333,Norquist,Grover,nbcnews,"New year, new tax code — and a much improved one at that.

According to U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin, the tax reform bill signed into law by President Donald Trump in December will increase the take-home pay for 90% of workers. Tax season will also be simplified for many Americans next year, as the number of filers who must itemize in order to lower their tax bill will fall from approximately 30% of households to less than 10%

The move to immediate expensing will also stoke productivity-increasing business investment, and small businesses will have greater job-creating capacity. However, we view the 14-percentage-point corporate rate reduction — from 35% to 21% — as the crown jewel of tax reform’s success. Prior to this bill, America’s corporate tax rate was the highest corporate rate among advanced nations. Now, the U.S. no longer has that dubious distinction.

In addition to the much-needed reduction in the corporate tax rate, the bill also ends the double taxation of U.S. company profits earned and already taxed overseas. This move to a territorial tax system for corporations ends a system of double taxation that is rare in the modern world (according to the Tax Foundation, there are only five other countries that tax corporations on global income). However, one of the biggest missed opportunities in the new law is that it fails to stop double taxing expats living abroad.",2,https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/american-expats-are-left-high-dry-trump-s-tax-reform-ncna838006

335,Norquist,Grover,newsweek,"Democrats continue to suggest that voters oppose the just-passed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. House Minority Leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi says it will be the end of the world, ""Armageddon."" The establishment press has claimed that many or most Americans will see their taxes go up.

And yet 227 of 239 Republicans in the House of Representatives and all 51 Republicans on the Senate floor voted to pass this tax reform. (Republican Sen. John McCain supports the bill but was at home in Arizona.)

Why did the Republicans so confidently vote for a bill the press and Democrats say is a tax hike and an economy destroyer—and thus presumably a bad political move?

For one, they read it. Heck, they wrote it over the past five years. They had more than 40 public hearings. The House drafted, scored and made public specific legislation three years ago. The framework and policy goals of the bill were front and center in the 2016 election and have been public knowledge for years.

Second, they understand what voters want in 2018.

While polling tells us that many Americans believe the Democrats when they say this bill will raise taxes on middle-income Americans, that is simply not true. The Joint Tax Committee, the official government body that scores tax changes, shows that the largest cuts in Americans' tax burdens flow to those earning between $20,000 and $50,000. In fact, every income group will see their taxes fall.

The problem for Democrats is that between today and Election Day 2018, Americans will cash a paycheck every two weeks. They will see less money withheld, and thus bigger paychecks.

A tax cut is a pay raise. Democrats threatening to repeal the Republican tax cut will be promising a pay cut for middle-income Americans.

The biggest winners of tax reform will be the Americans who were unemployed in the past eight years and finally enter or re-enter the workforce. But there are some other groups, newly identified and engaged voting blocs, whose vote will be changed by tax reform.

Democrats like to talk about demographic trends; they think all Americans self-identify by age, race, gender or ethnicity. But there are powerful demographic forces that this tax reform package energizes against Democrats.

Democrats attacked Republicans for reducing the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. This, they argue, will only benefit big corporations (which they smugly note do not vote). Democrats forget a few tens of millions of things here: stockholders, for example—the people whose life savings, pensions and health savings, flexible spending and 401(k) accounts increase with the stock market. When big corporations make more money, they make millions of Americans wealthier.

Of the 250 million Americans over age 18:

54 million have an active 401(k). That is a number equal to all the voters of Florida, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin, Iowa and all of New England. And they have spouses, children and parents.

43 million have an individual retirement account, and receive a letter showing them in black and white how much their life savings have increased.

There are already 13 million 529 educational savings accounts, used by families for college expenses. And the expansion of these accounts under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to cover K-12 expenses will greatly increase the number of account holders. Millions of Catholic, Jewish and evangelical parents who send their children to parochial and religious schools just watched the Democrats oppose them.

Pelosi is 77, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is 76; they remember the days when few Americans owned stock, and operate that way, too. Now tens of millions of Americans—more than a majority of voters—learn every month how their life savings have gone up (or down). They don't hate corporations; they like companies that increase their life savings. And since the GOP bill's passage, Republicans will remind those stockholders every week that Democrats threatened to take away their savings by scuttling lower business taxes.

What's more, Democrats have spit at ""pass-through"" corporations—calling them tax cheats and loopholes—to their ultimate disadvantage. A pass-through is a smaller business, a partnership, a sole proprietorship or S-corporation where the owner pays his business taxes through his personal income tax return. While Democrats belittle pass-throughs, Republicans understand their impact: There are 28 million pass-throughs, and each has an owner. Many owners have spouses and families, and the majority of Americans at work today work for a pass-through.

The tax cut for pass-throughs is less than we had hoped, but the ball is now rolling downhill. Every year the Republicans are in power, there will be another tax cut, and pass-throughs will see their rates fall in each effort.

Democrats say they would support a tax cut for everyone but the 1 percent. But all of them—every single one—just voted against a collection of tax cuts that energize, reward and empower the vast majority of American citizens, aka voters.

336,Norquist,Grover,washingtonexaminer,"As the Federal Communications Commission approached a vote on the Restoring Internet Freedom Order at its December open meeting, the Left got frantic, claiming it would bring about the end of the internet as we know it and even the end of democracy.

Reality check: The Title II regulations that are now being eliminated were imposed just two years ago. Before the imposition of Title II regulations, the internet was largely kept free of government regulation. What is being restored is precisely the open internet everyone says they want.

Those frantic calls from the Left look as foolish as Y2K mania.

The Obama FCC majority, taking orders from the White House, ignored decades of successfully keeping government away from overregulating the internet. The Obama FCC actually used a law designed to regulate public monopolies like taxi medallions and power plants to end the open internet consensus that goes back to the 1990s.

With the Restoring Internet Freedom vote, the FCC reclassified internet service providers as a Title I information service, not a Title II public utility. This will allow ISPs to try new business models – which they will have to be incredibly transparent about – that could better connect customers to the online services they want.

Now ISPs will have to answer to customers in the market and not to the whims of government bureaucrats. Opponents of restoring internet freedom are calling this a vote to create internet gatekeepers. Nonsense. By removing government regulation, it is less likely these sorts of gatekeepers will be able to exist. Business can create cartels in an industry only when the government enters with rules that limit the entry of new competitors and restricts consumer choice.

The average corporation exists for less than 20 years. As tech innovation creates new and better ways of doing business, companies become obsolete much faster.

This innovation is great for consumers, and is why our online networks have progressed so far in the 10 years since the invention of the smartphone. Changing course from this light touch framework to a utility-style regulatory system was not wise, but it was cheered at the time by existing internet companies for many of the same reasons some workers cheer occupational licensing and unions: They cut down on their competition.

Regulatory compliance – administrative oversight, employee training, etc. – hikes the cost of running the business. Excessive administrative costs divert resources away from the purpose of these businesses: to provide services to paying customers. This makes it tougher for these companies to stay afloat, especially new entrants to the market, because new entrants have higher initial fixed costs from the extra administrative hoops that their established competitors do not have to jump through.

Higher fixed costs mean fewer companies can even afford to dive into the market, which means continually diminishing competition for firms already in the market. Then, if the company is fortunate enough to survive, they have less capital with which to take creative risks.

Most new business ventures are not successful. Eliminating new companies by lobbying government to artificially raise the cost of doing business through regulation is a cheaper and safer business plan for established firms than actually continuing to take risks in the market, but the stagnation excessive regulation creates undermines the long-term health of the market in the process.

Less competition is not what brought the internet to its current state, and in order for future advancements to be just as life-changing as those in the past, continued deregulation will be needed. Despite the gnashing of teeth on the Left, there are still suitable government oversight regulations in place to stop anti-competitive business practices. But rather than preemptively throttling the growth the industry, the FCC and Federal Trade Commission are instead policing specific harms that arise in the market.

Fearmongering about anti-competitive behavior by ISPs after this vote is wrong because the greater fear should be for anti-competitive behavior that is government-backed. Government legitimizing one business model and regulating other models out of existence is the actual way the dystopian horror stories being peddled by the Left come to be.

The freedom of businesses to be dynamic in order to better meet consumer needs in the market makes old companies’ business models obsolete. That’s why when it comes to gatekeepers, your real fear should be of government power creating monopolies that can only exist backed by government power.

337,Norquist,Grover,pressherald,"Sens. Susan Collins and Angus King have a rare opportunity to reform the broken tax code this week when the U.S. Senate votes on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

The pro-growth, pro-family Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is a huge win for families and individuals in Maine and across the country.

ABOUT THE AUTHORS Grover Norquist is president of Americans for Tax Reform, an advocacy group founded in 1986 to support President Reagan’s tax overhaul plan. Mary Adams of Garland is a longtime tax-reform activist who organized the successful 1977 referendum to repeal Maine’s state property tax. Related Headlines Commentary: Senate tax plan has all warning signs of catastrophe in the making

Under this legislation, Americans at every income level see tax reduction and drastic simplification of the 70,000-plus-page tax code. This plan also reduces taxes for small businesses and corporations to promote more investment in the economy, leading to higher wages and new or better jobs.

DOUBLES STANDARD DEDUCTION

The Senate plan reduces almost every tax bracket and doubles the standard deduction from $6,000 to $12,000 ($12,000 to $24,000 for a family). This reform means direct tax relief for the 466,000 Maine individuals and families that currently take the standard deduction.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act also doubles the child tax credit to $2,000 per child, giving the 87,670 families in Maine that take the credit more take-home pay. The plan also repeals the Alternative Minimum Tax, directly reducing taxes for 14,530 taxpayers in Maine and simplifying the code for thousands more who no longer need to calculate their income under the AMT.

Through these reforms, a family of four with an annual income of $73,000 will see a tax cut of nearly $2,200 – a reduction of nearly 60 percent. Similarly, an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Foundation found that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will create almost 4,000 new full-time jobs in Maine and increase after tax-income for a typical middle-class family by $2,238.

PRO-GROWTH REFORMS

The plan also implements numerous pro-growth reforms so that businesses large and small are granted much-needed relief.

The U.S. currently has the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world. The Senate plan lowers the rate to 20 percent. This rate reduction is long overdue – the U.S. corporate rate has barely changed in 30 years, and America is just one of three developed countries that has failed to reduce their corporate rate since 2000.

Similarly, pass-through entities that pay taxes through the individual code (such as sole proprietorships, limited liability companies and S Corporations) see relief with lower tax brackets across the board and a 17.4 percent exclusion on business income.

The Senate bill also encourages businesses to invest in the economy through the implementation of full business expensing for five years. In addition, U.S. companies operating overseas will again be able to compete against foreign competitors through the implementation of a modern, territorial system of taxation that ends the needless and complex system of double taxation present in our outdated worldwide system of taxation.

SUBJECT TO HARSH CRITICISM

Despite the clear benefits the Senate’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will have for Maine businesses and families, the plan has been subject to harsh criticism.

Soon after the bill was released, Senate Democrats claimed it would leave a family earning $86,000 per year facing a $794 tax increase. However, this claim was debunked by the Washington Post’s Fact Checker, which gave it four Pinocchios (the worst rank possible).

Similarly, the Joint Committee on Taxation’s analysis of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act claims that the repeal of the Obamacare individual mandate will cause taxpayers earning between $10,000 and $30,000 to face a tax increase starting in 2021. Under this assumption, millions choose not to purchase Obamacare, meaning they will also choose not to receive the Obamacare refundable tax credit.

The committee’s analysis assumes that individuals will choose to increase their own taxes – the Senate bill retains the Obamacare tax credit and does not limit anyone’s eligibility for insurance. A separate and more accurate Taxation Committee analysis of the bill finds tax reduction at every income level (including for those earning between $10,000 and $30,000), with the biggest winners being middle-class families.

These misleading claims aside, the Senate’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is a pro-growth, pro-family bill that reduces taxes for individuals and businesses, simplifies the code and grows the economy. Sen. Collins and Sen. King have a rare opportunity to give much needed tax relief to Mainers. They should support this pro-growth, pro-family legislation.

339,Norquist,Grover,washingtonexaminer,"This week, the Senate has the opportunity to vote on comprehensive tax reform legislation that reduces taxes for families and individuals of every income level, dramatically simplifies the complex code, and reduces taxes on small and large businesses.

If passed and signed into law, this legislation would dramatically increase economic growth, wages, and take-home pay and simplify the tax code so that it is no longer rigged to benefit the few well-connected in our society.

Even though the GOP’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reduces taxes and reforms the code for businesses and individuals, the plan has faced criticism.

Some say the plan does not cut taxes enough for the middle class, while others say the plan purely benefits the wealthy. In each case, this criticism is off the mark – the tax plan gives strong rate reduction for every income level, with the biggest winners being middle-class families.

Rate Reduction and Simplification for Families and Individuals

The biggest winners of the Senate’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act are middle-class families. Under this legislation, a family of four earning the nationwide median income of $73,000 will see a tax cut of $2,200 – nearly 60 percent.

The plan ensures tax reduction across the board through the reduction of almost every tax bracket, the doubling of the standard deduction to $12,000 ($24,000 for a family), the expansion of the child tax credit from $1,000 to $2,000, and the repeal of the Alternative Minimum Tax.

The Obamacare individual mandate tax penalty is also eliminated, relieving families across the country from one of the most regressive taxes in the code. Currently, 79 percent of those paying the individual mandate tax make less than $50,000, while 37 percent make less than $25,000.

The current 75,000+ page tax code results in significant complexity for taxpayers, and more than 90 percent of Americans say the tax code is too complex, resulting in significant costs for people across the country.

According to the Tax Foundation, Americans will spend more than 8.9 million hours complying with the tax code, costing $409 billion. About 2.6 billion hours will be spent complying with individual income taxes, costing $98 billion each year. Similarly, the National Taxpayers Union Foundation estimates that individuals spend 1.8 billion hours on 1040 forms each year, costing $262 billion every year.

The many reforms in this tax plan such as the expansion of the standard deduction and the repeal of many itemized deductions and distortionary credits will result in dramatic tax simplification. According to a study by the Council of Economic Advisors, the tax reform plan will reduce the number of itemizers to just 7.6 percent of all taxpayers – drastically cutting back the time Americans spend complying with the tax code.

Tax Cuts and Pro-Growth Reforms for Businesses of Every Size

The Senate’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act also proposes significant tax reduction for businesses – starting with a globally competitive 20 percent corporate rate that will allow American businesses to compete against foreign competitors.

This lower rate, in combination with an average state tax rate of 4 percent, will place U.S. businesses on an equal playing field with foreign competitors, which have an average business tax rate of 24 percent. This rate reduction is also long overdue: Since 2000, 32 of the 35 developed countries have reduced their corporate rates, while the U.S. and Chile are the only two countries with higher corporate tax rates.

Small businesses also see strong rate reduction with a 17.4 percent deduction for businesses organized as pass-through entities. Under this plan, a small business owner with $100,000 in income would see tax reduction of almost $3,000 or roughly 25 percent.

While some critics of the plan argue that small businesses deserve a greater tax cut, the same argument can be made for all taxpayers. Small businesses are much better off in the Senate plan than they are under the status quo, which is why the plan is endorsed by the National Federation for Independent Business, the nation's leading small business trade association.

The tax reform plan also updates the tax code so that U.S. businesses are no longer subject to double taxation of income earned abroad. By implementing a modern, territorial system of taxation, American companies will be able to compete and thrive when doing business overseas.

Today, 95 percent of consumers live outside the U.S. and a total of 41 million jobs are tied to business operations overseas, so this outdated system results in lost jobs and lower wages

These reforms – together with the rate reduction and simplification on the individual side – will result in relief for families and businesses, reversing the trend of stagnant wage growth that has become a feature of the economy. Senators should pass the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act this week.

340,Norquist,Grover,sbsun,"The U.S. House of Representatives approved a desperately needed overhaul of the federal tax code two weeks ago and the Senate will vote on its version this week. Many California officials have been critical of the effort, including some prominent Republicans. Critics’ main point of contention is that scrapping the state and local tax deduction, which is a key feature of both the House and Senate versions of tax reform, will disproportionately harm California.

Not only is this criticism wrong, the conventional wisdom it’s based on has it backwards. Americans who live in high income tax states like California will actually be among the biggest winners from tax reform that, as the pending federal legislation does, ends the SALT deduction and does so in order to facilitate broad-based rate reduction that provides tax relief to households of all income levels.

This criticism of SALT’s repeal is misdirected. For it is the swamp in Sacramento, not the one in Washington, where complaints about how costly the Golden State is should be directed. The federal government, especially a federal government that is $20 trillion in debt, has no business subsidizing the high-spending, high-tax ways of bloated state governments like those in New York, New Jersey, Illinois and California. Same goes for the cities of Chicago, New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco.

Repeal of SALT in exchange for lower income tax rates is a great deal for California

The SALT deduction, which most taxpayers don’t benefit from because approximately 70 percent of Americans do not even itemize, is a federal subsidy that drives state and local taxes higher than they otherwise would be. Its repeal will benefit California taxpayers in particular, since they contend with one of the highest state tax burdens in the nation, by eliminating the current bias against state and local tax reduction.

Why should state and local taxes be deductible at all? If the federal government stops covering up the true cost of state and local government, another benefit will come from that. Different people will be elected to office in cities and states where politicians find their overspending no longer subsidized by taxpayers in other, less costly states.

If there are two Americans who both make the same amount of money per year, why should one of those taxpayers have a lower federal tax bill than the other due merely to the fact that they have decided to live in a state or city with a more expensive and wasteful government. Critics of repealing the SALT deduction never provide a good explanation for that because there isn’t one.

By eliminating this federal tax deduction that causes state and local politicians to tax and spend more than they otherwise would — and doing so to facilitate income tax rate reduction for individuals, families and businesses — the GOP tax reform legislation working its way to final passage is a win-win for California taxpayers.

The Republican tax reform plan will make California more globally competitive

Federal tax reform recently passed by the House and now being considered in the Senate will turbocharge the U.S. economy, and the Golden State economy in particular. It’s not only the likes of Texas, Florida, Arizona and North Carolina that California must fiercely compete with for investment, new businesses and jobs. As the world’s sixth largest economy, California competes not just with other states, but with the largest nations on the planet — nations that have been busy cutting their corporate income tax rates in recent years.

Countries throughout Europe and other continents have reduced their corporate tax rates in recent years, with the worldwide top average corporate tax rate dropping from 30 percent in 2003 to 22.5 percent this year. China’s corporate rate now stands at 25 percent, Great Britain’s sits at 18 percent. Canada levies a 15 percent rate and Ireland boasts a 12.5 percent corporate rate.

France assesses a corporate rate of 33 percent, which is still more competitive than the U.S. rate paid by California-based employers, but that’s a low bar to clear given the American corporate rate is the highest in the developed world.

French President Emmanuel Macron has proposed cutting his country’s corporate rate to 25 percent. At 35 percent, the U.S. corporate tax is more than 10 percentage points higher than the average rate for members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Simply put, the tax status quo in the U.S. greatly disadvantages California businesses.

The reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35 to 20 percent, the end to double taxation of profits already taxed abroad, along with a move from costly and convoluted depreciation schedules to full and immediate expensing for business investment, will make California far more competitive internationally than it currently is, and much more attractive to global investment.

Members of the California congressional delegation who voted for the House tax reform bill — which includes Reps. Kevin McCarthy, R-Bakersfield; Devin Nunes, R-Tulare; Mimi Walters, R-Laguna Beach; Steve Knight, R-Antelope Valley; Ken Calvert, R-Corona; Ed Royce, R-Fullerton; Doug LaMalfa, R-Richvale; Paul Cook, R-Yucca Valley; Jeff Denham, R-Turlock; David Valadao, R-Hanford, and Duncan D. Hunter, R-Alpine — should be commended for voting in the best interests of their constituents.

Unfortunately, Southern California Congressmen Darrell Issa, R-Vista, and Dana Rohrabacher, R-Costa Mesa, voted against this historic and desperately needed tax code overhaul. Fortunately, they will have an opportunity to reconsider and do the right thing when they get a chance to vote for final passage. A holiday season change of heart from Reps.

Simply put, the tax status quo in the U.S. greatly disadvantages California businesses.

The reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35 to 20 percent, the end to double taxation of profits already taxed abroad, along with a move from costly and convoluted depreciation schedules to full and immediate expensing for business investment, will make California far more competitive internationally than it currently is, and much more attractive to global investment.

Members of the California congressional delegation who voted for the House tax reform bill — which includes Reps. Kevin McCarthy, R-Bakersfield; Devin Nunes, R-Tulare; Mimi Walters, R-Laguna Beach; Steve Knight, R-Antelope Valley; Ken Calvert, R-Corona; Ed Royce, R-Fullerton; Doug LaMalfa, R-Richvale; Paul Cook, R-Yucca Valley; Jeff Denham, R-Turlock; David Valadao, R-Hanford, and Duncan D. Hunter, R-Alpine — should be commended for voting in the best interests of their constituents.

Unfortunately, Southern California Congressmen Darrell Issa, R-Vista, and Dana Rohrabacher, R-Costa Mesa, voted against this historic and desperately needed tax code overhaul. Fortunately, they will have an opportunity to reconsider and do the right thing when they get a chance to vote for final passage. A holiday season change of heart from Reps. Issa and Rohrabacher would be a great gift for California taxpayers, just as Ebenezer Scrooge’s was for the Cratchit family and the Grinch’s was for the citizens of Whoville.

343,Norquist,Grover,sgvtribune,"The U.S. House of Representatives approved a desperately needed overhaul of the federal tax code two weeks ago and the Senate will vote on its version this week. Many California officials have been critical of the effort, including some prominent Republicans. Critics’ main point of contention is that scrapping the state and local tax deduction, which is a key feature of both the House and Senate versions of tax reform, will disproportionately harm California.

Not only is this criticism wrong, the conventional wisdom it’s based on has it backwards. Americans who live in high income tax states like California will actually be among the biggest winners from tax reform that, as the pending federal legislation does, ends the SALT deduction and does so in order to facilitate broad-based rate reduction that provides tax relief to households of all income levels.

This criticism of SALT’s repeal is misdirected. For it is the swamp in Sacramento, not the one in Washington, where complaints about how costly the Golden State is should be directed. The federal government, especially a federal government that is $20 trillion in debt, has no business subsidizing the high-spending, high-tax ways of bloated state governments like those in New York, New Jersey, Illinois and California. Same goes for the cities of Chicago, New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco.

Repeal of SALT in exchange for lower income tax rates is a great deal for California

The SALT deduction, which most taxpayers don’t benefit from because approximately 70 percent of Americans do not even itemize, is a federal subsidy that drives state and local taxes higher than they otherwise would be. Its repeal will benefit California taxpayers in particular, since they contend with one of the highest state tax burdens in the nation, by eliminating the current bias against state and local tax reduction.

Why should state and local taxes be deductible at all? If the federal government stops covering up the true cost of state and local government, another benefit will come from that. Different people will be elected to office in cities and states where politicians find their overspending no longer subsidized by taxpayers in other, less costly states.

If there are two Americans who both make the same amount of money per year, why should one of those taxpayers have a lower federal tax bill than the other due merely to the fact that they have decided to live in a state or city with a more expensive and wasteful government. Critics of repealing the SALT deduction never provide a good explanation for that because there isn’t one.

By eliminating this federal tax deduction that causes state and local politicians to tax and spend more than they otherwise would — and doing so to facilitate income tax rate reduction for individuals, families and businesses — the GOP tax reform legislation working its way to final passage is a win-win for California taxpayers.

The Republican tax reform plan will make California more globally competitive

Federal tax reform recently passed by the House and now being considered in the Senate will turbocharge the U.S. economy, and the Golden State economy in particular. It’s not only the likes of Texas, Florida, Arizona and North Carolina that California must fiercely compete with for investment, new businesses and jobs. As the world’s sixth largest economy, California competes not just with other states, but with the largest nations on the planet — nations that have been busy cutting their corporate income tax rates in recent years.

Countries throughout Europe and other continents have reduced their corporate tax rates in recent years, with the worldwide top average corporate tax rate dropping from 30 percent in 2003 to 22.5 percent this year. China’s corporate rate now stands at 25 percent, Great Britain’s sits at 18 percent. Canada levies a 15 percent rate and Ireland boasts a 12.5 percent corporate rate.

France assesses a corporate rate of 33 percent, which is still more competitive than the U.S. rate paid by California-based employers, but that’s a low bar to clear given the American corporate rate is the highest in the developed world.

Countries throughout Europe and other continents have reduced their corporate tax rates in recent years, with the worldwide top average corporate tax rate dropping from 30 percent in 2003 to 22.5 percent this year. China’s corporate rate now stands at 25 percent, Great Britain’s sits at 18 percent. Canada levies a 15 percent rate and Ireland boasts a 12.5 percent corporate rate.

France assesses a corporate rate of 33 percent, which is still more competitive than the U.S. rate paid by California-based employers, but that’s a low bar to clear given the American corporate rate is the highest in the developed world.

French President Emmanuel Macron has proposed cutting his country’s corporate rate to 25 percent. At 35 percent, the U.S. corporate tax is more than 10 percentage points higher than the average rate for members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Simply put, the tax status quo in the U.S. greatly disadvantages California businesses.

The reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35 to 20 percent, the end to double taxation of profits already taxed abroad, along with a move from costly and convoluted depreciation schedules to full and immediate expensing for business investment, will make California far more competitive internationally than it currently is, and much more attractive to global investment.

Members of the California congressional delegation who voted for the House tax reform bill — which includes Reps. Kevin McCarthy, R-Bakersfield; Devin Nunes, R-Tulare; Mimi Walters, R-Laguna Beach; Steve Knight, R-Antelope Valley; Ken Calvert, R-Corona; Ed Royce, R-Fullerton; Doug LaMalfa, R-Richvale; Paul Cook, R-Yucca Valley; Jeff Denham, R-Turlock; David Valadao, R-Hanford, and Duncan D. Hunter, R-Alpine — should be commended for voting in the best interests of their constituents.

Unfortunately, Southern California Congressmen Darrell Issa, R-Vista, and Dana Rohrabacher, R-Costa Mesa, voted against this historic and desperately needed tax code overhaul. Fortunately, they will have an opportunity to reconsider and do the right thing when they get a chance to vote for final passage. A holiday season change of heart from Reps. Issa and Rohrabacher would be a great gift for California taxpayers, just as Ebenezer Scrooge’s was for the Cratchit family and the Grinch’s was for the citizens of Whoville.

349,Norquist,Grover,dailybulletin,"The U.S. House of Representatives approved a desperately needed overhaul of the federal tax code two weeks ago and the Senate will vote on its version this week. Many California officials have been critical of the effort, including some prominent Republicans. Critics’ main point of contention is that scrapping the state and local tax deduction, which is a key feature of both the House and Senate versions of tax reform, will disproportionately harm California.

Not only is this criticism wrong, the conventional wisdom it’s based on has it backwards. Americans who live in high income tax states like California will actually be among the biggest winners from tax reform that, as the pending federal legislation does, ends the SALT deduction and does so in order to facilitate broad-based rate reduction that provides tax relief to households of all income levels.

This criticism of SALT’s repeal is misdirected. For it is the swamp in Sacramento, not the one in Washington, where complaints about how costly the Golden State is should be directed. The federal government, especially a federal government that is $20 trillion in debt, has no business subsidizing the high-spending, high-tax ways of bloated state governments like those in New York, New Jersey, Illinois and California. Same goes for the cities of Chicago, New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco.

Repeal of SALT in exchange for lower income tax rates is a great deal for California

The SALT deduction, which most taxpayers don’t benefit from because approximately 70 percent of Americans do not even itemize, is a federal subsidy that drives state and local taxes higher than they otherwise would be. Its repeal will benefit California taxpayers in particular, since they contend with one of the highest state tax burdens in the nation, by eliminating the current bias against state and local tax reduction.

Why should state and local taxes be deductible at all? If the federal government stops covering up the true cost of state and local government, another benefit will come from that. Different people will be elected to office in cities and states where politicians find their overspending no longer subsidized by taxpayers in other, less costly states.

If there are two Americans who both make the same amount of money per year, why should one of those taxpayers have a lower federal tax bill than the other due merely to the fact that they have decided to live in a state or city with a more expensive and wasteful government. Critics of repealing the SALT deduction never provide a good explanation for that because there isn’t one.

Economics, North America

A rainbow shines over the U.S. Capitol in Washington

The tax reduction and reform act outlined by the House, Senate and White House Republican leadership in the spring is designed to drive job creation and economic growth.

The GOP Tax Plan's Number One Goal: Back to Growth

The “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” has passed the House of Representatives, and the Senate will vote on its version of the legislation the week after Thanksgiving. Should both bills pass and the bodies agree on a final compromise legislative wording, it will change the American economy, American politics and the world.

Just what single piece of legislation could be that powerful?

The outlines of the tax reform/tax reduction bills are known. And the likelihood of final passage is as certain as anything can be in Washington, DC, as the House and Senate bills and the president’s vision all live within the “framework” agreed upon months ago. The only real differences are in timing and focus.

The corporate rate will drop from 35 percent—the highest in the industrialized world—down to 20 percent. After-tax cash flow for $100 in earnings will increase from $65 to $80—a 23 percent increase. Imagine what that will do to the stock market valuations. American competitiveness will allow firms to stay in the United States, rather than continuing to be at risk of purchase by foreign companies that enjoy lower corporate tax rates.

And Americans will join the rest of the world in adopting a territorial tax system that allows us to repatriate American business earnings without penalty.

Full and immediate business expensing will reduce the cost of capital and new investment. This change alone is projected to increase the size of the economy by 5 percent over the next decade. The end of the death tax will end the annual destruction of billions of dollars of accumulated life savings every generation, and create more than 150,000 jobs. The alternative minimum tax is slated for repeal, removing a second layer of taxation on companies and individuals. And smaller businesses that pay their business taxes through Subchapter S corporations or LLCs will see their top rate fall from a high of 44 percent towards 25 percent. No more will smaller businesses face tax rates significantly higher than major corporations.

Story continues

Tax advantages—subsidies—for favored industries and incompetent cities and states will be repealed.

So what will this all do?

First, the American economy. The economic recovery that began in July 2009, six months into the Obama administration, has been the weakest recovery in modern American history. Annual growth has averaged less than 1.5 percent a year. The average U.S. growth rate from 1960 until Obama took office was 3.3 percent. The Reagan recovery—which followed both a collapse in employment, declining GDP at the same time we suffered under inflation rates of above 10 percent and a prime interest rate of over 20 percent—ran for seven years, averaging 3.5 percent per year.

The tax reduction and reform act outlined by the House, Senate and White House Republican leadership in the spring is designed to drive job creation and economic growth. While it also reforms the tax code, the focus has always been on increasing growth.

Democrats and media critics of the plan have focused on whether some Americans will get a bigger tax cut in dollars and/or percentage of their tax bill than others. But they miss the true first beneficiaries of the tax bill—those Americans whose income today is possibly zero because they are among the 12.8 million Americans who are unemployed or underemployed, or among the 524,000 who have actually left the workforce as discouraged workers.

The tax cut will change American politics.

The pundits have noted a growing hostility to immigration and immigrants, and to international trade. They suggest this is a withering of the American spirit, a sign of defeatism and withdrawal from the world. Or worse, proof that their assertion that Americans are all crypto-racists is accurate. But history shows that immigration and trade become unpopular whenever the economy weakens and Americans wonder “what happened.” Politicians welcome any answer other than that the government screwed up monetary policy, spent the nation into penury, and imposed unnecessary and burdensome increased taxes and regulations at the cost of growth and innovation.

When Reagan’s deregulation and tax cuts drove the economy forward in 1983 (four million new jobs), 1984 (3.4 million new jobs), 1985 (two million) and 1986 (2.1 million)—Congress voted and Reagan signed an immigration reform bill that was amnesty for 2.7 million illegal aliens. And NAFTA was proposed by Reagan, negotiated by Bush and signed by Clinton.

Tax cuts and deregulation lead to growth. Growth leads to more jobs, and an employed American is a cheerful American, indifferent or even welcoming toward expanded trade and immigration.

The tax bill is designed to change the direction and strength of our economy but will also change the electorate’s worldview. Republicans did poorly in the 1982 congressional elections, and Reagan’s popularity was low—because the economy was still weak. But when the full Reagan tax cuts took effect January 1983, we had growth for two years; that same once-unpopular Reagan won forty-nine states and re-election.

The tax bill will decide whether the GOP holds the House and strengthens in the Senate, and also how “popular” Trump will be. The importance of the tax bill to the November 2018 election is one reason to bet heavily that the GOP House, Senate and White House will “get it done.” The fury of the opposition strongly suggests that Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi see the danger for their hopes of returning to power.

And the world?

No less a predictor/reflector of the liberal/left worldview than Jeffrey Sachs has screamed that the reduction in American corporate rates—a belated response to the drop in business tax rates by every other nation in the world—would in fact drive our international competitors to further reduce their corporate income taxes.

Reagan’s tax cuts in 1981 and 1986 convinced much of the world to reduce individual and business tax rates. That helped the entire world grow, and created a virtuous competition to reduce the tax burden not just on Americans, but on our friends and allies as well. We are about to once again be the shining city on the hill, whose good example leads the world—not from behind, not from threats of invasion, occupation or war, but simply by being a good and successful example worthy of emulation. It costs us not one life and not one penny, and earns us no enemies.

The focus next year will be welfare reform, block-granting welfare (TANF), food stamps and Medicaid with work requirements and time limits to staying on welfare for able-bodied citizens. This will begin to bend down the cost curve of runaway entitlements, and shrink our unfunded liabilities, which are every bit as damaging as the present national debt.

Not bad for the first eighteen months in office.

But wait: there’s more. Next year will also bring another tax-reduction package—so if your favorite tax cut did not make it into the package this year, there will be another opportunity every year we have a GOP House, Senate and presidency.

358,Norquist,Grover,foxnews,"House Republicans have unveiled tax reform and reduction legislation that is also an amazingly powerful job creation bill.

After eight years of the slowest “recovery” in modern American history, we are now poised to create millions of jobs and move from our Obama-era 2 percent economic growth rate to our historic average of 3 percent growth and beyond. President Reagan’s growth rates were over 4 percent. We will match and likely surpass that.

Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, who is chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, focused on designing tax reform that put economic growth first and foremost.

Every decision was focused on “what creates the most jobs and income increases for Americans” and “how do we make this permanent,” so we do not have a repeat of the 2012 disappearing tax cuts, when the Bush-era tax cuts expired.

What would the GOP plan do if it becomes law?

It would double the standard deduction from $12,000 for a married couple to $24,000. This makes the claim by Democrats that this legislation raises taxes on middle-income Americans look foolish. Heck, even the Washington Post “fact checker” called out the Democrats for faking the numbers to suggest this is not a tax cut for the vast majority of Americans, in a story headlined: “Senate Democrats falsely claim GOP tax plan will raise taxes for most working-class families.”

The tax bill would also cut rates for all Americans. The new rates would be 0 percent, 12 percent, 25 percent, 35 percent and 39.6 percent. Yes, the top rate would still be the same as what we have now (all the others would be reduced), but it wouldn’t kick in until an income of $1 million for a couple.

The death tax would be abolished. First, it would be reduced by doubling the exempt amount of your life savings not taxed for the next six years. Then the death tax would die in 2024. If even a small piece of the death tax survived the knife, it would live to grow back to hit millions of Americans.

The alternative minimum tax would be abolished. That was imposed in 1969 to hit 115 people and now hits several million.

Business taxes that are now at 35 percent for American companies – one of the highest rates in the world – would fall to 20 percent immediately. China is at 25 percent. Canada is at 15 percent. Britain at 18 percent. We are not now competitive in the world economy due to our high business tax. This bill would change that.

Manufacturing would rebound because the tax bill would allow businesses to expense all new business investment in the first year, rather than over a decade or more. That drops the cost of new investment in job-creating, income-enhancing technology.

Lower taxes. Simpler. Pro-growth. Pro-jobs.

The next step is to move the legislation through the House Ways and Means Committee, which should happen quickly because the members were part of writing the bill, and then through the full House.

The Senate, which would need to join the House in passing the legislation for it to go to President Trump to be signed into law, has been involved in designing this bill from the start. As has the White House. That is why the House-Senate conference should be easier and shorter than usual and President Trump’s signature should be assured.

The president called the tax legislation “a great bill” when it was unveiled Thursday and said his administration is “working to give the American people a giant tax cut for Christmas.”

Yes, this is a tax cut bill. It is most importantly a job-creation, income-increasing bill.

It is also a powerful political move that will guarantee the GOP holds the House of Representatives and wins four or five additional Senate seats.

And keep in mind that every year the GOP holds Congress and White House there will be another tax cut. Four tax cuts in the next four years. So this bill is just a start. A very good start.",2,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/02/grover-norquist-republican-tax-bill-is-amazingly-powerful-job-creation-measure.html

The damage our present IRS tax code does to American competitiveness in the world and job creation at home has been debated for years. Taxes eat up too much of our time and our families’ savings. They limit our dreams. Enough talk. It is time to fix the problems.

America taxes businesses at 35%. China at 25%.

Even President Obama saw this and admitted we should do something about it. Now the Republican plan is taking action to reduce our self-inflicted damage, cutting the rate from 35% down to 20%.

Every part of the tax reform package now being inked in has been part of the debate for 20 or 30 years. Or more.

OUR VIEW:Tax reform or tax con?

The Republican tax cut increases the standard deduction from $12,000 for a married couple to $24,000. Soon, 95% of Americans will not need to itemize. Most Americans will be able to do their tax returns on a single sheet of paper.

The Republican plan cuts marginal tax rates for all Americans and ends the death tax imposed to pay for the Civil War and reimposed to fund World War I. Uncle Sam is a tad slow here; 33 states have already abolished their death taxes. So has Sweden.

Moving towards full and immediate business expensing was part of tax cuts initiated by Presidents Kennedy and Reagan. Obama allowed expensing for some business investment. Now we will expand this tested job creator to all American businesses.

The plan also reduces taxes on 30 million small businesses that are often treated worse than large corporations by our present tax code.

The Republican tax plan abolishes the alternative minimum tax, which forces millions of American to prepare two sets of tax returns and then choose the one worse for them.

Politicians have talked for decades about how the tax code kills jobs and lowers wages.

Those who want to avoid reform can continue to make excuses. Those who want to bring jobs backs to America and create new jobs and higher wages will be voting “yes.”

Pro-growth tax reform is too important for any Republican to lose focus, or be distracted by shiny objects and errant tweets.

361,Norquist,Grover,nbcnews,"President Donald Trump and Republican congressional leaders have outlined the framework for a powerful, pro-growth tax reform plan they intend to pass and sign by Christmas. We believe this plan will turbo-charge the U.S. economy by fixing major flaws in the federal tax code, while reducing tax rates and providing relief for individuals, families and employers nationwide.

To facilitate all these pro-growth changes, various credits and deductions will need to be scrapped to offset revenue lost because of rate cuts. The most important ""pay for"" is repeal of the federal tax deduction for state and local taxes, or SALT. It would raise a significant amount of money — $1.8 trillion in higher federal revenue over a decade — according to the non-partisan Tax Foundation, which can then be plowed into lower income tax rates for all Americans.

Democratic politicians and progressive activists who oppose tax breaks for “the rich” should support repealing the state and local tax deduction because its benefits will go disproportionately to upper-income taxpayers. This is especially true for those who live in high tax states and cities like San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles and Philadelphia.

Today taxpayers can deduct both state and local income and property levies when calculating their taxable income for federal income tax purposes. But this just provides an incentive for state and local politicians to spend more than they would were that provision not in the tax code.

Heck, even the Tax Policy Center acknowledges the SALT deduction leads to larger state and local government. “By lowering the net cost of taxes,” the center’s March 2016 report notes, the SALT deduction “encourages state and local governments to levy higher taxes and provide more services than they otherwise would.”

New York and California — which have some of the nation’s highest state and local tax burdens — receive almost a third of the total nationwide value of the deduction. Meanwhile, this deduction matters far less to taxpayers living in low-tax states, especially the states with no personal income tax.

Democrats are in a tough place arguing to keep this deduction since, as previously mentioned, it is used by — and disproportionately benefits — high-income Americans in richer states and cities. Households with income in excess of $100,000, for example, reap the majority of the benefits. Opposition to scrapping this preference makes the Democrats’ repeated public demands to tax “the rich” ring hollow.

Allowing taxpayers to deduct their state and local taxes does not create jobs or help the economy grow. It helps state and local government bureaucracies grow.",2,https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/democrats-should-stop-worrying-learn-love-gop-s-tax-plan-ncna813506

As some of the year’s highest electric bills are hitting consumers’ mailboxes thanks to near-record heat this summer, South Central Power members are getting a one-time break on transmission charges that could decrease the average member’s July bill by around $10.

The bill reduction is a result of the recent Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which federal lawmakers passed in late 2017. “Thanks to tax savings realized by our transmission provider, we received a credit of roughly $1.7 million toward our transmission costs,” said Allison Saffle, VP of member service for South Central Power. “We’ve passed those savings directly on to consumers, who will see them reflected in lower transmission charges on this month’s bills. Going forward, the impact of the lower tax rates will be passed directly on to consumers, who will see transmission costs lowered by roughly $1 per month.” – July 24, 2018 South Central Power Co.

364,Norquist,Grover,washingtonexaminer,"It is hard to screw up a tax cut.

But we've done it before. The Reagan tax cut of 1981 was supposed to be a 33 percent across-the-board tax cut. The Democratic Party held a majority in the House, so that rate reduction was reduced to 25 percent. Not good, but understandable. A compromise. But the real damage was that the 25 percent cut was delayed. There was a 5 percent rate reduction in 1981, a 10 percent rate reduction in 1982, and then a final 10 percent rate reduction in 1983.

Why did this matter? The economic growth driven by a 25 percent rate reduction began in Jan. 1983. Four million jobs were created that year, 1 million in Oct. 1983 alone. In 1984, Reagan won a smashing victory in 49 states – missing only Walter Mondale's home state of Minnesota.

But.

But there was an election in 1982, and the GOP got clobbered. Why?

Because by delaying the full tax cut, the economy was not growing in 1982 – oddly enough the 1982 election was held in November 1982.

Now, we have an election scheduled for Nov. 2018. There is careless talk among some staffers drafting the tax reform bill in the House that they might ""phase in"" (read: delay) the full reduction of the burdensome corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent.

Tax cuts taking effect immediately would supercharge the economy. If businesses know that by delaying recognizing earnings for a year or two (or three) they will face lower tax rates, they will react accordingly and delay new investment, jobs, and earnings.

Sure, strong growth three years from now would be nice. But strong growth in early 2018 so that even MSNBC ""reporters"" will have to mention new and additional jobs before the Nov. 2018 election would be more than nice.

If you cannot fit all the tax cuts you want into 10 years, then frontload them. That is what Republicans announced they will do with full and immediate expensing. It is to last five years, but start immediately so that we get the strong growth before the 2018, 2020, and 2022 elections. By then, it will be obvious to everyone – except experts at the Joint Tax Committee – that expensing should be made permanent. That is what happened with the research and development tax credit.

Frontload tax cuts. Speed up recovery and growth. Win the next election. Cut taxes.

Repeat.

NEO will credit residential customers the amount it has over collected, plus interest, since Jan. 1, 2018 under the previous corporate tax rates. The $500,423 credit, including interest, will be passed back to customers over a 12-month period.

NEO will return to customers normalized excess accumulated deferred income tax (EDIT), estimated by the utility to be approximately $2.3 million, over a federally prescribed time period.

NEO will credit customers non-normalized EDIT of $50,867 over a 72-month period.

A residential customer, using approximately 10 Mcf per month, will see a bill reduction of approximately $1.37 per month for the first year. – May 20, 2020 Ohio Public Utility Commission Statement

South Central Power Co. passed their savings along to customers as well:

As some of the year’s highest electric bills are hitting consumers’ mailboxes thanks to near-record heat this summer, South Central Power members are getting a one-time break on transmission charges that could decrease the average member’s July bill by around $10.

The bill reduction is a result of the recent Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which federal lawmakers passed in late 2017. “Thanks to tax savings realized by our transmission provider, we received a credit of roughly $1.7 million toward our transmission costs,” said Allison Saffle, VP of member service for South Central Power. “We’ve passed those savings directly on to consumers, who will see them reflected in lower transmission charges on this month’s bills. Going forward, the impact of the lower tax rates will be passed directly on to consumers, who will see transmission costs lowered by roughly $1 per month.” – July 24, 2018 South Central Power Co. Statement

Conversely, a vote for a corporate income tax rate hike is a vote for higher utility bills right as the USA is trying to recover from the pandemic.

366,Norquist,Grover,whittierdailynews,"We have arrived at the tipping point.

The Republican Congress and the White House have announced the framework for reducing and simplifying the federal tax code.

The battle to enact tax reform over the next three months will decide two questions.

One, can America return to her historic annual growth rate of 3 percent plus and leave behind the anemic 2 percent growth rate of the Obama “recovery”? Or not?

The Washington-based pundits have begun proclaiming that 2 percent growth is the “new normal.” China can grow at 7 or 8 percent, but Americans, we are told, must get used to 2 percent growth, the European growth rate befitting a sclerotic welfare state past its prime.

These predictions/assertions would be more depressing if one failed to remember that this is exactly what the very same “experts” announced in the late 1970s when Jimmy Carter’s policies also led to “malaise” and negative growth rates. There were “limits to growth” said all the beautiful people on network television. We should stop trying to grow faster. Limit our hopes for the future and for our children.

And then Reagan cut taxes and growth rates shot up to 4 percent a year and we created 4 million new jobs in 1983 — the first year of the Reagan tax cuts.

The second question we are about to answer is: “Can the thin Republican majorities in the House and Senate combine with the White House to govern against a Democrat Party determined to filibuster and delay any and all Republican successes so they can denounce the Republicans as incapable of governing?”

The good news for the country is that the answer to both questions is a resounding “yes.”

The tax plan will pass by mid-December and it is powerful enough to kick-start the present economy that has been damaged and weakened by eight years of tax hikes, “stimulus” spending, the doubling of the national debt, swelling unfunded liabilities and new and expensive regulations.

The tax reform plan outlined by the Big Six — House and Senate leaders and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House economic advisor Gary Cohn — has three major drivers of economic growth.

First, it reduces the business tax, the corporate income tax rate of 35 percent down to 20 percent. Our present corporate income tax rate of 35 percent is higher than any other major nation. China has a 25 percent tax rate. How did we expect to create jobs and opportunities here at home weighed down by taxes higher than a communist country? Russia’s top corporate rate is 20 percent. Canada’s is 15 percent (federal rate). The European average is just above 20 percent. This rate cut makes America competitive in the world once again.

President Trump does remind us that he wanted — and still wants — a top rate of 15 percent. While I hope he is successful in driving the rate down to 15 percent during his presidency, 20 percent is a very, very good start.

Tax rates on business income paid by the 30 million smaller “pass through” businesses that pay taxes through the personal income tax code — sole proprietorships, partnerships, Subchapter S corporations — will see their top rate fall from 40 percent to 25 percent.

Half of business income is earned by larger corporations, and half is earned by “pass through” businesses. Half of Americans work for a major corporation and half for smaller “pass-throughs.”

Finally these smaller firms will see their taxes reduced.

The second big bang for job creation will be moving from long depreciation schedules for new business investment in plant and equipment to full and immediate business expensing. Buy a million dollars of new equipment to make your employees more productive and you expense that million — it does not count as taxable income because you just spent it. This greatly reduces the cost of new investment.

The Republican plan introduces full expensing for five years. Then it goes away like Cinderella’s stagecoach. But I will bet you dollars to donuts that the powerful pro-investment, pro-growth effects of full and immediate expensing will convince Congress to extend the expensing provision just as Congress repeatedly extended the Research and Development Tax Credit. Eventually expensing, like the R&D tax credit, will be made permanent.

Third, tax reform will allow businesses that have earned and parked more than $2.5 trillion overseas to bring those dollars back without the stiff tax penalty demanded by present law. In the future all American earnings abroad would be taxed once by the overseas nation and then they could repatriate their earnings without penalty. One or two trillion dollars would return to the United States next year bringing reductions in debt, new investments, jobs and growth. A real stimulus program, not one run by politicians, but by men and women who earned that money in the first place.

Increasing the cash flow of every major company in America, repatriating trillions in overseas earnings back to the U.S. and lifting the tax burden on 30 million smaller businesses is a recipe for growth, new jobs and wealth creation.

But wait. There is more.

On the individual side the personal income tax standard deduction will increase from $6,000 to $12,000 and for married couples increase from $12,000 to $24,000. The first $24,000 of income for a married couple is free of federal income tax. The tax rate is zero.

The plan collapses the present seven rates that go as high as 39.6 percent down to four rates: Zero, 12 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent. The present 10 percent rate moves to zero.

The death tax is finally put to rest. Those foolish enough to die will no longer be taxed.

The Alternative Minimum Tax — invented by Ted Kennedy and Richard Nixon in 1969 — was supposed to hit 115 millionaires who paid little in taxes and now catches millions in its web. This tax is eliminated.

So who benefits most from the tax cut?

Answer: Those Americans who could not find a job during the Obama years. The unemployed and underemployed. The biggest winners will be the millions of Americans who enter the work force for the first time in their lives or re-enter after giving up during the lean years.

But can the Republicans pass tax reform? It will be a large bill with many moving parts. They came one vote short in the Senate of repealing much of Obamacare. Might that happen again?

The good news is that cutting taxes is a consensus issue in the modern Republican Party. Ronald Reagan did that. It took time. The Taxpayer Protection Pledge shared with all candidates by Americans for Tax Reform has been signed by more than 90 percent of congressional Republicans. Republicans will not raise your taxes (though they may invade small countries they cannot pronounce) and they will cut taxes when possible.

The House will hold hearings and put the outline into legislative language by the end of October. The Senate will go to work and put together its version by Thanksgiving. And then the two versions go to conference and a final bill will be signed by President Trump before Christmas.

The politics of this three-month battle to cut taxes will define the 2018 elections. Democrats will now spend three months attacking the very idea of reducing taxes on 30 million small businessmen and women. They vote. They have spouses and families. Every week will bring an announcement by the Fortune 500 companies about how much money they are bringing back to the United States and how they will invest it. All Americans who pay taxes will see their take-home pay increase, their rates reduced and their standard deduction doubled. And then the increasing employment numbers will be released every first Friday of the month from January 2018 through the November election. We can see the future from here and it looks good.

First, it reduces the business tax, the corporate income tax rate of 35 percent down to 20 percent. Our present corporate income tax rate of 35 percent is higher than any other major nation. China has a 25 percent tax rate. How did we expect to create jobs and opportunities here at home weighed down by taxes higher than a communist country? Russia’s top corporate rate is 20 percent. Canada’s is 15 percent (federal rate). The European average is just above 20 percent. This rate cut makes America competitive in the world once again.

President Trump does remind us that he wanted — and still wants — a top rate of 15 percent. While I hope he is successful in driving the rate down to 15 percent during his presidency, 20 percent is a very, very good start.

Tax rates on business income paid by the 30 million smaller “pass through” businesses that pay taxes through the personal income tax code — sole proprietorships, partnerships, Subchapter S corporations — will see their top rate fall from 40 percent to 25 percent.

Half of business income is earned by larger corporations, and half is earned by “pass through” businesses. Half of Americans work for a major corporation and half for smaller “pass-throughs.”

Finally these smaller firms will see their taxes reduced.

The second big bang for job creation will be moving from long depreciation schedules for new business investment in plant and equipment to full and immediate business expensing. Buy a million dollars of new equipment to make your employees more productive and you expense that million — it does not count as taxable income because you just spent it. This greatly reduces the cost of new investment.

The Republican plan introduces full expensing for five years. Then it goes away like Cinderella’s stagecoach. But I will bet you dollars to donuts that the powerful pro-investment, pro-growth effects of full and immediate expensing will convince Congress to extend the expensing provision just as Congress repeatedly extended the Research and Development Tax Credit. Eventually expensing, like the R&D tax credit, will be made permanent.

Third, tax reform will allow businesses that have earned and parked more than $2.5 trillion overseas to bring those dollars back without the stiff tax penalty demanded by present law. In the future all American earnings abroad would be taxed once by the overseas nation and then they could repatriate their earnings without penalty. One or two trillion dollars would return to the United States next year bringing reductions in debt, new investments, jobs and growth. A real stimulus program, not one run by politicians, but by men and women who earned that money in the first place.

Increasing the cash flow of every major company in America, repatriating trillions in overseas earnings back to the U.S. and lifting the tax burden on 30 million smaller businesses is a recipe for growth, new jobs and wealth creation.

But wait. There is more.

On the individual side the personal income tax standard deduction will increase from $6,000 to $12,000 and for married couples increase from $12,000 to $24,000. The first $24,000 of income for a married couple is free of federal income tax. The tax rate is zero.

The plan collapses the present seven rates that go as high as 39.6 percent down to four rates: Zero, 12 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent. The present 10 percent rate moves to zero.

The death tax is finally put to rest. Those foolish enough to die will no longer be taxed.

The Alternative Minimum Tax — invented by Ted Kennedy and Richard Nixon in 1969 — was supposed to hit 115 millionaires who paid little in taxes and now catches millions in its web. This tax is eliminated.

So who benefits most from the tax cut?

Answer: Those Americans who could not find a job during the Obama years. The unemployed and underemployed. The biggest winners will be the millions of Americans who enter the work force for the first time in their lives or re-enter after giving up during the lean years.

But can the Republicans pass tax reform? It will be a large bill with many moving parts. They came one vote short in the Senate of repealing much of Obamacare. Might that happen again?

The good news is that cutting taxes is a consensus issue in the modern Republican Party. Ronald Reagan did that. It took time. The Taxpayer Protection Pledge shared with all candidates by Americans for Tax Reform has been signed by more than 90 percent of congressional Republicans. Republicans will not raise your taxes (though they may invade small countries they cannot pronounce) and they will cut taxes when possible.

The House will hold hearings and put the outline into legislative language by the end of October. The Senate will go to work and put together its version by Thanksgiving. And then the two versions go to conference and a final bill will be signed by President Trump before Christmas.

The politics of this three-month battle to cut taxes will define the 2018 elections. Democrats will now spend three months attacking the very idea of reducing taxes on 30 million small businessmen and women. They vote. They have spouses and families. Every week will bring an announcement by the Fortune 500 companies about how much money they are bringing back to the United States and how they will invest it. All Americans who pay taxes will see their take-home pay increase, their rates reduced and their standard deduction doubled. And then the increasing employment numbers will be released every first Friday of the month from January 2018 through the November election. We can see the future from here and it looks good.

371,Norquist,Grover,dailybulletin,"We have arrived at the tipping point.

The Republican Congress and the White House have announced the framework for reducing and simplifying the federal tax code.

The battle to enact tax reform over the next three months will decide two questions.

One, can America return to her historic annual growth rate of 3 percent plus and leave behind the anemic 2 percent growth rate of the Obama “recovery”? Or not?

The Washington-based pundits have begun proclaiming that 2 percent growth is the “new normal.” China can grow at 7 or 8 percent, but Americans, we are told, must get used to 2 percent growth, the European growth rate befitting a sclerotic welfare state past its prime.

These predictions/assertions would be more depressing if one failed to remember that this is exactly what the very same “experts” announced in the late 1970s when Jimmy Carter’s policies also led to “malaise” and negative growth rates. There were “limits to growth” said all the beautiful people on network television. We should stop trying to grow faster. Limit our hopes for the future and for our children.

And then Reagan cut taxes and growth rates shot up to 4 percent a year and we created 4 million new jobs in 1983 — the first year of the Reagan tax cuts.

The second question we are about to answer is: “Can the thin Republican majorities in the House and Senate combine with the White House to govern against a Democrat Party determined to filibuster and delay any and all Republican successes so they can denounce the Republicans as incapable of governing?”

The good news for the country is that the answer to both questions is a resounding “yes.”

But can the Republicans pass tax reform? It will be a large bill with many moving parts. They came one vote short in the Senate of repealing much of Obamacare. Might that happen again?

The good news is that cutting taxes is a consensus issue in the modern Republican Party. Ronald Reagan did that. It took time. The Taxpayer Protection Pledge shared with all candidates by Americans for Tax Reform has been signed by more than 90 percent of congressional Republicans. Republicans will not raise your taxes (though they may invade small countries they cannot pronounce) and they will cut taxes when possible.

The House will hold hearings and put the outline into legislative language by the end of October. The Senate will go to work and put together its version by Thanksgiving. And then the two versions go to conference and a final bill will be signed by President Trump before Christmas.

The politics of this three-month battle to cut taxes will define the 2018 elections. Democrats will now spend three months attacking the very idea of reducing taxes on 30 million small businessmen and women. They vote. They have spouses and families. Every week will bring an announcement by the Fortune 500 companies about how much money they are bringing back to the United States and how they will invest it. All Americans who pay taxes will see their take-home pay increase, their rates reduced and their standard deduction doubled. And then the increasing employment numbers will be released every first Friday of the month from January 2018 through the November election. We can see the future from here and it looks good.

375,Norquist,Grover,redlandsdailyfacts,"We have arrived at the tipping point.

The Republican Congress and the White House have announced the framework for reducing and simplifying the federal tax code.

The battle to enact tax reform over the next three months will decide two questions.

One, can America return to her historic annual growth rate of 3 percent plus and leave behind the anemic 2 percent growth rate of the Obama “recovery”? Or not?

The Washington-based pundits have begun proclaiming that 2 percent growth is the “new normal.” China can grow at 7 or 8 percent, but Americans, we are told, must get used to 2 percent growth, the European growth rate befitting a sclerotic welfare state past its prime.

These predictions/assertions would be more depressing if one failed to remember that this is exactly what the very same “experts” announced in the late 1970s when Jimmy Carter’s policies also led to “malaise” and negative growth rates. There were “limits to growth” said all the beautiful people on network television. We should stop trying to grow faster. Limit our hopes for the future and for our children.

And then Reagan cut taxes and growth rates shot up to 4 percent a year and we created 4 million new jobs in 1983 — the first year of the Reagan tax cuts.

The second question we are about to answer is: “Can the thin Republican majorities in the House and Senate combine with the White House to govern against a Democrat Party determined to filibuster and delay any and all Republican successes so they can denounce the Republicans as incapable of governing?”

The good news for the country is that the answer to both questions is a resounding “yes.”

The tax plan will pass by mid-December and it is powerful enough to kick-start the present economy that has been damaged and weakened by eight years of tax hikes, “stimulus” spending, the doubling of the national debt, swelling unfunded liabilities and new and expensive regulations.

The tax reform plan outlined by the Big Six — House and Senate leaders and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House economic advisor Gary Cohn — has three major drivers of economic growth.

First, it reduces the business tax, the corporate income tax rate of 35 percent down to 20 percent. Our present corporate income tax rate of 35 percent is higher than any other major nation. China has a 25 percent tax rate. How did we expect to create jobs and opportunities here at home weighed down by taxes higher than a communist country? Russia’s top corporate rate is 20 percent. Canada’s is 15 percent (federal rate). The European average is just above 20 percent. This rate cut makes America competitive in the world once again.

President Trump does remind us that he wanted — and still wants — a top rate of 15 percent. While I hope he is successful in driving the rate down to 15 percent during his presidency, 20 percent is a very, very good start.

Tax rates on business income paid by the 30 million smaller “pass through” businesses that pay taxes through the personal income tax code — sole proprietorships, partnerships, Subchapter S corporations — will see their top rate fall from 40 percent to 25 percent.

Half of business income is earned by larger corporations, and half is earned by “pass through” businesses. Half of Americans work for a major corporation and half for smaller “pass-throughs.”

Finally these smaller firms will see their taxes reduced.

The second big bang for job creation will be moving from long depreciation schedules for new business investment in plant and equipment to full and immediate business expensing. Buy a million dollars of new equipment to make your employees more productive and you expense that million — it does not count as taxable income because you just spent it. This greatly reduces the cost of new investment.

The Republican plan introduces full expensing for five years. Then it goes away like Cinderella’s stagecoach. But I will bet you dollars to donuts that the powerful pro-investment, pro-growth effects of full and immediate expensing will convince Congress to extend the expensing provision just as Congress repeatedly extended the Research and Development Tax Credit. Eventually expensing, like the R&D tax credit, will be made permanent.

Third, tax reform will allow businesses that have earned and parked more than $2.5 trillion overseas to bring those dollars back without the stiff tax penalty demanded by present law. In the future all American earnings abroad would be taxed once by the overseas nation and then they could repatriate their earnings without penalty. One or two trillion dollars would return to the United States next year bringing reductions in debt, new investments, jobs and growth. A real stimulus program, not one run by politicians, but by men and women who earned that money in the first place.

Increasing the cash flow of every major company in America, repatriating trillions in overseas earnings back to the U.S. and lifting the tax burden on 30 million smaller businesses is a recipe for growth, new jobs and wealth creation.

But wait. There is more.

On the individual side the personal income tax standard deduction will increase from $6,000 to $12,000 and for married couples increase from $12,000 to $24,000. The first $24,000 of income for a married couple is free of federal income tax. The tax rate is zero.

The plan collapses the present seven rates that go as high as 39.6 percent down to four rates: Zero, 12 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent. The present 10 percent rate moves to zero.

The death tax is finally put to rest. Those foolish enough to die will no longer be taxed.

The Alternative Minimum Tax — invented by Ted Kennedy and Richard Nixon in 1969 — was supposed to hit 115 millionaires who paid little in taxes and now catches millions in its web. This tax is eliminated.

So who benefits most from the tax cut?

Answer: Those Americans who could not find a job during the Obama years. The unemployed and underemployed. The biggest winners will be the millions of Americans who enter the work force for the first time in their lives or re-enter after giving up during the lean years.

378,Norquist,Grover,wsj,"Every so often I’m asked to list the conservative movement’s most important recent accomplishments. One always ranks near the top: criminal justice reform.

With leadership from Republican governors and legislators and groups such as Right on Crime, conservatives have pushed to rein in runaway prison spending and adopt cost-conscious correctional policies that improve public safety. Starting 10 years ago in Texas, more than half of all states have now shifted course, changing laws to ensure that violent offenders serve hard time while those who are not a danger are steered toward less expensive alternatives that can help alter the paths of their lives and make communities safer.

Taxpayers benefit. In 2007 the Pew Charitable Trusts projected that state prisons would grow 14% over five years, costing states $27.5 billion more. Instead, the reforms have bent the curve. The state prison population is down 5%. Between 2010 and 2015, 31 states reduced both crime and imprisonment, proving that fiscal discipline and safe streets can go hand in hand.

Many of us on the right are concerned by rumblings we’re hearing in Washington and beyond. It’s disturbing that reports of isolated increases in violence in a handful of cities are fueling predictions of a looming American crime wave. There is no evidence for such predictions. The U.S. violent crime rate rose 3.4% last year, but it remains about half of what it was in 1991, when crime reached its modern-day peak.

While any uptick in crime merits our attention, we must be clear-eyed in our interpretation of the numbers and while developing an effective response. Americans are safer than they have been at almost any time in the last quarter-century, and returning to the failed policies of the past would be a costly mistake.",2,https://www.wsj.com/articles/conservatives-for-criminal-justice-reform-1506463970

Tax reform is a must-win for two reasons. First, to kick-start strong economic growth and job creation. Second, to demonstrate that President Trump and the Republicans in Congress can ""get things done.""

If there had not been a zillion shiny things and tweets distracting us, it should have been obvious last year that America would not elect a Democrat to the presidency for the third time, as a result of the failed economic policies of President Obama and congressional Democrats.

The Democratic failures include higher taxes on everyone, (including eight ObamaCare taxes directly on the middle class), an explosion of regulatory costs, a new unending entitlement and lousy job numbers.

Passing tax reform without a single Democratic vote will remind Americans that there are two teams in Washington. One works for government and the other works for them. Democrats refer to tax hikes as income. Republicans know taxes are a cost imposed on American families. Pick your team.

Even coming out of a deep recession, the Obama administration averaged growth of only 2 percent a year. President Reagan battled recession and inflation and managed 4 percent growth, creating 4 million jobs in the first year of his recovery.

In the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton promised $1 trillion in even higher taxes. She said she would not reduce tax rates for anyone and for any business, and hinted at other new and different taxes yet to come.

Donald Trump was elected president because he promised jobs, jobs, jobs. He and the GOP Congress know they have to deliver in such a way that even MSNBC will have to note from time to time that in the first six months of 2018 the economy is in fact demonstrably stronger.

The good news is that the emerging tax reform and reduction legislation will deliver a strong boost to the creation of jobs, income and wealth. The federal tax on businesses will be reduced from 35 percent (fourth-highest in the world), to roughly 20 percent, just below the developed world average. China is at 25 percent.

Long depreciation schedules will be replaced by full and immediate business expensing – at least for a few years. And history suggests that any such pro-growth measure will be extended again and again (just as the research and development tax credit was) and eventually be made permanent.

Today there are $2.6 trillion earned by American companies overseas and stuck there because of stupid federal tax policy. Tax reform will bring those dollars back in a cascade of real investment in America. President Obama's ""stimulus"" was run through congressional earmarks and city politicians. It left no noticeable permanent job gains.

The biggest winners of tax reform will be the millions of Americans who enter or return to the job market when we unleash America's business investment through lower taxes, expensing and repatriation.

Middle-income Americans will also see their personal tax rates fall and the standard deduction for an individual will jump from $6,000 to $12,000, and for a married couple from $12,000 to $24,000. Good luck to the Democrats explaining to millions of middle-class Americans who will see pay raises from these changes that they just benefit ""the rich.""

383,Norquist,Grover,insidesources,"Editor’s Note: For an alternative viewpoint, please see: Counterpoint: Tax Reform Is Not Going to Happen; Big Tax Cuts for the Rich Unfortunately Might

The Republicans in Congress and the White House are committed to passing a powerful reform of our tax code that will create jobs, economic growth, simplify the complex tax code and return money to hard-working Americans. This year.

For the last eight years the American economy has grown at 2 percent per year. It is the weakest recovery following a recession since World War II.

When President Reagan responded to the recession and double-digit inflation of the early 1980s, he cut tax rates and in the first year the tax bill took effect 4 million jobs were created. Growth ran at 4 percent a year for seven years.

If we had grown at Reagan tax-cut-rates instead of Obama stimulus-spending-and-tax-hike-rates, there would be 12 million more Americans at work today. Too many lives, families and communities have been damaged by tax-and-spend politics that killed jobs and opportunity.

Tax reform and reduction will change that. It did in the 1920s, the 1960s and the 1980s.

The Republican plan begins by doubling the standard deduction. Individuals now have a standard deduction — the amount of earning that is completely free of federal taxes — of $6,000. That will double to $12,000. A married couple now has a standard deduction of $12,000. That will double to $24,000. This is a significant tax cut.

It is also tax reform: after this reform only 5 percent of Americans will have to fill out complicated forms to itemize their deductions. This is a big step toward a tax return that can be filled out on a postcard.

And there is more. Today, American face seven income tax rates. This will be reduced to three. All Americans who pay federal taxes will see a reduction in their tax rates.

Special interest deductions and credits and loopholes will be eliminated. In eight years of Obama that did not happen. It is long past time to strip our tax system of corporate welfare and self-dealing.

One challenge America faces is that in an increasingly competitive world, American businesses pay a combined federal-state tax rate of 39 percent while the European average is 19 percent. Foreigners are not destroying our jobs — our government’s tax code is destroying our jobs. This must stop now.

President Trump has called for reducing the 35 percent corporate rate to 15 percent. That would move America from having one of the least competitive tax burdens to one of the most competitive. That means jobs and growth.

And lowering the tax burden on businesses working to create jobs and wealth is not just for larger corporations. The Republican plan also reduces the business tax on those businesses where the entrepreneur pays taxes through the individual rates. Those are known as Subchapter S corporations or “pass throughs” or partnerships, and sole proprietorships. These are tens of millions of smaller businesses that employ half the workforce and earn half of all business earnings. They pay a top federal rate of 44.6 percent.

Our government should get out of the businesses of crushing small and growing companies.

Tax reform will also allow the $2.6 trillion in earnings parked overseas to come back to the United States so that businesses can invest in jobs and opportunity here. Our present tax code locks that money outside the country. That is stupid and destructive and must and will stop this year.

And another big change that will create millions of jobs is moving from long depreciation schedules toward immediate 100 percent full expensing for new business investment. New factories and machines that make Americans more productive should not be discouraged by taxes and red tape. John F. Kennedy moved in this direction as did the Reagan reforms. But there has been backsliding. We will restore expensing so we do not double tax and discourage new investment in America.

Life is tough enough without an IRS actively discouraging and penalizing work, savings and investment. America should not be locked into slow and halting 2 percent growth. We can return to rates closer to 4 percent and higher. There are no limits on what Americans can achieve if we get the tax collector out of the way. Taxes can be simpler, lower, transparent, fairer and understandable — written in English.

The tax reform legislation is being drafted now and will be introduced in the House and Senate by the last week of this month. It will pass the House in October and the Senate before Thanksgiving.

Those Americans looking to get a job back or get their first job or enjoy a deserved raise need tax reform and tax reduction now. They deserve a government and tax code that works for them, not the present mess that fights against them and their families.",2,http://www.insidesources.com/point-americans-want-tax-code-works/

385,Norquist,Grover,latimes,"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has become a punching bag in some conservative circles lately. Fox News host Sean Hannity recently called for him to be replaced as the GOP’s leader in the U.S. Senate. The Senate Conservative Fund then piled on with a blast email calling for McConnell’s ouster.

These attacks are misguided. McConnell, arguably more than anyone else, is responsible for ensuring that Republicans in Congress have remained largely in lockstep opposition to the Affordable Care Act, and as minority leader in 2009, he also kept them in line against President Obama’s tax-and-spend stimulus package (no small feat at a time when the then-new president was highly popular and had many goodies to offer individual congressional Republicans).

Even though the GOP at best had control of only half of one of the three branches of government for most of the Obama administration, the party managed to hold growth in federal spending flat despite the best efforts of a White House intent on much higher levels of spending. McConnell’s leadership even forced Obama to make 90% of the George W. Bush tax cuts permanent.

The ire directed toward McConnell is silly. Taxpayers should save their anger for the three Republican senators who refused to end Obamacare and the 20 tax increases included in the law: John McCain of Arizona, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine.

Better yet, there is another big fat target for taxpayers who wish to go after Republicans behaving badly: the California Legislature.

By acceding to the cap-and-trade extension, the GOP helped pass what will be an even greater gas tax hike down the road.

Democrats so dominate the California Legislature that they could’ve extended the state’s carbon-emissions cap-and-trade legislation on a 2/3 supermajority vote without any Republican help. But some Democrats were not ready to put their fingerprints on sinking the state’s economy, so Gov. Jerry Brown needed to sucker some Republicans into voting to extend the program’s massive tax and regulatory burdens.

In other words, had seven Republican Assembly members and one Republican state senator not defected, the GOP potentially could have stopped Brown’s cap-and-trade extension. Sadly, Republican Assembly Leader Chad Mayes (R-Yucca Valley) delivered the GOP votes to continue this costly regime for another decade.

So long as Mayes remains the GOP’s leader in the Assembly, it’s hard to see why any California voters, including Republicans, would be motivated to elect more GOP politicians to the state Legislature. Why vote for Republicans if their leadership is only going to assist Democrats in making the state’s tax burden and regulatory climate — already among the most onerous in the nation — even worse?

Thanks to Mayes’ lack of wisdom, during the 2018 election cycle, Republicans will also have a tough time criticizing the $6-billion gas tax increase approved by Democrats in April. After all, by acceding to the cap-and-trade extension, the GOP helped pass what will be an even greater gas tax hike down the road. According to the Legislative Analyst’s Office, the cap-and-trade extension could increase gas prices by an estimated 63 cents per gallon in 2021, rising to 73 cents per gallon in 2031. That is more than three times greater than the 19-cent-per-gallon April increase.

Democrats couldn’t enact a national cap-and-trade law when Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) was House speaker, Harry Reid (D-Nev.) was Senate majority leader and Barack Obama was president because congressional Republicans remained unified in opposition to this economically disastrous policy. But too many California Republicans, under the direction of Mayes, made it clear they care more about Jerry Brown’s legacy than about Golden State taxpayers. And all for a program that imposes enormous economic pain for next to no environmental gain — cap-and-trade in California can’t lower global temperatures.

The good news for Mayes is that he’ll probably end up receiving the JFK Profile in Courage Award, an award Democrats like to hand out to traitorous Republicans. (Remember former Assemblyman Mike Villines of Clovis and state Sen. Dave Cogdill of Modesto? They got the award for voting for tax increases during the state’s 2009 budget crisis.) Unfortunately, Mayes’ treachery means there is no good news for California taxpayers.

386,Norquist,Grover,thehill,"ObamaCare repeal was defeated in the Senate by Arizona Sen. John McCain John Sidney McCain'Real Housewives of the GOP' — Wannabe reality show narcissists commandeer the party George W. Bush: 'It's a problem that Americans are so polarized' they can't imagine him being friends with Michelle Obama Congress brings back corrupt, costly, and inequitably earmarks MORE's unexpected ""no"" vote.

So what now?

The plan was: One, repeal ObamaCare. Two, pass tax reform. Three, win in 2018.

Number one didn't happen.

So is tax reform dead also? Maybe ""skinny"" tax reform?

ADVERTISEMENT

And why would we expect a different result on “take two”? Heck, John McCain also voted against the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003.

Republicans wisely fought the harder fight – ObamaCare – first. It almost worked. The pivot to tax reduction/reform is now taking on the easier fight.

There are six reasons tax reform will pass ""easily"" unlike ObamaCare repeal.

First, on taxes, the GOP is united. Speaker Ryan says that ""we had agreement on 80 percent of tax reform (before jettisoning border-adjustability) and we are now 97 percent in accord."" All agree that the business tax rate must come down to 15 percent or at worst 20 percent to be internationally competitive. Abolition of the death tax and alternative minimum tax have universal appeal. Full and immediate expensing has the backing of most Republicans and heavy manufacturing.

Second, while Republicans have little experience in repealing/reforming entitlements they are very good at cutting taxes. Every single House and Senate Republican (except Vermont Sen. Jim Jeffords) voted for the 1981 tax cuts. In 2001 every single Republican except McCain and Sen. Lincoln Chafee voted for Bush's first tax cut. And in 2003 every Republican (except McCain, Chafee, and Sen. Olympia Snowe) voted for Bush's second tax cut.

Third, the Trump/GOP tax proposal is very pro-family and helpful to middle class voters. It reduces the number of tax credits from seven to three. It doubles the standard deduction from $6,000 to $12,000 and a family of four’s standard deduction from $12,000 to $24,000. And the reform so simplifies the tax code that 95 percent of American taxpayers will not have to itemize.

Fourth, the business community is united in support of the major components of tax reform. Larger American businesses that compete internationally demand that the 35 percent rate fall to 15 or 20 percent so that when one adds the average state income tax of 5 percent we can compete with European firms facing an average of 23 percent tax rates. And equally important for Republican elected officials, smaller firms that are organized as Subchapter S corporations and pay taxes through the personal income tax demand that they see their tour ate now 40 or 44 percent fall to 15 or 20 for equity the big companies.

Two powerful lobbies, larger companies and smaller business leaders are united. For the first time in income tax history, all agree that we must bring the tax on Subchapter S corporations – so-called pass throughs where smaller businesses pay their business taxes through the personal income tax – to parity with larger businesses.

Fifth, there is an election in November 2018. Annual economic growth since the recession ended in July 2009 has been an anemic 2 percent or less. Reagan won his 49 state 1984 landslide after his tax cuts had taken effect in January 1983 and delivered 4 percent growth for almost two years. All 240 Republican congressmen are up for election, 10 senators are up. They want strong economic growth starting in the first quarter of 2018 – not the third quarter. (Bush lost in 1988 with solid growth – in the third quarter of 1988.)

The focus will be on growth because it is good for the country, but perhaps also because it is life or death for the Republican majorities. Republicans had hoped to have two bragging points in November 2018: ObamaCare repeal and pro-growth tax reduction. Now the tax victory must be ""huge"" and provide solid growth to carry the narrative.

Sixth, Democrat opposition will be hysterical and universal, but oddly muted. Everyone fully understands that not a single Democrat will vote for any tax cut. Period. The party has swerved hard left from the days when 37 Democrat senators voted for the tax cut of 1981 and 33 supported Reagan’s tax reform of 1986.

Still, Democrat senators have long been telling their corporate donors and small business constituents that they “feel their pain” of high business taxes. Many Democratic congressmen have friends that pay the alternative minimum tax and the death tax. Democrat opposition will in some cases be transactional. They have to sound and look “progressive,” yet signal to their voters that they understand the need for lower business taxes, all while never admitting the Republicans are doing what they could not or would not do for the past eight years.

387,Norquist,Grover,sltrib,"Utah is at the center of a national debate over the fight to raise taxes and impose greater regulations on Internet commerce.

Between U.S. House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz's Online Transactions Parity Act and state Sens. Curt Bramble's and Wayne Harper's state efforts, a select few Beehive State lawmakers have staked their political careers on making small businesses tax collectors for the government. Fortunately for taxpayers and consumers alike, there are good reasons that for more than 15 years, these efforts have failed.

Big government politicians have long sought to raise and impose taxes on consumers who can't vote them out of office. The growth of online retail shopping in recent years has made that quest appear even more tempting. Several things stand in the way. The first is the U.S. Constitution. In Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, the Supreme Court held that a business had to be physically present in a state before the state could require the business to impose sales or use taxes on consumers elsewhere on its behalf. This has prevented states like Utah from taxing businesses and consumers that aren't based in the state. It has also prevented states like California from reaching into the pockets of Utah consumers. The Constitutional barrier to the imposition of new and higher taxes has been an annoyance to some lawmakers, it has not stopped them from trying.

There are over 10,000 sales and use taxing jurisdictions in the United States. State and national efforts that would subject small businesses to each of these unique tax collection entities would be both burdensome and unaffordable. Imagine New York or California tax collectors auditing small online retailers in Utah for what they believe are under-reported tax payments. While this would be a boon to accountants and lawyers, it would be destructive to the small businesses that make America the economic powerhouse it is.

The effort to raise taxes on Internet sales isn't just bad policy; it's horrible politics.

A poll released just last week found that 71 percent of Utahns oppose legislation that would require businesses to collect and file sales taxes in other states. Seventy-three percent of people in that same poll believed that other states would be encouraged to subject small businesses in Utah to follow suit. And the two-thirds of Utah residents who oppose letting other state tax collectors reach into their pockets have good reason to be concerned. Bramble serves as the president of the National Council of State Legislatures (NCSL), a liberal big government lobby group, that pushes for state and federal legislation that would allow other states to do just that.

But what if Bramble and Harper's legislation were ""revenue neutral,"" as some hope? Even if the state sales tax were reduced to compensate for new revenue generated by expanding the Utah sales tax beyond state borders, the legislation would not merit support. State borders provide important protections for consumers and taxpayers from overzealous tax collectors. Tearing down this wall, whether it be through greater e-commerce reporting and notification requirements or greater tax authority, would destroy perhaps the most fundamental of protections against taxation without representation. Americans have a right to vote for or against those who raise their taxes.

Imagine being audited by California tax collectors, hauled off to a New York Court, or penalized with a lien by Illinois. If Bramble's efforts succeed nationally, this is precisely what could happen. The Utah Legislature should follow in Sens. Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch's footsteps by rejecting efforts to expand state taxing authority beyond state borders.

It is time to audit the Pentagon.

In 1990, Congress passed the Chief Financial Officers Act requiring every department and agency in the federal government to produce verifiable financial statements that can be fully audited. To date, each major agency has been able to complete this task except one — the Department of Defense (DOD).

This is unacceptable.

Right now our nation is facing a real crisis. The U.S. debt is teetering on the edge of $20 trillion and our servicemen and women are finding themselves without all the resources required to fulfill their missions and defend our country. The DOD is one of the largest employers in the world, with over 2.8 million active duty servicemen and women, national guardsmen, reservists, and civilians. In fiscal year 2016, the Pentagon budget reached nearly $600 billion. Our country faces many threats. We must provide for America’s national defense while still being responsible with taxpayer dollars.

The Founding Fathers noted the importance of defense in the very first line of the United States Constitution. Congress initially created the War Department in 1789, but following World War II, President Truman proposed a new defense structure. Even at this time in our history, we were spending more on defense than the government could afford. In his proposal to Congress, President Truman cited wasteful military spending as a reason for demanding a more unified and accountable defense department.

Trump budget cuts don't go far enough: Jon Gabriel

A real national security budget will keep the peace

In the last 70 years, not much has changed. In 2014, the Marine Corps announced it had successfully passed an audit, but had to retract its announcement upon further scrutiny. The Defense Business Board, an organization of private sector executives whose purpose is to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the DOD, issued a report in January 2015 revealing at least $125 billion in administrative waste with a bottom line that “we are spending a lot more money than we thought.”

The Government Accountability Office — Congress’ eyes and ears on the ground for keeping the federal government accountable — stated in 2013 that it could not complete an audit of the entire federal government because the DOD could not produce verifiable documents. According to GAO’s assessment, “The main obstacles to a GAO opinion on … consolidated financial statements were: Serious financial management problems at the Department of Defense that made its financial statements unauditable.”

POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media

Trump will test Democrats' tax patriotism: Glenn Reynolds

Imagine average Americans citing the complexity of their finances for their failure to comply with an IRS audit.

The first step to reining in our spending and getting waste under control is a full audit of the federal government. The Pentagon must conform to the same level of accountability that other public sector agencies are held to when it comes to the spending of taxpayer dollars. The national defense is too important to remain a black box.

The Trump administration is proposing a military buildup with an increase in the defense budget of at least $54 billion, to be paid for in part by eliminating waste. That is a great deal of money. American taxpayers have the right to know how and how well their taxes have been spent in the last few years.

What did those tax dollars buy? How many tanks do we have? Where are they? Do they still work? If Americans need to sacrifice more to maintain our military strength, step one is to have a fully informed citizenry. A full audit of the Pentagon will make it clear how much we have spent, what we bought with our money, and what we need for the future.

If President Biden and Sen. Sherrod Brown raise the corporate tax rate, Ohio households and businesses will get stuck with higher utility bills. Democrats plan to impose a corporate income tax rate increase to 28%, even higher than communist China's 25%.

Customers bear the cost of corporate income taxes imposed on utility companies. Corporate income tax cuts drive utility rates down, corporate income tax hikes drive utility rates up.

Electric, gas, and water companies must get their billing rates approved by the respective state utility commissions. When the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act cut the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, utility companies worked with officials to pass along the tax savings to customers, including at least 10 Ohio utilities.

As noted in a July 2019 First Energy Corp. Press Release:

“Ohio Edison, Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company and Toledo Edison – announced today that the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) approved a comprehensive settlement agreement that will return additional savings to customers related to federal income tax law changes and includes investments to modernize the electric distribution system with advanced automation equipment, real-time voltage controls and smart meters.

“FirstEnergy's Ohio customers will receive 100 percent of the tax savings created by the federal Tax Cut and Jobs Act, which includes tax savings already credited to customers since last year. As a result of the additional tax savings, a typical residential customer using 1,000 kilowatt hours of electricity could expect to see a reduction of over $4 in monthly bills.”



""We are pleased to resolve the tax reform issues and will pass along the tax savings to customers,"" said Samuel L. Belcher, senior vice president and president of FirstEnergy Utilities. ""We look forward to modernizing our electric system with advanced equipment that will help reduce the number and duration of power outages. Smart meters also will allow our customers to make more informed decisions about their energy usage.” – July 17, 2019 First Energy Corp. press release

Dominion Energy Ohio passed along their savings to customers as well:

The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) today adopted an agreement that authorized Dominion Energy Ohio (Dominion) to establish a credit on gas customer bills to reflect the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 on its rates.

Dominion will credit residential customers the amount it has over collected, plus interest, since Jan. 1, 2018 under the previous corporate tax rate. The $50.9 million credit will be passed back to all customers over a 12 month period.

Dominion will return to customers annually approximately $18.9 million, which reflects the remaining tax savings not currently accounted for in rates, on a going-forward basis, until the Commission approves updated rates through a distribution rate case. Dominion is expected to file an application with the PUCO for its next distribution rate case in 2024.

Dominion will return to customers normalized excess deferred income tax (EDIT), estimated by the utility to be approximately $416 million, over a federally prescribed time period of approximately 38 years.

Dominion will credit customers non-normalized EDIT, estimated by the utility to be approximately $181 million, over approximately a six-year period.

A residential customer will see a bill reduction of approximately $5.80 per month for the first year, a $3.15 reduction in years two through six and a $1.55 reduction in year seven and beyond. – Dec. 5, 2019 WKTN article.

Duke Energy Ohio, Inc passed along their savings to customers as well:

Duke Energy Ohio customers will receive approximately $20 million in annual tax savings on their electric bills beginning this month. The bill reduction is a result of the recent Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which federal lawmakers passed in late 2017.

""The tax act provides a unique opportunity for us to reduce customers' bills by millions of dollars,"" said Jim Henning, president of Duke Energy Ohio and Kentucky. ""And that's exactly what we're doing here – delivering real savings to our customers.""

Duke Energy Ohio also plans to lower its customers' natural gas bills by about $3 million beginning in May – subject to the approval of proposals filed with state regulators.

""The tax act reduced our corporate tax rate – and that's a benefit we are pleased to pass along to our customers,"" said Henning. ""However, the impacts on our business and customers go far beyond the reduction in the corporate tax rate. While some of the changes reduce our federal tax liabilities over time, others could actually increase our tax obligations.

""We considered all of these scenarios as we determined the best ways to pass along the benefits of the tax act to our customers. And we continue to work through various regulatory proceedings in our efforts to ensure that our customers receive the benefits of this new law."" – April 13, 2018, Duke Energy Press Release

Vectren will return to customers normalized excess accumulated deferred income tax (EDIT), estimated by the utility to be $74.6 million, over an approximately 25-year period.

Vectren will credit customers non-normalized EDIT of $25.9 million over a six-year period.

Each Vectren residential customer is estimated to receive approximately $270 in total credit over the duration of the refunds. – July 1, 2020 Ohio Public Utility Commission Statement

NEO will credit residential customers the amount it has over collected, plus interest, since Jan. 1, 2018 under the previous corporate tax rates. The $500,423 credit, including interest, will be passed back to customers over a 12-month period.

NEO will return to customers normalized excess accumulated deferred income tax (EDIT), estimated by the utility to be approximately $2.3 million, over a federally prescribed time period.

NEO will credit customers non-normalized EDIT of $50,867 over a 72-month period.

A residential customer, using approximately 10 Mcf per month, will see a bill reduction of approximately $1.37 per month for the first year. – May 20, 2020 Ohio Public Utility Commission Statement

South Central Power Co. passed their savings along to customers as well:

As some of the year’s highest electric bills are hitting consumers’ mailboxes thanks to near-record heat this summer, South Central Power members are getting a one-time break on transmission charges that could decrease the average member’s July bill by around $10.

The bill reduction is a result of the recent Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which federal lawmakers passed in late 2017. “Thanks to tax savings realized by our transmission provider, we received a credit of roughly $1.7 million toward our transmission costs,” said Allison Saffle, VP of member service for South Central Power. “We’ve passed those savings directly on to consumers, who will see them reflected in lower transmission charges on this month’s bills. Going forward, the impact of the lower tax rates will be passed directly on to consumers, who will see transmission costs lowered by roughly $1 per month.” – July 24, 2018 South Central Power Co. Statement

390,Norquist,Grover,foxnews,"You won’t hear this from the establishment media but the Senate’s ObamaCare repeal bill contains massive tax relief for middle class families.

When it was signed into law seven years ago, ObamaCare implemented a health care system with top-down, bureaucratic command and control. The government told you what insurance you must have. And what you cannot have.

ObamaCare suppressed individual choice, competition, and state flexibility, and imposed a long list of taxes on businesses and families.

Republican Senators now have the chance to repair this damage by passing the Better Care Reconciliation Act (BCRA).

When signed into law, the BCRA will replace the failing system with a sustainable, patient-centered health care system, just as Republicans promised in the last election.

This legislation achieves four important goals.

First, the bill repeals a total of $700 billion dollars in ObamaCare taxes that raise the cost of care, restrict choice, and hurt economic growth.

Second, the BCRA strengthens tax-preferred Health Savings Accounts, so that families are better able to save for health care expenses.

Third, the bill allows states to implement health care systems that work for families in the real world. No longer will we have a one size fits all system dreamed up by bureaucrats in Washington and policed by the IRS.

Fourth, the BCRA enacts long overdue entitlement reform that reins in out of control spending while ensuring the truly needy are protected.

ObamaCare imposed massive tax hikes that restricted the ability of individuals and families to make their own health care choices. The law imposed a $2,000 tax penalty on a family of four that failed to purchase “government-approved” health insurance and another $2,000 penalty on businesses for every employee they cannot provide with “government-approved” insurance.

In addition to these mandates, ObamaCare imposed middle class income tax hikes on families facing high medical bills. Prior to passage of the law, a family could deduct medical costs once they exceeded 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income. ObamaCare increased that to 10 percent, a tax increase that hits families making an average of $53,000.

Even the ObamaCare taxes on businesses hurt families because they are inevitably passed onto consumers. For instance, the ObamaCare health insurance tax levied on companies based on their market share is directly passed onto millions of individuals and small businesses. According to the American Action Forum, this tax increases premiums by $5,000 over a decade, with half of the tax falling on families earning less than $50,000 per year.

In addition to repealing these direct and indirect taxes on families, the BCRA repeals ObamaCare taxes that hinder economic growth, like the 3.8 percent capital gains tax on investment income of individuals and small businesses. This ObamaCare levy is a tax on new investment and thus slows job creation. How much damage did it do? Well, repeal of this tax will create an estimated 133,000 jobs over the long-term.

While the BCRA repeals ObamaCare's taxes, it also expands the ability of American families to use tax-preferred savings accounts to save for health care expenses.

Currently, 20 million Americans use Healthcare Savings Accounts (HSAs) and another 30 million use Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs). The Senate bill repeals ObamaCare’s taxes that restrict the ability of families to use these accounts. The bill restores the ability of families to use HSAs to purchase over the counter medicines. The bill also eliminates ObamaCare’s $2,500 cap on FSAs.

The bill also doubles the contribution limit on HSAs so they become an even better tool for families to pay for family health care expenses. This expansion also reduces taxes on HSA users by almost $20 billion over the next decade.

In addition to tax cuts, the BCRA achieves bold, once in a lifetime entitlement reform by block granting Medicaid to the states through a traditional grant or through a targeted per-capita allotment. This will put Medicaid on a budget for the first time in history allowing it to grow with inflation and population but not continue to spin out of control.

This change is an important step toward reining in Washington’s spending problem. Under these reforms, states will have the ability to introduce a system that fits their needs, will have important flexibility to implement work requirements, while having several years to phase in block grants.

This is not the only flexibility the BCRA grants states - the bill also empowers governors to create a health care system free from ObamaCare regulations if they choose.

The Senate bill drastically expands existing state innovation waivers so states can choose to set up a system free from numerous ObamaCare regulations that have increased costs such as Qualified Health Plan requirements, Essential Health Benefit requirements, and actuarial value requirements. The law also allows states to modify federal tax credits and rules based around individual and group insurance markets.

This will grant every state across the country the ability to implement a system that best fits the needs of their residents towards a system of lower costs, more choice, and increased access to care.

After seven years ObamaCare has failed.

Insurance premiums went up, not down. Government spending and taxes went up, not down. Americans had less choice and control over their own health, not more. The Senate bill reverses all of these trends and begins to move towards patient-centered, flexible and affordable health care for all Americans.",2,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/06/27/what-beltway-press-wont-tell-about-senates-obamcare-repeal-bill.html
391,Norquist,Grover,thehill,"In January, congressional Republicans began using a Bill Clinton William (Bill) Jefferson ClintonObama, Clinton reflect on Mondale's legacy Polls suggest House Democrats will buck midterm curse and add to their ranks Democratic Rep. Mondaire Jones calls on Breyer to retire MORE-signed law known as the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to undo fourteen of Obama’s “midnight” regulations that were finalized in the final six months of his administration. Repealed regulations include new labor, Internet, energy, environmental, and gun rules. The deadline to invoke the CRA has now passed and as Congress takes up healthcare and tax reform, the Trump administration and the bureaucracy now under his control must continue to take aim at even more regulations imposed in recent years.

There are several opportunities for reining in the regulatory state that don’t require any studies, drawn out debates, or much thought.

First, Trump should focus on financial rules and labor. The “Fiduciary Rule” has got to go. Although the rule partially went into effect on June 9, the Labor Department still has the option to roll back the rule through a new rule making process. Alternatively the more expedient option would be for Congress to target funding for enforcement of the rule, which if unaltered will adversely impact millions of Americans by putting the federal government between Americans and their retirement savings decisions. Without a full rollback of the rule, seven million IRA holders could be priced out of investment advice, meaning less IRAs and less American savings.

Next, the Republican Senate should quickly consider and confirm two new Trump appointments to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), which has served as a tool of Big Labor under Democrat control. Two seats on the board are vacant and if Trump nominees are confirmed with 51 votes, Republicans will have a majority on the five-member board. Instead of waging a war on businesses through things like the Joint Employer Standard that dismantles the American franchise model and makes independently managed small businesses more susceptible to coerced unionization, the NLRB should properly balance the interests of employees and their employers. The NLRB should not simply serve as a tool for forced-unionization.

Under President Trump, the war on America’s energy sector by radical environmentalists is and must end. A helpful first step included a withdraw of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, an Obama promise to limit greenhouse gasses in the future that was never actually Senate-approved.

In March, President Trump signed an executive order directing the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under Administrator Scott Pruitt to review former President Obama’s signature environmental regulation, the ""Clean Power Plan,” which is on hold currently due to litigation. Trump and Pruitt have since released a replacement plan for the regulation that is now being reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) prior to being released for public comment. It is important that there be a complete roll back of the Clean Power Plan.

Finally, bureaucrats shouldn’t be permitted to wage a war on innovation in the public health space. With the confirmation of Dr. Scott Gottlieb as the 23rd Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), there is great hope that under his leadership, the agency will expedite the approval of drugs, products, and technologies that save lives.

It is not only important that the process for introducing life-saving drugs or medical devices be made easier and less expensive, but there is perhaps an easier target for regulatory reform that stands to impact the health of tens of millions of Americans: the FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products (CTP). One of the core obligations of the center is to oversee the innovation, development, and introduction of products that are less harmful than cigarettes to the market. To date, they have miserably failed at this task and without statutory or obligatory reforms it’s only going to get worse.

The growth of the independent vapor product market and the 2016 decision by the FDA to classify those products as “tobacco” exacerbates the need for immediate reform at the center. Moving forward, the FDA should require that the center conduct proper and transparent rulemaking so that regulated businesses also know the rules by which the FDA actually conducts product reviews. Rather than spending resources guessing what the FDA may request or demand, businesses can invest in the U.S. and hire more employees to develop new products that are less harmful than cigarettes.

Slow-rolling the approval of products with an ad hoc process governed by non-binding guidance documents is not how a government entity, let alone a scientific organization, should operate. The current broken process ultimately will result in fewer of America’s forty million smokers from taking advantage of choices and technologies that may result in better health outcomes. The FDA and CTP should no longer stand in the way.

As Congress determines the best path forward on repealing Obamacare and then passing comprehensive rate-reducing tax reform, these regulatory reform opportunities represent an easy focus by different Trump appointees and the administration itself. Each of these reforms should represent big wins for taxpayers, consumers, and small businesses.

392,Norquist,Grover,wsj,"Americans know what kind of tax reform they want: a bill that cuts rates across the board, kills the death tax and the alternative minimum tax, expands the personal and family exemptions, and eliminates politically directed loopholes. If lawmakers passed such a plan, it would supercharge the economy and create millions of jobs.

The challenge is how to get from here to there, given the rules of Congress.

Tax reform can be enacted with a simple majority in the Senate under the process known as budget reconciliation—but only if various complicated procedures are followed. One of these, called the Byrd rule after the late Sen. Robert Byrd, says that bills passed under reconciliation cannot increase the deficit outside of the budget window—traditionally 10 years.

The practical result? Tax cuts passed under reconciliation magically disappear in year 11, like Cinderella’s carriage turning into a pumpkin at midnight. That is why the Bush tax cuts, passed in 2001, would have ceased to exist in 2011 had they not been temporarily extended for two years. Some parts then were made permanent in 2013.

But any tax reform meant to spur economic growth should be permanent so that corporations and entrepreneurs can plan ahead. If they don’t know what the rules will be a few years down the road, it is tougher to build factories, hire new workers, invest in equipment, or spend on research and development.

Conventional wisdom says that the only way to pass lasting tax cuts is to offset them with corresponding tax increases, base broadening or, best of all, permanent spending cuts.

There’s another option: Extend the budget window to 25 years—or longer. The 10-year window is not set in stone. The Budget Act of 1974 simply says that the window has to be at least five years in duration.

The idea of modifying the time frame isn’t new, and it certainly isn’t radical. The budget window was expanded in fiscal year 1995 from five years to seven. Congress used the 10-year window for the first time in 2000, but then went back to five years again as recently as 2007.

We say extend the budget window to 25 years. Why? Because the people creating jobs and investing in new products think long-term. Depreciation schedules for new plant and equipment often run to 25 years or more.

Lawmakers simply should write this year’s budget to say that all tax cuts can last 25 years, which would allow rate reductions to go into effect now and be offset later with revenue from higher growth or spending restraint.

If Congress is serious about boosting the economy, it should pass a net tax cut within the extended 25-year budget window. As President Trump says, “prime the pump” now and the economy will start to flow, creating millions of jobs and more tax money for Washington.

Fortunately for taxpayers, Sen. Pat Toomey (R., Pa.) has taken the lead in promoting this pathway to recovery. “Nothing in the law prevents us from using a 20- or even 30-year timeframe,” Mr. Toomey wrote in an op-ed last month. “A 20- or 30-year tax reform would be as close to permanent as we can get since Congress would be likely to overhaul the tax code within that period anyway.”

This brings to mind the classical story of the Gordian knot. It was a knot so complicated that legend said the man who could untie it would go on to rule all of Asia. That man was Alexander the Great, who didn’t wrestle with the knot as all the others had but picked up his sword and cut it in two, causing it to unravel.

That’s what Mr. Toomey wants to do. Extending the budget window to 25 years would cut the Gordian knot, unravel the Byrd rule, and allow serious tax reform to create millions of jobs in the years to come.

By Election Day 2018 the American people will want to know the answer to the question, ""are you better off than you were two years ago?""

Do you have a job?

Do your family members have opportunities and increasing wages?

Or not.

The success of the Trump presidency will hinge on the passage of pro-growth tax reform that addresses the American competitiveness problem, boosts the economy, creates more jobs, and leads to higher wages.

For the economy to grow, tax reform must be permanent, it must lead to competitive tax rates with territoriality, and it must allow immediate expensing of business assets.

It has been more than 30 years since the tax code was reformed, and in that time, the world has changed drastically. Other countries have updated their tax codes and lowered their rates, while the U.S. system has barely changed.

Over the past decade, the economy has struggled at just two percent GDP growth – the worst recovery of the modern era. This lackluster recovery has cost families an average of $8,600 in annual income, according to the Joint Economic Committee. The Congressional Budget Office projects that two percent growth will continue into the next decade under current policies.

Today, American businesses are taxed at rates far exceeding the rates faced by foreign competitors. The average federal/state corporate tax rate in the U.S. is roughly 39 percent, while the average rate paid by foreign competitors is about 25 percent. Businesses organized as pass-through entities face even higher rates – above 40 percent, and even 50 percent when state tax rates are accounted for.

While the U.S. rate remains high, other countries have adapted to the global changes by aggressively reducing their rates. Today, only the U.S. and Chile have higher corporate tax rates than they did at the start of the century.

People, not businesses, pay taxes, so high business rates are directly absorbed by employees, consumers, and investors through lower wages, fewer jobs, and stagnant economic growth.

As much as 70 percent of the corporate tax cost is borne by labor, according to the CBO. Every dollar increase in the corporate rate decreases wages by two dollars.

As much as 70 percent of the corporate tax cost is borne by labor, according to the CBO. Every dollar increase in the corporate rate decreases wages by two dollars.

In addition to lower rates, the code must be updated so it is globally competitive.

Today, the U.S. is only one of six developed countries with a worldwide system of taxation. Because of this system, American businesses operating overseas are double taxed on income – once when they earn it in the country they are operating in, and again when they bring this money back into the U.S. economy.

American businesses are faced with a disadvantage relative to their foreign competitors, and this system has also resulted in an estimated $2.6 trillion in after-tax income being stranded overseas, unable to be reinvested in the U.S. economy. Moving to territoriality will fix this competitiveness problem and allow businesses to compete.

Tax reform should also move toward a cash-flow system where business investments can be immediately deducted.

Under the current code, business owners cannot immediately expense the cost of purchasing equipment against their taxable income. Instead, they are required to deduct, or “depreciate,” these costs over several years depending on the asset they purchase, as dictated by complex and arbitrary IRS tables. These rules create needless complexity and increase compliance costs.

Moving to a cash-flow system where businesses can immediately recover the cost of their purchases also leads to strong economic growth. According to the Tax Foundation, full business expensing increases GDP by five percent after a decade and increases wages by four percent.

A tax plan that includes competitive rates, territoriality, and expensing will allow Trump to meet his promise of strong economic growth. These changes must be made permanent so taxpayers have the certainty to make decisions that drive economic growth.

The U.S. tax code of 2017 is outdated, uncompetitive, and complex. It restricts the growth of new jobs, increases the cost of capital, and discourages innovation. Reforming this code with pro-growth policies must be the top priority for lawmakers this year.",2,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/06/02/tax-reform-is-most-important-issue-2017.html

Donald Trump’s unexpected victory in 2016 did not lay the groundwork for Republican political dominance. But the March 2011 signing of ACT 10, a dramatic reform of public sector labor laws, by Wisconsin’s Scott Walker certainly did. To understate it: If Act 10 is enacted in a dozen more states, the modern Democratic Party will cease to be a competitive power in American politics. It’s that big a deal.

Here’s what Act 10 did and why it’s the model for the 25 states where Republicans control the House, Senate and governorship (public safety officers — primarily police and fire — are exempt from these changes).

No Wisconsin government worker can be forced to join a union as a condition of employment. No Wisconsin government worker can be forced to pay union dues, “agency fees” or any other payment to unions. (A teacher earning $50,000 in base salary previously was forced to pay $1,000 — 2 percent — in annual dues.) No government entity can withhold union dues from workers and hand the money to unions. Those wishing to join a union must now write a check to the union. In the past, most unions negotiated to have the government collect their dues, and the true cost of dues was hidden in the withholding. Income tax withholding has the same effect in disguising the true cost of taxation for many Americans. Unions may not negotiate pensions. The city or state has a pension plan, but mayors can no longer be mau-maued to grant pension benefits that would bankrupt the city in 30 years. Unions cannot negotiate benefits or work rules. Nor can they negotiate wage increases beyond the rate of inflation. Municipalities may put pay increases beyond inflation to the voters by referendum. Each union must hold an annual vote to see whether members wish to continue to be “represented” by that union. Many local unions have disappeared as a result.

In the five years since Act 10’s signing, more than 135,000 government workers — about one-third of government workers — stopped paying dues. At $1,000 per employee that costs the largest structure in the Wisconsin left $135 million a year. Over a two-year election cycle, the left in Wisconsin is short $270 million that once paid for voter ID, voter education and “get out the vote” efforts. Over the past five years, Wisconsin’s progressive structures were unable to coerce union dues totaling roughly a half-billion dollars. This is just in one state, and this was just the early years; each year, the number and percentage of government employees opting out grows.

Violent Opposition Before, Silence After

Union leaders in Wisconsin and the other 49 states understood what was at stake. They offered to accept pay cuts if they could maintain the laws that forced workers to pay dues and have the state collect them for the union. Their focus was on funding the union structure — not pay or benefits. Tens of thousands of paid union workers flooded into Madison, besieging the Capitol building for weeks. Other states’ unions paid for this effort, because they knew they could not afford for Act 10 to pass and become a model. They knew the stakes.

But Act 10 did pass. The unions tried to defeat the chief justice of Wisconsin’s Supreme Court to have the legislation ruled unconstitutional. They failed. They tried to recall Gov. Scott Walker and Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch. The recall was defeated. They tried again to recall enough senators to give the Democrats control of the legislature. They failed. And four years after Act 10 passed, there was an all-out effort to stop Gov. Walker from winning re-election. He won.

Even worse for unions and Democrats, Act 10 proved popular. Teachers were free to move from one school to another, untethered by fear of losing tenure. Bad teachers can be asked to go, and the unions’ role as defender of “last hired, first fired” layoffs was replaced by hiring and firing based on competency.

The MacIver Institute, a conservative think tank, calculated that in the first five years, taxpayers saved more than $5 billion, or on average $1,277 on property taxes and $916 in lower income taxes. Mayors, even Democrats, loved the ability to actually govern cities and manage workforces. The Democrats’ campaigns against Walker were funded by unions wishing to kill Act 10. But they campaigned publicly on other issues, knowing their candidates had all used Act 10 to govern their cities and counties.

Act 10 Is the New Black

It is the model for all Republican legislatures. Iowa enacted similar legislation this spring after the GOP captured the state Senate. Newly minted unified Republican control in Kentucky and Missouri, led by Govs. Matt Bevin and Eric Greitens, is committed to enacting Act 10 as soon as possible.

Today, there are 14.3 million union members in the U.S. — 7.3 million in the public sector and 7 million in the real economy. They take in annual dues of more than $8 billion every year — $32 billion over the course of a four-year presidential cycle.

Currently, there are 25 states with Republican control of the governorship and both houses of the legislature. If half of them pass Act 10 or its equivalent, the collapse of union dues cannot be replaced by any collection of progressive billionaires. Before ACT 10, the Wisconsin GOP had majorities consisting of 57 to 38 in the state House and 19 to 14 in the Senate. Today, they have the governorship and larger majorities of 64-35 in the House and 20-13 in the Senate. In short, Act 10 is campaign finance reform. No money taken by force may be employed in politics. Less kindly, but quite accurately, “no stolen money in politics.”

Like parallel trench lines approaching a besieged fortress, Act 10 cannot be stopped, and once enacted the state becomes red. No states with Act 10 can continue to be part of the once-vaunted “Blue Wall,” and it is difficult to see how a state that enacts Act 10 could repeal it. Of the 28 right-to-work states, only one repealed it, and later repassed it.

Wisconsin, which had not voted for a Republican candidate for president since 1984, voted for Trump five years after Act 10 passed and re-elected Sen. Ron Johnson, whom Democrats and Republicans believed to be the second most likely Republican to lose in 2016.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo is working to cement his reputation as the most leftist governor in the history of New York State. Cuomo is pushing a plan to enact a massive new tax on energy to pay for a bailout of four failing nuclear plants in the state all owned by the Exelon Corporation. This not only puts New York ratepayers on the hook for a potentially $8 billion bailout but is the definition of corporate cronyism. The question that remains is why New York’s fiscal Republicans are remaining silent on Cuomo’s bailout?

Cuomo’s corporate bailout scheme is being pushed under the guise of the governor’s “Clean Energy Standard,” which requires 50 percent of energy in New York to be produced from renewable sources by 2030. The new standard has given Cuomo the cover needed to push a massive new tax on the monthly utility bills New York residents and businesses pay, with the majority of the revenue going to Exelon Corporation, not renewable energy like Cuomo promises.

Cuomo's planned energy tax is projected to increase electricity rates in the Empire State by $964 million in the first two years, equating to roughly $1.3 million per day being siphoned off from New York ratepayers and going directly to Exelon Corporation. Those costs increase further to almost $3.5 billion within five years.

What are New York residents getting in return for billions in increased utility rates? They get to pay for a bailout of Exelon Corporation, a Chicago-based Fortune 100 company with annual revenues of $34 billion.

BAILOUT: Regulators defend nuclear plan

LAWSUIT: Challenging nuclear bailout

THE PLAN: NYS okays nuclear bailout

According to the bi-partisan Tax Foundation’s 2017 State Business Tax Climate Index, New York State is ranked 49th worst in the country for tax climates. Increasing rates on residents and businesses in the state will only serve to add fuel to an already massive tax fire, driving down the state’s competitiveness even further.

Ironically even environmental groups such as the New York-based Alliance for a Green Economy are crying foul over Cuomo’s bailout. In response to the plan, the Alliance’s program director, Jessica Azulay, argued that, “Under the guise of ‘clean energy’ the nuclear industry is about to get its hands on our money in order to save its own profits.”

What is more shocking than Cuomo’s blatant disregard for the economic well-being of his constituents and businesses is the fact that many of New York’s fiscal Republicans have continued to be silent throughout. The chair of the New York Senate’s committee on energy, Joseph Griffo, who is also the deputy senate majority whip, has been noticeably absent in the debate.

Downstate Republicans, such as state Sens. Elaine Phillips, Kemp Hannon, John Flanagan, and Kenneth LaValle, have also been shockingly silent on the matter, although their constituents will be the ones burdened by higher utility rates to fund a bailout for which they receive zero benefit.

Logically one would think that these New York Republicans would be up in arms over a plan pushed by a Democratic governor that will cost their constituents billions to fund a government bailout benefiting one corporation. Sadly that has not been the case.

400,Norquist,Grover,newsok,"Justice and public safety are two duties every legislature needs to address. We know any legislative discussion is difficult by design, and our political system works best when lawmakers turn a critical eye on all issues to produce effective, fiscally sound public policy. In pursuing criminal justice reform the Legislature, the Oklahoma Justice Reform Task Force and Gov. Mary Fallin have done just that. It's time for the Legislature to work together to do the right thing and fulfill their obligation to protect public safety and taxpayer dollars.

Criminal justice reform bills being considered this session accomplish five main objectives: strengthening supervision of offenders, focusing prison beds on serious and violent offenders, improving release practices, providing better support to victims of crimes, and ensuring oversight and accountability. These reforms didn't come from nowhere. They were developed in the midst of a historic conservative movement to reform the justice system.

If the bills are passed with the policies intact, the state will not only avert the 7,200 prison beds that will be added to the system, but actually decrease the current population by 3 percent, saving taxpayers billions of dollars.

TV pundits are bemoaning the loss of “bipartisan compromise.” They think they’re being sophisticated and worldly, but they are simply telling everyone just how very old they are.

Back in the 1950s, and even into the 1970s, all fights — civil rights, taxes, spending, guns, foreign policy — were bipartisan. Why? Because if you were told someone was a Republican, all you really knew about them was that they were born north of the Mason-Dixon Line. Little old ladies in Mississippi who agreed with Ronald Reagan on everything voted for George McGovern because General Sherman was mean to Atlanta … recently. Liberals in Maine were Republicans because the general defending Little Round Top at Gettysburg was a Republican from Maine.

If one party wants to go west while the other wants to go east, there can be no meeting point.

The parties were largely regional, with some marbling of recent immigrants. Tax fights pitted liberal Republicans and liberal Democrats against conservative Republicans and conservative Democrats. Every victory and every loss was “bipartisan,” because shirts and skins meant nothing.

Which also made compromise easier. Richard Nixon believed the government should grow larger, while his nemesis, Sen. Teddy Kennedy, wanted it to get “much larger.” The compromise? “Somewhat larger.” Over time, the federal government got quite large. In the Colonial period, government absorbed 1 to 2 percent of personal income; by 1980, the federal government was consuming 20 percent of the economy — thanks to those “large” compromises.

During Reagan’s political lifetime, the two parties evolved into more consistent structures. Those who wanted government to grow were or became Democrats, and those who wished to limit the state’s power over the individual were or became Republicans. The first Republican senator elected in the former Confederate states was John Tower, in 1961. Today, the state Senates and Houses of all 11 former Confederate states are controlled by the GOP, and nine of them have Republican governors.

The partisan divide started long before Trump. In 1981, the Reagan tax cuts won every Senate vote, except for 11 Democrats. The 1986 tax reform package that cut the top marginal tax rates for businesses to 34 percent and individuals to 28 percent passed the House 292-136 and the Senate 74-23. But by 1993, Clinton’s tax hikes passed by one vote, and without a single Republican one. In 2009, when Obama had a Democrat House and Senate, the stimulus spending passed without a single Republican vote in the House.

George H.W. Bush won the presidency when he promised, “Read my lips, No new taxes.” After breaking that pledge, he lost the 1992 election, and the message was clear to Republicans: Take the no-tax-hike pledge, win the primary and win the general. Keep the pledge? Get re-elected.

Since 1990, no income tax hike has passed with any Republican votes. No tax increase has been enacted at the federal level in any year since 1990 if the GOP held the House, Senate or the presidency. The only tax hikes came in 1993 and 2009–10 — years of complete Democrat control of the presidency, House and Senate. The Affordable Care Act was passed solely with Democrats’ votes. Dodd-Frank, the banking regulations bill, was passed with support from only three Republicans in the Senate and none in the House.

Looking ahead, the repeal of Obamacare will be passed with only Republican votes. The tax cut of 2017 will pass without any support from Democrats. So far, no Democrat has voted with Republicans in the Trump era if it was the deciding vote to enact anything. Once Judge Neil Gorsuch had enough votes to ensure his confirmation to the Supreme Court, and only then, did three Democrats — who are up for re-election in 2018 in red states — vote to confirm.

The lines are drawn. Democrats cannot vote against the interests of unions, trial lawyers, environmentalists or the pro-choice lobby. Republicans, meanwhile, cannot vote against gun owners, taxpayers or the self-employed. So what about bipartisan compromise?

If one party wants to go west while the other wants to go east, there can be no meeting point. On taxes, they go up or down; there is no in-between. Compromise means moving toward one’s goals more slowly than one might wish but still making progress. If you are heading from Washington, D.C., to California, arriving in Missouri is not treason; it is on the way to California. But if your feet are wet and everyone around you is speaking French, moving in the wrong direction is not compromising, it is losing.

That is why Republicans refused in 2011 to give Obama a tax hike in return for promises of spending restraint. A tax hike was not a compromise, it was a loss.

Neither party can be expected to betray its principles. And on most central issues, the parties are divided and wish to move in opposite directions. Divided government gives you stasis — like the last six years of Obama. But unity in the national government and in 25 red states and six blue states gives you movement in the direction of the majority party without concern for the niceties of “compromise” or “bipartisanship.”

Cutting the corporate tax rate from the non-competitive 35 percent to 15 percent and the tax on small businesses that pay taxes though their personal income tax returns from 44 percent to 15 percent, Trump has created the most pro-growth tax policy in modern history. Reagan's tax cut was less powerful. And Reagan's tax cut created four million jobs in the first year it took full effect (1983) and increased growth to 4 percent a year.

Two years of Reagan 4 percent growth led to the 1984 landslide where Reagan won 49 of the 50 states. Speedy passage of Trump's tax package will drive GDP growth and job creation…in time for the 2018 congressional elections and the 2020 presidential election.

The lower tax rate for business — Britain is 20 percent — will make us more internationally competitive and reduce the argument for tariffs and the danger of trade wars. Growth — as during the Reagan years — makes immigration reform possible because it removes the fear that low employment levels are caused by immigration rather than stupid and destructive American tax policy.

""Not too shabby: Trump tax plan nails corporate rate, errs on income"" https://t.co/jdfZ7NS5oX pic.twitter.com/K6K9ePtGhI — The Hill (@thehill) April 27, 2017

A 15 percent tax rate makes all the tax deductions that lobbyists have inserted in the code as protection against a 35 percent rate less valuable. And that makes special interest lobbyists less valuable.

Tax deduction lobbyists will be defanged and devalued. What they sell their clients has just been made half as valuable. And expanding the personal exemption for individual and families makes each itemized personal deduction less important or even irrelevant to millions of Americans.

For eight years Obama and Democrat fundraisers promised Silicon Valley Democrats would allow them to bring their overseas earnings back. They, uh, lied. Trump is delivering on repatriation, territoriality and a competitive low tax rate — the key need of every Silicon Valley entrepreneur. This could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.

And corrupt big city machines have for decades told taxpayers, “don't mind our high property taxes, the feds will pay much of it through the deductibility of state and local taxes.” Democrat governors said, ""Don't mind high income rates, the feds pay much of it."" With the elimination of the deductibility of state and local taxes Democrat mayors will have to pay for every penny they take.

GOP leaders say Trump tax plan will guide future policy https://t.co/ZL3DLJxRFk pic.twitter.com/wd0WJfF7At — The Hill (@thehill) April 26, 2017

And they will pay politically. Deductibility of state and local tax cuts has long been an argument for higher local taxes and against local tax cuts. Back in 1978, Governor Jerry Brown used this argument — unsuccessfully — against Proposition 13. Republican tax-reducing candidates will have a leg up and tax hiking Dems will now dance on marbles during these debates. Look for more Republican mayors courtesy of this tax reform.

Growth equals jobs. The wind is at the back of the GOP in 2018 and 2020 — and just think of how much fun Republicans can have running against all the Democrats who voted no. A powerful promise kept with Silicon Valley. A once skeptical business community empowered worldwide by Trump’s tax cut. Reduced tensions on trade and immigration. And a body blow to the tax and spend politics that have driven our more corrupt and failed cities.

ObamaCare is about to get worse before Congress repeals it. There is an ObamaCare tax on health insurance that was delayed until after the 2016 election. Now, it is scheduled to take effect in 2018. When it begins to bite, premiums will soar even higher.

Insurers are already beginning to price their plans for next year so any delay must happen soon. Congress can and should immediately act to delay the tax for one year.

Given these time constraints, lawmakers have only one realistic choice. Delay this tax in must-pass legislation funding the government before the end of the month.

The case for stopping this tax from going into effect should be clear. While repeal of ObamaCare has been delayed because of debates over what regulation changes are Byrd Rule consistent, there is consensus on repealing all $1 trillion of ObamaCare taxes.

The health insurance tax is the only ObamaCare tax that will go into effect next year, and it will have a damaging impact if it does. Next year alone, the health insurance tax will total $12.3 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Over the next decade it will result in nearly $145 billion in higher taxes.

The tax is calculated based on insurance premiums, meaning any costs are passed directly to small businesses that provide healthcare to their employees, and middle class families through higher premiums. The tax even impacts the care received by seniors through Medicare advantage coverage and low-income Americans that rely on Medicaid managed care.

According to the American Action Forum, the tax is responsible for premiums increasing by as much as $5,000 over a decade and half of the tax will be paid by those earning less than $50,000 a year.

The health insurance tax directly impacts as many as 1.7 million small businesses, 11 million households that purchase through the individual insurance market, and 23 million households covered through their jobs. The National Federation of Independent Business estimates the tax could cost up to 286,000 in new jobs and cost small businesses $33 billion in lost sales by 2023.

As it stands, taxpayers have already been hit enough by ObamaCare’s many other taxes. When it was signed into law seven years ago, ObamaCare imposed a tax on employer provided care, a tax on innovative medicines and other treatments, a tax for failing to buy government-mandated insurance, a tax on medical devices, taxes on health savings accounts and flexible spending accounts, and even a tax hike on Americans facing high medical bills.

The trillion dollars in higher taxes have restricted health care choice, increased costs, made saving more difficult, and granted government more control over care at the expense of individual control. The passage of these taxes also broke President Obama’s promise not to increase any form of tax on any middle class family.

In contrast, President Trump and the Republican majority in Congress promised an agenda of lower taxes, more jobs, higher wages, and lower healthcare costs through reduced premiums.

They can ensure that they are able to fully keep that promise by delaying the health insurance tax immediately. And killing the rest of the taxes later this spring.

Perhaps not.

The defeat of the repeal of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was not just a decision to leave Obamacare in place. It ripped the lungs out of an effort to reform the federal tax code that was scheduled to move immediately after the ACA was repealed.

Why and how did one stone kill two birds?

The “repeal and replace Obamacare” legislation and tax reform are each designed inside reconciliation budgets. This allows each to pass with a simple majority vote in the House and Senate. That is standard operating policy in the House, but in the Senate, it represents a unique opportunity to avoid a filibuster and enact legislation with 51 votes (not 60). A reconciliation budget comes with certain limitations. It can deal only with taxes and spending, and not policy changes. For instance, you cannot pass tort reform as part of reconciliation: There’s too much policy involved, and too little impact on budget numbers. You can — and Congress did — include the repeal of a trillion dollars of tax hikes that were part of Obamacare, and Congress can and did include $1.2 trillion in spending reduction. Both numbers over a decade.

So repealing Obamacare, which would have lowered the tax burden by $1 trillion over a decade, would have been a key step toward tax reform. Failing to repeal the Obamacare taxes puts tax reform “backward” one trillion dollars.

And the goal of tax reform for the White House and Congress is to turbocharge the economy in anticipation of the 2018 and 2020 elections. The Reagan tax cuts took full effect January 1983, and four million jobs were created that year. Indeed, had the Obama recovery been as robust as Reagan’s, more than 12 million additional Americans would have jobs today. Tax reform is designed to repeat the Reagan success.

Tax reform as outlined by the Ways and Means Committee in the House and the Trump Administration includes the following:

Reductions in taxes for corporate income and small businesses

Reductions in the cost of capital investment

Lower personal income taxes, and fewer income brackets too

Abolition of the alternative minimum tax

The end of “death taxes,” aka inheritance taxes and estate taxes

But we are further away from this paradise of lower taxes and simpler, more pro-growth tax code than we anticipated. A trillion dollars further away, in fact. So we have four options:

1. Go back to square one

Get House Republicans to rethink their earlier circular-firing-squad strategy and pass something that looks very much like the legislation they balked at last Thursday and Friday. Then proceed as planned. This looked unlikely early last week, more likely now.

2. Acceptance and dilution

Accept that you have one trillion less to play with and pass a watered-down tax-reform package with a smaller reduction in the corporate income tax rate. Go to 28 percent, not 20 percent. That would allow all other changes to move forward.

3. A big tax cut that will evaporate

Go for the entire planned tax cut and reform but recognize that by hiking the deficit by $1 trillion in years 11 through 20, the entire tax package (like George W. Bush’s tax cut in 2001) will evaporate after 10 years. Ten glorious years of low rates, and then “poof,” Cinderella. Pumpkin. Mice, not coachmen.

406,Norquist,Grover,nationalinterest,"Substantive tax reform will pass in 2017.

Its outlines are clear and the details are congealing.

Keep in mind that the tax-reform package will be passed through the reconciliation process, which requires that changes not increase the deficit in years eleven to fifty. Anything goes in the first ten years, but if the total package is not deficit neutral by year eleven, the legislation expires. This allows the House and Senate to pass fundamental tax reform with only Republican votes. No Democrats’ votes are required—and none is expected.

How did we get here?

Donald Trump released his tax-reform proposal during the primary campaign a year ago; his most eye-catching goal was to drive the corporate income tax rate to 15 percent. Obama had flirted with 28 percent. House Republicans were proposing 25 percent. The House Republican Blueprint quickly moved their target to 20 percent.

Trump had not initially included full and immediate business expensing (to replace long depreciation schedules) in his plan. Every other Republican presidential candidate and the House Republicans led with expensing, which dramatically reduces the cost of capital. Trump adopted full expensing.

Trump’s plan reduced individual tax-rate reductions, and his plan merged with the House Republican individual reform, to move the present seven tax rates to three rates: 12, 25 and 33 percent.

Capital-gains taxes will be set at 50 percent of the individual rates, for a top rate of 16.5 percent. Corporate capital gains will be reduced from today’s 35 percent to 20 percent.

The emerging Trump/House plan abolishes the death tax and the Alternative Minimum Tax.

The death tax was first imposed to finance the Civil War, and the AMT was imposed to solve a “fairness problem” that was supposed to hit 115 millionaires, and now hits millions of Americans.

The United States will move from its present “worldwide” tax system—where Uncle Sam insists on the ability to tax American companies and individuals, regardless of where they work or are located. This puts American firms and American companies at a severe disadvantage. French firms and French citizens earning income in the United States pay U.S. taxes but not French taxes. Americans working abroad pay both French and American taxes (U.S. law allows limited deductibility of taxes paid abroad).

The bill would allow the estimated $2.5 trillion of American earnings overseas to be returned, after paying an 8 percent tax on cash and 3 percent on fixed assets. After that, all earnings overseas could be returned tax free, forever into the future. American companies are happy to pay a one-time smaller hit and win permanent territoriality.

It is the higher business tax and the worldwide tax system that makes an American company that operates worldwide worth more if it is bought by a Canadian or Belgian company. Corporate inversions are driven, not by wicked foreigners, but by destructive American tax law. The Trump/House plan ends that incentive to invert or move headquarters overseas.

To “pay for” some of these tax reductions, business will lose the deductibility of net interest payments and many smaller deductions. The most controversial changes is making the corporate income tax “border adjustable,” so that when Boeing exports a plane worth $100 million it deducts $100 million from its reported income, and reduces its tax liability by $20 million in taxes ($100 million × 20 percent). An importer bringing in a $100 product must add the $100 to its taxable base and pay $20, or $100 × 20 percent. This does raise the cost of imports and reduces the after-tax cost of exports. Manufacturers in the United States like this a lot—importers less so. The border-adjustable feature raises $1 trillion over a decade.

Without the border-adjustable feature in the corporate income tax, the tax writers would have to find another $1 trillion in higher taxes somewhere else in the code, reducing spending by $1 trillion in the next decade. The Senate rules insist that the budget changes be deficit neutral (not tax revenue neutral) over years eleven through fifty.

If the tax and budget changes in tax reform do not keep the expected deficits from increasing from today’s expectations, then the tax package expires at the end of ten years. This is what happened to the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003. Both Trump and the House very much want the legislation to be permanent.

This is why the fight over repealing Obamacare was, and is, important. The American Health Care Act (AHCA) would have repealed $1 trillion of Obamacare taxes and $1.2 trillion in Obamacare spending over the next decade. It also would have expanded Health Savings Accounts and block-granted Medicaid to the states.

In addition to being good health-care policy—moving decisions to consumers, and having competition, not price controls, keep down prices—it would have lowered the spending and tax projections of the future by $1 trillion a decade. This would have freed up a great deal of running room for tax reform.

If Congress does not double back and revisit its failure to repeal Obamacare last week, it makes fundamental tax reform significantly more difficult. The tax reform would have to be smaller to fit inside the budget rules (a law, not a preference), since reconciliation bills or tax reforms would be temporary and turn into Cinderella’s pumpkin in ten years.

The tax-reform package, like the Obamacare repeal, has been put together by House, Senate and White House leadership over the last year. Even governors have been brought into the sausage-making process—and this explains why both official Washington and the stock market have begun to see this reform as something as inevitable as anything can be in Washington.

In the past few years, party loyalty and a sense of shame has kept those appropriators from betraying Reagan Republican principles and party discipline.

But the Freedom Caucus has taught those Republican appropriators who still lust after the good old days of earmarks that there are no longer any serious constraints on their — to date — sublimated lust for other people's tax dollars.

Oh yeah, the ""conservatives"" will be the first to whine when the video ""Republican Appropriators Gone Wild"" goes viral. They will call them RINOs and point out that we cannot have spending discipline if the GOP cannot command 218 members to fight and work together against spending.

But the appropriators will just laugh at them and mock them explaining correctly that they learned this bad behavior from the Freedom Caucus.

When one gang is let loose in a city to serve its own interests at the expense of everyone else, a second and third gang are sure to follow. (Al Capone, Bugs Moran ...)

408,Norquist,Grover,washingtonexaminer,"The decision by the ""Freedom Caucus"" to join House Democrats to defeat Trump and the House Republicans' first agenda item, the American Health Care Act, was a big deal. But it was much more than it seemed: The AHCA's defeat makes it unlikely that Congress can now pass any significant permanent tax reform.

Two birds. One stone.

Why? What does the health care reform bill have to do with tax reform?

Everything.

Obamacare itself was roughly a $1 trillion tax hike over a decade. It was a $1.2 trillion dollar spending increase over a decade. Unchanged, that tax and spending spree continues (and grows) without end. The AHCA bill that failed would have repealed the Obamacare taxes. It would have been the largest tax cut and the largest spending cut in American history: A trillion dollars, every decade, forever.

Because the spending reduction was larger than the tax cut, both would have been permanent victories for smaller government. The bill would have passed the deficit-neutral (or deficit-reducing) requirement of the Byrd Rule, and unlike the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 the tax cuts would not have lapsed within ten years. They would have been permanent victories. The tax cut was made possible, compliant with the Byrd Rule, by the spending reduction in the bill.

The tax reform that Trump and Ryan and the House GOP caucus planned to move after the AHCA passed — reducing the corporate rate from 35 percent to 20 percent, allowing immediate full business expensing, ending the Death Tax and the AMT, and expanding the personal exemption to $12,000 for an individual and $24,000 for a family of four — assumed that federal taxes would have been reduced by that $1 trillion already.

Then the required tax cuts could have fit inside the reconciliation package, been deficit-neutral into the future, and could be made permanent.

But now Republicans are $1 trillion short.

That tax plan, a combination of Trump's campaign goals and the House blueprint, can no longer be made permanent.

Here are the three options.

1. Return to the scene of the crime. If the ""Freedom Caucus"" can find 218 votes for a plan they approve and can pass the Senate, then the taxes and spending in Obamacare can be repealed and we return to the original plans for radical and permanent tax reduction and reform. The last week was a hiccup. A bad dream.

2. If the ""Freedom Caucus"" choses to leave Obamacare untouched, then the House Republicans could pass permanent tax reform but would have to reduce the planned tax cuts by about $1 trillion. The top business rate would only be reduced to 28 percent instead of 20 percent. Or the border adjustable part of the corporate income tax (created to raise $1 trillion over a decade to offset other tax reduction) could be doubled in size to raise $2 trillion over a decade. Or the higher taxes could be sprinkled throughout the original tax reform effort, irritating everyone.

3. Republicans could abandon the idea of having the tax cuts be made permanent. Tax cuts could be deeper and one need not ""restore"" the $1 trillion lost in the Obamacare SNAFU if Trump and the GOP are willing to have the entire package last just 10 years. Just like the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 which, like Cinderella's coach, turned into a pumpkin at the end of 2012. Temporary tax cuts lasting 10 years or less can be passed with 51 Senate votes inside the reconciliation budget process.

The downside of temporary is that businesses cannot plan well around a tax plan that they know goes away in 10 years.

Those are the three options on how to walk away from the train wreck of last week.

409,Norquist,Grover,realclearpolitics,"Remember the date of March 13, 2017. It was the day President Trump was guaranteed his re-election and Republican congressional gains in 2018 and 2020. It's not complicated. Follow along. The Congressional Budget Office released its study of Trump and Paul Ryan's plan to repeal Obamacare and begin to reform our healthcare system. It had many numbers. Only two mattered: taxes and spending. CBO announced that the repeal bill reduces taxes by almost $900 billion and reduces federal spending by $1.2 trillion over the next decade. This reduces deficit spending by $300 billion over the next 10 years. Thus the CBO, as official umpire, announced that the GOP Obamacare repeal plan may be enacted through reconciliation, the process that requires a simple majority in the House and only 51 votes in the Senate. No filibuster allowed. Perhaps equally important, the $300 billion in deficit reduction gives Republicans a great deal of wiggle room to amend their basic plan to win votes in the House and Senate to win those 218 congressmen and 51 senators. Tax cuts can be added into the mix. Thanks to the CBO score and the underlying power of the legislation, Obamacare repeal will now pass.

412,Norquist,Grover,foxnews,"The modern Democratic Party is hoping you care more about Trump’s tax returns than your own.

Ever since the dust settled on the November 8, 2016 election and America saw a Republican President, House and Senate, 33 GOP governors, 25 states with both a GOP governor and legislature and 67 of 99 state legislative bodies run by Republicans, the Democrats have been looking for the magic wand or secret incantation that could make this all go away.

“Trump’s tax returns.” Maybe if they say it three times while walking backwards around a cemetery drinking goat blood the world will be restored on its axis.

Tuesday night Rachel Maddow invited America to what she promised would be that exorcism. She had, she claimed, two pages of Donald Trump’s tax returns from 2005. Yes, two pages. Yes, 12 years ago.

And…

Donald Trump reportedly earned $153 million and paid $36.5 million in taxes in the year 2005. After months of breathlessly suggesting that Trump did not actually pay any taxes at all it turns out that the percentage of his income that he paid was just about what someone in his tax bracket would be expected to pay—and two and a half times more than the average taxpayer.

One notes that polling has consistently showed that the vast majority of Americans believe no American now matter how rich should pay more than 25 percent of their income in total taxes. The 25 percent tax paid by Trump was his federal tax alone. Doesn’t count property taxes, sales taxes, state and local taxes.

Newsflash: Trump paid his taxes and more. Rachel Maddow’s exploration of Al Capone’s vault exploded in her face and the world moves forward.

This brings us to the real story of 2016: Trump ran promising to reduce the tax burden on Americans and American businesses that create jobs.

The outline of his program is public. First, ObamaCare’s trillion dollars in new or higher taxes will be repealed. Obama lied his way into office claiming he would never raise any form of tax on any middle income American. The Trump/GOP repeal bill will abolish these taxes, providing much needed relief to tens of millions of middle income families.

Next, Trump will move to comprehensive, pro-growth tax reform. Individual rates will move from seven different rates to three rates: 33%, 25% and 12%. The Death Tax will be repealed. Business taxes will fall from 35 percent to 20 percent or lower -- closer to the worldwide average -- making America more competitive. And job-creating investment will be immediately expensed -- which reduces the cost of new investment and will turbo charge growth.

Taxes are too high on all Americans. Trump and the Republican congress are committed to lowering taxes and driving economic growth.

Repeating “Trump’s tax returns” did not turn back the clock or stop the movement towards tax reform and abolishing ObamaCare’s tax hikes on the American people.

413,Norquist,Grover,ozy,"The fourth in a series of op-eds by the president of the conservative group Americans for Tax Reform.

He avoided comment on Arnold Schwarzenegger’s poor ratings in The Celebrity Apprentice. There were no pointed attacks on members of the Fourth Estate and no update on just how many Americans attended his inauguration. And friends and foes alike responded by calling the speech “presidential.”

President Donald J. Trump’s hour-plus address to Congress last week delivered a clear agenda for his goals for 2017 and his key priorities. First, aka now, “repeal and replace” the Affordable Care Act. Immediately thereafter, pass tax reform. Third, and later, other stuff. On this and only on this “other stuff,” the president repeatedly reached out to Democrats for their cooperation and even their ideas.

This focus and the advanced timetable suggest that the White House is gaining its sea legs in understanding how Washington works. The top two priorities, Obamacare repeal and tax reform, are pushed to the fore because life is uncertain: Foreign policy and scandals distract, and no one is guaranteed to be in the driver’s seat in Washington beyond the first year of a presidency. Bush 43 lost his Republican Senate majority after just six months; Obama lost his House majority and Senate supermajority after two years.

Both repealing Obamacare and tax reform must be done within the “budget reconciliation” framework, a set of budget rules that allow legislation to pass with 51 votes in the Senate (no possibility of a filibuster) and a simple majority in the House. Not a single Democratic vote is required. Lose the House or Senate in 2018, and the door slams shut on this option and on both Trump priorities — after all, there will be no Democratic votes for radical changes to Obamacare or the federal tax code. As a result, delay on those issues will mean death.

To pass a permanent tax reduction through the budget reconciliation process, the budget changes — spending and taxes — must be budget deficit neutral after year 11. Temporary tax cuts, like Bush’s in 2001 and 2003, and temporary spending hikes can pass with 51 votes. But it takes 60 votes (passing through filibuster) to permanently cut taxes or to permanently increase entitlement spending. That is why Obama needed 60 votes to enact Obamacare — it increased the deficit in years 11 and beyond.

Republicans plan to repeal the tax cuts and most spending in Obamacare first — in order to reduce the revenue baseline in the future. Ending Obamacare is a trillion-dollar tax cut over a decade. Repealing most of the spending is a trillion-dollar spending cut. Revenue neutral. Permanent.

Trump’s speech, and subsequent administration statements, have made it clear the White House and House of Representatives are in sync. They will, one, repeal the 20 tax cuts in Obamacare and repeal most of the spending. Two, they will radically increase the size and scope of health savings accounts. On Medicaid block grants to the states, high-risk pools will be established to subsidize health insurance for those with pre-existing conditions. (Republican governors have been hosting conference calls on this for some time. The level of federal/state cooperation in reforming this entitlement is unprecedented.) And, four, they will create tax credits to extend coverage to Americans without employment-based insurance, Medicaid or Medicare. The goal is to have few if any Americans fall through the cracks.

One cannot change legislative policy inside a budget reconciliation bill, just tax and spending numbers. But Obamacare was written with more than 1,000 different places where the secretary of health and human services “may” or “shall” decide what the law requires. That means many opportunities for waivers, freeing states from federal requirements.

After Obamacare is repealed and health care policy is redirected as far as allowed within reconciliation rules, the tax cut can move forward in its own reconciliation package. It too must be deficit neutral in years 11 and beyond. That is why it’s important to reduce the revenue expectation prior to passing the tax bill. In addition, the House and Senate have agreed that tax cuts can be scored “dynamically,” and that allows revenue flowing from expected economic growth to “pay for” additional tax cuts.

The tax reform outlined by Republicans in the House over the past four years and amended by Trump’s demand to further reduce the corporate rate fits inside the requirement that allow the tax cut/reform to be made permanent. The tax bill will cut the corporate rate from 35 percent to 20 percent, the rate on business income inside Subchapter S corporation to 25 percent, end the “death tax” and the alternative minimum tax and reduce individual rates to 33 percent, 25 percent and 12 percent, while moving to a territorial tax system that allows American firms to repatriate future earnings at a zero percent tax rate.

And what about the “border adjustable” part of the corporate income tax reform that is opposed by many lobbyists in Washington? The timetable Trump laid out and his staff’s comments have made it clear the tax bill is no longer available for significant alterations. Now Trump and the House will move the largely written tax plan through Congress.

The Trump agenda and priorities have been clearly laid out. The popular and business support for both, and the power of the presidency and pull of party loyalty, make it likely that the initiatives will be law before fall 2017.

During the 2016 Republican primaries, then-candidate Trump unveiled an outline for a huge tax cut. It was a grab bag of popular measures: Kill the Death Tax, repeal the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) and cut individual tax rates. All these have been Republican talking points for the last 20 years. The centerpiece of Trump’s plan? To push the boundaries of a growing consensus that America’s 35 percent corporate income tax rate is too high. (The European average is about 25 percent.) The tax plan being constructed by the Republican-led House of Representatives at the time aimed to bring it down to 25 percent.

Trump saw and raised the stakes for opponents by laying a new marker, of just 15 percent — which would make the United States a tax haven for companies worldwide and a magnet for investment and talent. While many refused to take Trump’s tax plans seriously, the notion of a 15 percent rate was seen as an intriguing and potentially powerful driver for economic growth. Businessmen who had not yet begun to take Trump seriously wished a “real” candidate would move into that zone.

House Speaker Paul Ryan and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady were listening: They dropped their plan’s proposed corporate rate from 25 down to 20 percent. Trump reciprocated, making two significant changes to his proposal that brought it more in line with the House Republican plan and made it more pro-growth: He accepted the House Republican proposed tax rates for individuals of 33, 25 and 12 percent, depending upon income, with capital gains taxed at half those rates.

Trump also adopted as his own the proposal in all the other Republican presidential hopefuls’ plans to accept full and immediate expensing for all business investment. Today, business investment is assigned a presumed “useful life” and depreciates over that period, but a bureaucrat’s guess as to the “useful life” of new software, computers or even buildings is just that: a bureaucrat’s guess. Given inflation and the varying value of money, allowing immediate expensing dramatically reduces the cost of capital investment. So Trump’s plan took two steps toward the House Republicans, and they took a giant step toward Trump.

Brady promises to have a consensus plan unveiled within the first 100 days of Trump’s administration. It will almost certainly be in sync with White House thinking, and the Senate is not working on a competing or complementary proposal; most assume they will accept the Brady/Trump consensus. So what can we reasonably anticipate in a new tax plan? And what remains in contention?

Very Likely:

1. Abolition of the Death Tax. While the Bush/Obama years saw the number of Americans subjected to the Death Tax shrink — a couple can pass on up to $10 million without incurring a gift or inheritance tax, and the top rate fell to 40 percent — there remains strong support for killing this tax altogether to ensure it does not grow back to confiscatory rates.

2. Repeal of the Alternative Minimum Tax. This tax was created originally to solve the problem of some 155 Americans who invested only in tax-free municipal bonds and therefore paid no income tax. Over time it grew to hit several million Americans, particularly targeting those with expensive houses in states with high property and personal income taxes. The corporate AMT will also be abolished.

3. Tax cuts for individuals. The top individual income tax rate will fall from 39.6 percent to 33 percent. Lower rates will be consolidated into two rates: 25 and 12 percent. The 3.8 percent tax on capital gains enacted as part of Obamacare will end, and the 0.9 percent payroll tax hike on income over $250,000 — also part of the Affordable Care Act — ends.

4. Tax cuts for corporations. The corporate income tax will fall from 35 to 25 percent. And for those businesses that pay taxes through the individual income tax returns of owners, subchapter S corporations, the tax rate will fall from 39.6 to 25 percent. Both C corp and S corp tax rates will fall by about 42 percent. This was an equality demanded by the National Federation of Independent Business.

5. Business investment will be fully and immediately expensed.

6. The U.S. will move from a worldwide system of taxation to a territorial system, where American companies earning abroad may be repatriated without penalty. (There will be a one-time hit on corporate earnings now overseas of roughly 3 percent for fixed investment and 8 percent for cash. This will allow more than $2 trillion to return to the U.S. in a tsunami of domestic investment.

Up for Debate:

1. Removal of the border adjustable tax. This is the value of exports applied to a company’s taxable income, in effect “subsidizing” exports, and the value of foreign imports added to companies’ taxable incomes. Most nations do this through a VAT. Importers don’t like this tax, but it could raise $1 trillion over a decade. One could remove or limit this section by replacing it with a different tax increase elsewhere or a $1 trillion spending reduction over 10 years. Importers will become the leading advocates of entitlement reform or live with this tax.

2. Elimination of interest-payment deductions. This would cause challenges for regulated industries like power plants. Watch for exceptions.

3. Deferral of capital gains taxes for “like-kind” exchanges. That’s Section 1031, which may or may not continue. If your firm sells a small truck and buys a bigger one, the capital gains is deferred until you cash out of all trucks. This would be a powerful tool for growing firms to husband cash.

The Trump tax plan has been a communal effort, borrowing from other candidates and House Republicans who point out that they, in turn, have borrowed heavily from Senate ideas. All concerned are committed to a bill that will be simpler, more fair and improve our international competitive position permanently by boosting growth. The tax cut will be a Republican-only affair — just like Obamacare, Dodd-Frank and the “stimulus” were for Democrats.

This tax bill does not need and will probably not receive any votes from Democrats because the tax bill will be passed within “reconciliation,” allowing it to avoid filibuster. It needs only 50 Republican votes in the Senate, with the vice president casting the tie-breaking vote — and it should drop within the next three months.",2,http://www.ozy.com/pov/the-trump-tax-cut-how-much-how-soon-how-certain/75641

All the candidates focused on reducing the corporate income tax rate of 35 percent, famously the highest in the industrialized world. Trump was the most aggressive, proposing to bring the corporate income tax rate down to 15 percent.

In the past, House Republicans had settled on a 25 percent corporate rate. After Trump’s unveiling of his 15 percent rate, House Republicans moved their proposed corporate rate to 20 percent, moving towards the Trump target of 15 percent.

The Trump campaign then looked around and saw that the House blueprint, unveiled by Speaker Paul Ryan Paul Davis RyanOn The Money: Senate confirms Gensler to lead SEC | Senate GOP to face off over earmarks next week | Top Republican on House tax panel to retire Trump faces test of power with early endorsements Lobbying world MORE (R-Wisc.), and every single one of their Republican primary competitors expenses investment. The Trump campaign added full expensing for business investment to its plan.

Expensing allows businesses to deduct the value of new business investment the year it is made, rather than over a prolonged depreciation scheduled that can take place over many years, depending on the type of investment. It dramatically reduces the cost of capital investment.

The Trump campaign also accepted the House Republicans’ plans for an across-the-board tax cut on individuals that folds the seven individual tax brackets down to three, with a top rate of 33 percent and a standard deduction of $12,000 for individuals and $24,000 for families.

That process of the Trump and House Republican blueprint plans circling each other and merging continues. These are the settled matters, which are as settled as any negotiation that has not fully heard from the Senate allows.

The death tax, created to pay for the Civil War (on both sides) lived 10 years after Appomattox but was put to sleep in 1875 and revivified to pay for World War One which ended in 1918, will finally be put to death.

The alternative minimum tax, imposed in 1969 by Richard Nixon to be certain that 155 millionaires did not escape taxation by investing in tax-free municipal bonds, “trickled down” to hit several million Americans. It will be repealed fully.

The corporate income tax rate will drop from 35 percent to 20 percent and the tax rate paid by subchapter S corporations, also known as pass-throughs, businesses that pay taxes through the individual tax returns of the owners will drop from a high of 39.6 percent to 25 percent. This deal brought peace to the large and small business divide.

The seven individual income tax brackets—39.6 percent, 35 percent, 33 percent, 28 percent, 25 percent, 15 percent and 10 percent—are folded into three rates of 33 percent, 25 percent and 12 percent.

The United States will join most of the rest of the world and tax income on a territorial basis, meaning we will tax what happens here in the United States, not overseas.

American firms earning a dollar overseas will, in the future, be able to “repatriate” those earnings, bringing them back to the United States without penalty or tax. Present law allows American firms to “defer” American corporate taxes until money earned overseas is returned. As a result more than $2 trillion dollars is “locked” overseas.

The House blueprint would hit earnings overseas with a one-time tax or “deemed repatriation” of, say, 8 percent (3 percent for earnings invested in something other than cash). After that, the United States would have a fully territorial system and earnings could flow back to America unharassed. This change will unlock about $2 trillion to flow back the united states sometime before the 2018 election. One can imagine the stimulus of actual capital being deployed by business owners—not lawmakers.

Lastly, the “border adjustable” corporate income tax would exempt the value of exported goods from taxation and tax the value of imported goods entering the United States, similar to how European nations treat imports and exports. This change will raise $1 trillion over a decade because of the U.S. trade deficit. It will hike the costs of imports and consumer prices but also strengthen the purchasing power of the U.S. dollar.

Its attractiveness to tax reformers is that it is a significant “pay for” and it allows America to shift to a fully territorial system that taxes based on point of consumption and drastically simplifies the U.S. international tax system. This is viewed by House Republicans the capstone that holds the rest of the structure in place. It will be the focus of the most debate and remains the largest “open question” in tax reform.

The House will present its package, in sync with the Trump White House, within the first 100 days of the administration. It will have Senate approval by July before the August recess. Pessimists believe the final bill may pass in September of October.

It will be passed by reconciliation. No Democrat votes are expected or needed from either body. This will pass with 51 votes in the Senate, and it is structured in a way that will make it permanent, unlike the George W. Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003.

What will it be called? Whatever its paternity. It will be the “Trump Tax Cut” just like the Kemp-Roth tax plan—a decade in gestation in Congress—became the Reagan tax cut.

418,Norquist,Grover,ozy,"First in a series of six essays on just what a Trump presidency will mean for America, by the founder and president of Americans for Tax Reform.

Among the central promises of then candidate Donald Trump’s campaign were, first, to reform and reduce federal taxation on individuals and businesses and, second, to repeal and replace Obamacare.

A “yuge” tax cut bringing corporate tax rates to 15 percent or 20 percent will be a major piece of his administration’s tax reform. But often overlooked is that merely repealing Obamacare will yield massive tax cuts of more than $1 trillion over the next decade. How so? Obamacare was paid for by 20 new taxes and tax increases borne heavily by middle-income Americans. Among them were:

1. A tax that punished anyone who refused to buy a government-designed insurance. It hit single Americans with a minimum tax of $695. A family of two adults and two children who didn’t buy the insurance, meanwhile, paid a tax of at least $2,085. The penalties were expected to cost citizens $43.3 billion between 2016 and 2025. For that money, they got nothing. It is designed to force citizens to buy into Obamacare.

Mind you, the Obama administration first claimed that this penalty was a mandate, not a tax — only to argue otherwise before the Supreme Court. Indeed, Chief Justice John Roberts ruled that it was indeed a tax to allow Obamacare to pass constitutional muster. Trump has already signed an executive order urging the Department of Health and Human Services to stop imposing this tax.

2. Limits on health savings accounts and flexible spending accounts. By ending your ability to purchase over-the-counter medicines using pretax dollars in HSAs and FSAs, Obamacare raised another $6.7 billion in taxes. It also imposed a $2,500 cap on the FSAs of 30 million to 35 million Americans. This tax increase costs $32 billion over 10 years.

3. Taxing private health insurance. Obamacare imposed a tax on your private health insurance, designed to net $130 billion between 2016 and 2025. Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former member of the Council of Economic Advisers and former director of the Congressional Budget Office, estimated insurance premiums would increase by up to $5,000 over the decade.

4. Limits on deductions. Obamacare made it more difficult to deduct catastrophic medical costs for 11 million Americans. This income-tax hike costs $35.7 billion over a decade by increasing the threshold beyond which you can deduct extreme medical costs from the previous 7.5 percent to today’s 10 percent. The average household income of people hit with this tax? $53,000. This income-tax hike on the very sick and lower middle class will not be missed.

5. The “Cadillac Tax.” It imposed a 40 percent tax on plans costing more than $10,200 for individuals or $27,000 for families. This tax was delayed until 2020 due to pressure from union leaders whose members tend to have such plans. Republicans plan at a minimum to cut it in half by imposing a cap on the deductibility of corporate sponsored health insurance (and the new corporate rate will be 20 percent).

6. Penalties on withdrawals from HSAs. Obamacare doubled the penalty on such withdrawals, from 10 percent to 20 percent. The increase would raise $100 million over 10 years.

7. Taxing indoor tanning. By levying a 10 percent tax on indoor tanning costs, Obamacare would cost consumers $800 million over 10 years. The left laughs about this tax, but it has wiped out thousands of tanning salons and affects 30 million American consumers. And more than half of tanning salon owners are women entrepreneurs. They are keenly aware of this Obamacare tax burden.

Expect Trump to highlight that the above taxes directly hit middle-income Americans, in violation of Barack Obama’s famous commitment repeated on Sept. 12, 2008, in Dover, New Hampshire: “I can make a firm pledge. Under my plan, no family making less than $250,000 a year will see any form of tax increase. Not your income tax. Not your payroll tax, not your capital gains taxes, not any of your taxes.”

Other tax hikes inside Obamacare are nominally on businesses or higher-income Americans. Slated for abolition are an employment mandate tax, which forces employers to pay $2,000 per full-time employee if they do not offer “qualifying” — as defined by the government — health coverage and at least one employee qualifies for a health care credit. This is a $166 billion tax hike over 10 years. There’s also the surtax on investment income of 3.8 percent for households earning more than $200,000 (singles) or $250,000 (couples). This tax drove the capital gains tax from 20 percent to 23.8 percent and would cost $222.8 billion over 10 years. A payroll tax hike on individuals making $200,000 or couples earning more than $250,000 was scheduled to cost Americans another $123 billion over 10 years. The 2.3 percent tax on medical devices hits firms whether they earn a profit or not. The cost, of course, goes straight to consumers, costing $20 billion over 10 years.

And what of the spending in Obamacare? All that money went somewhere.

Congress is expected to block-grant Medicare — just as Bill Clinton did with Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC). This will give states much greater flexibility and, as with the AFDC reform, save both federal and state taxpayers a great deal of money while covering those truly in need.

High-risk pools will be subsidized by the national government so that those with expensive preexisting conditions can buy subsidized insurance and not have their costs paid by healthy purchasers of insurance. And tax credits will target those on the margin to allow them to buy health insurance.

These reforms to replace Obamacare are being debated right now in the House, Senate and White House. The death sentence for the tax increases has already been passed.",2,http://www.ozy.com/pov/grover-norquist-why-repeal-and-replace-is-a-good-deal-for-taxpayers/75306
419,Norquist,Grover,politico,"As he settles into the White House, President Donald Trump is still something of an ideological blank slate. During the campaign, he declared policy positions seemingly on the fly, at rallies or in tweets, and his stances on some issues—trade, foreign intervention, infrastructure—flout Republican convention. Trump, who had never served in public office until Friday, built his campaign on overturning political norms, and for some policy wonks (not to mention lawmakers and lobbyists), his flexibility presents a rare opportunity to shape the president’s thinking almost from scratch. He has been said to make decisions based on the advice of the last person he’s spoken with, or the most recent report he’s seen on TV. So we at Politico Magazine decided to jump into the fray, inviting a range of thinkers and writers to come up with out-of-the-box ideas for the new president—positions he might at least consider adopting, even if they haven’t so much as crossed his mind yet. From the serious (how Trump could play Vladimir Putin to his advantage) to far less so (a new hairdo—really), here are their offerings.

1. Go to Church

By Virginia Heffernan

Most presidents make a credible show of faith and openly discuss how belief guides their choices, but Donald Trump has to be the least god-fearing president in the history of America. The church he has claimed to attend—Marble Collegiate Church in Manhattan—says he’s not an active member. In his younger years, Trump did go there, but what struck him was the showmanship of minister Norman Vincent Peale’s sermons. Trump mispronounced the name of a book of the New Testament, sassed the pope, consulted a televangelist “spiritual adviser” whose ministry was once investigated by Congress, and has devoted his life to the misdeeds—greed, lust, pride, wrath—that are unwelcome in any moral order.

But this hushed midwinter calls for a measure of solemnity. And there is nothing like a moment of humility, gratitude and surrender to a higher power to kick off a new career. What better time for Trump to draw close to his Presbyterian faith, the great faith of Andrew Jackson and Ronald Reagan?

Trump may never become a true believer, but he could find church legitimately useful. Sooner or later—at some stately affair or during another snoozer disquisition by Steve Bannon on “Judeo-Christian belief”—the new president will have to speak of God. Or nod at the mention of something goddish. Trump’s pious second in command, Mike Pence, used to called himself an “evangelical Catholic,” and that seems to mean something about stem cells or straights-only lunch counters, but how can Trump know for sure? Time to study up.

Going to church would also be a form of thanks to the devout Christians who helped get him elected. In spite of Trump’s spectacular amorality, more than 80 percent of white evangelicals voted for him. From his new pulpit, Trump will find the notoriously religious American people looking to him for comfort, inspiration and moral guidance. For this, he might try a trick known to his predecessors: Crib from the Bible. It is sacred, yes, but it’s also politically stylish. That old, tired “politically correct” idiom that so riles Trump postdates the gospels. By quoting a little Ecclesiastes or “Two Corinthians” now and then, Trump can sock it to the faithless coastal elites.

Not to get too Age of Aquarius, but Trump might also find some peace of mind in the mystery of a faith. Of course, each one of us can benefit from any tradition that tempers the natural human tendencies to rapacious greed, ludicrous self-aggrandizement and banal carnality. If Trump by any ghost of a chance recognizes himself in these sins, religion can help. And as a source of counsel, Trump could find a confidant and consigliere among the clergy—someone to talk to, neither a schemer nor a sycophant; someone forgiving, even; ideally someone famous. They could appear together on social media, just like he did with Kanye—no commandment prohibits Instagram fun!

Trump has a ready-made option for any Sundays he actually stays in Washington: the New York Avenue Presbyterian Church, not far from the White House (and the Trump International Hotel). Abraham Lincoln attended that very church with his family, hitching his horse to a post that can still be seen outside the building. And like Trump, the 16th president had his name on landmarks: Lincoln’s family’s pew is marked with a barely noticeable nameplate that bears his signature. On the north wall, at balcony level, is the curiously cubist stained-glass window that shows grand Lincoln in midnight-blue silhouette—like Trump in his dazzling entrance at the Republican National Convention. On that window is a fragment of Lincoln’s second inaugural address, in which he enjoined the people to help bind up the wounds of a nation scarred by the Civil War. If Trump ever gets bored with prayer, or the sermon or hymns, he might like to take a look at the passage on the window. “With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right.”

At 109 characters, that would make an elegant and surprising tweet.

2. Create a Cabinet of Governors

By Lanhee J. Chen

Donald Trump finds himself in a predicament as he assumes the presidency. On the one hand, he is a political outsider, a man who has never held public office and appears to be wholly unconcerned with what Washington thinks. At the same time, he surely recognizes that the complexity of running the most powerful country on Earth requires the guidance of people who genuinely understand governance.

One way Trump could tap a ready-made group of experienced advisers, while still bucking the Washington elite, is to create a Council of Governors. Think of it as a secondary Cabinet but set up to advise the president from a perspective totally outside the Washington bubble. Plus, each member is already a chief executive—a credential Trump clearly cares about.

A version of this advisory body, with the same name, actually exists; it’s a bipartisan group of 10 governors that was established, ironically enough, under President Barack Obama in 2010. Today, the council is limited to advising the president and a few other top officials about matters relating to the National Guard and Homeland Security, but Trump could vastly expand the council’s role, turning it into a sounding board for himself and senior policymakers. On an array of issues, from abortion to the minimum wage, Trump has expressed an interest in pushing power away from the “swamp” of Washington. For this, the council would be indispensable. Advisers in the executive branch tend not to be focused on the nitty-gritty of how federal policy affects the states. That takes deep understanding of state-level politics, law and even culture—an arena where governors are uniquely suited to help.

For example, Trump’s call to repeal the Affordable Care Act—one of his most immediate challenges—could leave the states to take the lead on solutions to address health costs and coverage. In fact, there is an existing provision of Obamacare, Section 1332, that envisions precisely this kind of state-led innovation, and that is likely to remain intact even if other parts of the law are repealed. With a Council of Governors, Trump could get a better sense of how states might use the provision to pursue their own health reform plans. While a number of states that have moved ahead with the process would seek progressive alternatives to the ACA (Hawaii was the first state to receive permission to pursue its own health reform scheme), I and other conservatives have argued that right-leaning states could use it to pursue market-oriented health reforms before a replacement for the ACA is signed into law.

Education and energy policies also stand to benefit from state-level input. Trump has expressed skepticism about the U.S. Department of Education and supported the idea of giving states greater flexibility in how they use federal dollars. Conservatives have traditionally preferred states to have more authority over the regulation of energy exploration within their borders, and Trump has already turned to a former governor, Rick Perry of Texas, to be his energy secretary.

Devolving power to the states has long been a conservative governing principle. Still, the governors council, which ought to remain bipartisan, would not be an ideological tool. After all, it was the progressive Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis who called states the “laboratories of democracy,” and true federalism means allowing policy experimentation regardless of political leaning—so that the best ideas rise to the top. That’s something a pragmatist like Trump should be willing to support.

3. Sell Off Federal Lands

By Grover Norquist

Donald Trump has a lot on his mind, but one massive asset he’s probably not thinking about is federal lands. Trump, who likes a good real estate deal, should sell them off.

I do mean massive. The federal government owns about 640 million acres, or 28 percent of all U.S. land. The West is disproportionately affected: In some states, a majority of land is owned by the feds, including a whopping 85 percent of Nevada. (National parks make up only 12.4 percent of federal lands, so let’s leave those off the table.)

All that territory is worth a lot of money. The Obama administration valued federal onshore lands at $463 billion as of 2011—a lowball figure, and already outdated as new discoveries increase the value of oil, gas and mineral rights. There is also the “land” Washington owns beneath the ocean, an internationally recognized economic zone 200 miles from our shores. According to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, 90 billion barrels of oil and 327 trillion cubic feet of gas have yet to be discovered on the Outer Continental Shelf. Imagine the financial rewards—in the trillions of dollars—from direct leasing payments, job growth and tax revenue on increased economic activity.

Common sense would argue for privatizing these territories. Privately owned land has historically been better conserved and more productive. Selling off federal territories would not just create more access to resources, but also would allow suburbs and rural areas to develop, opening them up to young Americans looking for lower-cost housing with panoramic views. That means jobs for homebuilding, too. There is also room for philanthropists to create a real Noah’s ark, using property rights law to protect species from poachers.

Justice, however, would argue for giving at least some federal lands back to the states, for free. In the 1800s, as the country expanded west, the federal government sold its land to settlers and granted it to states when they joined the union. But it slowed that process at the six states that run north-south from North Dakota to Texas. It’s only fair to the states west of that line that Washington give back some of its imperial power.

How to handle it? Trump could hold an annual auction, or even launch another gold rush, allowing young men and women to stake their claims. Perhaps he could offer naming rights to sweeten the pot for Congress. And once the plan is underway, just think what we could do with the money it would free up. Pay down the national debt. Widen our highway system. Perhaps even buy the good bits of Canada.

4. Reboot the Rust Belt

By Antoine van Agtmael

As a candidate, Donald Trump tapped into the anger and anxiety of those left behind by the manufacturing decline. He won states like Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania in part by promising to bring back jobs from China and Mexico, while reviving coal and steel.

But Trump can’t expect to resuscitate industries that are no longer competitive. And even if he can roll back Chinese imports, the real threat to manufacturing jobs isn’t foreign competition but automation. If Trump actually wants to make good on his promise to revive the Rust Belt, he should focus on reinventing manufacturing. Cheap goods like shoes and shirts can be made in the USA—by robots and 3D printers—while more Americans are employed to make products with advanced features like sensors and access to big data. Technical skills will be in demand. Smarter, not cheaper, will be the mantra.

How can Trump do this? In one sense, the trend is in his favor: American manufacturing lost more than 6 million jobs between 1990 and 2010, but since then, roughly 1 million manufacturing jobs have been added back, the overwhelming majority in higher-tech industries. The Rust Belt has the potential to keep moving in this direction: It still holds reserves of technical and engineering expertise that just need to be redirected to advanced manufacturing.

This would mean convincing Congress to invest more in research and development. Since Trump has already proved willing to browbeat private companies, he could similarly lean on businesses and community colleges to negotiate a new social contract, together offering on-the-job training to help workers make their living doing something new. Infrastructure improvements could also be a vital boost, all the more so if they account for the innovations manufacturers are already building, like self-driving cars. And even as Rust Belt metropolitan areas such as Detroit and Pittsburgh rebound, Trump can’t forget about outlying suburban areas, which risk becoming collateral damage.

All this would take some salesmanship. But Trump actually could bring hope to the Rust Belt voters he loves for having elected him.

5. Play Russia Against China

By Edward N. Luttwak

Donald Trump’s suspicion of China and willingness to cooperate with Russia are well known, if controversial. But with these instincts, Trump could actually forge a coherent, and effective, grand strategy. In the 1970s, the United States embraced China to offset the Soviet power upsurge. Now, Trump should do the opposite: Focus U.S. strength against an increasingly militaristic China, and enlist Russia in that effort.

It is Geopolitics 101 not to confront both countries at the same time, and Russia is clearly less of a threat to the United States. Economically and politically, it is in decline, while China is on the rise. Both countries have displayed expansionist tendencies of late, but ever since swallowing Crimea in 2014, Russia has shown little appetite for annexing more of Ukraine or the Baltic states. China, by contrast, is trying to claim, and actively militarizing, the 1.4 million square miles of the South China Sea in clear violation of international law. That directly threatens Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam, as well as sea lanes vital to Singapore, Taiwan and Japan, the most important U.S. ally in the region. True, the economic and military interests that are at risk for the United States as China rises are not quite as crucial as our interests in Europe. But Europe has greater military strength of its own to protect its interests and ours.

Because there are only reefs, shoals and tiny islands in the South China Sea, some foreign policy observers believed that the Chinese could build only minor outposts and short airstrips on those lands. But in his first intelligence briefing, Trump no doubt discovered that the Chinese militarization is altogether more threatening: In the past eight years, the Chinese have built four full-size airbases, one of which is a Pearl Harbor-size mega-base on Subi Reef (yes, it was a coral reef). The Obama administration tolerated this expansionism, issuing only feeble appeals for restraint.

So what should Trump do? Offensive U.S. military action is out of the question, and no defensive action should be needed either. Even the notoriously isolated leaders in Beijing know that any forcible action by their armed forces would instantaneously cause the United States to close its ports to Chinese exports. Instead, the new president, in all likelihood, will turn to freedom-of-navigation patrols and intrusive overflights in the international space over the South China Sea. If these shows of U.S. strength interfere with Chinese-American trade, all the better. As Trump noted throughout the campaign, there is a huge U.S.-China merchandise trade imbalance—about $367 billion in 2015.

Then there is Vladimir Putin. Simply hectoring and calling him a “thug” is useless. It is in America’s best interest to negotiate with him and get something in return. Trump should recognize the foregone conclusion of Russia’s annexation of Crimea and end loose talk of Ukraine’s entry into NATO. Then, he should get Putin to stop his Cold War against the West, including his relentless anti-American propaganda and the delivery of high-end weapons to Iran and Syria. When Trump presses China, all Putin has to do is to stay out of the way—no new weapons sales to Beijing—and the deal will be worthwhile.

Putin could cheat, of course. But he knows that Trump is not as nice, or passive, as Barack Obama. After all, in the recent campaign, Trump outmaneuvered everyone else easily. If all this still seems too simple, so was Ronald Reagan’s utterly startling refusal of “coexistence” and “détente” with the Soviet Union in 1981. As Reagan showed then, the United States does simple much better than complex.

6. Shave It Off

By Susanna Wolff

If there’s one thing about Donald Trump that has stayed consistent for decades, it’s his famous hairdo: deep part on the left side, combed forward then back, and sprayed into place—a blowout that has aged into a reddish-white-blond bouffant. As much mockery as it’s brought him, he clearly loves it. “I’ve combed it the same way for years,” he told Rolling Stone a few years ago. “Same thing, every time.”

But here’s a thought: If Trump really wants to prove that he has what it takes to change the status quo—“drain the swamp” and shake the Washington elite to its fragile little core—there’s one simple place he can start: his head.

And not just with a trim. There are plenty of reasons Trump should just buzz it all off. For one thing, science says it will lend him authority. A 2012 study by Albert Mannes, then a lecturer at the University of Pennsylvania, showed (for reasons perhaps having do with Mannes’ own baldness) that people tend to rate bald men as appearing more powerful, influential and authoritative. We know Trump is profoundly image-conscious. Why shouldn’t he take advantage of all the sociological tokens of power he can muster?

Looking to history, only a handful of American presidents have been bald, and only Dwight Eisenhower really owned it. So Trump wants to show he’s not part of the elite, he’s a true political outsider? Nothing will prove his ingenuity and business acumen like having sold the American people on hair, then pulling that rug out from under them.

There’s also the geopolitical argument. How can Trump prove he’s more than just Vladimir Putin’s lackey on the global stage? One-up his wispy-haired rival by doing what even he doesn’t have the stones to do: buzz it all off. Trump doesn’t need to build up our nuclear capabilities to show he’s not afraid to take action. He can let his hair do the talking. Maybe a shave would even make him unrecognizable, and he could restart international relationships with a clean slate. A little bit of that presidential makeover Kellyanne Conway keeps promising.

If you think this sounds wildly unrealistic, consider that Trump has actually already said he’s willing to change his hair. In the days after he first announced his campaign in 2015, Trump told an audience in Winterset, Iowa, that if he were to win the presidency, he would go with a simpler style. “Why? Because this thing is too hard to comb,” he said. “I wouldn’t have time, because if I were in the White House, I’d be working my ass off.” Well, the hour has come.

Plus, let’s be real. What’s a president to do if his conflicts of interest come back to bite him or those Apprentice outtakes finally come out? Trump needs something up his sleeve to distract Americans and dominate the news cycle. Once again: hair. Use it. Own it. Shave it. You’ll be glad you did, Mr. Trump. And everyone else on Earth will be, too.

420,Norquist,Grover,ozy,"First in a series of six essays on just what a Trump presidency will mean for America, by the founder and president of Americans for Tax Reform.



Is Donald Trump a Republican?

Only a few years ago, he identified as a Democrat. He contributed to Democratic candidates. He donated heavily to the Clinton Foundation. Bill and Hillary Clinton attended his daughter’s wedding.

When first asked during the GOP primaries, he was the only one of the 17 candidates who refused to commit to supporting the party nominee. Later in the campaign, Trump encouraged a challenger to House Speaker Paul Ryan and suggested previous Republican presidential candidates were losers (Mitt Romney) or not war heroes (former POW John McCain).

But Trump won the Republican nomination in Cleveland on July 19, 2016, and the presidency in November. So he is the titular leader of the GOP.

The question then becomes: Was his a hostile takeover of the party? In the business world, new management not only tends to toss out old management but also changes the entire theory of the acquired company. The once-failing firm will now succeed and make us all very rich by doing things … very differently. Perhaps this is like George McGovern taking over the party of LBJ, or Reagan radicalizing the party of Nixon and Ford.

Of course, it’s too ambitious to predict the next four or eight years on the eve of Trump’s inauguration as the 45th president of the United States. But we do have some early signs of how Trump and the GOP will cohabit — and they suggest, above all, that Trump intends to govern as a Reagan Republican.

Policy

Trump can sometimes hide behind the ambiguity in 140-character fiats, but he has been quite clear in several areas.

Tax cuts. He wants huge permanent tax cuts for individuals, small businesses and corporations.

Energy. Trump likes energy of the nonrenewable sort. He likes poking holes in the ground and pulling up coal and oil and gas. He ran against Obama’s “War on Coal.”

Abortion. Trump ran as the most clear-spoken pro-life candidate, ever. His description of partial-birth abortion in the final presidential debate signaled to pro-life voters that he was not paying lip service to an issue that over the years has divided not only the nation, but the Republican party.

Guns. Trump concealed-carries. His kids hunt. He was endorsed early and enthusiastically by the NRA, which invested heavily in turning out gun owners in the states key to his Electoral College win. No Republican candidate has been as forceful and clear in his defense of the Second Amendment as Trump. That includes Reagan.

This policy list is a checklist for a Reagan Republican. And if Trump is sticking with the GOP on the hard issues, why would one assume he would demand a third way on the easy ones?

To be sure, Trump did highlight three significant departures from recent GOP orthodoxy: free trade, immigration and the Iraq War and occupation. Interestingly, all the other Republican presidential candidates said they agreed with Trump that invading, staying and occupying Iraq was a mistake that hurt America. Even Jeb Bush. Here, Trump changed the Republican party.

We have yet to see how the Republican House and Senate will work with Trump on new trade deals, revisiting NAFTA and his first challenge: a free-trade agreement with Britain in the wake of Brexit. Similarly, immigration issues — the wall, H1B visas, guest worker programs and threats of deportation — will also test Republican unity and Trump’s leadership.

Personnel

in a project as large as the United States government, personnel determines a great deal of policy. Those chosen to lead the FDA or FCC or the Pentagon get a great deal of running room. It is embarrassing to have to fire someone after you spend time, effort and political capital getting them through a Senate confirmation. Appointees know that.

While many will have Trump’s ear, his first big personnel decision was his vice president, Gov. Mike Pence — so solid a Reagan Republican that he might have come from central casting. His second big pick was his chief of staff, Reince Priebus — the chairman of the Republican Party and a down-the-line Reagan/Ryan/Kemp party-builder loyalist. Not your pick as a wartime consigliere if you planned a break with the GOP, let alone a siege or blitzkrieg against it.

Trump provided voters a list of his potential Supreme Court appointees during the campaign. The list could have been written by the conservative/libertarian Federalist Society. (Some think it was.) This nomination will be a unifying movement for Trump Republican Senators and the entire center-right coalition from the business community, the NRA and traditional conservatives.

The Trump White House and Cabinet are being deeply peopled by solid Reagan Republicans. While there will be moments and issues that divide Trump and the GOP Congress, this is true of all administrations. The White House and Congress are different entities that are elected in different years. They represent different collections of voters and bring different life experiences to each issue.

Two final thoughts

There is no Trump wing of the modern GOP. There was a Rockefeller wing of the GOP. A Goldwater wing. Few if any congressmen or senators believe they were elected because Trump was the nominee. Senate Republican candidates outperformed Trump in 23 of 32 races. Trump ran better than Republican Senate candidates only in four states: Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky and Missouri.

There is zero chance he’ll make nice with Democrats. Early on, during the contentious Republican primary, some suggested that Trump might govern with the Democratic Party against the Republicans, at least on some (unspecified) issues. Sen. Chuck Schumer reduced that possibility to zero when he announced that no Democrat would support any of Trump’s Supreme Court nominees.

Then came the dozens of Congressional Democrats announcing they’d boycott Trump’s inauguration, The New York Times’ editorial page, Meryl Streep’s Golden Globes speech, the cast of Hamilton’s address to Pence, Alex Baldwin on Saturday Night Live, CNN, the women’s march … the list goes on. All of those insults and indignities have erected a protective wall around Trump and the GOP, holding them — for now — in a strong embrace.",2,http://www.ozy.com/politics-and-power/will-donald-trump-be-the-next-ronald-reagan/75234
421,Norquist,Grover,foxnews,"President-elect Donald Trump campaigned on cutting taxes for Americans of all income levels. This year he has the opportunity to do so multiple times.

Most notably, Trump in the White House means that comprehensive, pro-growth tax reform is now a priority in the first hundred days of the new administration.

But this is not the first tax cut Congress will send to Trump’s desk. By passing legislation repealing ObamaCare through budget reconciliation, lawmakers have an opportunity to remove nearly 20 taxes which will save taxpayers more than one trillion dollars over the next decade.

Repealing these taxes is a huge win for middle class taxpayers, who were hit with an avalanche of tax increases despite Barack Obama’s “firm pledge” not to sign “any form of tax increase” on any American making less than $250,000.

The trillion dollars in higher taxes have restricted health care choice, increased costs, made saving more difficult, and granted government more control over care at the expense of individual control. Below are just some of the tax wins that will come from repealing ObamaCare:

1. Individual and Employer Mandate Taxes

ObamaCare enforces many of its provisions through stiff tax penalties both on individuals and on businesses.

Any individual that fails to purchase “qualifying” health insurance – as defined by President Obama’s Department of Health and Human Services – must pay an income surtax totaling more than $2,000 for a family of four. Close to 7.5 million households paid this tax – which the Obama administration refers to with the Orwellian name “shared responsibility payment.” Most make less than $250,000.

Similarly, the law forces employers to pay a $2,000 penalty per full time employee if that fail to offer qualifying insurance. This mandate increases taxes on businesses by $166.9 billion over a decade.

2. Taxes on Health Insurance, Prescription Medicine and Medical Devices

At the same time ObamaCare mandates insurance coverage, it directly drives up the cost of that insurance through a massive tax totaling $130 billion over the next decade. This tax is borne by small businesses, individuals and families through higher premiums.

The ObamaCare health insurance tax will increase premiums by up to $5,000 per family over a decade, according to the American Action Forum. The tax will directly impact 1.7 million small businesses, 11 million households that purchase through the individual insurance market and 23 million households covered through their jobs.

The tax could cost up to 286,000 new jobs, and $33 billion in lost sales by 2023, according to research by the National Federation for Independent Businesses.

This is just one of the many ObamaCare taxes that drives up health care costs. The law imposes billions of dollars more in taxes on prescription medicine and medical devices, and imposes a 40 percent excise tax on employer-provided insurance that will hit more than 40 percent of plans within a decade.

People -- not businesses – bear the burden of these taxes, so this is billions of dollars in higher taxes that are passed on to consumers who rely on life-saving and life-bettering products.

3. High Medical Bills Income Tax

In addition to increasing the costs of health care through higher prices and stifling mandates, ObamaCare directly increases taxes on Americans with high medical bills.

Prior to passage of ObamaCare, Americans facing high out of pocket medical expenses were allowed an income tax deduction to the extent that those expenses exceeded 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income (AGI). The law increased this threshold to 10 percent of AGI, making it more difficult for families to claim this deduction and widening the net of taxable income.

Around 10 million families used this deduction before ObamaCare, with the average taxpayer earning just $53,000 in 2010. Based on this information, the average family is paying $200 to $400 in higher income taxes each year.

4. Taxes on Savings Accounts

ObamaCare imposed several taxes that hit the tens of millions of Americans who use Health Savings Accounts and Flexible Spending Accounts. Specifically, the law forbid families from using HSA and FSA dollars for over the counter medications. Families had been making such household medicine cabinet purchases for years – cold and flu medicine and hundreds of other medical products. ObamaCare also hikes taxes on FSAs by imposing a cap ($2,500) on the amount of income families can contribute to FSAs and increases the tax penalty on early withdrawals from HSAs.

These tax-preferred savings accounts are used in conjunction with insurance plans, which tend to cover large and/or unexpected health events and allow individuals to make choices that best fit their needs. Expanding and protecting these savings accounts is one component to ensuring Americans have access to patient centered health care that best fits their needs and keeps costs low. Repealing these taxes will take power away from the federal government and increase the choices available to consumers.

Since it was passed into law in 2010, ObamaCare has resulted in greater costs, less choice, and higher taxes. By voting to repeal ObamaCare, lawmakers are taking step one toward lower taxes for American families and businesses across the board.",2,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/01/06/grover-norquist-why-repeal-obamacare-means-giant-tax-cut-for-middle-class.html
422,Norquist,Grover,realclearpolitics,"The starkest difference between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election campaign was their stated positions on taxes. Hillary Clinton formally endorsed six major tax hikes, totaling more than $1.3 trillion over the next decade: hikes on individual rates, increases in the corporate income tax, a higher capital gains tax, a transaction tax on all stock trades, a higher death tax and — borrowing from the tax policies of the Weimar Republic — an exit tax on businesses attempting to leave America.

423,Norquist,Grover,lifezette,"The starkest difference between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election campaign was their stated positions on taxes.

Hillary Clinton formally endorsed six major tax hikes, totaling more than $1.3 trillion over the next decade: hikes on individual rates, increases in the corporate income tax, a higher capital gains tax, a transaction tax on all stock trades, a higher death tax and — borrowing from the tax policies of the Weimar Republic — an “exit tax” on businesses attempting to leave America.

This tax cut will be as powerfully pro-growth as the Kemp-Roth tax cut Reagan enacted in 1981.

Despite her promise to never raise any tax on anyone earning less than $250,000, she endorsed a payroll tax hike on all wage earners, a steep tax on soda pop, and even a 25 percent national retail sales tax on gun purchases.

Donald Trump said he would never raise taxes. And he outlined a series of tax cuts. Now that he is the president-elect, what can we expect on the tax front?

The first Trump tax cut will be the repeal of most or even all of the nearly 20 tax increases that funded Obamacare, which will total about $1 trillion over the next decade. These are taxes on your health insurance, hospitals (both charitable and for-profit), medical devices, drugs, capital gains, your Health Savings Accounts and Flexible Savings accounts, out-of-pocket medical bills, and even a steep “indoor tanning tax.” These tax cuts will come inside the first reconciliation package.

The second Trump tax cut will be a comprehensive tax reform package that has multiple parts.

First, the plan lowers the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent or 15 percent. The current European average corporate tax rate is less than 25 percent, and falling. Taxes on businesses that now pay their taxes though the individual income tax code such as partnerships and Subchapter S corporations will pay 25 percent, down from 43.5 percent.

Second, Trump moves from long depreciation schedules for business investment to immediate, full business expensing. This greatly reduces the cost of new investment. (Historically Democrats have not opposed expensing in the way they absolutely hate individual rate reductions.)

Third, America will join the rest of the world in adopting a “territorial” tax system where the U.S. taxes activity in America and allows foreign nations to tax activity in their own nations.

By moving to a low corporate rate (20 or 15 percent) and a territorial tax system, the advantage to moving overseas is eliminated. No more inversions for tax reasons. It will also make business taxes “border adjustable,” which means the corporate income tax will removed from the cost of exported goods and services and added to imports.

Fifth, the death tax is repealed.

Sixth, the Alternative Minimum Tax is repealed. The AMT was passed in 1969 to punish 155 Americans who paid little or no federal income tax. Now the AMT threatens millions.

And seventh, the number of individual rates will be reduced from today’s seven to three with the top rate at 33 percent, not the present 43.5 percent.

This tax cut will be as powerfully pro-growth as the Kemp-Roth tax cut Reagan enacted in 1981. Reagan’s tax cuts led to 4 percent annual growth throughout his administration, while Obama’s growth was 2 percent. Had America grown at Reagan rates over the past eight years rather than Obama rates, we would have more than 10 million more Americans working in the U.S. And growing at 4 percent rather than 2 percent for a decade increases revenue to the government — through growth — by $5 trillion.

What else? I hope that Congress will keep Section 1031, which allows companies that trade up, buying newer and more expensive cars or larger buildings, to delay paying the capital gains tax until they cash out.

Congress should also look at reducing the corporate capital gains tax from 35 percent to the same rate as individuals — or even better, to zero. (All gains inside a company are eventually taxed when the firm stock is sold.)

There are two tax cuts that should follow the 2017 tax cuts.

[lz_related_box id=”264100″]

First, the Treasury Department should index the basis of all capital gains to inflation. It can do this by executive order. It does not require a vote of Congress. This would reduce the damage the capital gains tax does by 40 percent or more. We will no longer pay capital gains taxes on inflation.

Because the House of Representatives has been working on tax reform for several years and because the Trump campaign plan parallels the House version, in the next 100 days the House will pass a bill that will be the Trump tax cut.

The Senate will have to vote on the legislation with few changes. But Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah has a great idea to eliminate the double taxation of income built into the present corporate and individual income tax structures. Integrating those taxes would eliminate the double taxation of dividends. This long-overdue reform, plus others that Hatch and other senators have proposed, could be in the next tax cut in 2018 or 2019. Remember, the Bush/Cheney administration had a Bush tax cut in 2001 and then a Cheney-driven tax cut in 2003 that dropped the capital gains and dividend tax rates.

2017 will see the first two Trump tax cuts — but not the last.

424,Norquist,Grover,thehill,"Illinois lawmakers recently passed the Future Energy Jobs Bill (SB 2814), which would create the biggest rate hike in U.S. history. Proponents of the legislation claim it will “create jobs” and reduce energy rates. This is not true. This anti-free market legislation will kill tens of thousands of Illinois jobs, increase rates in the state by more than $13 billion and prop up politically connected corporations at the expense of Illinois residents.

ADVERTISEMENT

The Future Energy Jobs Bill is massive corporate welfare. It was a product of backroom negotiations between lawmakers, far left activists and corporations seeking consumer-funded handouts. The crux of the legislation is a bailout of two nuclear plants in the state owned by Exelon, which would be funded by an increase in the cap on rates consumers can be charged, which will costs Illinois residents a total of $2.4 billion.

Yet the nuclear bailout is only the tip of the iceberg of this grab bag of liberal policies.

In order to get the legislation even considered, the bill’s proponents had to kowtow to left-wing activists in the state and green energy interests with a slew of sweetheart deals included in the legislation. For instance, the legislation secures an expansion of the state’s Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) at a cost of almost $2 billion. It also continues the state's costly “net-metering” program.

When considering the multibillion dollar nuclear bailout, the RPS and net-metering continuation and billions in energy efficiency handouts, this legislation amounts to nothing more than a wish list of liberal policies and corporate welfare.

In fact, the far-left Environmental Defense Fund praised the bill as “the most significant climate bill and clean energy” legislation in Illinois history. It’s a large achievement by any liberal democratic standards.

Sadly for residents of the Prairie State, this legislative “achievement” means increased energy costs, lost jobs, and reduced economic output and competitiveness. Projections show that, if enacted, the legislation would amount to the largest energy rate hike in U.S. history of $13.3 billion.

The city of Chicago alone would see more than $127 million in higher energy costs, on top of more than $60 million and $59 million in higher costs for Chicago Public Schools and the Chicago Transit Authority, respectively. Overall, the seven-county metro area would see more than $10 billion in increased costs.

The state’s economy would likely be the hardest hit. The legislation would cause a projected loss of over 44,000 jobs and a reduction in Illinois’ economic activity of $14.7 billion. State and local governments would also see an estimated tax revenue loss of $429 million.

Given the drastic impact of this legislation on Illinois residents, businesses, and the state’s economy as a whole, one can only ask is this cost truly worth bailing out two insignificant nuclear plants in the state, while also doling out billions of dollars to special interests? The answer is obviously no.

Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner (R) has the ability to save his constituents from this needless and burdensome legislation, simply by refusing to sign the Future Energy Jobs Bill and ensuring Illinois residents and businesses are not subjected to the highest rate hike in history, thousands of jobs lost and billions of dollars in reduced economic growth.

By Grover G. Norquist and Patrick Gleason

Oct 28 (Reuters) - More governors and state legislators across the United States are recognizing the need to prohibit cities and towns from passing ordinances and heavy-handed regulations that harm the economy.

The catalysts for states' involvement in many cases are local rules that create barriers to employment and constrict the expansion of innovative companies like Uber, Lyft and Airbnb.

This is a positive development.

When Texas cities and towns were considering bans on hydraulic fracturing, for example, legislators in Austin responded by passing a statewide law preventing localities from shutting down natural gas extraction.

You might expect a bill halting efforts to shut down fracking would find a receptive audience in a major energy state with a Republican-controlled legislature. Yet some conservative lawmakers and pundits expressed hesitation because of their support for ""local control.""

""I agree  that banning fracking is a bad idea,"" said Mark Davis, a popular conservative radio host in Dallas, ""but I also believe in local control. Shouldn't local towns be able to do what they want?""

Responding to Davis, Tom Giovanetti, president of the Institute for Policy Innovation in Dallas, explained why lawmakers should not cite local control as some high-minded principle to follow blindly.

""Local governments are at least as capable as the feds of passing laws and ordinances that violate the presumption of liberty in the Constitution,"" Giovanetti said. ""Tyranny isn't OK just because it is approved by a majority of your fellow townsfolk. Rule of law, not local control, must be the governing principle.""

Looking ahead to 2017, Tennessee lawmakers have talked about taking up legislation that preempts Nashville's arbitrary cap on host permits for Airbnb, as well as other home-sharing services. Such preemption would block the enactment of a statewide patchwork of local home-sharing regulations. State legislators held a mid-September hearing to discuss the matter.

""We have somewhat of a hodgepodge across the state,"" state Senator Jack Johnson (R-Franklin) told Nashville Public Radio in reference to local home-sharing laws in Tennessee. ""Some cities ban the use of Airbnbs altogether. Others allow it in certain areas.""

Nashville's ordinance - which was recently struck down in a legal challenge brought by the Beacon Center of Tennessee - imposed a 3 percent cap on non-owner-occupied short-term rental permits in a given neighborhood.

State preemption of local home-sharing restrictions, like that under consideration in Tennessee, can promote tourism by providing more lodging options, while allowing individuals and families to bring in additional income.

Wisconsin, like Texas, recently took action to overturn local laws undermining free enterprise. At the end of last year, Republican Governor Scott Walker signed legislation that prohibits cities and towns from imposing new occupational-licensing requirements.

Many policymakers and analysts across the political spectrum increasingly recognize that the growth of occupational-licensing requirements has created a slew of high barriers to employment by making it more difficult to enter the workforce and earn a living.

In the 1950s, fewer than 5 percent of American workers were covered by licensing laws. That figure jumped to 29 percent by 2006. Though occupational-licensing requirements are generally presented as benefiting public health and safety, the spike in licensing regulations over the past 60 years has also been pushed by businesses seeking to prevent competitors from entering their markets.

When competition is stifled by licensing requirements, the losers end up being the general public, particularly middle-income and low-income households, which face higher prices and fewer choices. One 2011 University of Minnesota study found that occupational-licensing requirements cost consumers more than $200 billion a year, and may have blocked the creation of 2.85 billion jobs.

Last year, the Obama White House issued a report, which echoed many arguments made by conservatives, highlighting the problems presented by the growth of occupational-licensing requirements.

A high-profile case calling for a state to preempt local laws is likely to again emerge in the Lone Star State. The Austin City Council this year imposed fingerprinting requirements for ride-sharing drivers, which forced Uber and Lyft to end operations in the city. That heavy-handed ordinance has created travel woes, eliminated a source of income for many and tarnished Austin's reputation as an innovative tech hub.

Austin is a progressive city in a Republican-run state, and many Austinites take pride in living in ""the blueberry in the tomato soup."" Yet it is up to conservative state legislators to save these left-leaning residents from their busybody city council. When Texas lawmakers start their new session in January, they are expected to take up legislation that would overturn Austin's ride-sharing regulations and also preempt other cities and towns from enacting similar laws.

Last month, Hillsborough County, Florida, site of Tampa Bay, enacted Austin-style fingerprinting requirements for drivers contracting with Uber, Lyft and other ride-sharing services. When they return for session in January, Florida lawmakers should follow the lead of their Texas counterparts by introducing preemption legislation overturning that new local regulation.

428,Norquist,Grover,dailycaller,"American taxpayers support the nearly $140 million million a year expenditures of the Congressional Research Service, an independent and highly influential think tank housed within the Library of Congress. The agency’s mission is to advise members and committees of Congress by providing objective, nonpartisan analysis. This typically includes explaining the workings of government agencies, the intricacies of complex policy issues in a range of disciplines and evaluating expensive, but often ineffective, government programs.

This research can be an invaluable resource for lawmakers and their staff, helping guide and inform key decisions in the policymaking process. At the same time, while taxpayers foot the bill, they are left out of the discussion, with no way to access this research short of calling their congressional office to ask for copies of each report.

This makes no sense. Most other government agencies can and do release their research. There is no reason the more than 1,200 new “general-distribution products” generated each year by CRS cannot also be made public.

That’s why we’re launching EveryCRSReport.com, a project to make all nonconfidential CRS reports available in one place for free (after all, you’ve already paid for it). The project is led by the Congressional Data Coalition, a cross-partisan partnership to promote open legislative information, whose members include Americans for Tax Reform, Demand Progress, the Sunlight Foundation and the R Street Institute. The site will grant the public access to more than 8,000 reports and report updates in one searchable database (it does not include confidential memoranda or private correspondence).

We don’t want to be in the business of hosting government reports. In the digital age, the government itself could and should be doing it. Legislation has been introduced in both chambers of Congress by a bipartisan group of members – led by Reps. Leonard Lance, R-N.J., and Mike Quigley, D-Ill., and Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. – that calls for CRS to publish these reports officially through the website govinfo.gov. However, the bill still needs greater public support and awareness to overcome stubborn and spurious opposition from high-ranking members, such as Reps. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., and Tom Graves, R-Ga., who prefer to go about business as usual without inviting public scrutiny.

CRS was founded in 1914 as the Legislative Reference Service and originally adopted a policy of not making its reports publicly available due to concerns about the excessive cost to print and distribute them. This was justifiable at the time, since it was not the agency’s primary mission to serve the general public and, logistically, it would have led to unnecessary costs. In the digital age, this issue no longer exists. The Congressional Budget Office, which produces research on economic and budget issues and produces estimates of legislation, freely releases its work to the public online. So, too, does the Government Accountability Office, which investigates and audits government agencies and practices.

That’s not to say that CRS research is completely unavailable to the public. Congressional offices are free to distribute reports to curious constituents or other individuals on request. Thousands of reports can be found by a cursory Google search. Lobbyists and other D.C. insiders also can access the reports through expensive subscription services.

There’s no classified information in any of the reports on EveryCRSReport.com whose release could cause any harm. There should also be no concern that publishing would violate the privacy of report authors; the contact information of CRS analysts is redacted from the reports on our site. Regardless, other government agencies freely list authors’ contact information with their research, so this concern holds little merit.

The American public deserves to know what Congress knows. This ought not be a polarizing or partisan claim. It’s simply a matter of bringing government into the 21st century. There is broad support for making CRS research public. Groups on the left and the right, journalists, scholars, students, members of Congress and even former CRS employees all have supported public access to these reports. It’s time for Congress to be accountable to taxpayers and make this research public.

429,Norquist,Grover,ozy,"The usually restrained Fareed Zakaria recently wrote an entire column insisting the GOP was certain to become history.

I have read that column before.

In 1964 after the Goldwater defeat; in 1974 after Watergate; in 1986, after Iran-Contra and the Democratic recapture of the Senate; in 1992, with the defeat of George H.W. Bush; and in 2008, after Obama, the same refrain was repeated with undisguised glee. The cheerleaders for the party of big government have long hoped for the day when the opposition party would collapse and be replaced by the political equivalent of the Washington Generals — the basketball team whose lifework was to lose cheerfully to the Harlem Globetrotters.

Despite the best efforts of labor unions, trial lawyers and beneficiaries of government spending, the Republicans have not disintegrated, as predicted; and despite what sometimes appear to be the best efforts of Donald J. Trump, the Republicans will not disintegrate in or after 2016.

Indeed, those predicting that the Republicans will go the way of the Whigs start with six cardinal false beliefs — or false hopes.

Myth No. 1: The GOP is fragile, and one hard blow will shatter it.

False. Look at a map, and you’ll see that the Republicans’ bench is stronger and deeper than the Democrats’.

Of the 50 states, 31 have Republican governors. There are 99 state legislative bodies in the United States; two-thirds of them are run by Republicans. In 31 states, Republicans control both houses of the state legislature. In 23 states, Republicans control both the governorship and both houses of the legislature. Democrats control the governorship and state legislature in all of seven states.

The upcoming election won’t change GOP state dominance, which provides a solid base for congressional and senate candidates for decades to come.

Myth No. 2: The troubles of presidential candidate Trump mean the GOP is broken.

False. Trump’s sex tapes do not reflect on other Republicans. Try as they might, Republicans couldn’t transfer the Monica Lewinsky issue from Bill Clinton to any single House or Senate candidate in 1998 or 2000. That scandal did not shatter the Democratic Party.

It’s understandable that political observers focus on the presidency, especially right now. After all, historians name eras according to who was president, and it’s far easier to remember who was president in a given year than which party ran Congress, state legislatures and governors. The Republican Party, in particular, was for more than 60 years driven by the belief that it could never expect to control Congress. So it put all its efforts into winning the White House — the better to protect national defense, and to veto tax-and-spend ideas from a “permanent” Democratic Congress.

From 1932 to 1994, that strategy made some sense. But since 1994, the Republicans have held Congress more often than the White House. And no matter who wins the White House, the leaders of the Republican Party — its orthodoxy and its soul — will be Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell. Real power in Washington has, in peacetime, resided, as the Constitution expected and directed, in Congress. A Republican Congress will no more take direction from Trump than it would Hillary. It learned how to govern against Clinton and Obama, and it sees that taking a backseat to George W. Bush was a mistake not to be repeated.

Myth No. 3: The present Republican Party is divided on key issues.

Not true since the era of the Rockefeller Republican, and one has to be pretty old to remember that. Back then, many Republican candidates and officials aimed to expand the welfare state and to raise taxes. No longer.

Today, Republicans are united in their opposition to tax increases. About 90 percent of Congressional Republicans have signed the Taxpayer Protection Pledge to oppose any and all tax hikes. They have kept that pledge and stared down Obama in 2011 and 2012, forcing federal spending down from 24 percent of GDP to 20 percent. Trump and Speaker Ryan have put forward dramatic tax reduction plans that are mirror images of each other’s. They call for territoriality, lower corporate rates, immediate business expensing, abolition of the Alternative Minimum Tax and the estate tax, and, of course, the reduction of all individual rates.

More unites Republicans than opposition to tax hikes. They oppose the regulatory state, trial-lawyer abuses and government overspending. They are united in their call to abolish Obamacare as step one to move to a consumer-based health care system, and to protect the sharing economy (Uber, Airbnb) from the unions and Democratic Party labor laws. They are united in their commitment to pension reform and education reform that includes fighting against teachers’ unions that stand in the way of charter schools and full parental choice. Support for the Second Amendment, a question only 20 years ago, is a settled issue in the GOP.

Myth No. 4: Republicans are divided over the key issues of immigration and trade.

The weak economy has made everyone grumpy. Populists of the right and left blame immigrants and trade deals — or international bankers and trade deals — for slow growth and high unemployment. The Reagan years saw a recovery that averaged 4 percent growth. Obama’s so-called “recovery” translated to 2 percent growth a year. Both recoveries involved trade and immigration.

Only growth can calm the waters in both parties. And trade is key to American agriculture — again, look at the map. That is red territory. And unlike in many previous eras, the business community — from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to Silicon Valley — is united in support of expanded free trade. A handful of Republicans in districts hard hit economically cannot vote for trade deals until their local economy revives. They are not enemies of trade; they are politicians.

Myth No. 5: There is a Trump wing of the Republican Party.

Really? Name a Trumpist governor. Or a Trumpist caucus in the House or Senate.

Myth No. 6: The Democrats do not have such divisions.

False. The Democrats are divided on trade, labor and other issues. The modern Democratic Party is funded partly by the hundreds of millions of labor union dollars that flow from more than $7 billion in annual dues, not from Soros’ might. That party cannot support education reform or pension reform. It cannot stand with Silicon Valley on trade or high-tech immigration. Or with the sharing economy, independent contractors and entrepreneurs. The unions say no. Such divisions are often disguised by divided a government at the national level, but they’re exposed in Chicago, Detroit and New York City.

Should Trump win in November, the Republican Party will pass its Reaganite agenda on taxes, spending, tort law, labor law and energy. Immigration and trade will become easier issues with growth. Should Hillary win in November, the House will stop Hillary’s tax-and-spending plans — just as it did Obama’s — and we will see Republican states continue their drive for lower taxes, education reform, pensions reform, criminal justice reform, tort reform and support for the sharing economy.

If Trump loses in November, it will be the result of self-inflicted wounds of a decidedly personal nature. He is not losing any votes because of those positions he shares with Reagan or Ryan or McConnell. It would be a lonely defeat. Prospects of a GOP implosion are wishful thinking by Democrats with short memories and a handful of disappointed Republicans convinced that without their personal leadership, the world will end.",2,http://www.ozy.com/2016/is-the-gop-about-to-disintegrate/72504
430,Norquist,Grover,huffingtonpost,"America has the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world. We do not possess ""one of the highest"" corporate rates. Our corporate rate is number one.

Our combined federal and state tax rate is more than 39 percent. China taxes businesses at a rate of 17 percent. The European average is 25 percent. The United Kingdom is 20 percent. Ireland is just 12.5 percent. It is often nice to be the biggest or largest, but not when the issue is ""who has the highest tax rate?""

America is also one of the few countries with a worldwide taxation system rather than a territorial system. If you are an American company, you pay taxes when you earn income overseas and then our government taxes you again. Together those two uniquely stupid and destructive policies are forcing American companies to move overseas through a corporate inversion or leaving them vulnerable to be purchased by foreign firms.

The solution should be obvious -- fix these two problems by passing pro-growth tax reform. In their recently released ""Better Way"" Tax Reform blueprint, House Republicans call for updating the tax code to 20 percent - 5 below the European average, and implement a territorial system that ends the double taxation of our businesses.

Every 0.1 percent of additional economic growth can lead to as much as $286 billion in extra federal revenue - all without raising taxes - so this plan smartly prioritizes economic growth and simplification.

In contrast, Obama has refused to act over the past eight years and has derided the American competitiveness problem as a ""race to the bottom."" Hillary Clinton is set to follow his lead and continue to ignore the problem.

Hillary has already proposed more than $1 trillion in new taxes and looks set to follow Obama's path in pushing for destructive policies. Clinton has also called for an exit tax on businesses that are forced to leave the country and has suggested further complex regulations to crack down on businesses.

Year after year, the Obama White House claimed they understood the high rates were making it impossible, or difficult, for American companies to compete. But instead of addressing the problem, Obama called for a new tax on income earned by American businesses overseas and new regulations to trap our businesses.

Now, in his final months of office Obama is using the inversion ""problem"" as an excuse to push excessive regulations that give unaccountable IRS officials power over business investment decisions. These new debt-equity regulations will do nothing to stop the underlying problem that is driving inversions.

Inversions are occurring because our tax code is outdated that business cannot compete with foreign competitors. In the past decade, close to 50 American businesses have left the country through an inversion while we have also lost $179 billion worth of assets through acquisitions by foreign competitors.

Other countries understand that they have an opportunity to steal our businesses and high-paying jobs and are aggressively introducing pro-growth tax systems. 31 of 34 countries in the developed world have reduced their rates this century. We have not. The United Kingdom plans to reduce their corporate tax rate to 18 percent by 2020. Dozens of our competitors have proposed or created ""innovation boxes"" that give a lower tax rate to businesses that create high paying, IP intensive jobs.

The problem is only going to get worse if we do nothing. Obama has refused to act to address America's competitiveness problem throughout his presidency, and Hillary has already shown she will be no different. New regulations will only compound the problem and result in more of our iconic businesses leaving or being acquired.",2,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/grover-norquist/inversions-will-continue-_b_12125200.html

But there is still enough time to go on record about how unfair and broken the current tax code is, and set the precondition for successful passage of systemic tax reform in the first term of the new president.

We are urging House GOP leadership to bring up and pass H.R. 27, the Tax Code Termination Act, before recess. It is a simple bill which terminates the current tax code at the end of 2019 and sets an earlier deadline that requires Congress to replace it with a new tax code.

Conservatives in Congress support tax reform, yet they have not had the chance to vote on it. Not even once.

They made some expiring tax incentive provisions permanent, the so-called ""tax extenders,"" through the PATH (Protecting Americans From Tax Hikes) Act. The Ways and Means Committee released a tax reform blueprint (which included H.R. 27, the ""Sunset the Tax Code"" bill), but the blueprint is just a proposal; it has not been turned into legislative language, had a mark-up or committee hearing.

It is time that House Republicans rectify this glaring omission, and there is still time to do it and rightly claim credit for at least starting the wheels of tax reform.

The bill we are supporting sunsets the tax code, which we believe will force both sides to focus on tax reform whether they want to or not.

The bill has been specifically endorsed by the Republican Study Committee, the largest bloc of Republican members in Congress. Companion legislation will be introduced in the U.S. Senate this week.

Holding a House vote on the bill, and passing it, will give every single member who supports it a tangible way for them to express their dissatisfaction with the current tax code. Opponents of the bill can try to explain why they want to keep the current tax code.

In the past, efforts to reform the bloated, inefficient, overly complicated tax code have failed because the supporters of tax reform in theory begin by dividing into camps pushing their favorite tax reform plan.

That is the beauty of the Sunset the Tax Code concept. It unites all the supporters of any particular tax plan to take the first step. And to the skeptics who say that replacing the current code in less than three years is too tall an order, we say that the less time Congress has to create a new tax code, the better! We need one that is simpler, fairer and flatter, and not a tax code that so ridiculously complicated.

The first step is to unify behind the urgent need to start over from a clean slate and enact tax reform by a certain date, one that is near enough to spur discussion and legislative work, but far enough away that it will not to roil the economic markets.

Supporters of various tax plans — a flat tax, a fair tax, the Rubio-Lee tax plan, even the Trump or Clinton tax plans — can all agree that the current tax code is failing the country. It is manifestly anti-growth.

With the help of McLaughlin and Associates, in June 2015 we conducted nationwide polling to test our theory about the tax code and about setting a deadline for reform.

Fully 75 percent of all respondents agreed the code was ""unfair to the average taxpayer because it favors special interests through special incentives, exemptions and loopholes."" This included 73 percent of self-identified Democrats, 73 percent of independents and 81 percent of Republicans.

Asked if something ""needs to be done to force Congress to get serious about tax reform before 2020,"" 85 percent agreed (just 4 percent disagreed).

Finally, 70 percent supported ""terminating the current tax code at the end of 2019 as a way of forcing the Congress to enact tax reform,"" including 73 percent of Republicans, 69 percent of Democrats and 68 percent of independent. Just 10 percent opposed.

The current tax code is broken. It must be thrown out and rewritten. It cannot be reformed by nibbling around the edges.

Congress rarely acts without a deadline, so Sunset the Tax Code provides the catalyst.

House Republicans have an opportunity to go on record, before the election, on their opinion of the current tax code.

For nonviolent offenders, treatment and rehab produce better outcomes than mandatory minimum sentences.

Picture this: a legislative reform initiative that has garnered more than 70 percent approval from both Democrats and Republicans in state after state. Imagine a package of reform bills that has brought together elected officials from the left and right and passed through House committee with near unanimous support. Now consider that the speaker of the House is the biggest champion of these bills.

What issue has brought together both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue and has civil-rights groups working with top prosecutors and law enforcement? Justice reform. And given all this success, you would say these policies have every chance of becoming law, right?

It’s not that simple, but it should be.

In the months since bipartisan-backed sentencing- and prison-reform legislation was introduced in the House of Representatives, Congress managed to name about ten post offices, revised coastal-barrier boundaries, ordered the Mint to create commemorative coins, and adopted bison as the national mammal of the United States.

In the states during that time, Minnesota introduced and passed the most significant reforms to its drug laws in 30 years. These bills reduced mandatory minimums for low-level drug crimes and devoted greater resources to treatment instead of incarceration. Iowa took similar steps. Maryland repealed mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenses.

Advertisement

Even states with high incarceration rates took action. Oklahoma and Louisiana eliminated employment barriers for those with criminal records. And Kentucky passed one of the most aggressive expungement bills in the country that seals criminal records for certain offenses.

It’s time for Congress to act on justice reform.

The states have proven that treatment and rehabilitation in lieu of incarceration can often provide better outcomes. Unnecessarily harsh sentences for nonviolent offenders do not make better citizens; they lead them to commit more offenses. We also know that the easier it is for someone who leaves incarceration to get a job, improve his education, and support his family, the better shot he has at turning away from crime altogether.

In an election year, real reforms can easily get jettisoned for campaign-trail antics. Yet we know justice reform makes for good politics as well as good policy. In polling in battleground states such as Florida, Nevada, Ohio, and North Carolina, support for reforms that would reduce mandatory minimum sentences and focus resources on rehabilitation ranges from the low 70s to the high 80s for both Republicans and Democrats. These numbers show that the risk lies not in supporting these reforms, but in opposing them.

When one in three American adults has a record, these issues are now affecting every corner of society. That explains why the diversity of support for justice reform spans the breadth and depth of our political ideologies. Whether it’s about redemption and second chances, as is the case for religious groups such as the Southern Baptist Convention, or about reducing the cost of an ineffective system, as is the case for Americans for Tax Reform and many other conservatives, millions of Americans from all different perspectives are getting behind this movement. Long-time civil-rights organizations such as The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights are urging action to reduce the disproportionate impact that mandatory minimum sentences have on communities of color.

People at all levels of law enforcement — including former FBI directors, attorneys general, police chiefs, and prosecutors — agree that these reforms will help them do their jobs well and keep communities safe.

We have come too far to let a rare bipartisan effort like this die. Our country is ready to turn away from the discredited policies that exploded our prison populations and failed to give us the public safety we deserve. Our justice system should be a part of the solution to crime and its root causes. We can do better than using a one-size-fits-all sentencing regime that lumps nonviolent offenders with violent ones. And when some estimates have re-arrest rates for ex-offenders at 65 percent within three years, we cannot afford to continue the status quo. The reforms on the table would improve outcomes while ensuring that public safety is a top priority.

433,Norquist,Grover,ocregister,"It’s a widely abused practice that was imposed on America by past state legislatures and the federal government. Civil asset forfeiture has been used to take innocent people’s property for decades, and is perhaps better known as “legal plunder.”

As such, there’s nothing particularly “civil” about civil asset forfeiture, and a California state senator wants to do something about that in the Golden State.

In many states, under civil asset forfeiture, law enforcement can seize private property without a search warrant or an indictment, much less a conviction, based solely on suspicion that the property has been involved in, or is the ill-gotten gains of, criminal activity.

Never mind that that stands the jurisprudential concept of “innocent until proven guilty” on its head and that it’s incompatible with the constitutional prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures set forth by the Fourth Amendment.

In California, the bar has been set higher, with state law requiring police and prosecutors to obtain a conviction before forfeiting property such as a car, boat, plane, home or cash under $25,000. These same protections must apply to all property and seek to require a uniform conviction standard for property forfeitures. The proposals in SB443 would also require that a conviction be obtained before state and local law enforcement could benefit from federal forfeiture actions.

To that end, Senate Bill 443 was resurrected – a bill that was on the verge of passing the California Legislature last summer – from the inactive file. With amendments aimed at addressing law enforcement objections, there are hopes to have the legislation put to a new vote before the end of this year’s session.

In a June 2015 study for the FreedomWorks Foundation, “Civil Asset Forfeiture: Grading the States,” author Michael Greibrok rated California’s laws governing the procedure a “C-plus.” Americans commonly look at California to see the direction the nation is heading. On civil asset forfeiture however, it is being left behind.

And while a “C” is better than the “D-plus” earned by neighboring Nevada, “not as bad” is hardly a satisfactory standard.

Originally devised as a tool to combat drug trafficking, pimping, money laundering and the like by expropriating their ill-gotten proceeds, civil asset forfeiture has become widely abused, for reasons that are hardly surprising.

It creates a perverse financial incentive – to say nothing of a conflict of interest – for police departments in California when they get to keep 65 percent of the proceeds from the sale of property seizures and of any cash that’s seized.

One of the major goals of the proposal is to close a loophole in California and federal law that allows state and local law enforcement to keep seized proceeds and assets, even if the defendant is only suspected – not convicted – of a crime when the bust is the work of a joint task force with federal law enforcement officials.

In this so-called equitable sharing arrangement, state and local police and prosecutors get to keep up to 80 percent, with the federales getting the remaining 20 percent.

It comes as no surprise, then, to learn that according to a study by the Drug Policy Alliance, which supports SB443, joint state-federal forfeitures more than tripled between 2005 and 2013, while forfeitures without federal involvement remained largely constant.

Police and prosecutors’ budgets should never be balanced on the backs of innocent property owners and our law enforcement officials should not be relegated to tax collectors. In fact, many states – including New Mexico, Florida, Maryland and Minnesota – have taken steps to limit the use of civil asset forfeiture. Their communities did not collapse and neither will California.

Quite the opposite. By respecting due process and property rights, trust between the police and the communities they protect will deepen.

The bill is not perfect. In fact it only addresses civil forfeiture related to offenses involving controlled substances. But it is still a step in the right direction.

In Michigan, the Michigan Association of Police Organizations threw its support behind last year’s round of reforms.

Last June, SB443 passed the California state Senate overwhelmingly on a bipartisan vote of 38-1, and then cleared the state Assembly’s Judiciary Committee 7-0 on July 14 and its Appropriations Committee on Aug. 27 before stalling. Hopefully, California will build on the progress of other states and put their innocent property owners first.

434,Norquist,Grover,huffingtonpost,"The rule for doctors, ""First Do No Harm"" should also apply to politicians promising to ""reform"" the tax code.The federal tax code is too long -- 74,000 pages -- too complicated, too confusing, and too expensive for taxpayers.

It needs to be radically changed. But there is the right way to do it and the wrong way.

We should move to taxing income one time at one rate. Today we tax the same dollar over and over. When you earn it, when you save it, when you invest it and if you are stupid enough to die, the government takes another bite.

Congressional Republicans understand this goal. The House GOP's ""Better Way"" tax reform blueprint cuts taxes for ALL American businesses and families and reduces or eliminates double taxation, like the capital gains tax which needlessly discourages saving and investing.

Big government liberals want to go in the other direction. They want a code more complex and one of their favorite targets is hiking the capital gains tax. They know they can only raise the top ordinary rate so much higher than it is today without wrecking the economy.

Instead, they take aim at cracking the firm conservative opposition to raising the capital gains tax. Their long-term policy goal is higher taxes, with ALL capital gains taxed as ordinary income, and for that rate to be very high. Sometimes they deride the capital gains tax as a ""loophole"" that needs to be closed. Other times they see raising it in increments as the best way to achieve their long-term policy goal of higher taxes. Regardless of the proposal, the end game is the same.

President Obama hiked the capital gains tax rate from 15 to 20 percent for individuals earning $400,000 or more and then Obamacare imposed a 3.8 percentage point ""surtax"" on capital gains. The president's budgets have called for a hike in the rate to 28 percent from the current 23.8 percent, and have called for limiting the use of section 1031 ""like-kind exchanges,"" a common-sense section that allows investors to pay taxes only when they cash-out -- not if they choose to reinvest earnings into another asset.

Hillary Clinton would only perpetuate Obama's misguided effort. Already, she has called for a byzantine capital gains tax with six brackets for those whose total taxable income puts them in the 39.6 percent bracket. This proposal is supposed to fix the problem of short-term investment, even though investors make decisions based on value, not length of time.

She doesn't stop there. She also wants to raise taxes on ""carried interest"" capital gains earned by investment partnerships. Taxing these partnerships will damage your pension or 401(k), your favorite charity and the college your child will attend.

This proposal has nothing to do with taxing ""hedge fund guys,"" as some claim. Income from capital gains has always been taxed at a lower rate because it is income that has already been earned and taxed at individual rates. Economists have said again and again that capital gains income should not be taxed and studies have shown that even supposedly modest increases would have strong adverse economic effects.

For instance, a study by Ernst and Young found that repealing like-kind exchanges would cost the U.S. economy $13.1 billion in lost GDP year after year if used to finance more government spending.

Even using like-kind exchanges as an offset for tax reform would lead to a $6.1 billion annual GDP loss over the long term because repeal would result in a ""lock-in"" effect where businesses are arbitrarily discouraged from making investment decisions because of tax consequences. Similarly, hiking carried interest capital gains could raise as little as $3.1 billion over a decade while hurting pension plans, colleges, charities, and the middle class.

The capital gains tax is always derided as a ""loophole"" by big government politicians that want tax reform to be a tax increase. After outright raising the capital gains tax, they are running into resistance. So now, they are going after provisions like carried interest and like-kind exchanges.

After eight years, we have seen quite enough tax hikes on capital gains recently, and there should be absolutely no more of them.",2,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/grover-norquist/dont-hike-the-capital-gains-tax_b_10739746.html

A fiscal-control board can manage the territory’s debt at no cost to taxpayers.

After months of debate, weeks of negotiations, millions of dollars spent on misleading attack ads, and three bond defaults, Congress is running out of time to prevent a taxpayer bailout of Puerto Rico. The Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA), H.R. 5278, is the fiscally responsible solution to the island’s debt crisis. This legislation installs an oversight board to fix the mess, protect bondholder rights, and, most important, prevent a taxpayer bailout.

Advertisement

Questions have arisen about why Congress even has to deal with Puerto Rico. The argument has been made that the territory’s financial mismanagement created $72 billion in debt, so the territory should take care of everything without any help from the federal government. If Puerto Rico were a foreign country, that would be a valid point. But under the Constitution, Congress has the sole responsibility for all U.S. territories.

As the island’s debt ballooned to record levels, rather than take the steps necessary to restore fiscal security, such as cutting unnecessary spending, in late June of 2015 Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla simply declared that Puerto Rico could no longer meet its financial obligations. On May 1, 2016, the territory defaulted on $370 million worth of debt, the largest of three defaults to date. If nothing occurs before July 1, 2016, Governor Padilla has stated that Puerto Rico will default again, this time on $2 billion in debt.

Congress needs to step in now; otherwise, a huge taxpayer bailout is the likely outcome. PROMESA is the best, most fiscally responsible way to prevent a bailout from occurring. A fiscal-control board, similar to those that helped reverse the fiscal misfortunes of New York City and Washington, D.C., will be created under the legislation. The board’s responsibilities will include determining the depth of the fiscal situation, approving budgets, and producing financial statements. In short, it will ensure that the Puerto Rico fiscal crisis is addressed without spending a dime of taxpayer money.

Advertisement

The board will also be a forum for voluntary renegotiation of the terms of the Puerto Rican debt. There are no fewer than 18 classifications of creditors, with varying situations. This is good news for creditors, who are getting paid nothing right now thanks to the defaulted payments. Stretching out a repayment term or lowering an interest rate is clearly a better solution than getting nothing at all.

If debt cannot voluntarily be renegotiated, the board will be able to recommend a debt restructuring overseen by a federal court as a last resort. This is not to be confused with municipal bankruptcy: The process is not empowered by the Constitution’s bankruptcy clause, but by its grant to Congress of the authority to set all needful laws for territories. Ordinary federal courts rather than bankruptcy courts will be used.

This bill is not a bailout. Zero taxpayer dollars will be spent in helping Puerto Rico get out of its fiscal nightmare of debt.

Misleading claims are being made that this type of debt restructuring will spread like a contagion to basket-case states such as California and Illinois. But the Tenth Amendment prohibits Congress from setting up a control board for states along the lines envisioned for Puerto Rico, nor is it at all likely that a sovereign state would accept one even if Congress tried.

This bill is not a bailout. Zero taxpayer dollars will be spent in helping Puerto Rico get out of its fiscal nightmare of debt. Without PROMESA, defaults will continue, litigation will mount, and basic humanitarian services will start to break down. Creditors will demand payment anyway, and taxpayers will be left holding the bag.

While this bill will take care of one aspect of the economic crisis, it would have been even better if pro-growth tax reform and other provisions had been included to help create jobs and get the Puerto Rican economy moving again. For example, all U.S. companies doing business on the island have to pay Puerto Rican income tax and pay taxes again when they bring the money home, which is also the case for Americans doing business in foreign countries. This double tax should be permanently repealed as a down payment toward the territorial tax system that should be part of any comprehensive tax reform.

In any case, Congress has a duty to address the Puerto Rico fiscal disaster before every taxpayer around the country gets stuck with the bill.

436,Norquist,Grover,washingtonexaminer,"Recently, a few notable organizations have added their voices in support of criminal justice reform efforts in the Senate. The International Association of Chiefs of Police, the Major County Sheriffs' Association, Concerned Veterans of America and the National District Attorneys Association — none of which are soft on crime — agree: The Senate's Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act isn't either.

Neither are former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, 9/11-era New York Police Chief Bernie Kerik, the states of Texas and Georgia, and a slew of conservative leaders.

And again, all of them know that not only is criminal justice reform not soft on crime, it's a core conservative policy issue.

In the Senate, conservatives have been negotiating the details of SRCA since last year. The bill tackles reforms to the criminal justice system in two parts: First, it adjusts some punishments by allowing judges to deviate from certain mandatory-minimum sentences. The idea behind this is to ensure that low-level offenders are not tying up precious law-enforcement resources and to refocus on going after the worst criminals.

One of the sentencing fixes, known as the 924(c) ""stacking fix,"" is more commonly referred to as the ""Weldon Angelos fix."" Weldon Angelos is currently serving time for selling marijuana three times to an undercover agent. He had no prior convictions and no violent episodes. The only notable aspect of his case was his possession of a firearm. He had a gun for two of the deals, while agents found a gun in his house for the third instance, and that counted as possessing a firearm.

Suddenly, simply having a firearm in your home is a crime.

Thanks to poorly written mandatory-minimum sentence provisions, he was sentenced to 55 years in prison. By comparison, the mandatory- maximum sentence for voluntary manslaughter is 15 years.

A person could kill someone and spend less time in the clink than Mr. Angelos. His excessive stint in prison is tying up resources that would be better used on a real threat to society.

Under no circumstances would a violent criminal receive any leniency on his or her punishment, even if they committed no violent act in connection with the crime for which they are being sentenced. In fact, if there's any serious violent felony in the person's criminal history, they aren't eligible for any new sentencing relief. Furthermore, anyone hoping for a lighter sentence must first fully cooperate with prosecutors in the case.

The problem with our current excessive sentences for lower-level offenders is simple: Rather than deter crime, they create more crime, according to the best research we have.

America is not opening the cell doors. More like giving judges and prosecutors a carrot to get the cooperation of lower-level offenders and be better prepared to go after the Pablo Escobars of the world.

Second, SRCA would start to change our prison system into a real correctional system. Sadly, the recidivism rate in this country is unacceptably high. Our prisons have utterly failed to deter the people who go through the system from reoffending. No government agency should get a free pass when it comes to judging their use of taxpayer dollars and the outcomes it produces — and the prison system should be no exception.

That's why the Senate's bill would implement recidivism-reduction programming similar to that established in numerous red states to make sure the people leaving prison stay out of prison. Prisoners are encouraged to participate by allowing them to earn time credits that they can use to spend a specific portion of their sentence in either home confinement or community supervision.

That means that after successfully reducing their likelihood of committing more crimes, inmates are then transferred to other forms of supervision where they will take up fewer public resources and have an easier time reintegrating as productive members of society.

These reforms put inmates to work. That isn't being soft on crime. America is getting ready to get even tougher on it.

Little wonder that the conservatives that first came up with these reforms in the states won election after election. So much so that they didn't stop at one round of reforms: Texas is still passing reforms after starting nearly 10 years ago, only now it's doing so with the lowest crime rates since 1968.

There are important conservative priorities being pursued in Congress, and justice reform is one of them. The naysayers are becoming ever fewer and more isolated.

Nearly ten years ago, in 2007, Texas faced $527 million in immediate prison-construction costs, and $2 billion in additional costs by 2012. Even for a large and wealthy state, the sticker shock was staggering.

Texas had seen its prison population rise dramatically. Between 1990 and 2010, the number of inmates jumped from around 50,000 to more than 155,000 — incarcerating so many inmates began to crowd out other vital areas of the budget.

Texas House Corrections Committee chairman Jerry Madden approached House speaker Tom Craddick and asked what he should do to address the rising costs. “Don’t build new prisons,” Craddick said. “They cost too much.”

Madden, a Republican, got to work and, along with his colleagues from both sides of the aisle, devised a plan to tackle the state’s growing prison population. With an investment of $241 million, lawmakers created drug courts to divert low-level, nonviolent offenders into treatment programs as an alternative to incarceration and funded rehabilitation programs to reduce prisoners’ risk of recidivism when they reentered society.

The results of the Texas model are difficult to ignore: The state’s prison population declined by 14 percent and, even more importantly, crime rates dropped by 29 percent.

RELATED: Criminal-Justice Reform Is a Conservative Cause

One might argue that crime rates were dropping all over the country at the time — which is true — but if one were to listen to those in rabid opposition to justice reform, wouldn’t the reverse have happened? Instead, Texas now has its lowest crime rate since 1968 and recidivism is 9 percent less than before Texas’s 2007 reforms.

The results were so encouraging that other states sought to replicate Texas’s success. Most of the states that have moved on substantive justice reform are traditionally conservative ones. More than two dozen states — including Georgia, Mississippi, and South Carolina — have passed justice-reform packages.

RELATED: Texas Shows How to Reduce Both Incarceration and Crime

Interestingly, it wasn’t until multiple Republican-controlled states moved on the issue that traditionally blue states felt that they could: They all waited for red states to move first. Hawaii, Oregon, and Rhode Island, three of the most progressive states in the country, followed the lead of conservative states. Since then, even more red states — including Alabama, Oklahoma, and Utah — have passed justice reform.

Red states, and Texas in particular, provided a blueprint for other states to follow while Barack Obama was still the junior senator from Illinois. In fact, today, a Republican governor of Illinois, Bruce Rauner, is spearheading long overdue justice reform in the Land of Lincoln.

#share#Now is the time to bring these conservative reforms to the federal level. The federal prison population grew by nearly 800 percent between 1980 and 2013, and the Bureau of Prisons’ budget increased by almost 600 percent, from $970 million to $6.7 billion.

Opponents of justice reform point to the high recidivism rate of federal prisoners as one of the reasons Congress shouldn’t act, but this is exactly why we, like so many conservative states, should act to get smarter on crime.

RELATED: The High Cost of Over-Incarceration

Moreover, there is also another angle that congressional Republicans may not have considered: There are no guarantees this fall. Conservatives could be facing four or eight more years of a Democrat in the White House, Democratic control of the Senate, and, quite possibly, the House could swing back to left-wing control.

While there is more bipartisanship on criminal justice than any other issue, conservatives understand we cannot reduce the prison population without also strengthening alternatives like probation and drug courts. So, for example, there should be swift and certain sanctions — such as a weekend in jail — when someone blows off their probation officer. Some on the far left simply don’t recognize the “stick” part of the carrot-and-stick approach and want to divert savings on prisons to welfare programs rather than following Texas’s proven record by reinvesting the savings in supervision strategies that can help continue crime declines.

In light of this display of gross incompetence from the federal government — paying nearly half a billion dollars for an unworkable website that they had three years to prepare for — Americans should ask themselves: “Is it a good idea to put these bureaucrats in charge of doing our taxes?”

There are perennial calls in Washington for tax returns to be prepared by the Internal Revenue Service. Every April 15, like clockwork, a host of policy analysts take to the airwaves and op-ed pages to opine on how great it would be if the IRS prepared tax returns for most Americans.

There are a number of problems with this proposal, however.

For starters, having the IRS serve in the dual roles of tax collector and tax preparer presents an inherent conflict of interest. The main function of the IRS is to collect taxes, as much as possible. That is how the agency defines success and failure.

To put the government entity responsible for maximizing tax collections in charge of preparing returns would result in a clear conflict of interest — one that would work to the disadvantage of ordinary taxpayers. In our court system, we separate the role of prosecutor from that of judge for a reason.

Second, as demonstrated by the rollout of the Obamacare exchanges, the federal government does not have the bandwidth or the competence to be trusted with the added responsibility of preparing tax returns. The IRS is an unwieldy bureaucratic behemoth that is already under congressional investigation for stifling the First Amendment rights of President Barack Obama’s political opponents and making Star Trek videos at taxpayer expense.

Just this week, the Treasury Inspector General announced that $11.5 billion in fraudulent earned-income tax credits were paid out during the 2012 fiscal year. The IRS also announced that the 2014 tax filing season will be delayed by a week or two.

Aside from not having the capacity to handle the task, a proposal that the IRS prepare tax returns is a solution in search of a problem. For a decade now, 16 private-sector tax software providers have joined to provide free tax preparation services to low- and middle-income households. Over these 10 years, 37 million tax returns have been processed by this private option — saving taxpayers $129 million in administrative costs.

According to Jeffrey Eisenach, managing director of Navigant Economics, having the IRS prepare taxpayers’ returns would require “the largest and most ambitious information technology upgrade in the agency’s history.”

Eisenach also points out that the IRS has a less-than-stellar track record of designing and implementing technology modernization programs. Typical problems include delays, projects going over budget and basic failure. While implementing a tax return preparation system would cost hundreds of millions of dollars and take several years, history suggests it could actually take a decade or more and cost billions.

Computerworld put out a report this week that analyzed the last decade of government IT procurements costing more than $10 million. It found that 96 percent fail. These procurements usually “come in over budget, or vastly too late, or they don’t work at all” Clay Johnson, founder and chief executive officer of the Department of Better Technology, told the Washington Post this week. “If you’re going to spend a whole bunch of money on a process with a 96 percent failure rate,” Johnson said, “it pretty much guarantees it won’t work out that well.”

Requiring the IRS to prepare tax returns for millions of Americans would impose significant demands on its resources. James Maule, a tax law expert at Villanova Law School, describes the headaches this would create for taxpayers.

“Assuming such a system became operational,” Maule said, “what happens if a taxpayer finds a discrepancy between what the IRS puts on the return and what the taxpayer knows is correct? Would the IRS have the resources to change the inaccurate data on information returns imbedded in the system? Under current procedures, the IRS sends notices if there are mismatches with its information, and yet far too many of these automated notices are already incorrect.”

This month’s Obamacare launch provided a preview of the problems that would result from a government tax return preparation initiative. Those who have sought to enroll in Obamacare through the online exchanges have to contend with incorrect data, duplicate enrollment and other errors — such as spouses being counted as children. Sorting these problems out, come tax time, will not be easy

Conflicts of interest aside, the federal government’s plate is already too full. The IRS is responsible for implementing 47 different Obamacare provisions — including the 20 new or higher taxes that are to pay for this new entitlement program.

Starting next year, the agency will begin intrusively asking Americans for personal health identification information. The last thing that the federal government — the IRS, in particular — should be put in charge of, or that taxpayers should trust it with, is preparing tax returns for individuals, families and employers across the country.

Survey after survey shows that Americans hate the tax code, yet it has been decades since it has been significantly reformed.

There are two reasons for this apparent contradiction:

1) The forces against any simplification or reform effort are powerful and willing to do everything they can to block it: Every obscure tax provision in the tax code was secured at great cost and effort, and benefits someone.

2) Congress rarely acts unless it is forced to do so. Deadlines can be useful in forcing action.

Major tax reform is a crucial issue that Congress must address soon in order to help correct the many inefficiencies in the economy and restore the rate of economic growth to historic norms. Nonetheless, major tax reform appears unlikely this year, with Congress planning to recess in July for the fall election. However, Congress can set the conditions for tax reform in the next Congress by passing an innovative bill that will “sunset,” or legislatively terminate, the tax code by the end of 2019.

H.R.27, the Tax Code Termination Act, is authored by House Judiciary committee chairman Bob Goodlatte (R., Va.) with the sole purpose of setting a December 31, 2019, expiration date on the entire tax code, except for Social Security and Medicare.

The bill has attracted broad and bipartisan support, with 129 co-sponsors, including nine full committee chairs, plus House Ways and Means chairman Kevin Brady (R., Texas) and House Tax Policy Subcommittee chairman Charles Boustany (R., La.), members of leadership such as Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R., Wash.) and Greg Walden (R., Ore.), several members of the House Freedom Caucus, and bipartisan support from Minnesota Democrat Collin Peterson.

As Chairman Goodlatte has said, “It has become all too clear that the current code is broken beyond repair and cannot be fixed — we must start over from a blank slate. While I have yet to hear an argument for maintaining our current tax code, I hear argument after argument for why we need a new one.”

“Comprehensive tax reform will not happen overnight,” Goodlatte continued. “But we should not delay taking a first step forward. Setting a date certain for a new tax system is the necessary and prudent first step.”

Just over a year ago, our two organizations launched Sunset the Tax Code, a broad, nonpartisan effort to set a January 1, 2020, deadline for tax reform by passing legislation to terminate the current tax code on December 31, 2019.

We see this legislation as a powerful tool to convince Congress to begin the heavy lifting of rewriting our broken tax code.

That date is soon enough to create real urgency, yet far enough into the future to give Congress ample time to seriously debate many alternative tax plans without spooking the capital markets. We urge the House to pass the tax-code-termination bill before Congress adjourns in July or August. The next step in the legislative process is a Tax Policy Subcommittee hearing on the bill, and then a full Ways and Means Committee markup.

We see this legislation as a powerful tool to convince Congress to begin the heavy lifting of rewriting our broken tax code. It is the catalyst that we need, and it has the support of a majority of taxpayers.

National polling firm McLaughlin & Associates conducted a nationwide survey last summer to learn what voters think about the tax code. They found three conclusions:

1) Seventy-five percent of voters in both parties do not believe the current federal tax code is “generally fair and equitable.”

2) Eighty-five percent believe something must be done to force Congress to get serious about tax before 2020 (only 4 percent disagreed).

3) Seventy percent support terminating the current tax code at the end of 2019 to force tax reform (with only 10 percent opposing).

With tax-reform legislation not moving this year, passing H.R.27 is how Congress can show its commitment to eventual tax reform by setting a deadline for action that will bring both sides together and begin the national debate for a new tax code.

We know that Speaker Paul Ryan and Chairman Brady share a passion for tax reform and have groups working on it with hope that such legislation can move in the next Congress.

While Ryan and Brady are new to their current leadership roles, we know from past history that despite good intentions, other issues arise, crises occur, and year after year no tax reform passes.

A deadline is required, and H.R.27 is simple and clear.

Any tax reform is helpful. Any reduction in rates or simplification of the code would be pro-growth.

But despite the best efforts of the House Ways and Means Committee, there is simply no real urgency on Capitol Hill right now to pass broad-based reform.

Former Obama White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel was fond of saying, “Never let a crisis go to waste.”

We prefer a less sinister truism: “Nothing focuses the mind like a deadline.”",2,http://www.nationalreview.com/article/433995/tax-code-reform-deadline-congress-needs-deadline-incentive-move-taxes
440,Norquist,Grover,middletownpress,"Democrats have approached the 2016 presidential election with great confidence, arguing that changing demographics will guarantee them victory. By this, they mean the growing number of African Americans, Hispanics and Asian Americans expected to vote in November.

However, other dramatic changes in the electorate over the past 30 years give Republican candidates an advantage. Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee, has insulted these groups of Americans. Clinton began her political life in the late 1970s, and her understanding of who votes and why predates the emergence of these voting constituencies — in some cases by decades.

Home-schoolers: Thirty years ago, home schooling was illegal in almost every state. Today, all 50 states allow home schooling, and about 2 million children are home-schooled. Ten million Americans have been home-schooled at some point in their lives. Home-schoolers believe Clinton and the modern Democratic Party would like to regulate home schooling out of existence to please the teachers unions.

Charter school supporters: There are nearly 3 million students in public charter schools, an educational choice not available before 1992. Clinton has been endorsed by teachers unions, which see as a top priority bringing unionized teachers and work rules into public charter classrooms, destroying the very educational environment that parents of charter school students fought to win for their children. The kids cannot vote. Their parents can. These children and their parents live in cities, and often in swing states.

Concealed-carry permit holders: When Bill and Hillary Clinton were promoting gun control in 1993, the “gun lobby” was imagined by liberal politicians as limited to hunters in rural areas. Easy to ignore, they thought. But now 42 states have enacted laws that grant any honest citizen the right to carry a gun. Nearly 13 million Americans have concealed-carry permits. Carrying a gun is a personal decision, a big part of many people’s lives. Hillary Clinton said on March 6: “I think we have to try everything that works to try to limit the numbers of people and the kinds of people who are given access to firearms.”

This is an insult to the 13 million Americans who have decided to take upon themselves the task of protecting themselves and their families. Many live in swing states: Florida has about 1.4 million concealed-carry permits, Pennsylvania 1 million, Michigan 600,000, Ohio 460,000, and Colorado 160,000.

Fracking workers: It has historically been an easy decision for Democrats to insult and belittle the oil and gas industry, and Hillary Clinton is continuing on this track. Energy workers lived in Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Alaska - unlikely states for a Democratic presidential candidate to win. But the emergence of fracking has opened up oil and gas exploration in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Colorado. Try winning 270 electoral votes while threatening to damage the nearly 186,000 energy jobs in Ohio, almost 73,000 jobs in Pennsylvania and more than 100,000 jobs in Colorado.

Users of e-cigarettes and vapor products: Vaping, an alternative to smoking cigarettes, was not around 10 years ago. Today, more than 9 million Americans vape. They have shifted from smoking cigarettes to a healthier lifestyle. They are proud of their transition. President Obama’s Food and Drug Administration is moving to essentially kill the vaping industry through regulations, and Sen. Ed Markey, D-Massachusetts, the Carrie Nation of the new prohibition movement, has said, “The e-cigarette industry should be put out of business.” If you doubt that this is a vote-moving issue, ask someone who vapes.

Uber drivers and others in the sharing economy: There was no Uber before 2009. Today, there are 400,000 Uber drivers who take at least four trips a month. Clinton has announced that she wants to “crack down” on independent contractor laws that allow Uber and the entire sharing economy to exist. Why? Unions don’t like laws that allow Americans to work independently. They don’t pay dues. Clinton wants you to have a boss. Add to Uber drivers those Americans who know what Airbnb, TaskRabbit, Instacart and Postmates are.

Clinton watched her husband run for the presidency and win in 1992 and 1996. But that was before vaping, fracking, Uber, concealed-carry, charter schools and home schooling became prevalent in the United States.",2,http://www.middletownpress.com/article/MI/20160408/NEWS/160409623

Guest columnist

Two years ago, Mississippi legislators agreed on a smart, principled plan to transform the state’s troubled criminal justice system. I congratulated the initiative then, but I’m even more enthusiastic about it now.

At that time, almost a third of nonviolent offenders released from prison were reconvicted within three years. The system was failing. Mississippi deserved better.

This is why policymakers needed to take the best data and the most effective policies to reform the state's prison system. The evidence has begun to trickle in, and the changes are working. That’s no small feat, and if the state holds fast to its new course, the future looks bright.

To understand the significance of this progress, we should consider the problems besetting Mississippi’s criminal justice system just a few years ago.



In 2012 Mississippi had the nation’s second-highest imprisonment rate, trailing only Louisiana. Its incarcerated population had surged 300 percent between 1983 and 2013 to more than 22,400 inmates, and taxpayers faced the burden of spending another $266 million over the next 10 years to accommodate still more prison growth.

For all that investment public safety was still being shortchanged by ineffective practices and a lack of accountability. Among other discouraging signs, nearly one in three nonviolent offenders released from prison was back behind bars within three years.

Fortunately, Mississippi’s leaders had the vision and fortitude to tackle the problem. A bipartisan panel of legislators, judges, prosecutors, and others was appointed to study the state’s sentencing and corrections system and recommend improvements. Beginning in 2013, the Corrections and Criminal Justice Task Force spent seven months reviewing data, analyzing programs and practices that were producing results in other states, and gathering input from a wide range of stakeholders.

What they found was that Mississippi had been locking up more and more nonviolent offenders in its prisons for longer periods of time. The task force also discovered an enormous increase in the number of people incarcerated because of a probation or parole violation — in many cases because of a missed meeting with their probation officer, failed drug test or other minor violation, rather than a new crime.

Finally, task force members learned that Mississippi was relying heavily on its most expensive sanction — prison — in part because there were few sentencing alternatives. Without viable options, judges often had no choice but to incarcerate those who could be more effectively supervised in the community.

Conservatives know that outcome, not how much money you spend, is the true test of public policy. This is why it was conservatives who fought for reform in so many states. For many low-level nonviolent offenders, imprisonment is not the most effective sanction — and can actually increase the odds that someone will commit more crimes upon release.

Fortunately, the task force recommended an impressive package of reforms anchored in this very research. That led to House Bill 585, which passed the Legislature overwhelmingly and was signed into law by Gov. Phil Bryant on March 31, 2014. It marked the most significant criminal justice change in Mississippi in a generation and won national acclaim for the state.

Like other states that paved the way for justice reform, Mississippi’s bold actions are bearing fruit. With the implementation of evidence-based supervision strategies, more offenders are completing probation crime-free, and the number sent back to prison for not following the rules has dropped dramatically.

Moreover, Mississippi, long the second-highest incarcerator in the nation, has now dropped to fifth in the latest national rankings. A closer look at the state’s prison population decline points to the growing numbers of low-level drug and property offenders diverted from prison to proven alternatives like drug courts. This focusing of prison beds on serious and violent offenders is exactly what the bill was intended to do. In fact, the share of the prison population convicted of violent crimes has increased from 46 to 56 percent. This means that Mississippi is using prison beds both more sparingly and more wisely.

For residents of Mississippi, the dividends of all this are taxpayer savings, an estimated $266 million in averted prison costs over 10 years, more accountability, and a slowing of the revolving prison doors — now Washington and the nation are paying attention.

Mississippi’s leadership in this space has inspired other states to take note. In the short time since this state’s reform, Utah and Alabama have followed suit, ushering in comprehensive, cost-effective criminal justice reforms of their own.

Even Congress is taking up reforms pioneered in states like Mississippi. The Senate’s Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act, coupled with the House’s own package of bills, demonstrate the hunger Americans across the country have for conservative justice reform. This is why we urge the entire Mississippi federal delegation to also support reform.

I commend Mississippi’s leaders for championing and implementing HB 585. We’re seeing now that it truly does pay to be Right on Crime.

443,Norquist,Grover,washingtonexaminer,"On March 23, Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., made comments signaling his strong support for the House's criminal justice efforts. Discussing times when he had changed his mind, Ryan pointed to the justice system as an area that had not previously needed reform, but had since come to accept the consensus conservative prescriptions to improve the nation's criminal system. While Ryan failed to point to specific action, several bills have already received wide bipartisan support in the Judiciary Committee.

Ryan recounts how he ""spent the last few years touring poor communities around America — rural areas, inner cities — learning about just how people are trying to struggle with poverty,"" when asked about whether he has ever changed his mind. He came to the realization that ""there are a lot of people who have been in prison who committed crimes that were not violent crimes and who, once they have that blight on the record, had been in prison, their future is really bleak.""

He then gets to the heart of the matter, ""We overcompensated on some of our laws … ending up hurting their lives and hurting their communities.

""That is why – and I talked with [House Judiciary Committee Chairman] Bob Goodlatte about this last night – we're going to bring criminal justice reform bills, which are now out of the Judiciary Committee, to the House floor and advance this, because what we're learning is — what I learned — I didn't necessarily notice before is, you know, redemption is a beautiful thing. It's a great thing,"" the Speaker stated. ""Redemption is what makes this place work — this place being America, society — and we need to honor redemption and we need to make redemption something that is valued in our culture, in our society, and in our laws.

""When a young man comes out of prison — a person who is not a violent criminal, who did something where he really needed addiction counseling; he needed some of other kind of mentoring, maybe faith — that he can actually go back and be a productive member of society, be a good husband, be a good father, make a difference … reach his potential,"" he added.

A recently published study by the U.S. Sentencing Commission tells the story of the sorry state of American justice. Roughly half of federal offenders who left prison in 2005 were rearrested within 8 years. This means that even though the United States has the largest imprisoned population in the world, and after our country saw the largest jump in its incarceration in history, the system is not working like it should.

According to still another study, about 68 percent of released prisoners were rearrested after three years. People released from prison should be less likely to commit crimes. Not more.

This is not a new problem. For years the Right has been looking for ways to safely reduce American prison populations not by letting everybody out, but by making the system deter crime rather than perpetuate it. Mississippi, Georgia, Texas and North Carolina are just some in the long list of states that have done the difficult work of governing and showed how responsible legislation can make the government save lives while also getting leaner.

The House is currently considering three critical pieces of legislation that would presumably get floor time if Ryan follows through on his comments. Among these are the Sentencing Reform Act and the Criminal Code Improvement Act, both of which Americans for Tax Reform has endorsed, as well as the Recidivism Risk Reduction Act.

The Sentencing Reform Act would refocus sentences to target the worst drug trafficking offenders while giving judges the discretion to give lower sentences to small-time nonviolent offenders. This would ensure that we are using scarce law-enforcement resources where they will do the most good.

In addition, the Criminal Code Improvement Act would add much-needed protections for every-day Americans who may not know the entirety of the list of 5,000 federal crimes they can be charged for. If you do not know you are committing an obscure crime, you should not be prosecuted. It has been a basic common law principle for over 1,000 years.

Lastly, the Recidivism Risk Reduction Act would implement the practices of alternative incarceration, risk assessment and proven programing to put the ""Corrections"" back in the Correctional system.

As the Senate lags, the House seems poised to take the lead on this necessary and popular issue. Paul Ryan's leadership on criminal justice reform is yet another example of taking a Right on Crime approach to make America safe again.

This is an insult to the 13 million Americans who have decided to take upon themselves the task of protecting themselves and their families. Perhaps Clinton thinks she can ignore those whom some liberals consider rubes living in square states out west. But let’s look at swing states in 2016: Florida has about 1.4 million concealed-carry permits, Pennsylvania 1 million, Michigan 600,000, Ohio 460,000 , and Colorado 160,000.

By Grover Norquist and Patrick Gleason

March 15 (Reuters) - State lawmakers are getting into the act of demonizing corporate inversions even though there is not much they can do to stop them. Corporate inversions, in which U.S. companies merge with or are acquired by an overseas business, are a hot topic on the campaign trail and in the halls of Congress. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Democrats on Capitol Hill portray inversions as a nefarious maneuver by corporate executives to take advantage of lower tax rates abroad. But those politicians have misdiagnosed the ailment.

Inversions are not a problem for the United States. They are a symptom of a problem. The root problem is the United States levies the highest statutory corporate tax rate in the developed world and, unlike all other developed nations, imposes double taxes on profits earned abroad. Rather than confront this problem, Clinton, Sanders and others, including Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), deride major companies at campaign events.

GOP frontrunner Donald Trump bashes companies for moving their headquarters abroad just as much as Clinton and Sanders. Yet Trump, like Senator Marco Rubio, Ohio Governor John Kasich and other Republican candidates, actually proposes to get at the root problem by cutting corporate tax rates.

Now lawmakers at the state level are joining in on the demagoguery, with legislation that would punish employers for bad federal tax policy. In response to Pfizer's November announcement that it is buying Allergen and moving its headquarters to Ireland, where the 12.5 percent corporate rate is less than one half of the 35 percent imposed by the United States, the New Jersey Assembly passed legislation that prohibits inverted companies from receiving state contracts or development tax credits.

The New Jersey bill would effectively punish companies for responding to unsound federal tax policy. If the state senate approves the measure, Governor Chris Christie should veto it. It would only make New Jersey, whose business tax climate is already hostile to employers, even less hospitable.

""Corporate inversions take place because of the federal tax code,"" said Andrew Musick, director of taxation and economic development at the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, ""and have nothing to do with state programs or state contracts. In fact, they have little to no impact on New Jersey's corporate business-tax collections or the jobs and facilities located in the state.""

New Jersey lawmakers need to realize that companies that do business in the state face a combined federal and state corporate tax rate of 44 percent, compared to the 25 percent, on average, European corporate rate. New Jersey residents already pay the highest property taxes in the country, the sixth-highest income tax rate, the fifth-highest corporate rate and contend with the nation's second-highest overall tax burden. The last thing New Jersey needs are new laws that make the state even less competitive than it already is.

Legislators in Trenton aren't the only ones busy hatching a plan that will do nothing to halt corporate inversions. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew issued rules meant to tamp down on inversions - to little effect.

Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, has proposed an exit tax, which would require U.S. companies to pay taxes on foreign earnings immediately. Under current law, those earnings aren't taxed by Uncle Sam until the company repatriates them to the United States.

What's amazing is that Clinton sees high taxes pushing companies to relocate their headquarters abroad - and her solution is new taxes. It is as if she is effectively telling companies that the beatings will continue until morale improves.

It's interesting that the same Democratic politicians and pundits who lambasted Mitt Romney for saying that corporations are people, too, on the 2012 campaign trail, now insist that corporations have patriotic or moral duties, as though they are people. What is clear, in any case, is that the burden of corporate taxes is borne by people.

In fact, the Obama administration and federal government recently began acknowledging this.

Until 2013, Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation models assumed that the burden of corporate taxes was borne entirely by the owners of capital (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, IRAs and so on). That changed when the committee announced, in an October 2013 study, that it would begin reporting on the impact corporate taxes have on both capital and labor.

The decision came after the Treasury Department and the Congressional Budget Office made similar adjustments in their models to account for labor's share of corporate taxes. In fact, it has been during the Obama administration, which has signed into law trillions of dollars in higher taxes, that key nonpartisan fiscal scorekeepers have begun to recognize that corporate taxes are paid for, in part, by workers in the form of lower compensation and reduced opportunities.",2,http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3493533/States-vie-feds-punish-company-moves-abroad-But-does-work.html

The growth of online retail shopping in recent years has made that quest appear even more tempting. Several things stand in the way. The first is the U.S. Constitution. In Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, the Supreme Court held that a business had to be physically present in a state before the state could require the business to impose sales or use taxes on consumers elsewhere on its behalf. This has prevented states like Utah from taxing businesses and consumers that aren't based in the state. It has also prevented states like California from reaching into the pockets of Utah consumers.

Equitable sharing — a law-enforcement cooperation statute — allows state agencies to use federal law to skirt asset forfeiture restrictions. Because of this, a recent national report by the Institute for Justice gave Virginia a D- for its civil forfeiture laws, one of the worst grades in the country. Assets should generally not be seized until a defendant is actually convicted of a crime.

Second, it is time to address the ballooning cost of incarceration. In 1995, Virginia largely abolished parole, so more people now spend more time in Virginia prisons, thereby costing taxpayers more money. Furthermore, because offenders do not have a strong period of supervision and support when re-entering society, they are a significant risk to reoffend. Virginia taxpayers now spend more than $1 billion per year on incarceration, but there is little evidence that this increased level of imprisonment is making us safer. Longer sentences do not necessarily deter crimes or make felons less likely to reoffend. We need to be more particular (and frugal) — identifying where longer sentences work and where they don’t, and adjust accordingly.",2,http://www.richmond.com/opinion/their-opinion/guest-columnists/article_34e1fc32-5d11-578b-8423-1144a7ee2668.html

The U.S. Senate will soon vote on whether to permanently ban Internet-access taxes. Congress enacted the ban in 1998, and there have been nearly a half-dozen renewals since then. Senator John Thune (R., S.D.) has done present and future taxpayers a great favor by leading the fight to include it in the upcoming customs bill.

Members of Congress from both parties have voted again and again against the taxation of Internet access. In the U.S., public support for tax-free Internet access is overwhelming. The world agrees. Last year tens of thousands of Hungarians filled the streets to forestall their government’s attempt at imposing Internet-data taxes.

So why has this common-sense legislation, which enjoys bipartisan majority support in both the House and Senate — and popular support in the nation — languished year after year? In the case of the Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act, the bill is a hostage. Its virtue as sound law and its popularity are exactly what have doomed it to legislative limbo. Until now.

For more than 15 years, Congress held the threat of taxing Internet access over the heads of the American people, routinely passing short-term temporary bans on state and local access taxes, but refusing to permanently close the door on what amounts to taxing interstate commerce. Ironically, the most recent holdup was orchestrated by proponents of a new tax scheme on purchases made over the Internet.

But as 2015 drew to a close, with several pieces of must-pass legislation pending, congressional leaders worked to finally slam the door on Internet-access taxes. The ban wound up in the customs bill, but unfortunately we saw yet another short-term extension. The customs legislation including the ban got pushed into 2016. Nonetheless, it appears that we will finally get a vote in the Senate sometime in the few next weeks.

Though support of the ban is bipartisan and widespread, some senators, led by Majority Leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.), are fighting hard to pull this provision out of the customs bill, either because they oppose the ban outright, or because they prefer to hold it hostage so they can pass other tax increases (like the new scheme for taxing Internet sales). Or both. These senators are mounting an effort to strip the ban out of the customs bill when it comes to the floor.

This time, however, when these senators try to stop the Internet-access-tax ban, they will be on record. Through their public vote to strip the permanent ban out of the bill, Americans will know where each senator stands, and it’s going to be tough for anyone in any red or purple state to explain away a vote for allowing Internet-access taxes.

#share#New technologies that depend on Internet access are created every day. If our digital economy is to continue to thrive, it is imperative that Congress quit playing games with what has become an absolute necessity to business, education, entertainment, and basic communication.

One of the greatest barriers to Internet access is cost. For example, a tax that increased the price of Internet access by just 1 percent would reduce demand for Internet access by 2.75 percent, according to an estimate by former White House Chief Economist Austan Goolsbee.

RELATED: Stop the Streaming Tax

This new burden would disproportionately fall on low-income Americans. Households of lesser means could pay ten times more of their income than they do now for access. Many families would see their access to the Internet limited, or they might even be shut out altogether.

It is past time for Congress to rule out the threat of Internet taxation. Ever since I served on the Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce back in 1999, I’ve been arguing that we need to make the ban permanent. Our innovation economy and the American people deserve complete certainty that Internet access won’t be taxed.

Senators should vote against stripping the permanent Internet-tax ban out of the customs bill.

451,Norquist,Grover,huffingtonpost,"This week the National Conference of State Legislatures arrived in Washington to lobby Senators to pass legislation that would allow states to tax across state lines, hitting businesses in other states that sell products online. At present, the Constitution does not allow politicians in one state to levy taxes on businesses and individuals in other states. There is a good reason for that. It would be taxation without representation.

The ""let's tax those who cannot vote against us"" lobby had hoped to hold hostage the Internet access tax moratorium bill--that is regularly extended year after year. But that won't work, and they have shifted to trying to slip the Internet sales tax legislation into the Omnibus.

For many years now, tax and spend state legislators have been pushing Congress to implement sales taxes on the interstate transactions that the Supreme Court has ruled off-limits without Congressional direction.

The legislators claim to be after ""parity"", but what they really want is to avoid tax competition among the states. States that have driven out businesses and residents through high income, property and sales taxes want some way to get to businesses and people in other states. They want to tax people who cannot vote against them.

The two bills being pushed this year are the Remote Transactions Parity Act (RPTA) and the Marketplace Fairness Act (MFA). In addition to the tax increases on consumers, they both layer more regulatory burdens on small businesses and set a dangerous precedent for taxation without representation by extending collection duties and audit targets outside a state's own borders.

Elected officials have always had two hostages they thought would muscle the taxes through - local businesses and popular Congressional legislation.

State mayors and legislators threaten local businesses, small and large alike, with increased property or business income taxes if they don't go along with the plan.

Meanwhile, federal legislators won't allow the Internet Tax Freedom Forever Act, a vastly popular bill, to go to the floor for a vote. Powerful interests have blocked the bill unless and until some kind of online sales tax is attached to it. ITFFA would make the current Internet Tax Moratorium permanent, ending any possibility of states taxing Internet access, and also ensure that there are no discriminatory taxes on e-commerce.

The latest tactic being pushed by states is the online sales tax stowed-away in the Omnibus.

Understandable they would want to keep online sales tax under the radar. The bills are widely unpopular with voters across the spectrum. According to polling conducted by the National Taxpayers Union and the R Street Institute, 57 percent of respondents were opposed to an online sales tax. Broken down by party affiliation 65 percent of Republicans, 56 percent of Independents, and 48 percent (to 43 percent) of Democrats were opposed.

So many state governors and their allies in the legislatures have coerced the retail lobby for help pushing (unsuccessfully) Congress to pass a law too unpopular for them to pass themselves.

The legislation is murderous for small mom-and-pop retailers that are not equipped to navigate the considerable red tape and audit threats from thousands of taxing jurisdictions around the country, and no cakewalk for their bigger competitors.

Should either online sales tax bill become law, online retailers will be faced with over 10,000 complicated tax codes, including 45 state sales taxes and local tax jurisdictions.

As the state legislators visit various Senate offices, don't be surprised to see big box retailers and small mom and pops right there with them. They are in a tight spot: help the politicians collect taxes across borders or see their own taxes go up.

What states really want is to use the Internet to stretch not only their taxes, but also their regulations over all state boarders. Then when the businesses in other states run afoul of one or more of the thousands of taxing jurisdictions they can look forward to countless audits and lawsuits, with no recourse to any elected official that needs their votes.

An online sales tax isn't about ""leveling the playing field"" or giving states taxes they need and deserve; it's about borderless expansion of state power.

Working on their own state's budget would be a much better use of a state legislator's time.",2,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/grover-norquist/beware-state-legislators-_b_8771628.html

The spending interests in Washington, D.C., live well spending your tax dollars on themselves. They whine every year about the Taxpayer Protection Pledge organized by Americans for Tax Reform.

The Pledge is a public, written, signed commitment by a candidate for office that he or she will oppose and vote against any tax increase.

The Pledge protects your paycheck from the spenders. The spenders don’t like that.

Most Republicans in Congress have signed the Pledge to their voters. And kept it.

Other politicians make secret promises to the special spending interests. They will not promise to leave you alone. Their promises are made in dark rooms to the government unions, contractors and recipients of tax dollars. They want more of your paycheck.

President Obama was very mad at the Pledge (and me) because he wanted at least $1.4 trillion in higher taxes in 2011. Republicans in Congress who had signed the Pledge to oppose tax hikes kept their word, stood firm and passed a budget that will reduce spending $1 trillion over the next decade.

American workers and families won. Washington spending interests lost. The Pledge helped make this possible.

Obama ran in 2008 promising, “No family making less than $250,000 a year will see any form of tax increase. Not your income tax, not your payroll tax, not your capital gains taxes, not any of your taxes.” It only took him two weeks to break that verbal promise. And then again at least seven times in the 20 taxes in Obamacare.

This is why taxpayers need such promises in writing. Do you remember the establishment press condemning Obama in 2009 and 2010 when he broke his word and raised taxes on the middle class? Neither do I. When George H.W. Bush broke his written pledge, he lost the presidency.

In a crisis, politicians will either reform the government to cost less or they can paper over the problems of the past with higher taxes.

They should tell us now which they plan to do. In writing.

456,Norquist,Grover,foxnews,"Just as the Bureau of Land Management “manages” much federal land, the National Telecommunication and Information Association “manages” federal spectrum, and the Federal Communications Commission “manages” the commercial use of spectrum, and they do not manage it well.

In a recent speech to the tech community, 2016 Republican presidential candidate, Florida Senator Marco Rubio emphasized that spectrum is “the highway for the digital age” that will drive our economy. The small amount of spectrum that is licensed for commercially is valued at $500 billion dollars and generates between $5 trillion and $10 trillion in consumer surplus.

Spectrum delivers our wireless communications, like broadcast television, AM/FM radio, WiFi and smartphone traffic, through the air. Our ever-increasing consumption of wireless data coupled with spectrum scarcity, makes it a cherished resource for companies that want to deliver wireless services.

According to CTIA, the Wireless Association, “while mobile data traffic in 2019 is projected to be six times what it was last year, we will not have six times the spectrum available to support that traffic.”

The spectrum crunch is real. The FCC has auctioned less than half of the 300 MHz it said was needed by 2015. The FCC’s own data traffic estimate accurately predicted data traffic in 2014, but it is not keeping up and federal agencies have no incentive to help.

Only 30 percent of “beachfront” spectrum bands are available exclusively to industry. That means there is about another 80 percent of quality spectrum unavailable for commercial use.

We need to more spectrum to market. There are plenty of buyers. The feds need an incentive.

Where is all the spectrum going? To government agencies. Surprise.

The economic value of the 645.5 Mhz of commercially licensed spectrum is valued at nearly $500 billion, reports the Brattle Group. This is an opportunity for the government to meet budget “shortfalls” without hammering taxpayers.

In order to realize these benefits two federal agencies need to clean some attics and hold a yard sale. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration, which manages federal spectrum use, must restructure and reclaim under-used spectrum -- “clean the attic.” Then let the Federal Communications Commission manage the commercial auctions -- “host the yard sale.”

The fed, of course, does not want to part ways with its gold, especially since this particular asset doesn’t have to show up on the balance sheet. That’s right: one of the most valuable limited resources we have, federal agencies do not have to account for in their budgets or report how they are using it.

Hard to believe, but in up until the 90s even commercial spectrum was awarded via lotteries and “comparative hearings,” commonly called “beauty pageants.”

We need to more spectrum to market. There are plenty of buyers. The feds need an incentive. Senator Rubio has the carrot/stick.

In the recently reintroduced the Wireless Innovation Act, S. 1618, the NTIA would determine the commercial value of federal spectrum and require that agencies report it as part of their budget costs. Spectrum would no longer be a hidden asset. If an agency keeps it, it is a cost. But if an agency “sells” spectrum, is it a gain? It should be.

While it isn’t in this bill, this is an opportunity for agencies, particularly the Department of Defense, to sell off underused resources to fund their agencies. If agencies had the ability to sell or share spectrum under their purview, we would see it come to market.

More spectrum on the market benefits Americans twofold. The “profits” should be used to reduce tax burdens and/or debt, and with more spectrum in market hands, Americans get more of the wireless services and innovations that they love.

Hard to believe, but in up until the 90s even commercial spectrum was awarded via lotteries and “comparative hearings,” commonly called “beauty pageants.” After all of the ineffective arbitrary awards, the 90s brought spectrum to the free-market via auctions rather than gifting it to the politically connected.

The FCC has held nearly 100 spectrum auctions that have raised over $100 billion to date. The FCC’s first large scale spectrum auction – Auction 4 – ended in March 1995, and netted $7 billion for two 15 Mhz blocks of spectrum known as Blocks A and B. A year later, in Auction 5, the agency netted $10 billion for the 30-Mhz C-block.

The most recent auction raised nearly $45 billion.

If only one-quarter of government spectrum could be reclaimed and sold off, the government could plausibly raise between $100 billion and $200 billion. Not chicken feed.",2,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/20/how-government-slows-down-your-mobile-phone.html
457,Norquist,Grover,huffingtonpost,"Every tax season, ""good government"" types and a compliant media trot out their evergreen stories about how wonderful it would be if the IRS prepared people's taxes for them. Implicit (sometimes not so implicit) in these stories is how evil corporations that sell tax preparation software are the only thing stopping this panacea from becoming a reality.



Conservatives, in particular, should see this ploy for what it clearly is: a money-grab by the government. Every third party that calls for IRS preparation of tax returns will readily tell you that it extracts more tax revenue for the government, and that this is a feature and not a bug.



That's the real reason the Left and the government class supports IRS-prepared tax returns: they want the government to be bigger, and that requires higher tax revenues. The fact that IRS tax preparation is understood by everyone to result in higher tax revenues exposes the conflict of interest that would be caused by IRS-prepared tax returns.



The IRS has one job, and one job only -- to collect taxes. It measures its success or failure in its ability to collect as much in taxes as possible. To ask the IRS to estimate the tax liability of a taxpayer is akin to asking an alcoholic how much they can have without crossing the line -- the answer will always be ""more."" To make the tax collector the tax preparer as well invites a clear conflict of interest on the part of the IRS.



To burst another bubble in this debate, poorer Americans and those with simple tax situations already have access to totally-free tax preparation that does not invite the conflict of interest described above.



Since 2003, sixteen private sector tax preparer companies have made their software available (free of charge) to taxpayers earning less than $57,000 per year (this number grows with inflation every year). All taxpayers have to do is go to IRS.gov, click on the ""Free File Program"" link, and they are on their way to getting their taxes done for free right on the IRS website. Do-it-yourselfers can also fill out forms directly on IRS.gov and send them directly into the agency.



In addition, there are 146 low-income taxpayer clinics sponsored by the IRS spread around the country. Anyone with income at less than 250 percent of the federal poverty line can resolve their back tax issues (most likely entirely for free) at these centers.



According to IRS data, the Free File Program and the Low Income Taxpayer Clinics provide completely free tax preparation and advice for 70 percent of taxpayers (100 million families) filing a tax return. This is all done completely free of charge for these families, and without resorting to the IRS preparing tax returns as a backdoor tax hike measure. To date, 37 million tax returns have used Free File, saving taxpayers over $129 million in IRS paper-filing costs and millions more in fees that would have been paid to tax prep companies.



What about the other 30 percent of taxpayers? In general, these taxpayers have increasingly-difficult tax returns that the IRS cannot accurately prepare, nor does the IRS claim that they can do so or would like to try. As income rises, complicating factors like side business income, portfolio income, rental properties, and itemized deductions come into play. The IRS, by their own admission, simply cannot prepare these people's taxes.



Taxpayers don't want the government preparing their tax returns. According to a report by the California Franchise Board, only 8 percent of eligible California taxpayers have chosen to have the state fill out their taxes for them (""Ready Return""). Greater than nine in ten eligible California families have said ""thanks, but no thanks"" to the government's offer to ""help.""



In sum, then, IRS tax preparation is a public policy solution in search of a public policy problem. Today, the bottom seven-tenths of income earners in America can get a completely free tax return prepared and have free legal tax advice. This is done because the tax preparation companies have already made their software available to most taxpayers for free--right on IRS.gov. The only taxpayers that need to pay for tax software are those whose returns have gotten too complex for the IRS to prepare in any event.



Tax preparation companies don't particularly want to be in the simple tax return business, anyway. It's the more complex tax returns that generate higher fees for them, and result in customers coming back year after year. They are happy to provide free tax preparation on IRS.gov using the Free File Program -- their real customer targets are higher up the income stream.



Furthermore, there's no evidence that the IRS has the competence or capacity to prepare returns even if they wanted to.



In the absence of a public policy problem, there is a motive instead. That motive is higher tax revenues. The media, and especially conservatives, should not fall for this ruse again this tax season.",2,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/grover-norquist/grover-norquist-taxes_b_3005698.html

I'm a conservative activist who thinks that we should execute murderers and in the case of violent criminals we should throw away the key. One thinks that goes without saying, but it's better to let folks know where I'm coming from.

On the other hand, my life's work has been about maximizing individual liberty. How should liberty-minded folks look at the criminal justice system, and how should we treat all the rest of the criminals who will come back to society sooner or later?

Draconian punishments for minor infractions, an ever-expanding prisoner population and a legal regime that allows authorities to seize property without a warrant are all slowly eroding the freedoms that the nation has come to expect. For years, lawmakers have focused almost exclusively on being ""tough on crime,"" all the while forgetting to get ""smart on crime.""

Even as crime rates across the country continue to fall, American prison populations have increased to levels not seen in any other developed country. Between 2000 and 2012 the national prison population shot up from 1.4 million to 1.6 million according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Of that number, 16% were incarcerated for non-violent drug-related charges.

Simply spending more money on prisons or locking more people up is not being ""tough on crime."" It's time to see our justice system for what it really is: a massive government expenditure that should be held accountable for the results it produces.

And if you think the police state is only concerned with landing people in prisons, you are mistaken. Uncle Sam has the power to confiscate your property without so much as a warrant, let alone a court conviction. And it is quite the revenue stream: Between state and local governments alone the amount of money confiscated has ballooned from $407 million in 2001 to $4.3 billion in 2012

Already states like Texas have taken steps to change their sentencing and incarceration practices to reduce prison populations, recidivism rates and crime rates. Reforms passed in 2007 have allowed Texas to reduce the amount of people in its jails, save upwards of $2 billion in construction costs, and decrease the crime rate to the lowest levels since 1968.

The New Mexico legislature, meanwhile, has unanimously passed a civil asset forfeiture bill that would create powerful protections for the state's citizens.

Wisconsin is now entering the debate. This is not some ungainly compromise cobbled together in the mushy middle. Rather, a diverse collection of legislators and groups — urban, conservative, rural, liberal, progressive and free-market — are coming together to develop strategies based on facts, not slogans.

Thanks to the leadership of Rep. Rob Hutton (R-Brookfield), Sen. Lena Taylor (D-Milwaukee), Sen. Jerry Petrowski (R-Marathon), Rep. Evan Goyke (D-Milwaukee) and Rep. Mandela Barnes (D-Milwaukee), the Second Chance Legislation is now being debated in Wisconsin. The measure would make sure that 17-year-old first-time offenders charged with minor crimes are prosecuted in the juvenile system.

My support springs from a fundamental belief that government programs should be evaluated on outputs. If we measure inputs we are thinking like 1980s liberals who measure welfare success by the budget of the program. The outputs of prosecuting adolescents as adults are notoriously bad. Repeated studies have found that adult prosecution makes a young person more likely to offend again and can turn non-violent offenders into violent ones.

If all Americans are to have faith in their system of justice, if our communities are to feel safe in the thought that the police are there only to serve and protect, if the rights of citizens are to be ensured then this mess has got to be cleaned up. Conservatives are finding strange bedfellows on the left fighting for criminal justice reform for a completely different set of reasons, and developing reforms based on facts, not slogans. Taxpayers and our families deserve better.

461,Norquist,Grover,huffingtonpost,"In Washington, D.C., Republican congressional majorities and the Democrat president's veto create an evenly matched contest where each party can thwart the efforts of the other. On major issues that are matters of principle for right and left, Obama will veto any Republican congressional initiative and the Republican congress will refuse to enact any substantial Obama policy goal.

But there has emerged an area of possible consensus and cooperation in Washington and the 50 state capitals: criminal-justice reform.

Why?

For years, conservatives assumed the police, prosecutors, and wardens were operating in the public interest. Not something conservatives assume about other parts of government. Conservatives measured inputs: how many prisons built and filled? Not outputs: is crime falling?

Conservatives laugh at those who equate spending more on ""education"" with actually educating children. And yet they made that -- spending more equals progress -- assumption in judging the criminal-justice system.

Something has changed. The costs of mass incarceration have grown. The number of laws -- 4,000 at the federal level -- has grown to where the adage ""ignorance of the law is no excuse"" is laughable. Violent crime has trended downward such that the issue is not ""too hot to handle.""

One proposal moving forward is a ""base-closing commission""-style law that would create a bipartisan commission to look at the 4,000 federal laws and suggest a number that duplicate state laws or should not exist at all and present them to congress. Unless the congress votes to reject the elimination of the, say, 200 or 300 laws that would be repealed. No one would vote to legalize carjacking: a federal crime already illegal in all 50 states under state law.

Some states and Washington are rethinking mandatory minimums that set long prison sentences for high-profile crimes. Some mandatory minimums appear driven by the desire of a politician to hold a press conference that shouts: ""message: I care.""

Technology now allows probation and parole officers to keep track of more convicted felons outside of expensive prison walls and allow fathers to live with their families and get to work every day and yet be ""watched"" for the period of their probation.

Restitution can sometimes replace incarceration. Drug courts may focus on those with drug dependency.

Laws that make it difficult or impossible for felons to work after a conviction should be examined to see if they are actually protecting citizens or simply creating barriers to reentry.

Prisons and courts should be more transparent to the public and judged not on how much is spent, but what is achieved.

462,Norquist,Grover,blogs,"Whether you like craft beer brewed in small batches or the mass-produced variety, the most costly ingredient that goes into every pint of beer in the United States is taxes. With federal, state and local levies, taxes make up, on average, more than 40 percent of the cost of beer purchased in the United States. In an effort to reduce the excessive tax bite, two competing bills have been proposed this month on Capitol Hill, along with legislation at the state level.

One proposed bill, the Small BREW Act, would, if passed, provide targeted federal excise-tax cuts for beer made by domestic brewers, with tax relief based on volume. This bipartisan bill would change the definition of a small brewer.

The federal government now levies a $7 tax on each of the first 60,000 barrels produced by small brewers. After that, the tax spikes to $18 a barrel. Businesses not defined as small brewers — those that produce more than 2 million barrels annually — must pay the $18 federal tax on every barrel they make.

The proposed bill, however, would halve the tax for small brewers on the first 60,000 barrels to $3.50 a barrel and redefine a small brewer as a business producing fewer than 6 million barrels a year, as opposed to the current 2-million barrel standard.

Senators Ben Cardin (D-Md.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) introduced this bill. It has 25 Senate sponsors from both parties.

A competing bill, the Fair BEER Act, would provide federal tax relief for brewers of all sizes that are headquartered both domestically and abroad. Brewers producing 7,143 barrels or less a year, which represents 90 percent of brewers — would be exempt from paying federal beer excise taxes.

Brewers who produce between 7,144 and 60,000 barrels would face a $3.50 a barrel excise tax. Production in excess of 60,000 and up to 2 million barrels would face a $16-a-barrel tax. An $18-a-barrel tax would apply to production beyond 2 million barrels.

This bill, introduced by Representatives Steve Womack (R-Ark.) and Ron Kind (D-Wis.) has 23 co-sponsors.

But not just lawmakers on Capitol Hill are looking to provide tax relief for beer drinkers. State legislators seek to reduce the excessive tax burden on suds. In addition to the federal excise tax, all 50 states apply punitive taxes on beer. Tennessee, for example, levies the highest excise tax on beer at $1.17 a gallon. Alaska comes in second, with a rate of $1.07 a gallon. Wyoming has the lowest beer excise tax, at $0.02 a gallon. Wisconsin and Missouri have the next lowest, at $0.06 a gallon.

Despite having the lowest beer excise tax, Wyoming state legislators are moving to get rid of their 2-cent-a-gallon beer excise tax, which was instituted in the 1930s. The Wyoming House of Representatives passed legislation at the end of January that repeals the state beer tax. The bill is now pending in the Wyoming Senate. The beer excise tax generates only $300,000 annually for the state.

“It was an archaic law from the Depression days tied to the gold standard,” Wyoming Representative Jim Allen (R), who voted in favor of the bill, told a local newspaper. “The majority thinking was removing it would be helpful to young, growing local breweries.”

The Wyoming repeal bill follows successful efforts in other states to promote the growing beer industry. In 2013, months after Republicans took full control of the North Carolina General Assembly and governor’s mansion for the first time in more than a century, state legislators passed the Growler Bill, which allows Tar Heel State retailers to sell growlers (64 oz. glass jugs) of beer. Before this reform, only breweries were able to sell growlers. Now, North Carolinians can fill up growlers at retailers like Whole Foods and Total Wine.

The same month that North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory (R) signed the Growler Bill, South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley (R) signed the Pint Bill, which permits Palmetto State breweries to sell up to 48 ounces of beer right from the tap.

Before this reform, South Carolina breweries were only allowed to sell 16 ounces of beer a customer, and that had to be served in four-ounce glasses. These strict rules had served as a major impediment to local brewers trying to attract customers to their onsite tasting rooms.

The beer industry contributes nearly $250 billion a year to the national economy, along with 2 million jobs. Federal and state lawmakers are wise to provide tax and regulatory relief to brewers, as well as beer lovers who ultimately bear the currently onerous tax burden on beer.

Beer-industry expansion in recent years has produced numerous business success stories and helped revitalize small towns like Kinston, North Carolina. Anything that lawmakers can do to get government out of the way of industry growth is a good thing for all Americans.",2,http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2015/02/19/beer-may-be-about-to-get-cheaper/
463,Norquist,Grover,usnews,"During his recent State of the Union address, President Barack Obama spent significant time listing a slew of economic indicators that have been on the upswing. ""Our unemployment rate is now lower than it was before the financial crisis. More of our kids are graduating than ever before; more of our people are insured than ever before,"" he said. ""We’ve seen the fastest economic growth in over a decade, our deficits cut by two thirds, a stock market that has doubled and health care inflation at its lowest rate in 50 years. There's good news people.""

Obama credited his administration's policies for the improvements, saying, ""Middle-class economics works, expanding opportunity works, and these policies will continue to work as long as politics don’t get in the way."" As U.S. News & World Report's Robert Schlesinger put it, the numbers give the GOP a ""prosperity problem,"" because the party's ""central message for the last six years has been that Obama’s nefarious socialism is on the verge of crashing the economy.""

One tactic has been to simply redirect credit for the good news toward Republicans in Congress. ""After so many years of sluggish growth, we’re finally starting to see some economic data that can provide a glimmer of hope,"" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. ""The uptick appears to coincide with the biggest political change of the Obama Administration’s long tenure in Washington: the expectation of a new Republican Congress."" Republican pollster David Winston took a similar tack, telling the New York Times, ""There’s a positive story to tell since Republicans took over the House, 9.6 million jobs created, the deficit cut in half, 98 percent of the Bush tax cuts locked in place. ... These are policies that Republicans have been able to put into place that clearly helped move the economy in the right direction.""

464,Norquist,Grover,usnews,"Though by no means a new idea, the flat tax is resurging as a possible alternative to the current tax code as many of the 2012 Republican presidential candidates have included a version in their economic plans. A flat tax is a single rate that spans all income brackets of taxpayers, rather than the current “progressive” system, which taxes higher-income individuals at increased rates and includes numerous deductions and exemptions. Under Herman Cain’s so-called 9-9-9 plan, Americans would pay a flat 9 percent rate on their personal incomes, corporate incomes, and on sales. Meanwhile, Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s so-called Cut, Balance and Grow would give taxpayers the choice to opt out of the current system and pay 20 percent on individual income while allowing for a few of the deductions in the current code. Proponents of the flat tax argue that it would simplify the tax code while broadening the tax base. Opponents say the flat tax would shift much of the revenue burden to middle- and lower-income Americans while lowering taxes on the wealthiest.

465,Norquist,Grover,blogs,"The Federal Communications Commission is in the middle of a high-stakes decision that could raise taxes for close to 90 percent of Americans. The commission is considering whether to reclassify broadband as a telecommunications service and, in doing so, Washington would trigger new taxes and fees at the state and local level.

The agency would like to make Internet service a public utility, placing broadband under Title II regulation of the Communications Act of 1934. This move would make broadband subject to New Deal-era regulation, and have significant consequences for U.S. taxpayers.

Under this decision to reclassify broadband, Americans would face a host of new state and local taxes and fees that apply to public utilities. These new levies, according to the Progressive Policy Institute (PPI), would total $15 billion annually. On average, consumers would pay an additional $67 for landline broadband, and $72 for mobile broadband each year, according to PPI’s calculations, with charges varying from state to state.

Proponents of broadband reclassification, including the left-of-center organization Free Press, claim that it would not result in higher taxes or fees. The recently extended Internet Tax Freedom Act, they assert, prohibits state and local taxation of Internet service. This is incorrect, however. The act does not apply to telecom-related fees.

Free Press and other broadband reclassification proponents also say the new taxes and fees can be prevented if the FCC designates broadband as an interstate service. A Progressive Policy Institute report explains why this also is incorrect:

“When the Commission previously considered the jurisdiction of Internet traffic, it determined that such traffic was ‘largely interstate,’ but ‘jurisdictionally mixed.’ States routinely tax jurisdictionally mixed services that are classified as ‘interstate’ for purposes of regulation. For example, wireless services may not be regulated by state public utility commissions, but they are subject to a host of state and local taxes and fees. In several states, interstate wireless revenues are subject to taxation.”

Late last year, President Barack Obama waded into this contentious debate. He called for the Internet to be treated like a public utility. Critics of Obama’s position point out this would reduce investment in infrastructure and lead to inferior service for consumers. Reclassifying broadband as a telecommunications service would also stifle innovation and restrict the openness of the Internet.

The telecommunications industry has invested more than $1.2 trillion on broadband infrastructure since 1996. As a result, roughly 87 percent of Americans have access to broadband. It would be foolish for government to discourage the significant investment required to maintain, expand and improve this infrastructure by subjecting broadband to circa 1930s regulation. Subjecting Internet service providers to such onerous rules would depress innovation and penalize Web users.

Not only would higher taxes and fees leave individuals, families, and employers with less disposable income, a wealth of research indicates it would be bad for the economy.

John Hood, former president of the John Locke Foundation, found that keeping state and local tax and regulatory burdens as low as possible fosters economic growth, when he analyzed 681 peer-reviewed academic journal articles going back to 1990.

“Most studies find,” Hood stated, “that lower levels of taxes and spending, less-intrusive regulation…correlate with stronger economic performance.”

Tax Foundation economist William McBride reviewed academic literature going back three decades and found, “While there are a variety of methods and data sources, the results consistently point to significant negative effects of taxes on economic growth even after controlling for various other factors such as government spending, business cycle conditions and monetary policy.”

In McBride’s survey of 26 studies, dating to 1983, he found “all but three of those studies, and every study in the last 15 years, find a negative effect of taxes on growth.”

The Federal Communications Commission is expected to make its decision early this year. After the more than 20 tax increases signed into law during Obama’s six years in office, the last thing American taxpayers need is a gusher of new taxes and fees triggered by bureaucrats in Washington.

466,Norquist,Grover,blogs,"Religious extremism could derail Myanmar’s much-vaunted reform process, the Buddhist-majority country’s first Catholic cardinal, Charles Maung Bo, said on Tuesday.

Bo, who was named a cardinal by Pope Francis on Jan. 4, warned that Buddhist nationalism directed against minority Muslims could drive the latter to connect with international extremist groups that would “retaliate”.

“So far they have been more on the quiet side, but if they come with the force of an international community of Muslims, then violence, terrorism, suicide bombers and all these things could happen,” Bo told Reuters in an interview at the red-brick cathedral in downtown Yangon, Myanmar’s largest city.

Bo called for mutual understanding and urged the government to do more to curb hate speech by radical monks.

Myanmar emerged in 2011 from half a century of military rule, and the semi-civilian government has lifted curbs on freedoms of speech, association and media.

But the reforms have been accompanied by a rise in Buddhist nationalism, with monks forming groups aimed at promoting the country’s Buddhist character.

The main target of the Buddhist nationalist movement has been the country’s Muslims, who account for about 5 percent of a population of 51 million.

Sectarian violence since June 2012 has killed at least 240 people, mostly Muslims, while almost 140,000 Muslims remain in displacement camps after their homes were destroyed.

Myanmar is also racked by conflicts with ethnic insurgents, who have been battling the government for autonomy, some for six decades. The government is pushing for a national ceasefire pact this year, but the peace process has faltered, with sporadic clashes.

Bo said he was optimistic about Myanmar’s reform process, but warned that the military could again seize control if the peace process failed and sectarian violence continued.

“We hope that chaos won’t happen,” he said, calling on the military to make greater efforts to build trust with ethnic armed groups, and for more monks to speak out against extremism.

“For peace in the country the Buddhist monks also have quite a major role to play too,” said Bo, leader of Myanmar’s Catholics, who make up just about 1.6 percent of the population.

Francis appointed 20 new cardinals, 15 of whom will be eligible to vote for the next pope. It was the first time cardinals from Myanmar, Tonga and Cape Verde were appointed and the appointees from all three nations are electors.

467,Norquist,Grover,blogs,"Top-selling German tabloid Bild and 50 prominent Germans called on Tuesday for an end to what they see as rising xenophobia, a day after thousands of protesters in several German cities rallied against Muslim immigration.

Monday’s rallies, organised by a new grassroots movement called PEGIDA, or Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the West, have become a weekly event in the eastern city of Dresden.

Some 18,000 people, the biggest number so far, turned out in Dresden but similar rallies in Berlin and the western city of Cologne were heavily outnumbered by counter-protesters who accuse PEGIDA of fanning racism and intolerance.

Bild published a ‘No to PEGIDA’ appeal on Tuesday, covering the front page and a double page spread on page 2 and 3 with quotes from the 50 politicians and celebrities.

“(They) are saying ‘no’ to xenophobia and ‘yes’ to diversity and tolerance,” Bild’s deputy editor, Bela Anda, wrote in a commentary. “We should not hand over our streets to hollow rallying cries.”

In Dresden, the PEGIDA protesters waved Germany’s black, red and gold flag and brandished posters bearing slogans such as “Against religious fanaticism and every kind of radicalism”.

One poster in Cologne called for “potatoes rather than doner kebabs”, a swipe at ethnic Turks who at around three million represent Germany’s largest immigrant community.

Germany has some of the world’s most liberal asylum rules, partly due to its Nazi past. The number of asylum seekers arriving in Germany, many from the Middle East, jumped to around 200,000 last year — four times as many as in 2012.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel has urged Germans to shun the anti-Muslim protesters, saying their hearts are full of hatred and argued that hostility towards foreigners has no place in Germany..

In Cologne, home to a large Muslim population, there were 10 times as many counter-demonstrators as PEGIDA protesters. In similarly multi-ethnic Berlin, some 5,000 counter-demonstrators swamped around 400 anti-Muslim protesters, local police said.

Cologne Cathedral and Berlin’s Brandenburg Gate switched off their lights to protest against the rallies.

PEGIDA has nonetheless shaken Germany’s political establishment which some say could help the Eurosceptic party Alternative for Germany (AfD). But the AfD, dogged by internal power struggle, is split over how to deal with the movement.

Bild’s campaign drew current and former politicians, celebrities and businessmen.

“(PEGIDA) appeals to hollow prejudices, xenophobia and intolerance,” wrote former Social Democrat Chancellor Helmut Schmidt. “A look at our past and economic sense tells us Germany should not spurn refugees and asylum seekers,” he added.

Others included Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, rock star Udo Lindenberg, 76-year old pop star Heino and former German soccer captain Oliver Bierhoff.

The idea that taxpayers have to ""pay for"" tax reductions implies a Brezhnev Doctrine for the size of government: Total taxation can never go down, only up. Taxpayers reject that claim on our lives by the state.

A better question is why the politicians — every time they want to spend on a new program — should not have to cut an old program by the same dollar amount.

Most of the tax reduction in the ""extenders"" package is simple expensing of business investment. That is good, pro-growth policy that should be made permanent.

Since 1981, Congress has played a game by passing a two-year research and experimentation tax credit. Other useful (and some more political) tax cuts were attached to the package of repeatedly extended ""temporary"" tax reductions. Hence the name: ""extenders.""

Every two years, Congress would extend the package after extorting goodies from the administration and/or campaign contributions from the threatened industries.

If all the provisions were extended for the next 10 years — as they have been for the past 30 years — nothing would change from present policy.

If the extenders are allowed to lapse, taxpayers would pay $45 billion more over the next decade.

The bulk of the extenders are very good policy: the ""bonus depreciation"" to increase investment, the tax credits for research and experimentation, and small business expensing of asset purchases.

Other good ideas will prevent higher taxes on ordinary families: the ability to deduct state and local sales taxes, tuition and fees, and classroom expenses for teachers. They should also be made permanent.

The corporate welfare ""tax cut"" for wind power should lapse. This is a targeted political payoff that is not about creating jobs or growth, but about harvesting political donors.

Making the pro-growth extenders permanent will give businesses certainty in planning investment, avoid the loss of jobs and growth that higher taxes would bring, and end the political game of holding temporary tax hikes hostage. Politicians should not raise taxes as part of a return to honest accounting and an end to playing games with the tax code.

469,Norquist,Grover,washingtontimes,"ANALYSIS/OPINION:

We won our independence as a nation with 3 million Americans. Today we are the freest, richest and most powerful nation in the world with more than 300 million Americans. Immigration made us strong. Powerful. Economically dynamic. Growing.

If we were limited to just those born of the 3 million, we would never have filled the continent. Never become strong enough to stand alone and free. Immigration built this nation. Is this nation.

What is America? Are we all adherents of one religion? No. There is no state church, temple or mosque. Are we one race or ethnicity like the Germans or Greeks? Never. Not now and not from the start when people from many nations filled the 13 Colonies.

America is a people of the book, the Constitution. Your passport to being an American is your commitment to liberty and the government structures designed by the Constitution to protect that liberty.

Every generation has had its failure to recognize this. The president of the United States, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, once told Leo Crowley, a Catholic, “Leo, this is a Protestant country, and the Catholics and the Jews are here on sufferance. It is up to both of you (he was referring also to Henry Morgenthau, his Jewish secretary of the Treasury) to go along with anything that I want at this time.” Roosevelt was very wrong.

All names are American names.

Everyone agrees that immigration made America great, prosperous and strong. Our great-grandparents may have whined about the newest immigrants, but our grandparents and parents married them, and they are us and we are them. We know America was blessed by the wave of immigrants “back then.” Yet some with 20/20 hindsight cannot see the future unfolding ahead of us.

Not too long ago, we were told that Japan was No. 1. America’s best days were behind her. Now we hear that China will soon pass us by. Nonsense. Because we do immigration better than other nations, we control our destiny. Japan and Germany are already declining in population. Culturally, they do not do immigration well. Failure to welcome immigration is a stunting disease in any nation. China has many people today, but it decided to enforce a one-child-per-couple policy and for cultural reasons does not absorb immigrants well. Other nations might welcome immigrants, but they are not governed in a way that makes them the preferred destinations for most immigrants.

The best talent in the world would like to work in America. The hardest-working young men and women see their best futures with us. Kind of like our grandparents. Immigrants will tell you America did them a great favor by accepting them. Looking back, we know the immigrants, their hard work and dedication, and their children were gifts to our nation and its future. They manned our armed forces and filled our engineering schools and science labs.

Once again, the American people are debating how many immigrants we should welcome. Polls show that majorities of Republicans, Democrats and Americans at large support comprehensive immigration reform and see immigration as a net benefit to our nation. Yet some loud voices confuse some in the media. The labor unions and radical environmentalists and zero population growth advocates have argued that more people would make us poorer. But America knows that people are resources, not costs. Men and women produce as well as consume. We celebrate births and mourn at funerals.

America alone could decide next year to bring 1 million engineers to our shores or 1 million 20-year-olds filled with energy and love of liberty. There are many sources of energy. We can drill and frack for oil and natural gas here in America or we can leave the oil underground as President Obama and congressional Democrats have demanded in Alaska and off our coasts. Immigrants can join our nation and make us stronger, or our immigration laws can strand them overseas in nations whose laws and traditions keep them from prospering and producing.

It is time to reform our immigration laws step by step or in one comprehensive package. Mr. Obama and Democrats in Congress have a problem. They spent 2009 and 2010 with supermajorities in the House and Senate and did nothing to reform immigration. The union bosses stopped them as they did in 2007 when Robert Novak reported that Sen. Obama was their messenger, telling the Senate that President Bush’s immigration reform was dead.

Immigration reform is an easier call for Republicans. The communities of faith, the business community and registered Republicans at the grass-roots level all support comprehensive reform. The Southern Baptists, the Mormon Church, the Catholic Church and the Jewish groups are in. So are the Chamber of Commerce, the farmers, ranchers, dairy owners, and high-tech, small and large companies. Pro-lifers know that people are assets, not liabilities. Free-market Republicans know that more people produce more wealth.

The time to win the future is now.

470,Norquist,Grover,blogs,"After the GOP’s midterm-elections sweep, the Republican Party holds more U.S. House seats and controls more state houses than at any time since 1928. Having reached this goal, the GOP now needs to look for a 2016 presidential nominee to match this success.

President Calvin Coolidge, who sat in the Oval Office from 1923 to 1929, would be a smart model for the party. He reined in spending and reduced tax rates at a time when it was as needed as it is today. President Ronald Reagan admired Coolidge so much that he hung a portrait of the 30th president in his Cabinet Room.

One talked-about possible 2016 presidential candidate who shares many of Coolidge’s policy bona fides is Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who won his third statewide race in four years on Nov. 4. The two men have so much in common that it is worth seeing what Coolidge’s experience can tell us about a potential President Walker.

Coolidge took office at an extraordinary period in U.S. history. During his presidency, America advanced from a nation in which the horse and buggy was one of the most efficient methods of travel in many places to one filled with Model T drivers honking at one another to move it. The advent and popularization of modern appliances like electric washing machines allowed women of the 1920s to get out of the house.

Coolidge rose to national prominence largely because of his actions during the 1919 Boston Police Strike. Coolidge was governor of Massachusetts, and he stood down police union bosses to put an end to the strike. He offered a sharp contrast to then-President Woodrow Wilson, silent and timid on an issue of national importance.

Coolidge’s limited-government approach made for both good policy and good politics — it fueled a stunning prosperity. Economic expansion under Coolidge was rapid, with the gross national product rising roughly 4.2 percent a year from 1920 to 1929, as Marquette University’s Gene Smiley explained in an Economic History Association report. This is impressive growth by 19th-, 20th-and 21st-century standards.

A standoff with powerful bosses of government-employee unions is also what thrust Walker onto the national stage. The 2011 labor reforms that Walker championed and eventually signed into law sparked riotous protests in Madison. It cost $11 million to repair the damage done by union protesters at Wisconsin’s capitol building, considered to have one of the most aesthetically beautiful domes in the United States.

Republicans now have total control of 30 state legislatures — their largest advantage since Coolidge lived in the White House. The government reform and tax-relief measures enacted by Walker and other GOP governors are a big reason for this electoral success. Walker has made clear that more income tax cuts and creating a more competitive business-tax climate in the Badger State are among his top priorities for his second term. Coolidge did that at the federal level — and demonstrated the economic dividends that tax cuts can produce.

Veronique de Rugy of the Mercatus Center at George Mason University laid out the success of these Coolidge tax cuts. From a high of 73 percent, the top rate was reduced to 46 percent in 1924, and then was brought down to 24 percent by the time Coolidge left office.

Walker has adopted the Coolidge tax model, chipping away at his state income-tax rates. He talks about eliminating Wisconsin’s income tax during his second term. He has asked his lieutenant governor, Rebecca Kleefisch, to hold tax-reform roundtables across the state. Given that tax reform is usually the most politically difficult undertaking for lawmakers, Walker is astute in getting constituent buy-in ahead of time.

The day after the 2014 midterms, the national punditry was ready to focus on the 2016 presidential contest. Coolidge’s record and how it compares to what Walker has done in Wisconsin make a strong case for his name to be on the short list of GOP contenders.

471,Norquist,Grover,huffingtonpost,"The North Carolina Senate race is already the most expensive Senate contest in U.S. history. Driving up the already exorbitant cost of this race is a ""libertarian"" named Sean Haugh. Haugh is a pizza deliveryman who has been touting his support for legal marijuana and his love for craft beer as though those give him limited government bona fides.

As it would happen, Haugh is no conservative - he's not even remotely libertarian. Haugh is a liberal and a man of the left; don't take my work for it, just look at his positions.

Haugh is open to higher taxes. Not only did Thom Tillis, the Republican nominee, pass one of the most pro-growth tax relief packages ever to come out of any state, he has committed to oppose efforts to raise federal taxes if elected to the U.S. Senate. Haugh, in contrast, refuses to make such a commitment to North Carolina taxpayers.



Haugh is for expanding Medicaid under Obamacare. As The Weekly Standard reported this week, Haugh is a huge fan of Obamacare's Medicaid expansion:

""The rejection of the Medicaid expansion dollars--which on the surface you could kind of make a libertarian case for--but the end users have suffered. It's ended up in closing the rural hospitals,"" Haugh said. ""They made a political issue out of it and forgot about who they served. Republicans are happy to throw grandma out into the street.""

Haugh wants to funnel even more taxpayer dollars to teachers' union bosses. Again, as Haugh complained to The Weekly Standard:



""The teachers didn't get a raise for five years,"" Haugh said. ""I don't think this is something that either side can be proud of. I think Hagan is vulnerable because when she was serving in the general assembly, in order to balance the budget she cut a lot of areas of education.""

First of all, Haugh is wrong on the facts. K-12 spending has gone up every year that Thom Tillis has been speaker. Worse than being wrong on the facts, Haugh buys into the leftwing myth that higher spending improves education. As noted in a Wall Street Journal op-ed today:

""The U.S. spent $12,608 per student in 2010--more than double the figure, in inflation-adjusted dollars, spent in 1970--and spending on public elementary and secondary schools has surpassed $600 billion. How's that working out? Adjusted state SAT scores have declined on average 3% since the 1970s, as the Cato Institute's Andrew Coulson found in a March report.""

If all of that weren't enough to turn off limited government voters, his Twitter handle is @EmperorSean.",2,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/grover-norquist/nc-voters-beware-libertar_b_6083224.html
472,Norquist,Grover,reason,"This article is part of a series on the libertarian vote in the 2014 midterm election. Here's the first set of arguments from Democrats, Libertarians, Republicans. Read today's alternative perspectives from the other parties here and here.

You only have one vote. How best to use it to advance liberty?

A libertarian preparing to vote in a House or Senate race this November that features three candidates, a Republican, a Democrat and a Libertarian must make a decision.

Will voting for the Libertarian candidate add one more vote for a losing candidate that may win one or two or five percent of the vote and thereby convince America of the strength of the libertarian movement and the power of its ideas? Will the newscasters announce the libertarian vote and muse on how it grew from one percent to two percent? Maybe.

If the Democrat Senate candidate in North Carolina or Virginia wins by a narrow margin because several hundred or thousands of liberty voters voted for the libertarian third party candidate rather than the Republican Senate candidate how will this be understood by the media and by the national electorate? Will the media announce that the Democrat victories are actually a demonstration of the growing strength of the libertarian movement? Or will they argue the nation voted for big government? What message does your ""message"" vote send?

Richard Tisei, the gay pro-liberty Republican candidate for the House of Representatives in the 6th congressional district in Massachusetts lost by 3,650 votes in 2012. The libertarian candidate, Dan Fishman, won 16,668 votes. The winner, Democrat John Tierney was a consistent vote for statism for his entire career and the past two years. He just lost his primary to a young self-described ""progressive"" whom Joe Biden just went to Massachusetts to endorse; fortunately Tisei is running again. This time the Libertarians have decided not to field a candidate; in fact, Fishman is supporting Tisei, who may win this November. What lesson did Massachusetts libertarians learn from 2012?

In 2006, Montana's Republican Senator Conrad Burns lost to his Democrat opponent Tester by 3,562 votes. The Libertarian Candidate Stan Jones captured 10,377 votes. Tester's win meant that Obama had 60 votes in December 2009 and could pass Obamacare. That one vote passed a bill designed to fail into single-payer over time. Did the ""too cool for school"" libertarians advance liberty when they voted that day?

""But I want to advance liberty as rapidly and as powerfully as possible. Isn't voting for the Libertarian candidate sending a stronger signal that there is a real demand in the electorate for greater liberty than voting for the 'lesser of two evils' Republican?""

Well who is getting this message? When you watch the TV commentators on election night the tally they put up on the board is either, one, Republicans win and the nation wants lower taxes and spending and an end to Obamacare or two, Democrats win the Senate and the nation wants Obama's growing government. We don't get to write the script.

Liberty activists should remember that voting is only one political act. Speaking with your siblings, co-workers, neighbors, children and parents provides daily opportunities to advance liberty and multiply the voice and power of the liberty movement. Call your grandparents. Speak with the waitress. Don't whine that Republican candidates do not talk about liberty. You talk about liberty to everyone who will listen. Whining about other people is not work. It is whining. The struggle against statism is a great deal of work and the only person you control is you. Be the calm, coherent voice for liberty you wish the Republican candidate for Senate was.

Hollywood producer Sam Goldwyn used to tell writers, ""If you want to send a message, use Western Union."" Not every political message had to be jammed into ""his"" movie. Liberty activists know that the Internet now allows us to share tweets, Instagram pics, Facebook posts, simple e-mails, and whatever was invented last week and I haven't heard of yet.

I would argue that if the election is close or might be close the smart move is to vote for the Republican. The corollary of that is that if a particular election is not close—and every election day has a number of elections at the same time (congress, Senate, state legislature, governor, mayor)—then ""send a signal"" with a vote for the Libertarian. And if you are a potential libertarian candidate, organize your campaigns so that you can honestly look any liberty voter in the eye and accurately assert that there is no opportunity cost of casting a ""message"" vote for you on this particular ballot this year.",2,http://reason.com/archives/2014/10/30/voting-republican-is-the-smart-choice-fo
473,Norquist,Grover,huffingtonpost,"Seniors don't need a calendar to know that the 2014 elections are just around the corner. The Democrats' desperate shouts that Republicans want to destroy Medicare are as predictable as autumn's falling leaves.

The irony here is that the ""War on Seniors"" is actually being waged by President Obama and his Congressional allies. It was Democrats who cut $716 billion from Medicare to pay for Obamacare, much of it coming from the popular Medicare Advantage program which gives seniors choice in how they receive their Medicare benefits. The President was so worried about his own re-election in 2012 in places like Florida that he used executive authority to blunt the effect of those cuts until after his re-election.

The Obamacare law also created an unelected panel known as ""IPAB"" whose sole job is to cut Medicare payments to providers which will inevitably lead to rationing of services to current and future seniors.

Most recently, Obama and his allies have directed their war on seniors to Medicare Part D, the popular prescription drug benefit in Medicare. Relying on free market principles, Part D allows providers to compete with one another to deliver drug benefits to seniors. This competition has driven down prices and saved money for both seniors and the Medicare Trust Fund. Premiums for seniors average about $31 per month (far below the $56 originally forecast) and the cost to Medicare is more than 40% under budget.

Putting the power in the hands of seniors to choose a Part D plan that suits their needs has also resulted in satisfaction rates above 90%, unheard of for most government programs.

The successful free market ""beachhead"" in Medicare that Part D represents is anathema to command and control liberals. It's downright embarrassing to have a well-functioning part of Medicare existing alongside the hulking failure that the traditional Medicare system has become for younger workers.

Liberals have tried to undermine Part D by imposing ""rebates"" (Translation: price controls) similar to the failed Medicaid system. When the Republican House blocked the imposition of price controls, the Obama administration attempted through rulemaking to limit the number of plans from which seniors could choose. It was painful to watch CMS Director Tavenner's paternalistic argument before Congress that seniors somehow were not capable of deciding what was best for them. Former Congressional Budget Office Director Douglas Holtz-Eakin pointed out in an American Action Forum report that if the rule was put into place more than 14 million seniors would lose the Part D plan they voluntarily chose and are happy with.

Congressional Democrats faced with the prospect of cancellation notices going out to seniors just before the mid-term elections balked and joined Republicans and urged the withdrawal of the rule. The Obama administration backed down, at least until after the election.

Republican candidates under attack in the perennial Medi-Scare campaign would be wise to remind seniors of just who is waging this War on Seniors. And the next time their opponents start talking about the Republicans' ""voucher plan"" for Medicare, they should remind seniors that their plan for reform (which by the way is voluntary - seniors or younger workers can continue to choose traditional Medicare) is nothing more than an extension of the competition and choice seniors now enjoy with Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D. And there is nothing scary in that.",2,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/grover-norquist/dems-scaring-seniors-on-m_b_6062770.html
474,Norquist,Grover,politico,"Nancy Reagan began consulting Quigley after the assassination attempt on her husband. Reagan astrologer, Joan Quigley, dies

SAN FRANCISCO — Joan Quigley, the astrologer who helped determine President Ronald Reagan's schedule and claimed to have convinced him to soften his stance toward the Soviet Union, has died at the age of 87.

Quigley died Oct. 21 at her San Francisco home after an unspecified illness, the San Francisco Chronicle, quoting Quigley's sister, Ruth, said Friday.

Nancy Reagan began consulting Quigley after the 1981 assassination attempt on her husband. She wanted to keep him from getting shot again, Nancy Reagan wrote in her 1989 memoir, ""My Turn.""

Entertainer Merv Griffin had told her that Quigley had predicted that the day the president was shot was going to be a dangerous one for him.

Quigley would go on to advise Nancy Reagan on dates for presidential trips and news conferences.

The president became aware of the consultations and warned his wife to be careful because it might look odd if it came out, Nancy Reagan wrote in her book.

""If it makes you feel better, go ahead and do it,"" she quoted the president as saying.

The consultations were revealed to great embarrassment for the White House in a 1988 book by former White House chief of staff Donald Regan, who blamed the first lady for his ouster a year earlier. Regan said almost every major move and decision the Reagans made during his time as chief of staff was cleared in advance with a woman in San Francisco who drew up horoscopes. He did not know her identity.

The woman was in fact Joan Quigley, an heiress and Republican political activist. Quigley told The Associated Press in 1988 after her identity was revealed that she was a ""serious, scientific astrologer.""

""I am really not one of these clowns, and I really don't like this circus atmosphere,"" she said.

A call Friday to Joanne Drake, a representative of The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation, for comment on Quigley's death was not immediately returned. The foundation was created by President Reagan and manages his library and museum in Simi Valley, California.

Both the president and Nancy Reagan denied that any policies or decisions were based on astrology.

But Quigley told a different story in her 1990 memoir, ""What Does Joan Say?""

Before Reagan's 1985 summit with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in Geneva, Quigley said she advised Nancy Reagan that ""Ronnie's 'evil empire' attitude has to go.""

""Gorbachev's Aquarian planet is in such harmony with Ronnie's, you'll see ... They'll share a vision,"" she recalled telling the first lady.

475,Norquist,Grover,politico,"Alexander is expected to breeze to reelection in Tennessee in his race. | AP Photos King endorses Alexander

Independent Maine Sen. Angus King, who caucuses with Democrats, is endorsing Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander for reelection.

The endorsement will have little effect on the electoral map — Alexander is expected to breeze to reelection in Tennessee in his race versus Democrat Gordon Ball — but it comes amid speculation on King’s political future. He has declined to say which party he will caucus with next year.

Meanwhile, King has been an active political player this year, endorsing Democrats, independents and Republicans — though Alexander is certainly more conservative than Sens. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine), House hopeful Emily Cain, a Democrat, and Maine gubernatorial candidate Eliot Cutler, an independent. Similarly, King leans further to the left than other Alexander supporters like Newt Gingrich and Mike Huckabee.

( POLITICO's 2014 race ratings)

King called Alexander “the kind of person who we absolutely need” in the Senate and praised him as a listener and problem solver. The two have worked together on student loan issues, and the endorsement came after a Nashville event on education.

“As a conservative senator who focuses not just on making a speech but also getting a result, I am glad to have the support of an independent like Sen. King who has a reputation of doing the same,” Alexander said.

King and Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) have been the subject of much speculation — mostly among Republicans — about whether there might be caucus switching if Republicans take the Senate. The topic causes much eye-rolling among Senate Democrats.

( Full 2014 election results)

“The Republican Party is not a growth market now or for the foreseeable future,” said one Democratic aide. “If the Senate is narrowly divided either way next year, the odds will be strongly in favor of Democrats taking back the majority in 2016, given the map.”

When asked during a lengthy interview about whether he’d consider switching caucuses, Manchin said he’d “never thought about” switching and that doing so would require a change in “your whole philosophical beliefs.” He’s been hitting the trail hard for vulnerable Democrats like Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana and Rep. Nick Rahall of West Virginia — but he also strongly criticized Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) in a September interview for not allowing more votes on amendments.

“Harry needs to let us vote. I’m not saying anything to you that I haven’t said to Harry,” Manchin said, hastening to add of the Republican leader: “Mitch doesn’t make it any easier, trust me.”",2,http://www.politico.com/story/2014/10/angus-king-lamar-alexander-endorsements-112191.html

477,Norquist,Grover,theguardian,"What is Burning Man?

It is a larger version of ... what? Woodstock? That was a bunch of teenagers coming to watch artists perform. At Burning Man, everyone is expected to be a participant. Burners bring their art work, their art cars, their personal dress and/or undress: everyone is on stage. The story of Woodstock was thousands of young people, without the sense to bring their own food and water, being rescued by the state police and sensible bourgeois rural folks. The story of Burning Man is one of radical self-reliance.

It is a more intense than ... what? Not quite the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. Burning Man is an arts festival in the middle of the Nevada desert. It takes hours to get there, and you must bring what you eat or wear or need: you cannot buy anything there. Burning Man is more like Brigadoon – a western ghost town that springs to life. Dust storms. Cold nights. Black Rock City is completely built and then taken apart and disappeared each year, by 65,000 people.

Burning Man is greater than I had ever imagined. I have been to large demonstrations in favor of the environment, and the trash left behind is knee-deep. At Burning Man, you are hard-pressed to find a cigarette butt on the ground. There are no trash bins. Participants carry it in, and they carry it out. I have been to the Louvre. It is a very big place with many nice paintings. I knew that. I was not disappointed. Burning Man is more like Petra, the lost city in Jordan, which I found more impressive than its advance billing or reputation.

My wife and I had planned to join the “event” in 2012, but some idiot scheduled the Republican National Convention in Tampa for the same week. I objected, but the overlapping bit of the Venn diagram of Burners and Mitt Romney enthusiasts was perhaps not as large as I had thought.

Some self-professed “progressives” whined at the thought of my attending what they believed was a ghetto for liberal hippies. Yes, there was a gentleman who skateboarded without elbow or kneepads – or any knickers whatsover. Yes, I rode in cars dressed-up as cats, bees and spiders; I watched trucks carrying pirate ships and 30 dancers. I drank absinthe. But anyone complaining about a Washington wonk like me at Burning Man is not a Burner himself: The first principle of Burning Man is “radical inclusiveness”, which pretty much rules out the nobody-here-but-us liberals “gated community” nonsense.

Before my wife and I arrived in Nevada last week, we were showered with kind comments from Burners disassociating themselves from the idea that Burning Man belongs to any political camp. Indeed, I found political allies who gave me wonderful advice – they had been participating for years.

A community that comes together with a minimum of “rules” demands self-reliance – that everyone clean up after themselves and help thy neighbor. Some day, I want to live 52 weeks a year in a state or city that acts like this. I want to attend a national political convention that advocates the wisdom of Burning Man.

I was invited to speak to a group one night for an hour. Moments before I spoke, I was told that I was the last speaker in a series focusing on psychedelic drugs. My talk was on freedom. I left untouched the cup of coffee and opened soda at my side. The questions lasted two hours. We had a ball.

Looking at the effort behind each camp – each art car, each public art display and sculpture – I was reminded, à la The Princess Bride, that this word “bohemian”: I do not think it means what you think it means.

One sculpture was the three-story “Embrace” – two upper torsos and heads facing each other. They took two years to create. Three weeks to assemble in the middle of nowhere. Maybe an hour to burn on Friday morning. This is hard work. Indeed, there is entirely too much work involved at Burning Man for lazy people to get to the Playa, nevermind build a camp or feed yourself.

You hear that Burning Man is full of less-than-fully-clad folks and off-label pharmaceuticals. But that’s like saying Bohemian Grove is about peeing on trees or that Chicago is Al Capone territory. Burning Man is cleaner and greener than a rally for solar power. It has more camaraderie and sense of community than a church social. And for a week in the desert, I witnessed more individual expression, alternative lifestyles and imaginative fashion than .... anywhere.

The demand for self-reliance at Burning Man toughens everyone up. There are few fools, and no malingerers. People give of themselves – small gifts like lip balm or tiny flashlights. I brought Cuban cigars. Edgy, but not as exciting as some “gifts” that would have interested the federal authorities.

I’m hoping to bring the kids next year.

On my last day of my first Burning Man, at the Reno airport, a shoeless man (he had lost his shoes in the desert) was accosted by another dust-covered Burner carrying sneakers: “Take these,” he said. “They are my Burning Man shoes.” The shoeless man accepted the gift with dignity.",2,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/02/my-first-burning-man-grover-norquist
478,Norquist,Grover,blogs,"Valentine’s Day is a time when couples go out for romantic dinners and exchange gifts, while singles meet up in bars, hoping to make some bad decisions. Valentine’s Day is also a day when people with crazy ex-boyfriends or -girlfriends are reminded of how thankful they are for anti-stalking laws.

Every state has made stalking a crime. These laws help protect people who might otherwise live in fear. Yet labor unions have successfully, and disconcertingly, lobbied to be exempt from anti-stalking laws in at least four states – California, Pennsylvania, Illinois and Nevada.

“The most glaring examples of union favoritism under state laws,” notes a 2012 U.S. Chamber of Commerce report, “tend to occur in criminal statutes and allow individuals who engage in truly objectionable behavior to avoid prosecution solely because they are participating in some form of labor activity.”

Pennsylvania unions now enjoy a loophole that the state’s anti-stalking law “shall not apply to conduct by a party to a labor dispute.” In Illinois, anti-stalking laws exempt “any controversy concerning wages, salaries, hours, working conditions or benefits … the making of collective bargaining agreements.”

These exemptions prove that organizing tactics used by unions can have something in common with those of stalkers – and can perhaps inflict similar emotional distress.

While a number of states have exemptions that have allowed union members to intimidate and harass, California is by far the worst actor. As in other states, it is a crime in California to interfere with a lawful business through physical obstruction or intimidation of workers or customers.

Yet California has exempted unions from this law. The negative effects were clear in 2008, when United Food and Commercial Workers Union members picketed a new Ralph’s grocery store in Fresno. They went beyond traditional picketing, harassing customers and instigating confrontations with employees on store property. When store workers finally called the police, authorities refused to come and put a stop to the union’s disruptive behavior.

With the nation’s highest income and sales tax rates, in addition to many costly regulations, California is already one of the most difficult places to do business. Its exemptions permitting such behavior on the part of unions – which would be considered criminal for you or me – makes the state an even more inhospitable place to do business.

California also has a host of exemptions that allow union members to violate the property rights of private citizens. The 2008 Researcher Protection Act makes entering the residences of academic researchers to interfere with their work a crime. Sounds reasonable. Yet this doesn’t apply to union members. They can invade a professor’s home in California and it’s not a crime – so long as the invader is “engaged in labor union activities.”

You might wonder why unions have lobbied to be exempt from laws against trespassing. The fact is that they have a long history of targeting private residences. In 2010 roughly 500 protesters from the Service Employees International Union showed up outside the home of a Bank of America deputy general counsel to protest the company’s policies. That bank official wasn’t home, but his teenage son was – and felt forced to barricade himself in a bathroom as union demonstrators surrounded his house and even came onto the front porch.

Unions can also invade your personal space if you’re riding public transit in California. The California Penal Code states “willfully blocking the free movement of another person” in a public transit system is a crime subject to up to 90 days in jail and a $400 fine. However, California legislators have passed a provision exempting unions. This means that union protesters can block the movement of people on public transit so long as it is related to collective bargaining efforts – something to keep in mind before getting on BART during your next visit to San Francisco.

Labor bosses have even deemed it necessary to get legislators to grant unions exemptions from laws against sabotage. Wisconsin’s state law against sabotage exempts unions, so as to not curtail their organizing activities. The fact that anti-sabotage laws might be construed as an impediment to union organizing says more about union organizing efforts than anything else.

Yet, in 2011, union members were alleged to have sabotaged equipment belonging to supporters of Governor Scott Walker’s labor reforms. In New York and New Jersey, during a labor dispute between Verizon and the Communications Workers of America, the telephone company contacted the FBI to investigate allegations of sabotage. The company reported equipment being stolen, fiber-optic lines cut and an office heating system tampered with.

During a union organizing effort in Ohio, the owner of one non-union electrical services company had his tires slashed and rocks thrown at his windows. One of his employees was assaulted. The owner was himself shot in the arm while confronting a person who was vandalizing his car on his property. Other owners of non-union shops experienced similar harassment and intimidation. When the Associated Builders and Contractors called on unions to halt such odious behavior, the unions responded that their actions were perfectly legal.

State lawmakers should oppose efforts to exempt unions from anti-stalking and anti-trespassing laws. Where such laws are already on the books, they should be repealed. For union bosses can be like those scary exes who insist they aren’t letting you break up with them.

Workers and employers deserve the freedom to tell unions, “I’m just not that into you.”
