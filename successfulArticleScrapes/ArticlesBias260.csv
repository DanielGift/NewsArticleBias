1,Eckhardt,Rachel,huffingtonpost,"Halloween has come and gone, and with it surfaced a renewed interest in avoiding cultural appropriation during the holiday. Various awareness campaigns encouraged party-goers and trick-or-treaters to show their Halloween spirit by donning racially and culturally sensitive outfits, condemning costumes depicting members of foreign backgrounds as a form of cultural appropriation.

Cultural appropriation is the practice of borrowing traditional artifacts, customs, rituals, or dress from another culture, often done without regard for the significance of such articles in their society of origin. It is often performed by members of first-world countries, who consider the icons of third-world nations to be exotic or edgy. Typically, those who appropriate other cultures do so out of a genuine (however misguided) interest in the borrowed custom, rather than ill-intentioned disdain, although this sadly is not always the case.

Engagement in cultural appropriation is problematic for several very valid reasons. America has a long history of oppression and exploitation of other human populations, beginning with the conquest and genocide of Native Americans, and continuing with the enslavement of African Americans, the internment of Japanese Americans during WWII, and the general persecution of various diasporas that have immigrated to the United States over the years.

Many modern Americans denounce these practices and enthusiastically support multiculturalism, however, the negative aspects of U.S. history are not easily forgotten, especially as the battle against racism and xenophobia is far from over. It is insulting for members of foreign nations and their descendants to witness their treasured ethnic traditions reduced to cheap and hollow caricatures, all in the name of commercialism.

This is not to say that rituals and customs should not be shared. Cultural diffusion, the spreading of culture from one civilization to another, happens organically when different populations come into contact. It is one of the best aspects of the human experience; language, dress, food, music, art, and more are disseminated through interaction with others, enriching our lives with new perspectives and knowledge. It is difficult to imagine a homogeneous America, one in which we couldn't participate in the rituals of other nations without ever needing to travel outside the country.

Determining when the line between cultural diffusion and cultural appropriation has been crossed presents several challenges, starting with the difficulty of ascertaining the difference between the two. Sometimes it is obvious. It is a no-brainer that wearing a burka, yarmulke, or Native American headdress just for fashion is offensive, but it's not always that clear. Insults are very subjective; one person may take grave offense to an action that another sees no issue with at all. Do we side with the offended person, or the one who doesn't care? Additionally, in order to decide whether someone has misused traditional garb requires us to make assumptions concerning the ethnic and social background of the individual presumed to be guilty of appropriation. The issue is muddied further by the occurrence of similar practices between very different ethnic populations, for instance, the wearing of dreadlocks by both Caribbean and Celtic indigenous populations.

Hypersensitivity to cultural appropriation presents an obstacle to overcoming the issue. Well-intentioned individuals classify any use at all of foreign aesthetic elements as incidences of appropriation. Anything from displaying native artwork to wearing chopsticks in one's hair is classified as horribly offensive, even if the cultural artifact in question doesn't hold particular significance in the nation of origin, such as with the chopsticks. This method of ""crying wolf"", so to speak, causes misconceptions about the nature of cultural appropriation, arguably causing more harm than good by presenting the concept as nothing more than unnecessary political correctness, which some individuals dismiss outright as a matter of principal.

This is very unfortunate; as cultural appropriation is a very real issue. When addressed incorrectly, it can worsen cultural and racial relations between by calling attention to the differences between populations and discouraging the exchange of ideas and customs between societies. It fosters a divisive mentality, prompting persons to retreat into the comfortable familiarity of their own social mores, never to attempt cultural immersion again. This brings to mind an excellent quote attributed to Mark Twain:

""Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness, and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts. Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things cannot be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one's lifetime.""

Cultural isolationism should be avoided at all costs. It destroys the spirit of our country as a diverse melting pot. Our goal is to coexist as an enlightened, multicultural society. It is a lofty goal, and if we are to attain it, respect for the traditions of the various peoples who have made their home in America is essential. When dressing for Halloween, for a party, or whenever, the ornaments and dress of other cultures should not be worn without regard for the nation in which it originated. By the same token, we should stop demonizing the use of any and all items which are somewhat related to a foreign country, as misclassifying cultural appropriation is equally harmful, albeit in a different way.

2,Eckhardt,Rachel,huffingtonpost,"Throughout most of America's history, we've had a two-party political system, but the divisive and competitive politics of the Democrats and Republicans have many Americans wondering whether we'd be better off with a multi-party system.

In the beginning, there were two parties: Adams and Hamilton's elitist Federalist Party, and Madison and Jefferson's populist, small-government Anti-Federalist Party, later called the Democratic-Republican party. In 1815 the Federalist party fell, leaving one remaining party for two presidential terms, aptly called the ""feel good era"". The good feelings didn't last, and the party split into Democrats and Republicans. The Whigs briefly rose, but only lasted until the 1850s. We've had the Democrats and Republicans from 1869 onward, though yesterday's parties were ideologically different from those of today. History has seen the formation of various minority parties, but our system has largely been dominated by the big two.

So why two parties? Apart from our constant partisan bickering, liberals and conservatives actually agree on many core values, such as personal liberty, equality and free speech. It makes sense to have two parties that agree on our central ideals, but disagree how to accomplish them. A two-party government tends to be more stable and easier to govern; volatility is a large weakness in countries with many parties. Tradition plays a significant role, as we remain entrenched in the party arrangement that we have had for much of our history. The principal reason is our ""winner take all"" electoral college system, wherein a party wins all (or none) of the allotted votes for each state, based on the majority vote. The losing party gets no representation, rather than a percentage of it, as in a proportional system. This setup perpetuates itself, and makes a third party win nearly impossible.



George Washington left us with an ominous warning about a two-party system in his farewell address:

The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by the spirit of revenge natural to party dissension, which in different ages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is itself a frightful despotism.

The present discordant political climate makes Washington's words as relevant as ever. Our structure naturally forces us to choose sides, fostering an ""us or them"" mentality which severely limits our choices. President Washington worried that this eventually would lead to a single individual seizing control, and advised restraining our system with checks and balances, in order to prevent this ""frightful despotism"":

Without looking forward to an extremity of this kind (which nevertheless ought not to be entirely out of sight), the common and continual mischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it the interest and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain it.

The American political party model is the minority worldwide; most other democracies have three or more parties, even dozens in several countries. Our North-American neighbors can demonstrate two very different examples of how a multi-party system might function. Canada, a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system, has six major political parties, while Mexico, a presidential system, has seven. Canadian politics are dominated by a liberal and a conservative party -- both of which are more ideologically moderate than ours. Canada's minority parties are nevertheless influential and capable of winning elections; in recent years, Canada's New Democratic Party has risen in prominence. Canada's size and population density is best represented by multiple parties. Mexico's system includes proportional representation, with parties needing at least 2 percent of the vote in order to maintain their party registration. Voting is compulsory, but these laws are not enforced. Mexicans have long opposed the concept of reelection (although this is now changing for legislators only), so their presidents are limited to one six-year term.

One commonality in multi-party countries is a parliamentary government, with some exceptions. Another is proportional representation; the party with the highest percentage of the vote wins. This system confers the obvious benefits of more party choices, and accurate representation for minority parties. Countries with more than two political parties often demonstrate higher voter participation, as citizens from various ethnic and ideological backgrounds can find groups that closely match their ideals. The downside is that with so many options, consensus on major issues becomes difficult, and accomplishing tasks becomes arduous. Splinter parties often form and dissolve rapidly. In America, governance is challenging enough with only two parties; it's hard to imagine congress attempting to please 10 different parties.

The grass is always greener on the other side, and Americans often denounce our polarized two-party system in favor of three or more parties, with good reason. Our current arrangement deters us from voting for third-party candidates, as we are loath to waste a vote. Crossing the aisle is a political liability for lawmakers, who are forced to vote in lockstep with their party. Consensus is admittedly difficult with many opposing coalitions in countries with multi-party structures, and the formation of too many parties must be prevented; this could easily by achieved by requiring parties to maintain a percentage of the vote in order to remain active.

We could have the best of both worlds by establishing a proportional system in order to give minority parties a fighting chance, which would in turn keep the majority parties on their toes. Perhaps it would motivate them to work harder for their constituents, lest they be voted out in favor of a third party contender. It's high time for America to join the majority of the world's democracies by giving a multi-party system a chance.",-1,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rachel-eckhardt/the-more-the-merrier-woul_b_8387458.html
3,Eckhardt,Rachel,huffingtonpost,"As a military veteran and a gun owner, I enjoy blowing off some steam from time to time by spending a day at the shooting range, as I'm sure many other Americans do. I don't think twice about it, but according to Facebook, my right to bear arms is in jeopardy. Chances are, while scrolling through your news feed, you've seen the memes too, ominously warning you that the government is coming to take your guns. Our Second Amendment rights are being threatened like never before, they insist, and anyone who says otherwise is not a true American patriot.

Some Americans dismiss this as nothing more than gun-lobby propaganda, others head straight to the gun store to strengthen their gun-ownership cred. Being a skeptic by nature, I'm suspicious of 99.9 percent of the claims circulating on Facebook, so this got me thinking, how much truth is there to these rumors, and how can we put our gun laws into perspective?

I'm sure plenty of people know this by heart, but for those who don't, the Second Amendment to our constitution has this to say on the matter:

A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.

How this amendment has been interpreted is a subject of much contention, with some believing that it applies to an individual's right to bear arms, others arguing that it applies to the state's right to keep a well-organized militia (the National Guard, according to some). Without boring you with the in-depth legal discussion, suffice it to say that in 2008, the Supreme Court went with the first interpretation, that is, that individual Americans have the right to bear arms for self-defense.

Sounds pretty simple, right? Well, not so fast. The thing is, while we have the right to bear arms, our government has the duty to protect its citizens from harm, which naturally makes these two ideals come into conflict. Our government has to strike a balance between safeguarding its citizens lives, while at the same time safeguarding their constitutional rights. It has been said that a good compromise leaves neither party happy, and that saying definitely applies here.

It helps to take a look at how gun ownership and rights have looked through our country's history. In the beginning, Americans were pioneers who hunted for subsistence and participated in local militias, so gun ownership was commonplace and completely unregulated. This changed over time as our country became more stable and organized, with the first gun laws in the early 1800s putting restrictions on the carrying of concealed weapons. The National Firearms Act, enacted in 1934 in response to the rise of gun crimes by 1930s gangsters, regulated the use of ""Tommy"" guns, sawed-off shotguns, and other guns frequently involved in gangland crime. Several high-profile assassinations during the 1960s, including that of President JFK, lead to the Gun Control Act of 1968, which restricted the transfer and sale of guns, and established that certain types of people should be prohibited from owning firearms. This Act led to the creation of the Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms Bureau. The 1990s saw the ban of assault weapons following a school shooting, and also the advent of background checks for handgun purchases. Looking back through history, we can see a definite pattern: each time gun regulations were strengthened, it seems to have been in direct response to a violent gun crime.

The present gun control situation is no different; several recent high-profile gun crime incidents, particularly the Sandy Hook shooting, have many Americans calling for tighter gun laws, and of course, many other Americans opposing such laws. In response, President Obama has laid out a set of proposals to curb gun violence. His proposals include a larger police force, better police training, gun safety classes for Americans, mental health awareness training for schools and police, and enhanced interstate mental health and background checks. His plan also includes bans on automatic weapons, armor-piercing bullets, and high-capacity magazines, as well as plans to encourage gun safety technology.

Not surprisingly, Americans are pretty evenly split on the issue. Some believe that every gun control measure is an infringement on our constitutional rights, while others believe that these regulations are common sense measures that make it more difficult for criminals or mentally ill individuals to get a hold of guns, while still allowing law-abiding Americans to exercise their right to bear arms. Some have gone so far as claiming that these are all efforts to incrementally make it impossible for Americans to bear arms at all.

The fact is, there have been no proposed federal laws that would ban ownership and possession of all guns for many years. Gun laws vary state by state, with some states having looser regulations than others. If Obama's proposals were enacted, this would leave gun laws unchanged in many states, and tighter in others, but would still allow Americans to own weapons provided that they have no history of mental illness or violent crime, and provided that they aren't owning military-style assault weapons. Our courts have done a fairly decent job of upholding our Second Amendment rights. In an important recent Supreme Court ruling, District of Columbia v. Heller (2008), the Court upheld our right to use guns for self-defense, and declared two DC gun bans unconstitutional.

A good compromise leaves neither party happy. Many law-abiding Americans want to have the cool big guns, and don't have violent intentions. Other Americans want guns banned completely as they are in other countries. We can't have it both ways, so we compromise by allowing Americans to bear arms, albeit with some restrictions. As for the claim that this is an attempt to eventually take ALL guns away; our history and laws simply don't support that. So is the government really coming for our guns? It would seem not.

4,Eckhardt,Rachel,huffingtonpost,"These days, we are bombarded daily on social media with political memes and articles that aren't exactly accurate, to say the least. It seems impossible at times to sort fact from fiction, and news from propaganda. So how do you keep yourself from drowning in a sea of misinformation?

1. Read opposing points of view.

Until you look at both sides of an issue, you can't know for sure whether your beliefs are correct. ""But I throw up in my mouth a little every time I read X news,"" you say. ""They're so narrow-minded."" See where I'm going with this? It can be positively infuriating to read viewpoints that contrast so starkly with your own, but the alternative is to live in an echo chamber full of yes-men, which some might call narrow minded. Give the other side's perspective a fair shot before making up your mind.

2. Avoid confirmation bias.

Confirmation bias: it's our tendency to overlook information that we disagree with, in favor of information that supports our preexisting notions. We're all guilty of it. This may be the most important tip, because it's the first step to overcoming bias. It requires being mindful. If you find yourself cherry-picking only news stories that you agree with, ask yourself whether you are guilty of confirmation bias.



3. Fact-check everything.

I read on Facebook that Obama is spying on Americans using tiny mosquito-mounted cameras. There was even a picture showing a mosquito with a spying apparatus strapped to his back, and a small but sinister nozzle for taking blood samples. This sounded silly, so I headed straight to Snopes, where I learned that while the military is experimenting with small drones, Obama is definitely not using robot bugs to collect DNA samples for his secret lair. Had I not fact-checked that story, I'd be hiding in my house from evil insect drones right now, instead of writing this list.

4. See past your first impression.

We all have the tendency to let our first impressions influence how we see things in the future. Maybe the first time you read about a certain politician, you heard he was an alcoholic that uses so much self-tanner that he looks like a living traffic cone (not mentioning any names). Now, every time you hear about him, your first instinct is to wonder what drunken orange blunder he committed this time. Give second chances, and you may find out your first impression wasn't entirely fair.

5. Don't play the blame game.

It's natural to want to point fingers when there has been a political catastrophe. Many people make the mistake of blaming the first person or thing that they read about, but in our complex country, things are rarely that simple. This goes for giving credit too- before praising a politician to the skies, make sure they deserve your admiration.

6. Give the devil his due.

We all have politicians we can't stand. Maybe yours has a horrible comb-over and a penchant for insulting large groups of people, or maybe you're not satisfied with the ""hope and change"" they promised. Just because you don't like them doesn't mean that every single thing they do is bad. Try to put aside your negative feelings enough to learn about their good achievements, and you just may surprise yourself.





7. Beware of the straw man.

A straw man argument is one in which someone misrepresents an opponent's stances, then attacks the weakened position instead of the real one. A congressperson wants to cut military spending, therefore he hates America and is in league with terrorists. Outrageous claims like those are easy to spot, but others are subtler; some people are experts at hiding straw man arguments, while others don't realize they have created one. Beware of claims that require assumptions or huge leaps in logic. You may be dealing with a straw man.

8. Jump off of the bandwagon.

As social animals, it's our instinct to fall victim to group-think. Large groups of people believe something, so it must be correct. We also want people to like us, so we agree with them so as not to be unpopular. It can be demoralizing or even scary at times to be the odd man out and leave a dissenting Facebook comment or tweet, especially with all of the internet crazies out there. Nevertheless, it's better to be the lone voice of truth than join a chorus of falsehoods.

9. Anecdotes aren't statistics.

Your grandfather smoked 3 packs a day, but he lived to be 95 years old. Clearly, smoking isn't really that bad for you. Everyone has a story that seems to contradict the statistics, but this becomes problematic when one starts believing their anecdote invalidates the data. They know one person to whom the figures didn't apply, so nothing else matters. Be wary of falling into the trap of thinking that the exception is the rule.



10. Swallow your pride.

Nobody likes to admit when they are wrong, but unfortunately, even the smartest people make mistakes. The worst possible thing to do is double down on an error. If you relied on faulty data, jumped to conclusions, or shared an untrue article on social media, the best thing to do is admit it. Don't beat yourself up over it, and don't be embarrassed. Everybody has done it before, myself included.

It's difficult to find accurate information on the internet, especially when it comes to politics, but following these tips can help you be more politically savvy.

5,Emanuel,Rahm,wsj,"‘You never want a serious crisis to go to waste,” a sage said during the Obama transition in 2008. The media’s zeal to compare today’s crisis to the Great Recession has spurred journalists to ignore a crucial corollary to that law of politics: Not every crisis deals the White House the same hand. For reasons I don’t understand, pundits seem to be unable to appreciate, much less explain, how timing, substance, landscape and legislative politics all frame an administration’s freedom to respond. Covid-19 and credit default-swaps don’t elicit the same kinds of reactions or responses from the public. To illuminate what’s happening today, you need to do more than compare policy outcomes—you need to dig deeper.

Consider the different contexts of the crises of 2009 and 2021. Not that it isn’t terrifying to take power when the economy is shedding 500,000 jobs per month, but on the day Joe Biden was inaugurated America had lost nearly 500,000 lives—perhaps half of which could have been saved. That distinction has deep political implications. If America during Covid is awash in a sense that we’re in this together—think of the crowds that cheered hospital staffs last spring—12 years ago, the country was riven with anger. Lehman Brothers collapsed only two months before Barack Obama’s victory. The electorate wasn’t looking for empathy; voters rightfully wanted Old Testament justice. Mr. Obama had to restore trust in the financial markets, save the auto industry from itself, and stimulate the economy in a nation hungry for retribution.

Mr. Biden was hardly bequeathed the generalized prosperity that Bill Clinton left to George W. Bush or Mr. Obama handed to Donald Trump. Healing the scars of the Trump era has been Mr. Biden’s unique burden. That said, he presides over a country steeped in empathy—that’s one of the key reasons he won and is the right leader for the moment. His burden is to sustain the nation at a moment of mourning—to seek relief after years of division. Mr. Obama’s was to prevent a second Great Depression—to pull the nation back from the precipice of an economic abyss. Neither challenge is easily overcome, they aren’t remotely the same.

Which brings us to the politics. In a way that’s infuriatingly facile, pundits try time and again to compare Mr. Biden’s relief strategy to Mr. Obama’s stimulus plan when the two presidents faced political hurdles that were entirely distinct. Mr. Biden faces a 50-50 Senate with a more cohesive Democratic Caucus, all but three of whose members are from states he won. Because a filibuster-proof majority is such a daunting goal, conventional wisdom is that it would be futile to try. Twelve years ago, Democrats had a much larger majority, but 13 Democratic senators hailed from states Mr. Obama had lost, and those senators needed the political cover of bipartisanship. In other words, the legislative dynamics were entirely upside-down.

Which brings us to the most important similarity. If the crises facing Messrs. Obama and Biden had entirely different DNA, one thing connects them—Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. Unlike many other GOP leaders—Bob Dole and Bill Frist in the Senate, Bob Michel and John Boehner in the House—Mr. McConnell has chosen to be maximally obstructionist. The question is whether a strategy that worked in an era of bank bailouts will be effective in a time of public-health crisis and all the vulnerabilities it has exposed.",-1,https://www.wsj.com/articles/not-every-serious-crisis-is-alike-11618767433
6,Emanuel,Rahm,washingtonpost,"Without any fanfare, Republicans are signaling that they are prepared to support measures to boost the working poor into the middle class, and to keep the working middle class from falling backward. That ideological shift opens the door to progress that Democrats have been trying desperately to achieve for more than a generation.

Story continues below advertisement

Since the Reagan era, the core fault line between progressives and conservatives has centered on how best to help those struggling to grasp and climb the bottom rungs of the economic ladder. Democrats have consistently argued for government spending sufficient to counteract the private sector’s race to the bottom on wages. Republicans have taken the opposite view, contending not only that an unhindered free market is sufficient to end poverty but also that government assistance programs are invariably rife with waste, fraud and abuse.

Advertisement

Over the past several months, a shift has occurred. Amid the ravages of the coronavirus, changing economic realities, former president Donald Trump’s disastrous record and the changing makeup of the Republican Party, GOP leaders have begun to abandon their blind faith in the private sector’s supposedly unmatched ability to boost every working family into the middle class. Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) has led the way, and several of his colleagues are floating other means of supplementing wages. All of these measures implicitly cop to the Democratic contention that government needs to do more.

What’s behind the change? My hunch is that political considerations play a big role. If, as some claim, Republicans have designs on becoming the party of the working class, many among its next generation of leaders will struggle to explain their decision to oppose covid relief designed to benefit the middle class and working poor. They will need to show some pattern of action on behalf of working people, and they will need to do more than boost the minimum wage to do so.

Story continues below advertisement

In the past, Democrats looking to help working-class families have been compelled to take a transactional approach, giving the Republicans something for wealthier voters in exchange for hiking the minimum wage. Not anymore. Now, the minimum wage can be the tip of the spear, balanced not against something Democrats have to give up, but accompanied by something that makes a real difference for families struggling to stay above the poverty line.

Advertisement

Romney’s proposal to create a universal child allowance of at least $250 a month for most families was received enthusiastically by White House chief of staff Ron Klain. Others are making similar overtures. Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Mike Lee (R-Utah) want to expand the child tax credit, which reduces tax liability for breadwinners. And when running for office in 2018, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) campaigned on a plan to again revamp the bipartisan earned-income tax credit (EITC), which adds income to low-wage jobs. Remarkably enough, this might be a place where good policy and good politics meet.

The right mix of these programs can be far more powerful than any one proposal alone. So, combined with the recent setback on the minimum wage and the relief package’s merely temporary expansion of the child tax credit, the new thinking among some Republicans suddenly puts the dream of guaranteeing a “living wage” within reach. That gives Democrats the additional flexibility required to do something bigger. Even entrenched ideologues might acknowledge that the minimum wage need not be the same in Manhattan as Missouri. To cement this deal quickly — and to satisfy concerns from moderates — Democrats should think about a more comprehensive approach.

Story continues below advertisement

To begin, the package should set the new rate at $15 an hour, tying that figure to inflation moving forward, and giving states the right to opt out of $15 per hour in favor of a floor closer to $12. (This has the added political benefit of forcing those lawmakers who oppose the higher figure to vote affirmatively to cut it.) Then, rather than include a tax cut for the rich, the package should augment the child tax credit and expand the EITC in such a way to allow recipients to claim benefits on a quarterly basis, so they don’t have to wait the full year to receive their allowances in cash.

Advertisement

No one likes to have a good policy idea upended by a parliamentarian, but that’s not the big story here. Key Republicans are raising a white flag in a long-stalemated, zero-sum economic debate. A higher minimum wage is clearly in the offing. The Biden administration is poised to do what matters most to create an inclusive economy — crafting a filibuster-proof package that rewards work, strengthens families and pushes progressives much closer to their dream of ensuring that no family with a full-time breadwinner is forced to raise its children in poverty.

7,Emanuel,Rahm,wsj,"Take a split-screen snapshot of America’s two political parties. Congressional Republicans, having just witnessed President Trump literally sic a mob on them, have remained overwhelmingly loyal. Democrats are trying to build support for President Biden’s Covid-relief package by disparaging former President Obama’s efforts to save the economy in 2009. It’s a study in contrasts, and a master class in the relationship between messaging and politics.

Democrats need to tear a page from the Republican playbook. When interviewing for a job, you don’t lead with self-loathing. Democrats need to assert that they’ve got a record of success. If the GOP could claim that a past Republican president had created 20 million jobs, do you think they would disparage him as a RINO—a Republican in name only? If a GOP president had sparked the longest peacetime economic expansion in the nation’s history, do you think they’d label his efforts as “tepid”?

These aren’t trick questions—of course they wouldn’t. Nevertheless, it’s chic today in certain quarters of the Democratic Party to disparage Presidents Clinton and Obama, who actually did those things, on the misguided pretense that criticizing the progressive past will somehow open the door to a more robust progressive future.

Republicans rarely make that sort of mistake. They know how powerfully a historical narrative can alter the contemporary political landscape. For decades, the GOP has consistently reminded the public how Ronald Reagan cut taxes, strengthened the military and slashed government programs. They rarely focus on the taxes he raised, the nuclear-weapons programs he mothballed, or the New Deal and Great Society programs he left intact.

The resulting narrative legacy has provided the GOP with a crucial foundation for subsequent success. By burnishing the claim that economic growth can cover the revenue lost through tax cuts, Republicans seeded the ground for future political and legislative victories. They set the stage for the Bush and Trump tax cuts of 2001, 2003 and 2017. The tale Republicans tell is the reason they often carry an edge on the economy.",-1,https://www.wsj.com/articles/democrats-need-an-11th-commandment-11614641569
8,Emanuel,Rahm,wsj,"When you work in the White House, you reserve only the toughest of tough decisions for the president. If the best option is clear or obvious, the staff signs off before it reaches the Oval Office. As President Biden wrestles with a pandemic, a stalling economy and the GOP’s recalcitrant leadership, every potential move comes with serious trade-offs. Like every president, Mr. Biden’s success will be determined by how deftly he balances policy and politics as well as his short- and long-term objectives.

Mr. Biden’s legacy will be defined largely by how well he handles Covid-19 and whether he can rev up the economy. His pledge to unify the country distinguished him as a candidate. Because many voters view bipartisanship as a core part of his character, abandoning it risks undermining his central appeal to swing voters and others. Keenly aware of the president’s situation, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell is looking to force him into a no-win choice between a short-term legislative success and long-term bipartisanship. Mr. Biden’s challenge is to avoid Mr. McConnell’s trap—to pursue the robust pandemic relief package the country needs without destroying his relationships with moderate Republicans who will be crucial to passing his plan to “build back better.”

Mr. McConnell is playing the long game as always. He knows that Mr. Biden won’t scale back the funding required to get the country past this long, dark winter. As minority leader, he can’t stop Democrats from using the tools provided through the budget reconciliation process; he used the same strategy when championing tax cuts in 2017. He wants to make Mr. Biden’s coming legislative victory as costly as it can be politically, framing it to the public as evidence that the president’s professed devotion to bipartisanship was merely lip service. If senators come to believe that the president is stiff-arming Republicans, Mr. McConnell will more easily convince his GOP colleagues to join him in obstructing the rest of the president’s agenda.

This is not only an economic debate; it’s a political balancing act. The near-term risk of sliding into a double-dip recession is much more dangerous than the possibility that inflation may return this summer. If the nation slips into another recession, the president will quickly lose his political capital. In other words, the country can’t afford for Mr. Biden to abandon today for tomorrow, and Mr. McConnell is using that reality as leverage. As President Clinton’s tenure made clear, tough, single-party economic fixes passed at an administration’s outset can open the door to bipartisan successes down the line.

That said, Mr. Biden can’t ignore the political risk of steamrolling the GOP. A majority of Americans (especially independents) want him to follow through on his promise to work across the aisle. If “build back better” is the north star for this administration, Mr. Biden will need Republicans who vote against the relief package to work with him on climate, infrastructure, education and more.",-1,https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-joe-biden-needs-bipartisanship-11613307600

Beyond the horror of the underlying crime, the insurrection, not to mention the support it received from so many corners of our society, was an unmistakable symptom of a cancer in the body politic. Even amid a global pandemic and an economic catastrophe, finding ways to combat that underlying cancer—and to root out the anger and dissatisfaction that drives it—represents the thorniest and most lasting challenge the nation will face under President Joe Biden’s leadership.

In addition to bringing all the perpetrators to justice, we as a nation need to confront the fact that Americans today face a societal transformation more destabilizing than any other in our history. In just a few decades, technology and employers have reshaped the definition of “work” faster than our culture, traditions, and institutions can keep up. Working- and middle-class incomes have remained stagnant even as everyday costs have risen. And perhaps most important, we’ve seen a bigger shift in the racial and ethnic makeup of the electorate over the last 20 years than in the previous two centuries. As such, our generational burden now is to face down the deep-seated fear many harbor about being rendered powerless in the next cultural, racial, political, and economic order.

To face this kind of historic moment, some might have Biden look to Lincoln and FDR for inspiration. But Teddy Roosevelt actually provides a more useful guide. At the turn of the 20th century, our nation faced a series of changes that combined to be utterly destabilizing. The population was churning as immigrants poured in from poorer corners of Europe, and Southern Blacks began the Great Migration north. The nation was undergoing its first true economic transformation, with urban industry eclipsing rural agriculture, and electricity, oil and engines quickly changing what “work” meant. As corporations grew more powerful, the nationwide concentration of wealth spurred many to term the phrase “robber baron.” And the resulting tumult sparked a stampede of extremism.

We should never lose sight of the underlying landscape the original Progressives emerged to confront. The Ku Klux Klan, which had largely been defunct, was re-formed in 1915 and launched a campaign of domestic racial terror. Anarchists threatened institutions of all sorts, assassinating President William McKinley and bombing cities with a frequency that seems shocking now. Labor unrest, too, was often violent. Many wondered whether American democracy could survive at all.

Remarkably enough, the changes behind today’s whirlwind may be even more pronounced. At the birth of the American Republic, whites constituted the whole of the nation’s electorate. When Bill Clinton was elected president two centuries later, the white share still stood at 87 percent. But get this: In the 28 subsequent years, the white share has fallen to 67 percent. Think of how that dramatic shift reverberates differently in disparate American communities.

Meanwhile, that more hopeful change is being accompanied by other shifts that are much more ominous. Inequality today puts Gilded Age wage gaps to shame. The climate is in crisis, requiring us to re-tool huge portions of our economy. We face a rising China and an increasingly adversarial Russia. And as the pandemic has revealed, our health care and public health systems, once a cornerstone of our national strength, are in dire need of reform. It takes nothing away from the crucibles represented by the Civil War, the Great Depression, or the Second World War to realize that the present sense of disruption is most similar to the challenge we faced at the turn of the 20th century.

The level of turmoil is easy to overlook for those whose lives have benefited from the changes. But Americans whose education ended in high school, who live beyond the footprint of a cosmopolitan bubble, or who have seen their neighborhoods inundated with “deaths of despair,” have a right to worry that the combined effects will leave their children bereft of any opportunity to claim the American Dream. That’s not license to abandon the principles of democratic governance or to break the law—far from it. But it is a worry the rest of us ignore at our nation’s peril.

Fortunately, because today’s problems echo those that defined the Gilded Age, turn-of-the-century politics has something to teach us as well. When Teddy Roosevelt assumed the presidency in 1901, he had a big reform agenda. The move from farm to factory prompted reformers across the country to make high-school education a universal touchstone. But the primary agent of exclusion at the time—the institution most culpable not only for economic inequality, but for upending middle- and working-class aspirations to real prosperity—was monopoly power. So in shaping the contours of his “Fair Deal,” Roosevelt embraced a broad agenda designed to give the excluded masses greater opportunity. He established the federal government as a neutral arbiter in labor disputes, rather than a backstop for monopolists. He embraced more robust ongoing regulation for the nation’s private corporations. And maybe most notably, he took on the trusts directly, bringing suit to break up one of J.P. Morgan’s behemoth railroad corporations, Northern Securities.

Today, as a new wave of monopoly power threatens the broader economy, the new administration has a range of challenges demanding bold solutions. There are already signs the Biden administration may acknowledge a new strain of tech monopolists, and could get bipartisan support in pushing back against them.

But in the end, nothing works as forcefully to address the division between inclusion and exclusion than education. As Vice President Kamala Harris noted in her debate with Mike Pence—and as First Lady Jill Biden, a community college professor herself, knows well—schooling has emerged as the single most important determinant of economic prosperity and lifelong opportunity in the 21st century economy. College degrees, while always advantageous, are now irreplaceable passports to middle class success. Of late, presidents of both parties have entered office intending to improve the nation’s antiquated and inadequate education system. Now we need a much more robust agenda. In the same way Roosevelt-era progressives attacked monopolistic trusts, Biden-era progressives must improve our educational system.

Fortunately, in the spirit of Louis Brandeis’s embrace of local experimentation, effective reforms are close at hand. We need to find ways to ensure students start earlier and go longer. As my administration did in Chicago, and as incoming Labor Secretary Marty Walsh did in Boston, municipal government can reimagine basic public education, abandoning the K-12 model for something much broader—like “Pre-K through 14.”

Every child in American can and should be guaranteed a seat in a prekindergarten program today, regardless of their zip code. And at the other end, public school instruction shouldn’t end in grade 12—we should guarantee every citizen the opportunity to earn an associate degree by making community college free and accessible. Moreover, we should transform the focus on high school graduation to a focus on a successful post-graduation, nationalizing Chicago’s requirement that, before receiving a diploma, every student have in hand a letter of acceptance from a college, community college, or vocational school, a job offer, or a plan to enter either the military or a national service program like AmeriCorps.

To heal the body politic right now, we first need to address the entry wound—namely the actual criminal mob’s attempt to undermine our democracy, and uncover the complicity of anyone in power. But, in time, we will need to focus on the underlying cancer plaguing society-at-large. At a moment when questions of inclusion and exclusion gird nearly every political and economic debate, Washington needs to focus on giving every citizen the tools required to build a prosperous middle class life.

The disruptions to the social order have left too many in our society plagued by a fear that they will be excluded from tomorrow’s bounty. Reaching to much the same challenge, Teddy Roosevelt’s Fair Deal reverberated to shape Woodrow Wilson’s New Freedom and FDR’s New Deal in the decades that followed.

12,Emanuel,Rahm,wsj,"Many Americans were taken aback when 126 members of Congress joined a specious lawsuit to overturn last month’s presidential election. It appeared to be the latest, most glaring evidence that the country’s commitment to its constitutional system is in decline. But there’s reason for hope. Hyperbolic calls to abandon the core institutions of American life—demands to forsake capitalism from the left, and vicious, norm-busting partisanship from Donald Trump’s Republicans—were defeated handily this year. The result of the presidential election showed that beyond repudiating President Trump, Americans are seeking renewal and revitalization.

To be sure, polarization is a real and serious problem. But this election was less about whether the U.S. would tack left or right, and more about whether the country would embrace compassion. Americans rejected the radical vituperation proselytized on the fringes and chose the optimistic tradition of social justice associated with Pope John XXIII. (I know that may sound strange coming from a practicing Jew, but here we are.) The man who decisively defeated Mr. Trump reflects the “silent majority” of Americans, who believe in renewing rather than revolutionizing our political and economic systems. Rooted in faith, Joe Biden’s promise to “save the soul of the nation” reflected his determination to address the political, economic and cultural alienation that fuels fervor on the far right and left alike.

Those who feel vindicated by Mr. Biden’s victory shouldn’t lose sight of how we got here—or how we got President Trump four years ago. A significant minority of the country is angry, and their anger is, at root, entirely legitimate. Trump supporters and the far left both sense that in today’s America the powerful few get ahead and don’t see, hear or value everyday people. I realize that people on either edge of the political spectrum naturally take offense at being lumped in with the other lot. But everyone who still champions democratic capitalism—and that’s most of us—needs to realize that the calls for revolution from right and left have a common foundation in grievance and estrangement.

Their uproar was a long time coming. Many of today’s radicalized voters come from families who sacrificed when the country went to war over phantom weapons of mass destruction and watched the responsible policy makers get off scot-free. Their communities were decimated by the financial crisis, and banks got bailouts while victims were left holding the bag. Today they struggle to afford college even as celebrities lie and cheat to get their children into elite schools. Over the years they’ve grown to believe that there are two sets of rules in the U.S.—one for the rich and powerful, and one for everyone else. They’re not entirely wrong.

But the solution isn’t to blow up the system, ignoring the will of the people as expressed at the ballot box. Nor is it right for proponents of America’s institutions to castigate, shun, cancel or demonize those who have lost faith. Both camps have become ideologically tribal, and Mr. Trump was particularly adept at exploiting the desire to find fellowship in grievance. But the first step in reconciliation or bridging a political divide is to control any impulse to dismiss the other side, and instead reach for mutual understanding. That’s why Americans should adopt Mr. Biden’s belief that everyone counts, that everyone’s voice matters, and that our collective responsibility is to ensure that the country can “grow together.”",-1,https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-win-for-the-american-system-11609182770
13,Emanuel,Rahm,wsj,"When the election was called for President-elect Joe Biden, progressives across the nation breathed a sigh of relief. But as the congressional results became clear, many of us paused the celebration. Unless Democrats win both Georgia Senate seats in Jan. 5 runoffs, Mr. Biden will be the first Democrat to face a Republican Senate at the beginning of his first term since Grover Cleveland in 1885. How can he even hope to pursue a progressive agenda?

The concern is well-founded because continued gridlock would be a disaster, blocking America from working through its challenges. But there is a way forward. Pundits are prone to parse the electorate between red and blue, but voters are much more complex. Millions who cast their ballots for Mr. Biden or President Trump support policy positions held by the other candidate. That isn’t to argue that President Biden should walk away from his agenda and put his finger in the wind. But it does suggest that, while Republican senators may profess to oppose the Democratic agenda, on particular issues, they’re poised to join a “coalition of the willing.”

Voters are more complex and less partisan than is commonly appreciated. More than a third describe themselves as independents. In ballot measures this November, various Trump states embraced progressive priorities—and Biden states turned right as well. In Florida, where Mr. Trump won by more than 350,000 votes, more than 60% of voters approved a ballot initiative raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour. Mr. Biden won California 64% to 34%, but a ban on affirmative action was upheld 57% to 43%. South Dakota voted 54% to 46% to legalize marijuana, but supported Mr. Trump. Illinois, which gave Mr. Biden a 16-point margin, voted down a progressive income tax. Three months after voting for Medicaid expansion, Missouri went for Mr. Trump. And previously red Arizona, which Mr. Biden won by a hair, approved an income tax hike on those making more than $250,000 to fund the state’s schools.

Because these ballot measures weren’t connected to candidate personalities or any larger narrative, they offer an unvarnished view of what people really believe and a window into how to lead during a period of divided government. No Democrats and very few Republicans want to replace Trump-era vitriol with Biden-era bickering, and that should inform the way Democrats at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue think about their legislative strategy. With the filibuster still in place, progressives will have no way of forcing controversial legislation through the Senate, regardless of what happens in Georgia. So the White House will need to gain the acquiescence of at least a handful of Republican senators to drive progress.

One strategy is to try to beat moderate Republicans into submission, dreaming that a deluge of angry phone calls, emails and social-media posts will cow them into supporting a progressive agenda. While that may be emotionally gratifying, it’s rarely effective. A more promising approach would be to find issues on which individual senators would benefit politically from breaking with their leadership and supporting President Biden’s plan. That would allow for small compromises that build the trust needed to advance bigger legislative priorities later.",-1,https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-biden-can-break-the-senate-stonewall-11606776086

What the country, and especially the Democratic Party, now need, they claim, is a synthesis of both: people with good policy ideas who know how to win elections. This insight does not exactly dazzle with its originality, nor will readers be surprised that the authors modestly suggest that this wondrous synthesis is precisely what they themselves embody -- but let all that pass. The book's real importance is as a guide to the thinking of two bright, centrist Democrats whose views will be carefully reviewed as the party prepares for 2008. The most important big idea in the book is that Democrats should stop defending the New Deal and instead concentrate on recasting it for a more mobile society. Portable pensions and health care are two of the cornerstones of this vision. Less hopeful is an idea that the authors appear to set great store by: a compulsory period of three months of national service and training for all Americans under 25. Wonks will observe that the time is too short to teach anything useful and that while the cost would be high, the real benefits would be few. Hacks will wonder whether even a short-term, nonmilitary draft is really the proposal best calculated to build widespread support among younger voters.

16,Emanuel,Rahm,msn,"When President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law in 2010, much of the media framed the bill as a vast expansion of the existing social safety net. Because a Medicaid expansion was one of the laws’ cornerstones, it appeared largely as a benefit for the working poor, which narrowcast its public support.

Since then, however, the nation’s reliance on Obamacare’s more universal protections—most notably for those with pre-existing conditions—has changed public perception. The Affordable Care Act today has joined Social Security and Medicare in the pantheon of American entitlements: It’s popular, and Americans from all walks of life have come to rely on its protections, especially in the middle of a pandemic.

Load Error

With that shift, Obama’s signature domestic achievement, once politically vulnerable, has become a third rail for any critics who still want to attack it. Now, on the eve of the next administration, the ACA’s improved public image creates a political opening for President-elect Joe Biden to work with Congress to expand the original bill and offer more coverage to more Americans—just as Social Security and Medicare were expanded over time, too.

Obamacare’s rising status as an entitlement gives it a new kind of political power—and points to one of the key reasons Democrats did so well in the 2018 midterms, and that Biden won so convincingly earlier this month. Conservatives still feel comfortable criticizing programs that exclusively target the working poor—food stamps, school lunch, unemployment insurance, Pell Grants—because many middle-class voters see them as benefits for someone else. But entitlements, by their very nature, have a universal appeal, putting them beyond the reach of the GOP’s political hatchet.

In 2016, candidate Donald Trump was savvy enough to recognize this when he vowed publicly not to touch Medicare and Social Security. But blinded by his hatred for his predecessor, he subsequently failed to realize that Obamacare, too, had crossed the entitlement Rubicon. Irony of ironies: Because President Trump attacked Obamacare so relentlessly, he is leaving Washington with the law much stronger politically than it was when he took the oath of office.

Obamacare’s political evolution has been as overlooked as it is remarkable. As White House chief of staff when the bill became law, I saw firsthand in 2009 and 2010 how vehemently some Americans opposed the bill. Specious attacks—like the false claims that it would “socialize medicine” or create “death panels”—both incensed conservatives and turned many moderates against our effort. And because so many Americans viewed the bill as a boon for the working poor (as well as the unemployed) financed by everyone else, Republicans could attack it almost with impunity, as they did. When Trump took office four years ago, the “program” was still net unpopular.

But Obamacare flipped to net favorable quickly after Trump’s election, and it now emerges stronger from Trump’s White House tenure. After years of Trump castigating the law without offering an alternative, the country realized nothing had actually been “socialized,” and that the law’s various provisions are nothing close to the “disaster” Trump claimed ad nauseum. A person who began with very little credibility on health care lost even more. Simultaneously, the law’s insurance exchanges and protections for young adults have been woven relatively seamlessly into the nation’s health care woodwork. Far from making it any worse for the wear, the ACA has improved the health care system overall. Finally, with the emergence of Covid-19, whole swaths of the electorate saw just how important the protections really were.

Beyond Trump’s personal divisiveness, nothing was more responsible for the Democrats’ big victories in the 2018 midterms than the party’s vow to protect Obamacare. Even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was savvy enough to understand the electorate’s evolving sentiment. When the president pressed Congress in 2019 to try once again to repeal and replace the law, McConnell retorted in his quietly devastating way: “I made it clear to [the president] that we were not going to be doing that in the Senate.”

There’s no mistaking why, during the presidential campaign this year, Biden made health care such a crucial focus of his advertising, second only to Trump’s character. As evidenced by Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s recent questions from the bench about a lawsuit over the ACA, the conservative Supreme Court also would prefer to leave Obamacare alone. If they don’t, the 2022 midterms are liable to be a repeat of 2018.

That should point Democrats at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue to three crucial takeaways for the months ahead. First, the elements of the bill that proved so controversial a decade ago—namely, the provisions that extended coverage to the working uninsured—eventually faded to become only a single element of the law’s broader appeal. Today, the protections for young adults and those with pre-existing conditions have become a fixture of the American experience. Progressives often debate whether it’s more expedient to target benefits or spread them more widely. As is most often the case, the surest way to help the working poor is to tie their benefits to those that serve the middle class.

Second, Democrats should see Obamacare’s more enduring political success as a signal for how to carry the torch for reform further still. After Social Security established a retirement floor in 1935, progressives added new benefits, including disability pensions in 1956. After establishing Medicare in 1965, Washington created the prescription drug benefit in 2003. Democrats should push Obamacare on the same trajectory.

That should begin with a new effort to deploy the ACA’s Medicaid expansion in the 12 states that haven’t yet embraced it. Recall that Obamacare originally gave states the opportunity to expand (the state-administered and federally subsidized) Medicaid for the poor to those living slightly above the poverty line. The bill offered to cover the expansion’s full cost for the first several years, asking states to pay a mere pittance of the cost as time went on. Thirty-eight states have embraced the opportunity—but some Republicans still refuse. As governors plead with Washington for budget help amid the pandemic recession, President Biden should make them an offer that would be hard to refuse: for the federal government, once again, to cover 100 percent of the Medicaid expansion’s costs for all states. By merging budget aid with assistance for those afflicted with Covid-19, Democrats can make this a policy win-win.

Lastly, to take some pressure off the ACA’s insurance exchanges, Congress should pass legislation lowering the age of eligibility for Medicare from 65 to 58, regardless of which party takes the Senate majority. Much as the GOP embraced Medicare’s prescription drug benefit despite the cost, this should appeal to Republicans in Congress because their voting base trends older. Biden has proposed adding a public option to the ACA, as well—something Congress refused to embrace a decade ago, but that now represents the next logical step. It may not yet be politically feasible. But in the meantime, the burgeoning group of middle-aged uninsured Americans too young to meet Medicare’s present cut-off should be given an opportunity to buy-in early—a down payment on the goal of Medicare-for-All.

A decade ago, many would have been hard-pressed to argue that good policy was good politics in the case of Obamacare. Just think of the rise of the Tea Party and the bloodbath of the 2010 midterms. But over the long run, as they say, “truth will out.” A decade after its passage, Obamacare’s survival is no longer in doubt, and its future has never been more promising. It has insured millions of Americans, even as its protections have become staples of middle-class life. At the law’s signing ceremony, then-Vice President Biden called the bill “big f---ing deal.” As president, he will have an opportunity to make it even a bigger one.",-1,http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/how-joe-biden-can-use-the-political-power-of-obamacare-to-expand-it/ar-BB1baVgh?li=BBnbcA1&srcref=rss&ocid=iehrs

Far from making it any worse for the wear, the ACA has improved the health care system overall. Finally, with the emergence of Covid-19, whole swaths of the electorate saw just how important the protections really were.

Beyond Trump’s personal divisiveness, nothing was more responsible for the Democrats’ big victories in the 2018 midterms than the party’s vow to protect Obamacare. Even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was savvy enough to understand the electorate’s evolving sentiment. When the president pressed Congress in 2019 to try once again to repeal and replace the law, McConnell retorted in his quietly devastating way: “I made it clear to [the president] that we were not going to be doing that in the Senate.”

There’s no mistaking why, during the presidential campaign this year, Biden made health care such a crucial focus of his advertising, second only to Trump’s character. As evidenced by Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s recent questions from the bench about a lawsuit over the ACA, the conservative Supreme Court also would prefer to leave Obamacare alone. If they don’t, the 2022 midterms are liable to be a repeat of 2018.

That should point Democrats at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue to three crucial takeaways for the months ahead. First, the elements of the bill that proved so controversial a decade ago—namely, the provisions that extended coverage to the working uninsured—eventually faded to become only a single element of the law’s broader appeal. Today, the protections for young adults and those with preexisting conditions have become a fixture of the American experience. Progressives often debate whether it’s more expedient to target benefits or spread them more widely. As is most often the case, the surest way to help the working poor is to tie their benefits to those that serve the middle class.

Second, Democrats should see Obamacare’s more enduring political success as a signal for how to carry the torch for reform further still. After Social Security established a retirement floor in 1935, progressives added new benefits, including disability pensions in 1956. After establishing Medicare in 1965, Washington created the prescription drug benefit in 2003. Democrats should push Obamacare on the same trajectory.

That should begin with a new effort to deploy the ACA’s Medicaid expansion in the 12 states that haven’t yet embraced it. Recall that Obamacare originally gave states the opportunity to expand (the state-administered and federally subsidized) Medicaid for the poor to those living slightly above the poverty line. The bill offered to cover the expansion’s full cost for the first several years, asking states to pay a mere pittance of the cost as time went on. Thirty-eight states have embraced the opportunity—but some Republicans still refuse. As governors plead with Washington for budget help amid the pandemic recession, President Biden should make them an offer that would be hard to refuse: for the federal government, once again, to cover 100 percent of the Medicaid expansion’s costs for all states. By merging budget aid with assistance for those afflicted with Covid-19, Democrats can make this a policy win-win.

Lastly, to take some pressure off the ACA’s insurance exchanges, Congress should pass legislation lowering the age of eligibility for Medicare from 65 to 58, regardless of which party takes the Senate majority. Much as the GOP embraced Medicare’s prescription drug benefit despite the cost, this should appeal to Republicans in Congress because their voting base trends older. Biden has proposed adding a public option to the ACA, as well—something Congress refused to embrace a decade ago, but that now represents the next logical step. It may not yet be politically feasible. But in the meantime, the burgeoning group of middle-aged uninsured Americans too young to meet Medicare’s present cutoff should be given an opportunity to buy in early—a down payment on the goal of ""Medicare for All.""

A decade ago, many would have been hard-pressed to argue that good policy was good politics in the case of Obamacare. Just think of the rise of the Tea Party and the bloodbath of the 2010 midterms. But over the long run, as they say, “truth will out.” A decade after its passage, Obamacare’s survival is no longer in doubt, and its future has never been more promising. It has insured millions of Americans, even as its protections have become staples of middle-class life. At the law’s signing ceremony, then-Vice President Biden called the bill a “big f---ing deal.” As president, he will have an opportunity to make it even a bigger one.",-1,https://www.politico.com/news/agenda/2020/11/19/rahm-emanuel-obamacare-entitlement-biden-438216
18,Emanuel,Rahm,legalinsurrection,"As the post-2020 election dust begins settling, for the Democrats anyway, former Obama stooge Rahm Emmanuel digs up and mercilessly flings at those Americans left behind by regressive, globalist policies insulting, condescending leftist advice. He tells unemployed, and soon-to-be-unemployed under the Harris-Biden administration, retail workers that they need to #LearnToCode.

In January of last year, I noted that left-media layoffs resulted in a gleeful response by the right, telling them to learn to code, advice many of these very people had disdainfully suggested for Kentucky coal miners whose livelihoods were decimated by anti-fossil fuel fanatics on the left, up to and including the Obama-Biden administration.

When our nation’s coal miners found themselves out of work, the left-media gleefully told them that they need to “learn to code.” After all, they were dinosaurs working, literally, with dinosaur fuels and needed to be reeducated for the global, technological economy. The condescending chant that rained down from the privileged ivory towers of the leftist elite: Learn. To. Code.

Big Tech was not amused.

And here we are again, in a horrific Groundhog Day recycling of the Obama-Biden administration: The Harris-Biden administration is about to declare war on American workers not only in the fossil fuels industries but in other staples of American enterprise like bricks and mortar retail sales.

On ABC, Rahm Emanuel literally says a Biden White House should tell people laid off from retail stores like JC Penney to learn to code. He actually said this. Amazing. pic.twitter.com/xlSnVi7445 — Curtis Houck (@CurtisHouck) November 7, 2020

Breitbart reports:

Laid-off retail workers should learn to code for new software jobs, says Democrat heavyweight Rahm Emanuel. “There’s going to be people, like at J.C. Penney and other retail [outlets]. Those jobs are not coming back,” Emanuel told ABC News November 6. “Give them the tools, six months, you’re going to become a computer coder. We’ll pay for it, and you’ll get millions of people to sign up for that,” Emanuel said. “They are not going back to parts of the retail economy, and we need to give them a lifeline to what’s the next chapter.”

Note the reemergence of one of the Socialist Democrats’ favorite tag lines: “Those jobs are not coming back.” It sounds like we will soon be back to the administration and oversight of America’s decline, and after four years of President Trump’s America First successes, I, for one, am not looking forward to that prospect.

The gun lobby is in retreat, same-sex marriage is the law of the land, and the imaginary “War on Christmas” is the least of anyone’s problems — and so a muscular new coalition is forming. The Supreme Court long served as a last line of defense against GOP lawmakers determined to eviscerate the right to choose, the right to vote, equal protection under the law, and environmental and workplace protections. But rather than just continue to play defense in the courts, Democrats should soon have the votes also to go on offense in the legislative arena.

By ramming through Judge Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination just weeks before the election, the GOP might have finally won the Supreme Court. But checks and balances are a two-way street, and the power Democrats are likely to wield beginning next year might reverberate until 2030. They should be careful not to squander it.

Some Democrats have called for expanding the number of justices to the Supreme Court in order to shift its ideological leaning. (The Washington Post)

It’s already happening. State legislatures are writing the protections provided in Roe v. Wade into law. Absent movement from Washington, states have embraced tough renewable-energy standards — and a Democrat-controlled Congress could advance a national approach to climate change. Legislators can make sure school districts benefit from equal funding. And if you thought that Democrats’ vows to maintain coverage for those with preexisting conditions played a role in their huge midterm victories in 2018, imagine the effect at the polls if the Trump court rips insurance away from families hit by covid-19 — and a Democratic Congress speedily steps in to restore it.

Despite Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.’s assertion that the high court just calls “balls and strikes,” the conservative majority’s evisceration of a Voting Rights Act reauthorization that had passed the Senate, 98-0, proves that justices are, in fact, legislating from the bench. So as they hand down a stream of unpopular decisions, Democrats will have multiple opportunities to campaign for legislative checks that will solidify and grow their new metropolitan majority of urban and suburban voters.

With health care, climate change and tax reform all on their to-do list, Democrats shouldn’t waste political capital attempting a political maneuver — court-packing — that not even Franklin Roosevelt could pull off at the height of the New Deal. Rather than expand the court, Democrats should expand the playing field. With the filibuster curtailed, they will be equipped to establish a new national voting rights regime that addresses not only the legacy of bigotry in the South but also conservative efforts to disenfranchise people of color across the country.

They will have an opportunity also to expand the district and appellate courts, where much of the key case law gets made, as Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.) has proposed. And they can move to bring a new level of transparency to our politics, exposing how dark money not only influences the legislative branch but also funds junkets and exotic retreats for judges and justices as well.

The wave election of 2010 that empowered Republicans for a decade has now played itself out. The majority of Americans aren’t going to march across a bridge back to 1955. If conservative judges try to push LGBTQ people back in the closet, women back in the alley, immigrants back on boats, voters back to facing poll taxes and other barriers, and workers back into sweatshops, the consequences at the polls will be devastating for the Republicans for years to come. A preview is only a couple of weeks away.

Progressives are right to be infuriated by the way conservatives have shattered norms to seize the court. But we shouldn’t let that anger blind us to the path to a new governing majority.

20,Emanuel,Rahm,wsj,"If you think President Trump is running behind on account of his bombastic style and divisive rhetoric, you’re missing the forest for the trees. Voters knew who this guy was four years ago, and nearly half the country voted for him anyway. His campaign this year is collapsing because the American people are recoiling from the essence of his governing agenda. Mr. Trump’s destructive record will define not only next month’s election but also Republican politics for years to come.

American presidential elections generally come in one of two varieties. The first is “change vs. the status quo.” That dynamic framed the 2008 election, when Sen. Barack Obama, running on a platform of hope and change, defeated Sen. John McCain. The same basic template shaped Sen. John Kennedy’s 1960 race against Vice President Richard Nixon. The second variety is “challenger vs. incumbent.” That’s what we had eight years ago, when Mitt Romney lost to Mr. Obama, a race that turned on the public’s impression of the president’s first-term success. Jimmy Carter vs. Ronald Reagan in 1980 reflected the same dynamic—but obviously toward a different outcome.

This year’s election is unique because it doesn’t fit either mold. In contrast with Hillary Clinton, who came off as a beacon of the elite establishment, Joe Biden is a clear agent of change, a working-class son of Scranton, Pa., who has lived the American dream and promises to reform, improve and expand the infrastructure of American life by bringing new ideas to Washington. But Mr. Trump is an agent of neither change nor the status quo. He ran promising to be a disruptive president. In both style and substance, his modus operandi is to exploit cultural resentments. So the 2020 campaign is broadly unprecedented, pitting a change agent against a disrupter.

Yet Mr. Trump wasn’t the first candidate to run as a disrupter. William Jennings Bryan did so beginning in 1896, challenging the Eastern corporate trusts. Huey Long planned to do so in 1936, challenging the New Deal from the left with a simple phrase: “A chicken in every pot, and every man a king!” More recently, Pat Buchanan, Ross Perot and Newt Gingrich each promised to be a disrupter before being shunted aside by Republican Party apparatchiks. Mr. Trump distinguished himself because he managed to win, even while running behind in the popular vote.

Now we’re seeing why Mr. Trump’s approach has historically been such a political failure. Four years of constant disruption has proved to be more than the American people bargained for. He bested Mrs. Clinton by 5 points among voters 65 and older. But today Mr. Biden leads by 21 points among seniors according to one poll. Mrs. Clinton lost noncollege white women by a yawning 27 points four years ago, but Mr. Biden has narrowed that gap to 6. Another poll found that Mrs. Clinton’s 3-point deficit with white college-educated women has shifted to a 24-point lead for Mr. Biden. And the mass of disaffected Americans, many of whom will emerge as “Biden Republicans,” isn’t limited to these three demographic groups.",-1,https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-change-beats-trumps-disruption-11602521888

A graduation ceremony at Bradley-Bourbonnais Community High School in Bradley, IL. Photo: Scott Olson/Getty Images

Americans today are deluged by a seemingly endless stream of horrible news. Wildfires. Hurricanes. Economic dislocation. Social unrest. Naked power grabs undermining hallowed institutions. All that amid a pandemic that has already taken 200,000 American lives, many of which might have been saved had the White House been even half-competent. The country at this moment could use something to cheer about. And while it’s not getting much attention, Chicago has some welcome news at the ready.

Consider this: Chicago Public Schools in 2020 boasted a record graduation rate of 82%, up from 56% just a decade ago, and the lowest ever dropout rate at 5.6%. That marks eight consecutive years of improvement in a district where 84% of students live at or below the poverty rate. Second, after Chicago in 2017 became the first and only school system in the country to make enrolling in college or community college, joining the armed forces, beginning a vocational program, or securing a job a prerequisite to receiving a high school diploma, 97.5% of last year’s graduating class walked secure in knowing what they were going to do next. Third, forthcoming data from the University of Chicago Crime Lab reveals that adolescent arrests dropped by 75% during the years the city made these educational gains, from 15,000 in 2010 to little more than 3,700 in 2019.

The biggest beneficiaries in each of these three trends were adolescents of color. Young men and women from Black and Hispanic backgrounds, primarily, made the biggest jumps in graduation rates and college enrollments and saw the biggest decline in arrests. But if you think these results were driven by the changes my mayoral administration made in the courtroom and the classroom, you’d be looking in all the wrong places. Without a doubt, I worked hard on both fronts from lengthening the school day and redesigning the city’s high school curriculum to decriminalizing marijuana. But a big part of Chicago’s success has been driven by a simple realization: Young people spend only 20 % of their time in school, meaning that 80% is spent elsewhere. So in thinking about how to break the school-to-prison pipeline, we decided to take a different tack: We would make a huge investment as a city in what happens before and after the school bell rings.

Without any federal help, and despite significant fiscal headwinds, we doubled our career-based summer jobs program from 14,500 to 33,000 positions, simultaneously requiring participants to sign a pledge committing themselves to enroll in college. Inspired by our city’s former first lady, Maggie Daley, we grew our after school program from around 65,000 to 110,000 youths and focused those afternoon hours on artistic expression, athletic activities, and academic programs designed to burnish their life skills.

And we partnered with the nonprofit Becoming a Man (BAM) to establish the largest citywide mentoring program in America, growing from 150 to 7,500 young men in just a few years. In the city’s 20 most challenging neighborhoods, young men now meet with a mentor for four hours a day, five days a week, nine months of the year, from 7th to 10th grades. Among those kids enrolled in BAM, there’s since been a 50% drop in arrests for violent crime, overall arrests have dropped by more than a third, and the on-time graduation rate has grown by almost a fifth.

Investing in young peoples’ “off hours” offers a pragmatic and enormously consequential way to end the school-to-prison pipeline.

These investments have dramatically reshaped our city’s classrooms, courtrooms, and our children’s futures. And that’s for a glaringly obvious reason: Without even thinking about it, middle-class parents invest vast sums nurturing their kids outside school. Summer camp. Little league. Soccer clubs. Piano lessons. SAT prep. That extra engagement gives those adolescents big advantages they maintain for life. It keeps them out of trouble. It provides them with additional caring adults in their lives. And all of that combines to give them a leg up in school.

Chicago simply wanted kids coming from poorer families to be afforded the same basic supports and opportunities. When cynics say that “those kids” from “that family” in “that sort of neighborhood” can’t achieve more, they rarely consider all the reasons why kids achieve. Millions of young men and women in this country wake up each morning presuming they won’t live to see their 21st birthday. So if we’re going to get them to begin asking themselves instead where they’ll be at 21, we need to provide them with the emotional connections and role models that are crucial to every adolescent’s development — supports that middle and upper adolescents often take for granted.

When the fog of Covid-19 lifts and kids return to their normal academic routines, adults shouldn’t return the rote, brain-dead, politically contentious policy debates that have stymied progress for decades. Beyond educational and criminal justice reform, investing in young peoples’ “off hours” offers a pragmatic and enormously consequential way to end the school-to-prison pipeline. It’s all borne from a simple and commonsense insight: If you want to see students succeed in the classroom, then you need to invest in their lives outside of school. That’s as true in urban America as it is in the suburbs. In a moment of national soul-searching, it’s a reason to hope and work for a better future.",-1,https://gen.medium.com/ending-the-school-to-prison-pipeline-starts-outside-the-classroom-4a8781aaf168

Democratic nominee Joe Biden has embraced an entirely different approach — one centered on breadth. He won the nomination by refusing, despite fervor on the left, to abandon the core of his identity — namely his impulse to reach out both to his right and left in search of common ground. By inviting remarks from John Kasich, Colin Powell, Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and so many people in between, the Democratic convention demonstrated Biden’s belief in building coalitions so diverse they would struggle to fit beneath a Barnum & Bailey big top.

Set aside the national popular vote, which Democrats are likely to win because Trump has mobilized Democrats in cobalt-blue states as never before. The outcome of this election hinges on a handful of swing states. In Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, White working-class citizens constituted 67 percent, 62 percent, and 62 percent of nonvoters in the 2016 election, by one estimate some 4.8 million voters. That is the core threat Democrats now face. It means that the pool of potential new Trump voters is very deep.

Fortunately, just as Trump has new voters to mobilize, Biden does as well. Since 2016, suburban women in swing states have stampeded into the Democratic Party. Older voters, for years a strength of the GOP, are likely to vote en masse for Biden. Latino voters could play an outsize role. And if the outcome of the South Carolina primary is indicative of enthusiasm in the Black community, the Democratic ticket will outperform its reach from 2016.

Trump’s challenge is to find ways to excite his base without driving voters who already find him offensive into Biden’s camp — and that is likely to be very difficult to do.

Biden’s challenge is to continue to broaden his coalition so that it negates the new voters Trump is able to excavate from the depths of his aggrieved base. Every decision the Biden campaign makes needs to be understood through that prism. If Trump’s rage and rants against establishment elites prompt more of his voters to come to the polls this year, Biden will need a strong result from what I call the “Metropolitan majority”: voters in cities and suburbs. And while Democrats may be able to pull some additional support out of constituencies that generally support our candidates, Biden will need to win additional suburban and college-educated female votes, as well.

None of that is to argue that Democrats should ignore Trump’s provocations. But it does suggest that we focus on issues that will expand our appeal to the women (and some men) who have grown to dislike Trump, but are susceptible to believing that a Biden presidency might point the country to a political extreme.

In addition to talking about climate change, we should focus on clean air and clean water. Rather than speaking about infrastructure in general, we should focus on shortening daily commutes and reducing traffic. Beyond promising to address the burden of student debt, we should focus on expanding quality education across the board. Biden’s convention speech was effective because it not only reintroduced him to the voting public but also went a long way toward inoculating him from the claim that he’s a radical. But Trump will keep trying to make that case.

Both nominees have arrived at strategies that accurately reflect their best chances of winning. Biden could never have relied on the depth of a single constituency — simple demographics dictate that Democrats build a coalition. Trump’s divisive record precluded him from any hope of building a coalition. The president’s only real hope of earning a second term rests on provoking Biden into a fight that frames the Democrat as a man of the far left.

In the heat of any given moment, Biden supporters can’t forget that. Satisfying as it might be to take the bait, Democrats need to resist the temptation to fight this campaign on Trump’s terms.

24,Emanuel,Rahm,wsj,"President Trump is eager to frame this year’s election as another 1968, when chaos sent voters fleeing to the candidate who promised law and order. That’s far-fetched, given 2020’s fundamentals. More than any other recent presidential race, this campaign looks like a repeat of 1980. That’s when Republicans wooed the “Reagan Democrats” out of FDR’s New Deal coalition and into the GOP fold. This year, Democrats have an opportunity to chisel off a demographic that will come to be known as “Biden Republicans.” The question is whether Democrats will let these voters migrate back to the GOP after November, or whether our party will become their permanent safe harbor.

First, let’s be clear about 1968. Two wings of the Democratic Party went to war with each other, essentially upending the progressive movement until Bill Clinton pieced things back together a quarter-century later. Today, by contrast, even if Democrats disagree on the path forward, we share the same objectives: expanding health coverage, curtailing climate change, and promoting economic equality and social justice. For that reason alone, the 1968 analogy doesn’t hold.

This year, Democrats have the chance to achieve a generational transformation. Beyond broadening the coalition to include moderate voters who oppose President Trump, we could deepen our base by turning disaffected Republicans into Democrats. Voters in places that were once beyond our reach—suburban parts of Maricopa County, Ariz.; Mecklenburg County, N.C.; and Bucks County, Pa., for example—are open to conversion. So beyond thinking about the outcome this November, Democrats need to focus on what happens after Mr. Trump has been ushered off the stage.

The 1980 election was a touchstone because it offered clear evidence that, in politics, culture counts. Reagan Democrats in places like Macomb County, Mich., walked away from the New Deal coalition not because Democrats had abandoned progressive economics or organized labor. Rather, Reagan used crime and welfare to argue that the left had turned its back on working-class values. Most important, these voters stuck with the GOP even as Reagan championed tax cuts for the wealthy, revealing that cultural concerns tied corporate leaders and unionized rank-and-file workers—an unlikely coalition that’s lasted for decades.

The GOP long relied on wedge issues—God, guns, gays—to bury Democratic candidates running in competitive states and districts. But the country has evolved, and more voters are seeking candidates who embody diversity, openness and compassion. Louie Gohmert-style responses to the pandemic and stupefying denials of climate change have betrayed the GOP’s cultural aversion to science. The Black Lives Matter signs in windows across suburban the U.S. reveal what so many Americans think of Mr. Trump’s divisiveness. Set the underlying merits aside—these issues reveal a cultural shift that cuts against the Republican Party.

A similar thing happened in 2000. Compared with Al Gore, reporters concluded, George W. Bush appeared more comfortable in his own skin. But as president, Bush turned out to be so comfortable in his own skin that he let Dick Cheney and Donald H. Rumsfeld (and other officials around them) talk him into pursuing phantom Iraqi weapons of mass destruction — with disastrous consequences. In the past 20 years, the media bears some responsibility for putting an inexperienced cowboy and a corrupt reality television star in the White House. The results speak for themselves.

Of course, no one forced Democratic hopeful Michael Dukakis to put on a helmet and jump into a tank, as he did in 1988. But if, as the Trump White House desperately hopes, the media decide this year to make a big deal of Biden’s age, this race could tighten in less time than it takes Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) to announce that she’s “disappointed” about Trump’s latest tweet.

If journalists decide to turn a few mangled phrases into a real conversation about Biden’s mental acuity, they will do a disservice not only to their embattled profession but also, more importantly, to our democracy.

We already know how the Trump White House wants reporters to frame the race: to pit the president, imperfect though he may be, against a “senile” Biden. The president’s trip to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for a medical acuity test (followed by repeated calls on Biden to do the same) was revealing on its own, but part of his larger campaign to change the focus from the novel coronavirus and work the refs. And if journalists begin looking for story lines that “raise questions” about Biden’s purported mental impairment, Republicans will have played them again.

Can we just please be reasonable about who’s actually showing signs of strain?

Trump has speculated that bleach can cure covid-19. (He later insisted he was asking sarcastically.)

He has suggested dropping nuclear bombs on hurricanes.

He has hinted that windmills cause cancer.

He refuses to say he will accept the results of the election.

If the public has a worry about anyone’s judgment in this campaign, it shouldn’t be Biden’s.

Here’s what everyone knows: Trump is behind in the polls on account of his abysmal performance — not because, as he likes to whine, the media doesn’t like him.

Biden, meanwhile, has several lifetimes in government. He was the steady hand that led the recovery implementation in 2009 — a program that rolled out an $800 billion stimulus package. He frequently served as the Obama administration’s point person in complex international crises. He oversaw the moonshot for cancer research. He’s uniquely qualified to lead the country at this fraught moment.

Even as the number of U.S. coronavirus cases passes 3 million, President Trump has repeatedly played down covid-19’s toll on the country. (The Washington Post)

The media will be right to scrutinize the former vice president, and fact-check his comments. They should examine his choice for vice president closely. But if they hammer at a specious senility narrative, Trump, Brad Parscale, Stephen Miller and Jared Kushner wouldn’t be able to script it any better.

Suburbia’s emergence as a new Democratic base traces an arc similar to one scribed over the past decade in Colorado: Once considered a swing state at best, the state is now cobalt blue, where the GOP can’t even hope to compete in presidential elections. That’s instructive. Nancy Pelosi is speaker today not because Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York inspired fervor on social media, but because Lucy McBath of Georgia, Abigail Spanberger of Virginia and Lauren Underwood of Illinois, among many others, flipped mostly suburban red districts in 2018. Those victories were fueled by women with college degrees. We need to learn from those wins and replicate them around the country.

It’s true that younger voters helped propel Obama into the White House — but Obama’s coalition was unique to Obama. Biden is developing a coalition all his own. Black and urban centers will be crucial in 2020, and Biden is poised to be the first Democrat since Al Gore to win a constituency that’s particularly important in swing states, namely voters 65 and older. Clinton, Obama and John Kerry all fell short; Biden appears to be getting a majority of seniors, never easy for a Democrat.

But it is suburban women who are creating the new Democratic majority and the change that can bring. After suburban districts painted Virginia’s state legislature blue last year, Democrats managed to deliver legislative victories on gun safety, abortion rights and racial equality. And because that progress has inspired so much additional support, Virginia is now out of President Trump’s reach. Unlike voters who will either vote for Biden or just stay home, college-educated suburban women will choose between Biden and Trump in November, meaning each additional vote from this group is essentially a vote Trump loses. In other words, like black voters, these women are a key to reestablishing a progressive judiciary, addressing social injustice and expanding economic prosperity from the middle out.

To win Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Florida or Arizona, Democrats will need to speak explicitly to these voters’ concerns. We should talk as much about environmental protection — clean water and clean air — as we do about climate change. When discussing infrastructure, we should highlight traffic reduction as much as light rail. We should pay as much attention to expanding universal pre-kindergarten and improving K-12 education funding as we do to college costs. And beyond talking about Trump’s cultural divisiveness, we should focus on the culture of corruption in Trump’s Washington.

Black women are the Democrats’ most reliable voting bloc. Here’s how seven prominent black female activists and media figures say Joe Biden can win them over. (The Washington Post)

The Trump campaign is so focused on driving enthusiasm within his narrow base of white male populist voters that he won’t even try to compete for the suburbs — he has already ceded that ground. That marks a unique and historic opportunity for Democrats, not only for 2020 but also for years beyond. It’s not enough to be an alternative to Trump — we need an affirmative agenda that binds the “metropolitan majority” of urban and suburban voters. If our political and legislative strategies reflect and include the interests of both the nation’s urban core and college-educated suburban women, a President Biden and his Democratic successors are sure to be able to enact much more of our party’s progressive agenda in the years and decades to come.",-1,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/06/24/democrats-new-loyalists-suburban-women/
27,Emanuel,Rahm,nytimes,"The CARES Act has gone a long way toward addressing some of these issues temporarily. It uses federal funds to add 13 extra weeks of coverage, adds $600 per week in benefits, and extends cash assistance to freelancers, contractors and the self-employed. Unfortunately, these improvements will start to phase out in July.

Our initiative would make the CARES Act reforms permanent. A national unemployment assistance program would cover all workers who lose jobs, regardless of the type of contract they have, provide funds to employers to keep workers on the job and extend cash assistance until an economic downturn ends. National unemployment insurance would finally provide security to all workers.

For the federal government to assume the costs and administration of Medicaid and unemployment insurance, the states would have to agree to use freed up resources — a quarter of a trillion dollars per year — to invest in education and infrastructure. As our grandmother would say “Such a Bargain!” (It sounds better with an Eastern European accent.)

Increase State Investment in Education

Twenty-first century economies require students to start learning earlier than kindergarten and later than high school. States would be required to provide early childhood programs to every child born into poverty, as well as full-day pre-K education to every 3- and 4-year-old, which many cities have already instituted. In a few years, these types of programs become fiscally self-sustaining by reducing medical, educational, and criminal justice costs. Over the long term, it’s been found, they can return as much as $7 to $15 for every dollar invested, and ensure higher incomes for children when they become adults.

In the 21st century three-quarters of jobs require more than a high school education. The primary way states will have to improve funding for higher education is copying what was pioneered by Chicago and Tennessee and replicated in numerous states and cities with free community college: increase funding for public colleges and universities. Since 2000, funding for public colleges and universities has dropped, causing the average tuition for in-state students to more than triple. The American Modernization Initiative would lower or cap future tuition increases, and at a minimum would provide the first two years free.

Modernize State Investment in Infrastructure

We all know the dire straits of American transportation systems, school buildings, water treatment facilities, and utilities. The broken dams in Midland, Mich., remind us we don’t have a day to waste to make these investments.

Under the initiative, states would have to increase their funding for infrastructure, a strategic investment. With millions of unemployed construction workers, it would generate millions of needed jobs. Every dollar spent generates from $1.50 to $2.50 in short-term economic returns and increases business productivity.",-1,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/15/opinion/medicaid-unemployment-insurance.html
28,Emanuel,Rahm,lrb,"Some​ books appear at exactly the wrong moment, which only makes them more interesting. Rahm Emanuel was mayor of Chicago between 2011 and 2019. In short order he has turned out a boastful and boosterish account of his time in office, which also serves as his manifesto for a new way of doing politics. Emanuel believes that the world’s hundred leading cities generate the economic, intellectual and cultural energy of the planet. As a result, he says, ‘Mayors effectively run the world now.’ Emanuel quit a high-flying career in Washington to return to his hometown of Chicago. He had been an adviser to Bill Clinton, then a leading congressman and finally Obama’s chief of staff. Some felt that he may have been headed for the White House in his own right. But he has no regrets. Who would want to be president these days? He thinks the federal government is where good ideas go to die. Cities like Chicago are where it’s at. It just takes mayors like him to make it happen.

The Nation City was published at the end of February, a few days before the US recorded its first Covid-19 fatality. Three months later, Chicago alone has seen around four thousand deaths and more than eighty thousand confirmed cases. Large parts of the city have shut down. No one can blame Emanuel for having failed to anticipate any of this. Still, the disease has left him looking a little foolish. His template for how to turn your city into a model of dynamic enterprise and liveable community is so very 2019. It comes with easy to follow instructions. First, focus on education, particularly in the early years, and make sure kids are in school as much as possible. This is a good idea, but hard to do at the moment. Second, encourage tourism, which is the great provider of new jobs. Third, invest heavily in the airport. Fourth, attract all the service industries you can, especially restaurants. Fifth, form partnerships wherever possible with universities and work to bring in more students. Finally, if you get stuck, ask Mike Bloomberg what to do next: he’ll know. You see the problem. At least Emanuel didn’t go all in on the cruise-ship business, though if Chicago were on the coast he might have done.

Let’s start with Bloomberg. It’s not Emanuel’s fault that his mayoral mentor’s political lustre has been tarnished by a lamentable late bid to capture the Democratic presidential nomination. Bloomberg achieved his primary goal, which was to stop Bernie Sanders. It cost him a lot – in money and personal humiliation – but at least his failure helped to focus minds on the alternatives: suddenly Joe Biden didn’t look so bad. But it was the way he failed. Bloomberg came across as such a mayor – patrician, managerial, used to getting his own way, impatient with the questions, preferring policy pronouncements to raw politics. He seemed to believe he was above it all: a technocrat among the politicos. Of course, Emanuel would say that this proves his point: mayors aren’t cut out to be president because they are problem-solvers, not grandstanders. But the kind of mayoral politics Emanuel champions has a tendency to look a little aloof when it moves outside its comfort zone. It wasn’t so much that Bloomberg was ill at ease on the national stage. It was that he thought it didn’t matter.

Not all mayors are like that. Boris Johnson, who was mayor of London, has made the move up from city to national government, in part by doing nothing to conceal his appetite to dominate the bigger stage. But Johnson’s growing discomfort as prime minister reflects his mayoral roots. In London he was used to coasting whenever he could and delegating the hard stuff. As PM he can’t. And we all pay the price. Bloomberg, by contrast, is much happier in his role as the man who brings mayors together. Since his tenure as mayor of New York ended in 2013 he has hosted regular gatherings for the leaders of America’s cities, and he sees himself as a conduit for good policy and good practice. Emanuel talks of ‘the brotherhood and sisterhood that exists among mayors’. Bloomberg is their paterfamilias. What Emanuel values in these mayoral get-togethers is the absence of speechmaking or a set agenda. It’s simply a way for overworked executives to kick back, share their problems and spark some creative thinking. Emanuel’s thesis is that these days the best political ideas move horizontally from city to city, rather than vertically from local to national government or back again. It’s a vision of politics that relies on a network of likeminded local leaders bypassing federal bureaucracy to get things done. Its attraction is that it is non-partisan – the mayors come from both sides of the political divide – and pragmatic. The downside is that it looks a lot like a private political club.

There was another mayor running for the Democratic nomination this year: Pete Buttigieg, from South Bend, Indiana. He also features heavily in this book as an example of what makes mayors different. Buttigieg argues that mayors are far more connected with the lives of the people they represent than other politicians because they are much closer to the ground. City leaders can’t take time out from their jobs because the city never sleeps: something always needs fixing. Unlike national politicians, they have to live permanently in the places they run, and they have to respond to their constituents’ concerns in real time. ‘You can’t offer alternative facts,’ Buttigieg says. ‘If a road is in bad shape, you can’t point to it and say: “This is the greatest road in the history of roads.” People will call BS.’ What you can do is ‘be nimble and try different ideas and see what works and what doesn’t. And in a matter of a few years, you can literally see things actually working, people getting jobs and neighbourhoods rising.’ He calls it ‘the hardest and most rewarding job in the world’. It makes you wonder why Buttigieg wanted to be president. Still, there’s no question that in his case sounding like a mayor was a big part of his national appeal. More pragmatism, less BS. It’s the same argument Rory Stewart gave for quitting national politics in order to run for mayor of London, before the pandemic put a stop to that. Being mayor was the only way you could be sure you were making a difference to people’s lives.

Emanuel sums it up: city government is ‘immediate, intimate and impactful’. What creates the impact is not simply the proximity of the politicians to the people they govern. It’s the proximity of those people to each other. The density of city populations is what creates their energy as well as the need to find solutions in double quick time, before the system gets overwhelmed. As Emanuel points out, this has been the great shift in how we understand city life in recent decades. From the 1960s to the 1980s urban density was thought to be what pushed residents away: it was associated with crime, inefficiency and crumbling infrastructure. People moved out to the suburbs and beyond, looking for space and security. But then two things happened. First, crime rates started to fall dramatically in many big cities, for reasons that are still much debated (Emanuel attributes it in large part to innovative local policy initiatives). Second, the tech revolution, which was supposed to accelerate the move out of the cities, ended up having the opposite effect. In the 1990s it was assumed that digital communication would strengthen the impulse to get away: why live in the blighted city when you could work from home? But not only did people not much want to work from home, the tech revolution drove a desire for more human connection. In the age of the internet it turned out we wanted to rub up against each other as much as possible, in order to share ideas, services and experiences. The tech companies were no different. They didn’t want to be outside the city looking in. They wanted to be at the heart of it. Where the tech companies led, the rest followed.

A service economy puts a premium on physical proximity: restaurants near businesses, businesses near universities, universities near parks, parks near schools, schools near homes, homes near restaurants. If you can walk between them all, so much the better. And if you can’t, build cycle lanes. So begins the virtuous circle of bringing people together in order to produce new ways of cohabiting, which then allow more and more people to join. It’s not clear what comes first: the crowds or the solutions. ‘Did cities realise population increases because they became more liveable?’ Emanuel asks. ‘Or did they become more liveable because population increase demanded it?’ In the end it doesn’t much matter. What matters is what works. Emanuel’s blueprint for 21st-century city governance rests almost entirely on the assumption that this model is both progressive and sustainable. Bustling city life forces politicians to breach their ideological red lines; it forces citizens to drop their prejudices against each other; it forces businesses to notice the environment in which they are operating. Above all, it keeps supplying new ways of doing things, so nothing gets old. In cities, good ideas will drive out the bad. In national governments, bad ideas can drive out the good. That’s Emanuel’s pitch: bet on the city, because necessity is the mother of invention.

What​ he doesn’t say is that this is sustainable only if you assume that nothing will disrupt the benign relationship between population growth and innovation. But, as we’ve learned in recent months, any model of politics that relies on increased human density is intensely vulnerable to natural disruption. Bringing people together in ever larger numbers means that if something goes wrong, everyone suffers. Emanuel takes for granted that if we keep up the population pressure, human ingenuity will always stay one step ahead of natural risk. Ever since Malthus warned that population growth was bound to outpace food production this has been the technocrats’ response: not if we have anything to do with it! But in the 21st century, with the natural world changing faster than at any point in history and the danger escalating all the time, densely populated cities look very fragile. There are still plenty of things that can be done to mitigate the risks. But the sheer weight of human numbers might well create problems faster than solutions.

Emanuel insists that the intimate but vulnerable city is still a better bet than the nation-state, which suffers from being too remote and therefore not vulnerable enough. National politicians can afford to fiddle while the world burns because they are insulated from the immediate consequences of their actions. They can play partisan politics because doing nothing rarely costs anyone their job. It’s easier to block solutions at the national level than it is to come up with new ones. As a result, Emanuel remains convinced that cities are far more likely to make a difference to climate change than national governments. This is in part because they have all the urgency and the dynamism. But it’s also because they are responsible for most of the carbon emissions. Cities run most of the world’s transport; they use most of the world’s energy; and they contain most of the world’s buildings, especially the vast, overheated, incandescent ones. What’s more, they don’t need to wait on interminable international diplomacy to address these problems. What Emanuel calls ‘urban diplomacy’ – the global version of the Bloomberg network – makes it possible for mayors to pool ideas and learn best practice. Under many electoral systems – including those of the US and the UK – rural voters still get a decisive say in choosing national governments. But if cities do what they can it won’t matter, because doing what they can will be enough on its own.

Underpinning this argument about the future is a long-term perspective on the past. Emanuel points out that when the US federal government was created at the end of the 18th century it catered to a nation of around four million citizens, not so many more people than currently live in Chicago. A country of that size could be governed intimately. Today, with more than 300 million inhabitants, it can barely be governed at all. Cities are also a much more durable site of government than the nation-state. Cities have been around for more than ten thousand years. Rome has been governed as a city, in one form or another, for nearly three thousand years. We have had nation-states for barely four hundred years. Cities, for all their obvious artificiality, are more natural-seeming than nation-states. Nations are only ever imagined communities. Cities, Emanuel suggests, are real ones.

He is right to argue that cities are more than just mini states. What they offer is something quite different from national politics. They don’t police their borders, as states do. They don’t print their own money. They don’t run their own armies. They don’t fight wars. Of course, cities used to do all these things, and more. For much of the last three millennia, Rome has been a place of extreme political violence and near perpetual warfare. Until relatively recently, cities didn’t just have borders; they had walls and gates and guards to keep watch on who came in and who went out. Cities controlled commerce and regulated the money supply. To claim that cities have always done politics differently – shown how to make it more intimate, more liveable – is a little disingenuous. Cities used to be like nation-states, only smaller, more violent and less stable. The sort of city government Emanuel champions has only been made possible because the nation-state now exists to shoulder much of the burden of warfare and finance. It is one of the luxuries of the modern age. Mayors get to do Buttigieg-style bijou politics because states do the heavy lifting.

Cities are still responsible for policing their inhabitants and the possibility of extreme violence remains. Emanuel addresses Chicago’s notorious problem with gun violence and describes some of the steps he took to mitigate it. He advocates a mix of technological innovation – he is a big fan of the idea of predictive policing, which uses ‘data sets from the University of Chicago Crime Lab to help predict where a shooting may occur within a six-block radius’ – and tough community love. He is particularly proud of another University of Chicago-based programme called Becoming a Man, which uses relaxation and meditation techniques to teach young men how to deal with frustration. It’s something, but it does nothing to address inequalities in the city. As I write, Chicago is one of many American cities where riots have broken out following the killing of George Floyd by a city police officer in Minneapolis. An article in the Atlantic asked of the increasingly militarised response: ‘Are they police departments or armies?’ The governor of Illinois, like many of his counterparts, has called in the national guard. The protesters want a complete overhaul of the way the city polices its black citizens. If history is any guide, they are not going to get one.

Emanuel acknowledges that cities can’t replicate many of the functions of nation-states. As always, he tries to put a positive spin on it. He thinks cities benefit enormously from not being able to tinker with the money supply. Mayors have to run a tight ship, which makes for discipline. He quotes Buttigieg again: ‘There is no deficit spending in cities, no printing of money. By law I have to balance the budget every year. We spend down cash reserves some years and borrow money sometimes, but there’s no cheating on whether we have enough money to do what you say you’re going to do.’ Of course, some cities end up borrowing more than they can afford to and effectively go bust. The coronavirus crisis has left many facing financial ruin, as revenues dry up. The nation-state will have to bail them out, as it always does, no doubt extracting promises that they will run even tighter ships in future. Emanuel, like Buttigieg and Bloomberg, wants to present streamlined and efficient city government as a practical necessity rather than a political preference. He says it is the only way to get things done, now that federal government ‘is no longer a progressive entity’. Politicians of the centre-left effectively have a choice: waste time on national pipe dreams or work within their means at the city level to impact the lives of the poorest citizens. It’s the Stop Bernie project all over again.

To Obama-era veterans like Emanuel, Sanders is the utopian, with his wishful, something-for-nothing schemes. But there is something utopian about the Emanuel project too, wishing away whole swathes of public life. By writing off national government as a site for progressive politics, Emanuel treats cities as sufficient for what needs to be done: just let the mayors get on with it! But national government doesn’t go away just because you are no longer interested in it. It retains its power. It has the capacity both to restore order and to unleash chaos. Cities are not immune when things go wrong. Indeed, because most people live in cities, they are right in the firing line. ‘It would behoove progressives now,’ Emanuel writes, ‘given their dominance in urban areas, to concentrate on local government, not to think of policies going from top down or bottom up but instead to think of them flowing horizontally, across the country and across the world, from city to city to city.’ It’s all there: the assumption that politics means policy; the reliance on electoral capture of urban constituencies; the globalist grandiosity; that oh-so-mayorly word ‘behoove’. What’s missing is the question of what happens to the national government while the mayors are keeping busy.

Emanuel​ barely mentions the many people who live in rural areas rather than cities, let alone all those who live in the middle grounds we still call ‘towns’. He assumes that towns are just mini cities, despite the fact that many – especially in former industrial areas – are increasingly depopulated and suffering the fate that was anticipated for cities in the 1980s: as people leave, other people have less reason to stay, unless they have no choice. In the UK, as in the US, towns don’t necessarily vote the way cities do – it was the towns of the Midlands and the North, along with rural areas, that gave Boris Johnson his electoral victory last year. The population of towns tends to be older than the population of cities. Many towns don’t have a university, which is the strongest indicator of voting preference (or progressive capture). This makes it very hard for them to participate in the kind of university-philanthropy-innovation nexus that lies at the heart of Emanuel’s project. (There are exceptions, of course – the US has plenty of college towns, like Buttigieg’s South Bend, home of Notre Dame.) This year is not a propitious time to start building new universities, with much higher education migrating online, perhaps never to return. At the back of Emanuel’s mind appears to be a belief that is often implicit in technocratic policymaking: people simply need to move to where the action is.

Many people who live outside cities, however, will not move, especially not now. Just because the predictions that a home-working revolution was on the way in the 1990s were proved wrong doesn’t mean they will be wrong this time. It seems likely that we are about to enter a new phase of city life. If the 1960s-80s were the emptying out, and the 1990s-2010s were the return, the 2020s-40s could well be the time of urban uncertainty, with some going one way, some the other, depending on forces beyond their control. National governments, on which city governments still rely to underpin their finances and to secure their authority, are likely to reflect this uncertainty in their makeup. It would be a mistake for progressives to think they can win through cities without restoring their fortunes at the national level as well. It would be an even bigger mistake to assume that all the people who don’t live in cities will be so grateful for the progress being made in them that they will eventually jump on the progressive bandwagon. Surely Trump’s America and Johnson’s Britain are proof against that.

Emanuel borrows a phrase from the early 20th-century Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, one of the architects of the New Deal, who said that the American states were the ‘laboratories of democracy’. That title, Emanuel claims, now belongs to the cities. What he means is that cities can try out new policy ideas to see what sticks. But he has almost nothing to say about trying out new forms of democracy. Why not experiment with different ways of making democratic decisions, rather than simply having the mayors decide? Emanuel is not much interested in participatory budgeting, or citizens’ assemblies, or direct action, or even electoral reform, despite pointing out that by 2040 almost three-quarters of Americans will live in just 15 states (where the biggest cities are), meaning 30 per cent of voters will choose 70 per cent of senators. He just shrugs – what can you expect from a legislative system that is no longer fit for purpose? His is a conservative vision of progressive politics. The nation-state is broken and needs to be left alone in the hope that it won’t cause too much trouble. The city, where the demographics more or less guarantee that the right people will win, can be relied on to carry the torch. But the nation-state can still cause plenty of trouble. And the city can’t be relied on. Progress is not guaranteed, and it can come in a wide variety of forms. Three months is a long time in politics.",-1,https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v42/n12/david-runciman/ask-mike
29,Emanuel,Rahm,washingtonpost,"He embodies this theme at all hours. He plays golf as the United States nears the 100,000-death mark. He refuses to wear a mask. He claims to be taking hydroxychloroquine. He tweets “LIBERATE MICHIGAN” even as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is issuing guidelines to continue to isolate. He’s entirely focused on turning out his base, and it shouldn’t be lost on anybody that his base is more energized than ours at the moment.

Trump wants to color this moment as one in which he is leading America forward and Democrats are dragging their feet. It is a narrative that falls nicely into his grievance-driven worldview. Each time we resist his efforts to reopen the economy, we come off as that much more effete and out of touch. He’s setting a trap for us.

And in politics, you can’t beat something with nothing. Rather than centering our agenda on resistance to the reopening he intends to trumpet, Democrats should respond by explaining how we intend to rebuild America.

To be clear, the issue here isn’t policy — or even economics. It’s culture. Democrats are so aligned with data, science and logic that we’ve lost sight of why so much of the country is skeptical of expertise. It was the elites who claimed we’d be welcomed as liberators to Iraq, where we would find weapons of mass destruction. It was the elites who talked up collateralized mortgages, and then bailed out Wall Street while Main Street suffered. In too many cases, the elites have gotten the big ones wrong and never paid any price.

Partly as a result, Trump’s insistence that the country reopen resonates. Set aside that he’s substantively responsible for the carnage: This is the first national crisis that hasn’t received a national response — and the consequences are obvious to everyone. Trump is keen to pose as the lone voice sticking it to the haughty, know-it-all institutional experts, but he doesn’t have any idea how to get us out of the current economic and medical morass.

Democrats need to move beyond resistance, reluctance and mere relief. Americans are hurting today — and many fear, quite understandably, that the millions of jobs and small businesses destroyed by the pandemic may never come back, even when the lights come back on. Reopening the economy isn’t going to bring back all the jobs lost at both the big chain outlets such as J.C. Penney and at all the neighborhood retail storefronts. Maybe most pointedly, reopening the economy won’t do anything to protect the Michiganders whose lives were destroyed when obsolete dams burst, flooding huge swaths of Midland County.

Let’s force Trump to fight on our turf — reality — rather than let his diversions define the campaign. What if, rather than sparring with Trump, Democrats presented a comprehensive plan to rebuild our roads, bridges, dams, school, hospitals and more — so we emerge from this crisis with a more vibrant economy? We will need millions of additional coders, cybersecurity analysts, nurses, construction workers, teachers, aides and more in the decades to come. How about offering these workers this bargain: As their hunt for work continues, Washington will give them another bonus if they pursue an online degree in coding, advanced manufacturing or nursing assistance, among other areas. We can turn crisis into opportunity, transforming our workforce into an army of American rebirth.

It is not enough for Democrats to say, “Let’s go slowly!” Besides, rebuilding is a better pitch than reopening. Democrats have never lost when promising to invest in America and Americans. And it will put the Republicans at a disadvantage. Faced with a proactive agenda that appeals to the whole of the electorate, Trump and Senate Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) will be the ones who appear reticent to move forward.

To help Americans laid low by the pandemic rebuild their lives and communities, we need a real and affirmative agenda people can compare to Trump’s empty grievances.

30,Emanuel,Rahm,gen,"Food Deserts Are Their Own Pandemic Hot Spots

The line to get into a grocery store in Chicago, Illinois on May 1, 2020. Photo: Xinhua News Agency/Getty Images

There are a great many factors that have made African American communities more vulnerable to Covid-19. Economic disparities, unequal access to health care, and legacies of discrimination all unquestionably play big roles. But anecdotal evidence suggests that something else is also at work. Within Chicago, African American neighborhoods with nearby access to grocery stores boast a lower Covid-19 mortality rate than those that remain food deserts. And while access to nutrition isn’t a panacea for the deep-seated issues that undermine access to the American dream, the absence of fresh food is a telltale sign of curtailed opportunity.

The disparities are remarkable and must not be overlooked. Woodlawn, a predominantly African American neighborhood on the city’s South Side, not far from the University of Chicago, was without a grocery store for 47 years until Jewel opened a new facility in 2019. Today, the neighborhood has a Covid-19 mortality rate of 2.1 deaths per every 10,000 residents. Austin, a neighborhood on the far West Side that’s just over the border from the prosperous suburb of Oak Park, remains today without sufficient access to fresh food. The rate there is more than three times as high — 7.5 deaths per 10,000 people. The same distinction is true when you compare Bronzeville with North Lawndale and any number of other neighborhoods.

My brother the doctor will inevitably complain that I’m not academically qualified to weigh the impact of food access against education, income, and density of living. But I’ve got a hunch. Those who have succumbed to Covid-19 have disproportionately been afflicted by preexisting conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, and obesity. In areas where meal choices are limited to Burger King and 7-Eleven, residents are almost inevitably going to face a greater struggle to bring down their blood pressure and stay healthy. Fortunately, policymakers over the years have developed a raft of new tools on hand to expand access to fresh groceries.

When I became Chicago’s mayor, studies indicated that more than 400,000 Chicagoans lived in food deserts, meaning they had to travel more than a mile to purchase fresh food. So I invited local grocery executives to City Hall and argued that any chain that wanted to claim that it was a “Chicagoland” store needed to serve all parts of Chicago. That meant opening new branches in underserved locations. Many were initially skeptical, convinced that stores in minority neighborhoods would weigh down their bottom lines. But working collaboratively with my administration, several answered the call, with a half-dozen new stores opening in formerly bereft neighborhoods. What’s more, several chains have come to realize that there’s good business to be done in neighborhoods they hadn’t before considered serving. The Bronzeville Mariano’s, located in the central hub of Chicago’s South Side African American community, has proven to be a thriving success.

Eliminating food deserts isn’t simply about ensuring that every child eats their vegetables — it’s a key to solving the more comprehensive problems that afflict corners of urban, suburban, and rural America alike.

But this problem is bigger than any brick-and-mortar solution. Inspired both by first lady Michelle Obama’s work at the White House and Milwaukee’s success reclaiming fallow industrial sites, we made a big push to expand Chicago’s urban farming. Working with local nonprofits, we were able to expand the space available to grow fruits and vegetables inside Chicago’s city limits nine times over and even assisted in building the country’s first certified organic urban farm. Then, to distribute the produce grown on those urban farms, the city donated three public buses to a nonprofit partner, Growing Power, which retrofitted them to become mobile, food-stamp-accepting grocery stores (think of the Good Humor van but with fruits and vegetables), and began scheduling regular runs in communities without access.

With help from Washington, we could take all of this a step further. The Opportunity Zone program, which was established decades ago to breathe new life into economically deprived neighborhoods, was expanded in the tax-cutting bill President Donald Trump signed in 2017. Today, it has become in too many cases a subsidy for real estate developers working on the margins of otherwise thriving neighborhoods. To use an existing program to address this scourge, Opportunity Zone tax breaks should be directed at developers who agree to prioritize grocery stores and then hire local residents to fill the attending jobs. That would not only improve forlorn neighborhoods and expand economic opportunity — it would almost surely improve health outcomes as well.

One risk coming out of the pandemic is that we limit the scope of our analysis to our public health system alone, which clearly needs vast improvements. But as every mayor knows, a community’s challenges are almost invariably linked together. Poverty, health care, education, job access, and public transportation layer one on top of another. Eliminating food deserts isn’t simply about ensuring that every child eats their vegetables — it’s a key to solving the more comprehensive problems that afflict corners of urban, suburban, and rural America alike. If we’re going to improve health outcomes and longevity in every corner of the country, we need to take approaches that have worked to improve health in cities and apply them nationwide.",-1,https://gen.medium.com/food-deserts-are-their-own-pandemic-hot-spots-38baf54ffb51
31,Emanuel,Rahm,timesunion,"For most of our history, vice presidents have been chosen to help bring ""balance"" to a ticket, uniting a party divided by ideology or geography ahead of the general election. As a result, most vice presidents have been little more than window dressing.

Two men who went on to be president learned this firsthand: LBJ was iced out of JFK's Camelot; Dwight Eisenhower, asked about Richard Nixon's contribution near the end of his two terms in the White House, said, ""Give me a week, and I'll think of one.""

To this day, choosing a running mate remains an explicitly political decision. But, more than most people realize, it is, above all, a very personal choice. A ticket's chemistry is among the most important (if underappreciated) factors in determining electoral success. More importantly, vice presidents now wield real power in the West Wing. For that reason, my bet is that however much his choice helps him politically, Joe Biden, a former vice president himself, will select the person he admires most, trusts most deeply and gets along with best.

The present job was forged in 1992, when Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton made the unlikely choice to run with someone from the state next door. Tennessee Sen. Al Gore turned out to be a political asset because he underscored Clinton's moderate, Southern, ""New Democrat"" credentials. Voters could see that the two men, and their spouses, had genuinely come to like each other, though they had different interests and skill sets.

Few of us involved in the vetting process at the time understood how important that personal connection would be. Throughout the first meeting Clinton held on whom to pick, convened in Tallahassee, he clutched a copy of Gore's book ""Earth in the Balance."" Over the course of the following weeks, names came on and off Clinton's list. Despite broad expectations that Clinton would ""balance"" the ticket somehow, Clinton's respect for Gore's intellect ensured that his name remained — the only constant in the group.

After the election, that bond became even more important. Clinton brought Gore into every important decision. During the government shutdown of 1995, House Speaker Newt Gingrich was pushing Clinton to accede to big cuts to Medicare and Medicaid, and the president's pollster, Dick Morris, was urging Clinton to cave. Gore stood alone with Clinton in the Oval Office as they decided to reject Morris' advice. That proved to be the right call: Voters blamed Republicans for shutting down the government in pursuit of their heartless agenda, and the standoff turned the political tide for much of the next six years.

The lack of a personal bond can unravel a ticket. Arizona Sen. John McCain's decision to nominate Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin in 2008 briefly put a scare in some old Democratic hands. Palin, a newcomer, checked all the right boxes — young, female, reliably conservative. But she was entirely out of sync with McCain's persona and message. Within two weeks of her boffo introduction at the GOP convention in Saint Paul, she ran afoul of McCain's politics and personality and quickly became a drag on the ticket.

Biden was an effective vice president because President Barack Obama trusted his political judgment. At a final auto bailout meeting convened in the Roosevelt Room, the president's economic and political teams were largely at odds. Some believed we should let GM and Chrysler go bankrupt — others recommended a bailout for GM alone. Biden, himself a blue-collar kid from Scranton, Pennsylvania, understood the impact shuttered plants could have on a community, and argued persuasively that if Washington was going to be in for a penny it should go in for a pound by saving Chrysler as well. He was right on the merits — and his standing with the president helped steer the administration in the right direction.

When Biden is president, his toughest days will be those where policy and politics are in conflict. He will need to trust the judgment of his vice president to help him steer the country through. The good news for this year's Democratic nominee is that the women he will consider have a lot to offer his ticket politically. Each promises to strengthen his standing among a specific demographic or, in other cases, in a crucial region. But only Biden can measure the personal chemistry that will help him convince the country the two people on the ticket can work together to manage the many challenges ahead.

Picking a running mate is a bit like picking a partner or even a spouse. ""Balance"" has a lot to recommend it. But outside appearances are far less important than underlying trust.

33,Emanuel,Rahm,politico,"I realize that may sound strange coming from someone with my public profile. I’m rarely described as a fount of compassion—at home or in public. But there’s just no denying that people want the next president to help carry the nation’s pain. This will be a big boost for Joe Biden in November. As a working-class patriot who made good despite enduring a litany of personal tragedies, he has proved himself uniquely capable of connecting to voters where and how they live their lives. The story of his life—the grit and perseverance he displayed taking the train home from D.C. after the last Senate vote each night to care for his two young sons, bereft of their mother—is a testament to the very type of leadership no narcissist could ever provide.

To be clear, it’s not just Trump’s personality that voters increasingly detest. His cratering support among both college and noncollege educated women is driven by his policy agenda: his gleeful decision to cage children at the border; his efforts to upend the Affordable Care Act, imperiling their families’ health care coverage; his failure to address the epidemic of school shootings and the growing scourge of vaping. The nation’s reaction to Trump has fueled a nearly uninterrupted string of Democratic victories across the country for local elected offices, for congressional seats and for statehouses.

Just look at the evidence. In 2017, Democrats won both a suburban district outside Pittsburgh and a statewide senatorial election in Alabama. Despite facing an electoral map Republicans had drafted to protect their majority, the Democratic Party decimated the GOP in the 2018 midterm elections. Last year, Democratic candidates won governorships in Kentucky and Louisiana, not to mention both houses of Virginia’s state Legislature. Trump has both whipped up the Democratic base and pulled moderate suburban voters into the Democratic tent. The party’s big win in the Wisconsin Supreme Court election—a margin fueled largely by the Milwaukee suburbs—demonstrates that the momentum continues today.

If the electorate’s aversion to Trump’s hostility—in personality and in policy—had ramped up before the crisis, their hunger for empathy is now sharper than ever. Reports of death tolls, overflowing morgues and efforts to contain the virus dominate the front pages. Once the economy reopens, Americans will still be mourning the tens of thousands who have lost their lives and the opportunities lost in the ensuing economic wreckage. Biden’s experience and competence will stand in stark relief to Trump’s penchant for playing the role of national carnival barker. But if that’s the obvious contrast, here’s what will make the biggest difference this November: “Uncle Joe” has carried the burden of grief like few others in public life.

The vast difference between the two candidates would have been highlighted more explicitly on the campaign trail, where split screens would have shown Trump preening on stage while Biden took time to talk privately with a grieving widow on a rope line. But even from his home, Biden’s humanity shines through. You need not look past his recent appearance on James Corden’s show—an interview in which he choked up while holding a picture of his two sons but turned that experience back to his awe for the American peoples’ perseverance in the face of struggle—to understand why his candidacy is resonating at this moment.

Republican strategists seem to want to steer the president away from the abrasiveness that propelled him to victory four years ago. His gauzy Super Bowl ad about criminal justice reform was evidence that some insiders realize animosity won’t work again. But at the end of the day, Trump is going to be Trump. The dismissive way he treated female reporters asking about reopening the economy reflected the character flaw that drove his appeal four years ago. But it’s lost its shine. In the political environment shaped by a pandemic, Americans don’t want venom, they want compassion. If anger animated the 2016 election, empathy will define 2020.",-1,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/04/23/biden-is-to-2020-as-trump-was-to-2016-203868
34,Emanuel,Rahm,wsj,"America’s coronavirus catastrophe is a function of two separate failures—only one of which, national government incompetence, is getting sufficient attention. The public has been forced to choose between their lives and their livelihoods, and voters will judge President Trump’s handling of the crisis in November. But the second question centers on overall accountability. No single federal official below the president is charged with preparing, mobilizing and deploying the national response to a pandemic.

As we’re seeing in Ohio, where Gov. Mike DeWine was quick to take action, and in Washington state, where Gov. Jay Inslee was similarly aggressive, speed in response corresponds to speed in recovery. No one seems quite sure who is running the White House’s national effort. Is it Mike Pence, or the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner? By contrast, Boston Mayor Marty Walsh hired retired Gen. Stanley McChrystal to run his city’s response. Yet hiring better people is only a first step. Congress needs to institute wide-ranging reforms. This is a classic case of diffuse authority undermining a national priority.

The Education Department oversees school funding and policy. Farm policy sits at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. But responsibility for public health is spread across disconnected agencies. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, the intelligence agencies. Even the Pentagon plays a role in planning. America has faced the threat of four pandemics over two decades (H1N1, SARS, MERS and Ebola), and it’s sure to face many more. The country needs to make a single official broadly responsible for protecting the health and well-being of the American people in a public-health emergency.

Typically, when the federal government has been outmatched by a crisis, Washington has responded by making structural changes that bring a laserlike focus on the threat. As the Cold War ramped up in 1947, President Truman created what became the National Security Council. When the energy crisis flattened the U.S. economy in the 1970s, President Carter established the Energy Department. After President George H.W. Bush’s administration botched the response to Hurricane Andrew, President Clinton drove enormous new resources into the Federal Emergency Management Agency and elevated it into a cabinet-level department. After 9/11, President George W. Bush established the Department of Homeland Security and a new agency to coordinate the nation’s vast intelligence network.

It’s time to apply that playbook to the recurring challenge of pandemics. Reformers should focus on four initiatives:",-1,https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-to-prepare-for-the-next-pandemic-11586795657
35,Emanuel,Rahm,wsj,"Warren Buffett once noted that “only when the tide goes out do you discover who’s been swimming naked.” When it comes to emergency management and public health, the tide is out, and the federal government has been caught with its pants down. For decades, we’ve failed to invest sufficiently in the nation’s public health system, but the crisis we face today will not be one-of-a-kind. If we’re going to make sure that future pandemics do not automatically precipitate an economic depression, Washington is going to have to step up.

In recent weeks, state and local authorities have filled some of the void in the face of federal dysfunction. Beyond the first responders, doctors, nurses and other hospital employees on the front lines, the heroes of this crisis have been focused, energetic executives such as Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles and Governors Andrew Cuomo (New York), Mike DeWine (Ohio), J.B. Pritzker (Illinois) and Gretchen Whitmer (Michigan).

AFTER THE PANDEMIC Leading figures from a range of fields look ahead to the lasting impact of today’s crisis How Will Covid-19 Change Our World?

But there’s no substitute for federal leadership, as we’ve seen in past crises. FEMA’s botched response to Hurricane Andrew in 1992 spurred change in Washington. A year later, President Clinton appointed James Lee Witt as FEMA director, and he led quick and effective responses to disasters time and again. And in 2010, in dealing with the Deepwater Horizon disaster, President Obama was determined to provide a counterpoint to the inept federal response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

Though mayors and governors can do a lot, national crises and challenges ultimately need national solutions. States shouldn’t be bidding against one another for masks and ventilators as they are today—the federal government should be the clearing house. State bureaucracies should not be forced to keep an eye on diseases spreading from China or other parts of the world—that should be up to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Security Council. States can’t fund research for medical treatments at the scale made possible by the National Institutes of Health. And on and on.

Washington’s failure today is just a more extreme example of the dynamic that has emerged as a feature of life in the nation’s cities and states: Too often the federal government simply doesn’t show up.

In Chicago, we made community college free without any help from Washington, but that wasn’t because we didn’t want to work with the federal Department of Education. They just had nothing to offer. We would have gladly accepted the federal Department of Transportation’s help in expanding O’Hare, our largest airport, but we couldn’t wait for the federal bureaucracy to get its act together.

Partisanship aside, the frustration with Washington is substantive, persistent and real. State and local leaders have taken the lead out of necessity, not just opportunity. We’d rather have a federal partner on any initiative.

No matter who takes the oath of office next January, I expect the next administration will invest more money and attention in the agencies that partner with state and local government to address a host of crises. H1N1, SARS, Ebola—health challenges have become a steady drumbeat that, with climate change and globalization, will accelerate. Good on state and local leaders for stepping up, but Washington’s role remains indispensable in meeting the challenges of tomorrow.

Corrections & Amplifications

Warren Buffett said “only when the tide goes out do you discover who’s been swimming naked.” An earlier version of this article incorrectly attributed the statement to Winston Churchill. (March 27)",-1,https://www.wsj.com/articles/its-time-for-washington-to-step-up-11585249514
36,Emanuel,Rahm,washingtonpost,"Today, faced with another crisis, we need to think strategically not only about how to address the virus but also about how the United States can come out stronger on the other side. We all know this won’t be the last time we confront a pandemic. But it should be the last time a public health emergency provokes an economic depression. We need to prepare for tomorrow, starting today.

There is a premium on immediate mobilization. In contrast to President Trump’s denial and delay, our approach in 2009 was swift and sweeping. But our aim then wasn’t just to stave off depression — it was also to address underlying weaknesses moving forward. Our bailouts came with strings attached. We insisted that financial firms maintain bigger cash reserves and that the auto industry bite the bullet on reforms they’d long postponed.

In that spirit, we need to use this crisis to fix our public health system, our medical infrastructure and our industrial capacity. Trump may be outmatched by the moment, but the rest of the United States can rise to meet this crisis.

South Korea wasn’t properly prepared for severe acute respiratory syndrome five years ago, but Seoul used that failing to prepare, and it shows. The U.S. health system, by contrast, may be unusually advanced, but its public health components lag far behind. Despite years of warnings, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has an annual budget of a mere $6.5 billion. Trump’s tax cut for the financial industry amounted to $32 billion per year. At the time, Republicans argued that the tax cuts were designed to drive growth. Now look where we are.

Here’s an alternative strategy:

First, let’s finally make the investment in public health that’s been so lacking. To get ahead of the next pandemic, we need to invest not only in the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration but also the National Institutes of Health, which funds the research behind new medicines and vaccines. Former vice president Joe Biden led a moonshot for cancer; it’s time we embrace the same approach for a much broader range of infectious and other diseases, funding not only the research but also the scientists and laboratory teams that can unlock their secrets.

Second, we’ve ignored too many of our infrastructure needs for too long. The coronavirus crisis has exposed the many ways in which the U.S. medical grid is unready to meet the challenges of a fully globalized world. We need a much more robust network of critical care and emergency care facilities, with special emphasis on intensive care units, that can be stood up and put in place overnight. We should have a surge capacity that doubles our available hospital bed capacity. And we need a new rapid deployment force of trained medical “reservists” who can switch from their regular jobs to providing the manpower that makes these surge units operational.

Global Opinions writer Jason Rezaian spent a year and a half in an Iranian prison. How he coped with panic and anxiety applies to the fear of coronavirus today. (The Washington Post)

Third, despite all the double talk coming from the White House, it is clear our strategic supply chain is inadequate. As demonstrated by the frustrating struggle to produce the ventilators, masks and other equipment that health-care workers need in this crisis, we must continue to make investments in re-industrializing the United States. For years, plants and industries have migrated offshore in search of cheaper labor. While diminished trade barriers have played some role in that shift, the search for lower production costs eroded our industrial capacity. We now have technology that allows Americans to compete on price with more distant economies.

All of this is to say, again, that Washington needs to make sure this crisis doesn’t go to waste. Previous crisis investments paid off in ways we sometimes neglect to appreciate. Today’s bank reserves were created by the financial reforms passed after 2008. Hospitals today are drawing supplies from a strategic reserve President Bill Clinton created in 1999. The Recovery and Reinvestment Act helped establish the backbone of today’s telemedicine system.

37,Emanuel,Rahm,wsj,"In Washington, few lines are as hackneyed as Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan’s aphorism that “everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not his own facts.” That’s true, but it’s also true that pundits can sometimes twist a few “facts” into a false narrative. Consider three widely accepted misconceptions about the Democratic Party—each of them debunked by the outcome of the primaries to date.

First, those who see the party as a collection of self-interested identity groups get it wrong. Many assume that female candidates had a distinct advantage with female voters, African-American candidates with African-American voters, Hispanic candidates with Hispanic voters, etc. But neither Cory Booker nor Kamala Harris had a line on African-American Democrats. Julián Castro failed to dominate within the Hispanic community. Maybe most remarkable, Elizabeth Warren didn’t win female voters even in Massachusetts.

Let that be a lesson to everyone pontificating about who our nominee should pick as his running mate to “balance” the ticket. I know plenty of female voters who, while caring about day care and early childhood education, also worry about America’s forever wars and climate change. In the same way, Hispanic voters don’t necessarily believe new arrivals should immediately get free health care. And as the African-American community’s support for Joe Biden reveals, not all African-American voters rule out leaders who have a history of being “tough on crime.”

Among Democrats, demographics are not destiny—they are informative, not determinative. As Sen. John F. Kennedy said nearly 60 years ago, “I am not the Catholic candidate for president. I am the Democratic Party’s candidate for president, who happens also to be a Catholic.”

Second, it’s time to reset the media’s obsession with money in politics. I got my start as a fundraiser, so I’m well aware that candidates need a certain level of support to mount a successful campaign. Moreover, I’ve been horrified to see excessive sums of corporate money pour into the process since the Supreme Court wrongly decided Citizens United.",-1,https://www.wsj.com/articles/democratic-voters-smash-media-myths-11584028017

Article content The following is adapted from opening remarks made by Rahm Emanuel on a Munk Debates Podcast. Listen to the whole episode about Joe Biden here: Joe Biden is the best candidate to take on Donald Trump in November. If you go back and look at president Bill Clinton in ’92, ’96, the midterms of ’06, then Barack Obama’s 2008 and 2012 elections, and the 2018 midterms, the same kind of script was used for all six of those national elections. It’s what I call a metropolitan majority built around an urban/suburban resurgence for Democrats. We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

Try refreshing your browser, or Munk Debates – Rahm Emanuel: Why Biden is the Democrats' best hope for winning Back to video That is true for the White House, and it’s true when you run competitive senate races, gubernatorial races, or for the congressional majorities. And in each of those cases, when you look at where Biden is winning, it’s from that same template and playbook. Biden has built a coalition and is outperforming both in the urban areas, where African-American voters are, and with this resurgence as we’ve seen in Virginia and North Carolina in major metropolitan areas and major urban areas. And Biden’s vote growth in the suburban areas reflects where the Democrats did best in the 2018 midterms, which is how they created their House majority in exactly the congressional districts you’ll need to win the general election.

When you look back at how president Clinton won, president Obama won, or any other previous presidential election, the character of the person, their biography, their story matters as much as their policy. And Joe Biden from Scranton, Ohio, has working-class roots. His own personal story matches up perfectly against Trump, who is an entitled child and real estate developer. Never-Trump voters want someone who will bring calm, coolness and capability to the office because they are exhausted by Donald Trump’s constant chaos and conflict. Finally, Biden brings an openness towards working across the aisle to make progress, an attribute which works perfectly in contrast to all the weaknesses of Trump. There are only three Democrats who have won re-election in the past 100 years: Franklin Roosevelt, Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. And where they won and how they won among what groups are very similar. Biden has the greatest capacity to replicate that.

Article content Never-Trump voters want someone who will bring calm, coolness and capability to the office Biden is the best answer to Trump because he has proven time and again that he can get the biggest, broadest coalition to show up and vote for Democrats. African-American voters are comfortable with Biden. Swing voters in swing states are most comfortable with Biden. And unlike in 2016, Trump is the reality. Last time he was not. Hillary Clinton was the establishment last time, whereas this time Trump is the establishment. He doesn’t get to run against the establishment, because he has become the establishment. Joe Biden’s character, his broad coalition, and his ability to make Trump own and answer for the failings of his administration will become the factors that lead to a Biden presidency. Rahm Emanuel was the 55th mayor of Chicago.

Sen. Bernie Sanders’s (I-Vt.) campaign sees a path to the White House fueled by his call for a revolution. Former vice president Joe Biden, by contrast, wants to build on the successes of previous progressive administrations. Here’s what I recommend: For the time being, set aside your position on any given policy issue. Hold your assessments of either man’s personality in abeyance. The choice we each face now should be centered on politics, and politics alone.

Sanders and Biden would attract very different political coalitions. Sanders would abandon our party’s pursuit of swing-district moderates in favor of seeking to inspire legions of young progressives — something, it’s worth noting, he has failed to do since the primaries began. (Which raises the question: Why would they suddenly materialize in a general election?) Biden promises to reinspire the Obama coalition, weaving moderates and liberals, suburban and urban voters into what I call the Metropolitan Majority. Which political strategy do you think is more apt to achieve our goals? Look at the history, data and facts to make your decision.

First, the history. We’ve seen the arc of this political moment several times. A president wins an election. That president’s party is trounced in the subsequent midterms. The other party then has to choose a strategy in the following presidential contest. What do winning campaigns tend to do? More often than not, they embrace the strategy that helped their party prevail two years earlier.

In 1980, after the GOP picked up Senate seats on the promise of cutting taxes and getting tough on Moscow in 1978, Ronald Reagan championed the same themes. After Democrats used a “Six for ’06” agenda (raising the minimum wage, expanding access to health care, etc.) to take back control of the House 14 years ago, Barack Obama made those themes the centerpiece of his campaign against John McCain in 2008. After seeing how successful demagoguing the immigration debate was for GOP House candidates in 2014, Donald Trump used the same message to win in 2016.

That brings us to the facts. Two years ago, Democrats routed the GOP not by marching angrily to the left but by backing candidates with profiles that matched their districts. Democratic challengers promised to meet Trump’s chaos with legislative competence. The Democrat running for governor of Michigan was propelled to victory on a simple slogan: “Fix the damn roads!” Our path to the White House cuts through the same urban and suburban real estate that handed Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) the speaker’s gavel.

That assessment is borne out by the data. Candidates supported by Our Revolution, a group banking on the theory that more radical policy ideas will turn out legions of uninspired voters, failed to flip a single seat in 2018 — zero, zilch. And yet Sanders promises to employ that same strategy as the Democratic nominee. How big a boost would the “revolutionary” candidate need to win? According to at least one academic study, he would need a surge in progressive voters larger than the surge Obama got from African American voters in 2008. Ask yourself: Does that seem plausible — or even possible?

As our nominee, Sanders would rip up and throw away the playbook that’s been responsible for every recent Democratic victory in such places as Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. President Bill Clinton. The 2006 midterms. Obama. The 2018 midterms. Given that so much is on the line, is the risk really worth the reward?

I’ll vote for the Democratic nominee this November, bar none. But every primary voter should understand the stakes — they should be explicitly political with their vote. As you enter your polling booth, know that your choice is really between radically different theories of how Democrats win. The stakes are high, and we can’t afford to get the politics wrong. If we lose, we not only hand the White House to Trump for four more years. We will have been defeated up and down the ballot, and we’ll face the prospect of enduring an unrestrained executive branch and a submissive Congress for at least the next two years, and a conservative Supreme Court for the better part of a generation.

40,Emanuel,Rahm,news,"Move over, federal government: cities and mayors are where it’s at when it comes to actually getting things done these days.

That’s the premise of a new book by former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel called “The Nation City: Why Mayors Are Now Running the World.”

Thanks to our sponsors: View all sponsors

The book argues that urban centers like Chicago — and the politicians leading them — now set the tone for innovative policies in the U.S. and around the world.

“The center of gravity of our politics have moved local,” Emanuel says. “Not only are mayors in the forefront of the government you have confidence in, that directly touches and effects your life … they’re now taking on other additional pieces of public policy that used to only be the federal government.”

Emanuel says as federal funding has dried up and Congress has grown more dysfunctional, mayors are now tackling national issues like climate change and immigration reform.

“Things that never, ever were the purview of a mayor, they now, to stay ahead and keep their city ahead, have to take on not only the basics of what they always did, but even more because the federal government is retreating, and that void requires they step forward,” Emanuel said.

“The Nation City” features anecdotes and interviews with mayors from around the world about how they addressed problems when the federal government couldn’t, or wouldn’t.

“Ideas now move around the world horizontally and not vertically, as they once did, from the ground up to national governments,” Emanuel writes in the book. “Cities now adopt and adapt ideas and copy and borrow from each other.”

One example Emanuel cites is Chicago’s conversion to LED streetlights.

“We were at a conference on climate change, and Mayor Gregor [Robertson] of Vancouver talked about smart poles and LED lights and other services you can do on those polls. We’re now in the middle of a conversion of all our streetlights [to] LED,” Emanuel said.

The book’s publication comes a month after the Washington Post reported Emanuel had been removed as an unsalaried contributing editor at the Atlantic. Emanuel was pushed off the magazine’s masthead after African American staffers objected to his handling of the murder of Laquan McDonald, which many have called a cover-up. The incident led to the Atlantic eliminating the category of “contributing editor” entirely.

“It was really up to management, I understand their concerns,” Emanuel said, adding he continues to contribute to the Washington Post and Wall Street Journal. “I took that title back – it’s not important. The important thing are the ideas, do they have a forum, and that’s what I’m doing.”

Below, selected excerpts from “The Nation City.”

The Nation City: Why Mayors Are Now Running the World By Rahm Emanuel Selected Excerpts: On the Nonpartisan Collaboration and “Idea Stealing” that Makes Mayors More Effective than Congress When former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg created a technology hub with partnerships among universities, businesses, and the local government, scores of other cities—including Chicago—decided to do the same thing. Our idea to sue big pharmaceutical companies for deceptive marketing when no one else was really addressing the opioid epidemic caught on quickly. More than seven hundred other cities are now involved in lawsuits. The Riverwalk project we built on the Chicago River was informed by what we saw happening concurrently on the waterfronts of Paris and Berlin and Dallas and Buenos Aires. This idea of repurposing old industrial waterfronts in cities has since spread across the world. Tackling public education as a holistic, prekindergarten-through-college initiative rose nearly simultaneously here in Chicago and in Louisville and Boston. “Good mayors imitate,” says Dayton, Ohio, mayor Nan Whaley. “Great mayors steal.” These collaborations have proliferated and accelerated “just as the ability of our national politicians to work together has ground to a halt,” says Bruce Katz. Cities, for all intents and purposes, are on their own now. As major deliverers of goods, they don’t have the luxury or patience to wait to solve problems. Cities are collectively plotting independent courses and learning from each other to solve problems. This is happening, as you’ll see, in cities that are large (Chicago), medium (Louisville), and small (Carmel, Indiana). They work together, outside of their respective national governments. They trade goods, ideas, and innovations. They’ve become nation cities. And here’s another thing that’s going on in cities and with mayors that’s in direct contrast to what’s happening on the national level: Cities and mayors are governing effectively, and they are sharing ideas on a nonpartisan level. Though many of the biggest cities in the world are led by mayors who identify as liberals, many are not. Through the U.S. Conference of Mayors and other intermediaries both domestic and international, we all work together, regardless of political labels. There is a rea- son for this: We all face the same problems, and we all must deal with them immediately. “We maybe come from different broader philosophical ideas about the role of government,” says Tom Tait, the Republican former mayor of Anaheim. “But at the local level it’s about getting things done and serving people. And there’s not a whole lot of ideology in that.” Says Knox White, the Republican mayor of Greenville, South Carolina, “Our federal politicians are in a bubble. We aren’t on the city level, and don’t want to be. We talk to our constituents. We work with each other to get things done. My job is to facilitate this. It’s what I do. That’s what a mayor does.” Being a mayor is pragmatic and political, but it’s not partisan. It’s about looking forward and not backward. It’s about the locally progressive politics that truly make a positive difference in people’s lives. Excerpt: On the Leadership of Mayor Pete Buttigieg Far too often we anoint a young politician as “the next great leader” in politics before said politician is ready or has done anything to deserve such hype. Every once in a while, though, there is a politician who does deserve that hype. One of those people is Pete Buttigieg, the thirty-seven-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana. South Bend is not a big American city. It barely qualifies as a medium-sized one (the population is 102,000). But the quantity of people governed is not the way to measure the effectiveness of a mayor. It is all about the quality of his or her leadership. Buttigieg was born in the city he governs. He’s a Rhodes Scholar and former McKinsey consultant. He was first elected mayor of South Bend in 2012, becoming the youngest mayor of a U.S. city with at least 100,000 citizens. A year later, while serving as mayor, he was deployed to Afghanistan for seven months as a naval intelligence officer. In 2015, right after he announced his bid for reelection, he came out as a gay man in an op-ed. Four months later he won a second term as mayor with more than 80 percent of the vote. South Bend is just ninety miles from Chicago (we draw a good number of graduates of the University of Notre Dame, which is in South Bend), so Mayor Buttigieg and I have met on a number of occasions. In the downtown area, you can’t walk ninety feet without running into an alumnus. Mayor Buttigieg likes to describe the job of being mayor as “the hardest and most rewarding job in the world.” It’s the hardest, he explains, because of the level of scrutiny and immediate accountability. “You can’t offer alternative facts. If a road is in bad shape, you can’t point to it and say, ‘This is the greatest road in the history of roads.’ People will call BS.” He also points out that you’re always on as a mayor. “There is no legislative session and then we all go home for a break,” he says. But the rewards, Buttigieg says, make it all worth it. “You can get things done. We can be nimble and try different ideas and see what works and what doesn’t. And in a matter of a few years, you can literally see things actually working, people getting jobs and neighborhoods rising. And it’s incredibly rewarding to see that.” During his tenure Buttigieg has seen a lot of the rewards. Since 2012 the unemployment rate in South Bend has been cut in half and neighborhoods have been reborn, thanks in large part to the transformation of the city under him. Among his successful initiatives was something he called 1,000 Houses in 1,000 Days, in which he pledged to repair or demolish that many buildings to revitalize South Bend. The city was very much in need of a restart when Buttigieg became mayor, full of unsightly and unsafe abandoned and vacant buildings. Both citizens and businesses overwhelmingly backed the initiative. Buttigieg started the project by basically getting everyone who had a stake— businesses and civic institutions, citizens’ groups, schools, the university, and government entities—in one room and telling them, “Let’s get this done for each other.” He established the deadline of 1,000 days in order to give the plan some needed urgency. It was a critical component. “As the composer Leonard Bernstein once said, ‘In order to do something great, you need two things: a plan and not quite enough time,’” he says. To add to the pressure and accountability, the city updated the progress of the plan for all to see on its website. “You could see how we fell behind in the middle of the project and then when we caught up,” Buttigieg explains. “It was a healthy combination of pressure and the right kind of reward structure. This is one of the things missing in the federal government.” Another thing missing in the federal government: actually getting things done. 1,000 Houses in 1,000 Days was completed two months ahead of schedule. In all, the project cost $10 million. To pay for it, Buttigieg reprogrammed some federal dollars that were earmarked for neighborhood stabilization and applied some of the money from the 2008 mortgage crisis settlement. Repurposing federal money is a critical skill for mayors to cultivate. Creativity from mayors happens on both the idea and the funding side. “There is no deficit spending in cities, no printing of money,” he says. “By law I have to balance the budget every year. We spend down cash reserves some years and borrow money sometimes, but there’s no cheating on whether you have enough money to do what you say you’re going to do.” This project proceeded hand in hand with another one that was called Smart Streets, which aimed to make the downtown area more accessible and appealing by converting one-way streets into two-laners and then narrowing them (to slow down traffic), widening the sidewalks and making them more aesthetically pleasing (with tree plantings and decorative brickwork), and creating new bike paths. Some fifteen miles of streets were rejuvenated in one year, all done with $24 million in tax increment financing, or TIF, which is a subsidy that is paid back by future tax revenue from that project. Since the project was completed, there has been more than $90 million in private investment in the downtown area, including new hotels, retail stores, and restaurants. One of Buttigieg’s mandates is never to wait for the federal government to catch up. “We need to act locally and lead by example,” he says. One way he has done this is with paid family leave (new moms and dads get up to six weeks of leave at full salary). “It’s hard to believe that we are the only developed nation without it,” he says. Buttigieg couldn’t impose the measure on the private sector, but he did do it for the 1,000 public employees of the city, leading by example. “Now these folks can turn to their spouses and ask them when their places of work will do the same thing,” he says. “We’ve challenged the rest of the community to catch up.” (Five states and a handful of cities now also offer some sort of paid family leave.)

41,Emanuel,Rahm,digitaledition,"Most Chicago political books fall into a few genres, all with borders as sharply drawn as the gerrymandered ward boundaries our aldermen produce after every census and its accompanying lawsuits. Former outsiders who become insiders write exposés of the Machine (Milton Rakove’s “We Don’t Want Nobody Nobody Sent,” or R.J. Nelson’s “Dirty Waters: Confessions of Chicago’s Last Harbor Boss”). Journalists write biographies of politicians, most often about Mayor Richard J. Daley: Mike Royko’s “Boss” or Adam Cohen and Elizabeth Taylor’s “American Pharaoh” come first to mind, but dozens of other lesser-known books have been written to glorify, vilify or even objectively analyze a man still known around here as “The Mayor” (pronounced, by Chicagoans of a certain age, “Da Mare”).

But books by , rather than about , former Chicago mayors are so rare that no genre applies.

So Rahm Emanuel’s “The Nation City: Why Mayors Are Now Running the World” can only be compared to Jane Byrne’s “My Chicago.” In her book, Chicago’s first woman mayor wrote an apologia of sorts, exploring her personal life, her connections with the first Mayor Daley, and analyzing her administration’s successes and failures.

In “The Nation City,” Emanuel perhaps invents a new genre for mayoral tomes. He combines the look backward at what happened and what might have been (which can, and will, be picked apart endlessly, starting below) with a forward-looking manifesto that extends far beyond Chicago, Cook County or Illinois. Emanuel brags about what he considers his successes and downplays (or ignores) his shortcomings. More importantly, he makes an argument about the future of politics in America and the rest of the “developed” world, which may prove to be true: Mayors matter more than presidents or prime ministers. He writes:

“Mayors run the places that are now the hubs of innovations and ideas, the places that drive the economic, intellectual, and cultural energy of the world. They acknowledge and actively address climate change. They deal with immigration and infrastructure and don’t just constantly kick these issues down the road, hoping someone else will figure them out. They grapple with the challenges of education, disparities in wealth, health, housing, terrorism and crime. Cities are globally integrated and diverse. Cities are embracing reality and creating solutions that reflect where matters are headed. Cities are all the things national governments are not. They are the present. They are also the future.”

If Daniel Burnham’s famed dictum about urban planning were adapted to this book, it would be “Make no little claims.” Emanuel’s approach has its flaws, but he makes a compelling argument that in our current political situation, local politics and the mayors who run cities large and small do indeed matter more than ever before.

To open with the flaws:

The book lacks certain formal apparatus typical of serious writing: there’s no index, only a brief “Selected Bibliography,” and no sources cited for quotations from other writers. Emanuel also directly quotes other mayors and politicians with whom he spoke; his readers must be generous and assume he took careful notes at the time.

This objection applies only if this book purports to be a work of urban scholarship, which it does not: It’s a political polemic, with its bold claim about the local mattering more than the national.

The book begins with, and occasionally returns to, Emanuel’s immigrant family history, depicting the colorful character of his maternal grandfather, Herman Smulevitz, aka “the Big Bangah,” and his self-made immigrant emphasis on the value of education in America, one which Emanuel claims to wholly embrace.

Such biographical gestures can run into trouble when depicting later policy decisions. Emanuel’s chapter on his education reform “accomplishments” is a masterpiece of both self-justification and rhetorical use of the passive voice. He recounts battles with Springfield over funding (especially for prekindergarten programs), and with the teachers union over the length of the school day and year, and with local opposition over plans to close schools. He crows over his triumphs.

But then he writes, “Closing one school, let alone forty-nine, is never a popular thing to do, and I took some serious flak for it. But in this case we had to. Yes, it potentially stressed the rest of the school system. But these concerns were overridden by the fact that these schools were consistently failing, and the students who attended them were trapped in that failure, with no prospect for improvement.” With this, he goes further than can be truly justified, and one wonders what the Big Bangah would think about the people in the sort of economically marginalized neighborhoods he inhabited losing their schools.

Whole books could be (and have been) written arguing the opposite (see Eve L. Ewing’s “Ghosts in the Schoolyard” for a thorough refutation of the idea that these schools were “failing” in some objective way, and that the students in them were “trapped” rather than at home in vital spaces).

Perhaps it’s just unrealistic to expect any politician to truly depict, much less grapple with, the arguments of defeated opponents or disappointed constituents.

Even for politically savvy Chicago readers, familiar with Emanuel’s record and fully opinionated about it one way or another, later sections of the book make a compelling, albeit primarily anecdotal, argument for Emanuel’s larger point: “Something was broken in our federal government. It was dysfunctional, and only getting worse with each ensuing year. Because of packed courts, gerrymandering and the influence of special interests, it was also no longer a progressive entity, no longer the deliverer of programs and policies that actually helped the people who needed it. … (C)ities were the last places where progressive politics existed.”

In the main body of the book, Emanuel recounts tales about other mayors, in the United States and around the world, who have taken the lead when their national governments have descended into dysfunctional irrelevance. In the U.S., most of these mayors are Democrats, but Emanuel includes several Republicans facing the same challenges and coming up with similar solutions. Many of these names are familiar, and, ironically, two are former mayors running to become the irrelevant president: Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, and Michael Bloomberg of New York City.

Even acknowledging the probability that Emanuel has cherry-picked his examples, stories of progressive successes in South Bend, Dayton, Oklahoma City, Los Angeles, London, Paris and other cities over the last two decades suggest his larger point has merit: Mayors, because they have to respond in real time to on-the-ground issues rather than promoting an ideological agenda not shared by at least half of the country, must deliver the goods, with or without (mostly without) the Feds. As he puts it (with clunky alliteration typical of his prose) “The opportunities in our cities are facilitated now by our mayors, who run the only governments left in the world that are immediate, intimate, and impactful.”

Another flaw of the book is a missed opportunity, to see beyond city borders below the federal level. To brag, as he does, about luring corporate headquarters from Chicago suburbs to the city itself ignores the fact that the entire metropolitan region is an economic, transportation, and natural ecosystem in which politicians need to work in synch. From Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to Gary, Indiana, we live in a vast metroplex that crosses three state borders and includes a dozen counties and hundreds of municipalities. When these governments compete against one another (for corporate headquarters, or new factories, or what federal funding can be pried out of Capitol Hill), it’s a race to the bottom where they replicate the problems of the federal government that Emanuel otherwise persuasively engages with. A middle focus, above the city but below the feds, would have been welcome.

While Emanuel’s prose won’t win any awards for suppleness or grace, he displays occasional flashes of a self-deprecating sense of humor, one not frequently seen since his good-natured response to Dan Sinker’s 2011 campaign season @MayorEmanuel twitter parody (and subsequent book, “The [Expletive] Epic Twitter Quest of @MayorEmanuel”). After two Chicago tourists greet Emanuel while walking along the Seine with Mayor Anne Hidalgo of Paris, he writes that “Hidalgo laughed and joked that I had planted the duo to impress her. I told her that if I’d wanted to impress her, I would have lined up a few dozen people to come say hello. And trust me, that is not beyond me.”

Readers may or may not be impressed with everything Emanuel lines up in this book, but it should not be beyond us to see the solid argument he makes about the crucial unifying and energizing role of cities, and their mayors, in an era of national political divisiveness and paralysis.

‘The Nation City’

By Rahm Emanuel, Knopf, 235 pages, $26.95",-1,http://digitaledition.chicagotribune.com/infinity/article_share.aspx?guid=dae8275d-b428-4012-afeb-2bf3eef51f94
42,Emanuel,Rahm,chicago,"In this excerpt from “The Nation City,” a new book by Rahm Emanuel, the former Chicago mayor writes of growing up in a high achieving, highly competitive and fiercely loving family, and how this shaped his own “fierce and focused desire to succeed.”

Benjamin and Marsha married and had three sons — Ezekiel (Zeke), and then me, and then Ariel (Ari) — and later adopted a daughter named Shoshana. We grew up in a series of different apartments in Chicago, starting in neighborhoods with low rents and a mix of immigrants, Jews and Catholics and poor whites who had migrated north from southern Appalachia. We fled one of those apartments — a crumbling flat with leaky faucets and peeling paint — because one night my mother found a rat sitting next to me in my crib. (We moved to Wilmette when I was in the fifth grade. I would return to the city — to Cornelia Avenue in Wrigleyville — after graduating from college in 1982.)

My father coupled his hospital job with a private practice, and he worked 70 hours a week seeing a range of patients, from those so poor that he provided them with free treatment to the sons and daughters of famous ballplayers on the Chicago Cubs. But he always made time for his kids. His favorite game to play with us was chess. He never took it easy on us, never let us win. He encouraged us to think three moves ahead and always to imagine our opponent’s response to our potential moves.

My mother was an activist. She believed that it was our duty to fight for people who were suffering in this world. She was arrested numerous times while protesting. She stood in the crowd at the Mall in Washington, D.C., and watched Martin Luther King, Jr., deliver his “I have a dream” speech. She marched in protests with her three toddler sons in tow, and always took us along to the polling station to watch her vote. She took us to hear King speak in Chicago in 1966. She helped organize a local chapter of the Congress of Racial Equality. Our landlord kicked our family out of an apartment on West Buena Avenue because he didn’t like the mixed-race gatherings my mother hosted there.

I know it might be hard to believe now, but I grew up as a quiet, attentive child. My mother and brothers tell me that I didn’t speak much when we were gathered together, but merely observed. That changed after an incident when I was 17. I sliced the middle finger on my right hand while working one day at my job at an Arby’s. The finger — and my hand and arm — eventually became infected, and I spent seven weeks in the hospital. The doctors were able to save my hand and arm, but they were forced to remove half of my middle finger. I don’t remember much after the surgery, but Zeke told me that when the doctor unwrapped my hand for the first time, I flipped everyone the bird and then declared that I would have to do it twice now for the desired effect. Something changed in me after that accident. A quiet, introverted kid suddenly became transformed into a garrulous teen full of energy and a fierce and focused desire to succeed.

While we were growing up, the city of Chicago was our playground. There were movie theaters, libraries, museums, a zoo, parks, and a mass transit system that made it possible to get to all of those places. There were people of all different backgrounds and races and religious beliefs who had one thing in common: a profound yearning to improve their lot in life. The city had its hazards, too. There was poverty and crime. There were dark alleys that we avoided. My brothers and I were more than once taunted for being Jewish. The city shaped us. It held all of the promise and all of the peril in the world.

At the center of everything was my maternal grandfather, Big Bangah. By the time he and my grandmother Sophie were in their late 40s, they’d scraped together enough money to move from North Lawndale to Albany Park, on the Northwest Side of Chicago. Their new neighborhood wasn’t materially much nicer or further up the socioeconomic ladder than their old one, but it was a solid blue collar area (as it is today), and it did signify to Big Bangah that he had scratched and clawed his way firmly into the lower middle class. My grandparents were over the moon about the move, believing they had made it. (My father’s private medical practice had served Albany Park, my uncle was a cop there, and I would wind up representing the neighborhood in my first years in Congress. The joke in our family was that we had traveled many miles but we had never gotten very far.)

Every Sunday, with no exceptions or excuses tolerated, we all went to Big Bangah and Sophie’s for dinner on the third floor of a three-flat, where we were joined by my Aunt Shirley and her six kids and two of my uncles. These dinners were not sedate affairs. There was chaos everywhere, with kids running around and political arguments at the table that ended in shouting matches. There was no peace. There was no quiet. But we always entered the house as a family, and then, after all the battles and bickering, we left that same way, sent off with kisses from Sophie and a huge bear hug from Big Bangah. All to be repeated the following Sunday.

Big Bangah never explicitly told us what he expected from us in our lives, but it was implicit in everything he said and did, and we all heard it, loud and clear. And if we ever needed an actual physical reminder, all we had to do was look at a framed piece that hung on my parents’ family room wall. Within it was the purse that Sophie had had with her when she arrived in America. Sticking out of the purse were the immigration papers that she and her two sisters had had with them then. The most haunting aspect of the piece, though, was the black-and-white photos surrounding the purse — pictures of my mother’s and father’s families, of the aunts and uncles and cousins whom we never got to meet because they never got out of Eastern Europe and presumably succumbed to either the pogroms or, later, the Holocaust.

The contents of those photos mesmerized my brothers and me. The message conveyed by them — and by the life and deeds of our grandparents — was simple: We sacrificed and struggled and left behind family that we never saw again. That sacrifice will not be dismissed. You are going to work hard to get an education. How dare you get a B on your report card? You are going to make something of yourself.

Big Bangah and Sophie eventually moved into our home for a while, and we got to feel and witness this message in a closer and more powerful way. Though Big Bangah was retired by that time, he rose at 4:30 a.m. out of habit, to read newspapers and books at the kitchen table and continue his self-education, sitting there in a tank top, boxers, knee-high socks, and slippers. There was no ambiguity when it came to the meaning of his life. Big Bangah had worked his ass off in pursuit of his big dream: that his children and grandchildren would be provided with an education and the opportunities for better lives than he’d had.

We internalized his dream. There is a reason that Zeke is a leading oncologist and bioethicist and that Ari runs one of the most significant talent agencies in the world and that Shoshana has overcome her physical disabilities to lead a happy and productive life.

I took Big Bangah’s dream, sprinkled in my father’s work ethic and my mother’s activism and their shared desire to help those who were suffering and in need, and entered the world of politics.

43,Emanuel,Rahm,chicagobusiness,"There are the obvious examples. You may remember Rob Ford, the crack-smoking former mayor of Toronto. The crack was just one of many scandals. Ford's great sin when it came to his constituents was that his scandals made everything about him and not about his city. Kwame Kilpatrick, the former mayor of Detroit, was charged in 2008 with ten felony counts and was eventually convicted—and jailed—for perjury and obstruction of justice. Kilpatrick spent his mayoral tenure looking after himself and not his city. Billy Wilson, the former mayor of Greenbrier, Tennessee, was charged with stealing $60,000 from a Toys for Tots campaign in 2013. He resigned the following year and somehow escaped a jail sentence (though he was forced to pay back the money). In 2018, Ben Zahn, the mayor of Kenner, Louisiana, banned his parks and recreation department from buying Nike products after that company aired a commercial featuring Colin Kaepernick, the NFL quarterback who famously kneeled during the national anthem to protest racial injustice in the U.S. When Zahn's attempted ban was revealed, it divided his city. Many citizens of Kenner took to the streets to protest, joined by some members of the New Orleans Saints. Only after the harsh blowback—and after talking to an attorney—did Zahn rescind the ban. Then, too, a good rule of thumb is this: Don't sell your children's books to entities that do business with your city, as Baltimore mayor Catherine Pugh did.

Scandals, corruption, and wading too far into national issues are certainly signs of bad mayors. But some of the attributes of a bad mayor are more subtle. A bad mayor is one who views their job as just making sure the proverbial (or in some cases literal) trains run on time. This technical work is something every mayor has to do, of course, just as every NFL quarterback must be able to take the snap from the center. But that's merely the beginning of the job. Bad mayors don't stretch themselves, don't address challenges, lose their nerve, deny that the challenges exist. I've seen these mayors. We all have. They can at times even win reelection. But they are still failing. One measure of a good mayor is how long you've served. Another measure is what you accomplished while you served. A failed mayor is one who doesn't honestly confront problems and reach out and hold the hands of the public as they march down the road of change. . . .

. . . Change is our new constant. It comes swiftly, unannounced. And the hardest thing to figure out is how to make change a friend and not a foe. A mayor who denies change is going to fail. He will fail in his responsibility to the public to better prepare his city for the future. When I closed forty-nine failing schools as part of our reform of the Chicago public school system, it was very unpopular politically. But it had to be done, for the future of those students who were trapped in those schools, and because we desperately need to be preparing our eight-year-olds for the information economy, in order to give them a brighter future. More important, and of equal political value, when it came to fighting Springfield for equitable funding, the willingness to clean up our own fiscal issues gave the city the ability to make a strong case, and to dismiss all those who for decades had derailed equitable funding as a Chicago bailout. In that fight we implemented a political strategy of being in the boat with all other cities with predominantly low-income children, rather than on a raft by ourselves. This enabled us to defeat Governor Rauner in his attempt to label the funding a Chicago bail-out, and to make him sign the new funding formula that brings 425 million more dollars to Chicago's students. Mitch Landrieu took on his firefighters' union. Jim Brainard installed more than a hundred roundabouts in his city to slow down traffic, ease congestion, and fight pollution. Garcetti and I pushed through significant renovations of our airports. Pete Buttigieg gave his city employees paid family leave. Knox White knocked down a highway bridge to create a new downtown with a waterfall park. Change always comes. Act on it. Bad mayors mimic their federal government counterparts. Denial is not a long-term strategy in local government. Unfortunately, it is in national ones.

A bad mayor doesn't use the bully pulpit to positive affect. ""It is an underused thing,"" says Tom Tait. ""But mayors can, and should, affect culture for the better. It can take a long time and you have to be persistent, but it changes everything."" A bad mayor doesn't use his or her position to lead, to convene, to cajole. Remember what Greg Fischer said: ""Citizenship is a participation sport."" A bad mayor asks nothing of his or her citizens, universities, businesses, religious institutions, or non profits when it comes to helping make the city work and get better.

There is also such a thing as a bad or failing city, and it has mostly to do with livability. Nine out of the ten most polluted cities in the world are in India, according to the World Health Organization. The New York Times reported in early 2019 that the inhabitants of these cities were showing up in emergency rooms unable to breathe, and that kids were vomiting in schools because of the air quality. In 2017 a collective 1.24 million people died as a result of pollution in these cities. India's cities are not alone. In Beijing, the 5 million automobiles and coal-burning and construction dust have made that Chinese city one of the most polluted in the world. In addition, 40 percent of Beijing's water supply is too polluted to use thanks to chemical discharges from industry. Shanghai is unable to use 56 percent of its water supply because of pollution. Pollution problems in the United States are not nearly as profound as they are in some of these cit-ies in the Far East, but they do exist. In Brady, Texas, the drinking water was found to have nine times the acceptable level of radium in 2018. Flint, Newark, and Pittsburgh have been battling lead problems in their drinking water for years.

The Indian cities have taken a small step recently to address their air pollution by setting up monitoring sites and collecting data. Leaders in Beijing came to Chicago in 2018 to study our parks system, with the hope of creating more green spaces in their city to help the quality of life. Brady is seeking a federal grant to replace its water system. Both Flint and Pittsburgh are actively addressing their water problems.

These are all positive steps. But much more will have to be done. The inhabitants of these cities will demand it. The New York Times reported that corporations are now refusing to move to the polluted cities in India. Most certainly those who are able to move out of those cities are already doing so. If polluted cities don't literally clean up their act, they will wither.

The modern city under the modern mayor must become a place where people can live, work, and play. Finding the equilibrium among those three needs determines a city's viability, today and into the future.

But no city has yet found the perfect balance. Even good, healthy cities have serious problems that can seem intractable. As I have mentioned, the rate of gun violence in Chicago, though steadily getting better, is still a tragedy and still needs a lot of work. Even though New York City mayor Bill de Blasio is not in charge of his city's mass transit system (the governor of New York is), he can't just punt the problems currently plaguing the system upstairs. He has to do whatever it takes to make sure that the subway system is modernized. If he doesn't, the progress of share ideas and get things done, reaching the same ends with different means, if that's what it takes. The best of them make their cities better places to live, work, and play. With the help of universities and nonprofits, they can create—and then scale—vitally important programs like BAM and the Star Scholarship. I'm full of hope because of what mayors have been able to accomplish, individually and collectively, when it comes to addressing the world's most pressing problems.

Bryan Barnett of Rochester Hills is optimistic, too: ""Mayors have earned trust, and we're given the liberty to try and bring solutions to communities because of that trust. That's a very productive thing.""

So is Louisville's Greg Fischer: ""A lot of it is about increasing our mind frame about what's possible when it comes to providing a brighter future for everyone. I'm confident we are getting there.""

So is Nan Whaley: ""Mayors are on the ground and we have to be pragmatic. We can move quickly and transform things very fast. The future is better because of that.""

Income inequality, the environment, immigration, housing, education, infrastructure, mounting pension debt, the costs of prosperity—all of these issues confront mayors and cities, and they require constant work and vigilance. These issues are all intertwined. They're about making the world work and making it a better place. It is our mayors who stand on the front line when it comes to these issues, confronted by ""the fierce urgency of now,"" as Martin Luther King, Jr., once said.

Our cities are our places of opportunity. They were for my grandfather. They are for me. For you. For everyone in the world.

They contain all the peril in today's world.

More important, they also contain all of the promise.

44,Emanuel,Rahm,foreignaffairs,"O’Hare International Airport in Chicago is one of the most important transportation hubs on the earth. With 2,700 flights a day and more than 80 million passengers a year, it is one of the United States’ busiest airports and the world’s second-biggest connector airport, linking flights to points across the globe. It is also, in certain crucial areas, old and outdated; some of the runways and terminals have gone decades without an overhaul. And when O’Hare gets clogged up, the rest of the country does, too.

When Chicago last renegotiated the lease agreements for airlines operating at O’Hare, in 2011, the federal government provided nearly a billion dollars in funding. But in 2016, when the city took urgently needed steps to modernize the airport? Crickets.

Chicago didn’t have the luxury of postponing and waiting, fingers crossed, for federal help that might never materialize. Instead, the city took matters into its own hands and negotiated directly with the airlines. In March 2018, Chicago announced an $8.5 billion deal for terminal and gate modernization, on top of a $1.5 billion deal for runway expansion. The projects will nearly double the airport’s terminal space, increase the number of gates by a third, add new runways and reconfigure old ones, and increase daily flights by 40 percent. The negotiations took the city just two years from start to finish.

Infrastructure may not be sexy, but an expansion of this size is a big deal—not just for Chicago but for the entire country. And yet the city is getting it done without a penny of economic assistance from the federal government. Instead, all funding will come from an increase in passenger traffic. Federal bodies must, of course, approve the overall plan and any environmental mitigation. But O’Hare is a perfect illustration of a larger trend across the developed world: as national governments have become weak, paralyzed, and dysfunctional, cities and their mayors have filled the vacuum. In many critical areas, they are now the ones actually getting things done.

Nation-states do not reflect the future.

Obviously, mayors alone can’t maintain the military, address major public health risks, or run big national entitlement programs, but most day-to-day functions of government do come under their purview. Mayors acknowledge and actively address climate change. They deal with immigration and infrastructure and don’t just constantly kick these issues down the road, hoping someone else will figure them out. They grapple with education, inequality, health, housing, terrorism, and crime.

Nation-states do not reflect the future. Rather, they are in a state of atrophy and decline. As of this writing, a dozen national governments in Europe are minority governments, with perhaps a few more on the way. When confronted with problems, these governments will produce gridlock and stagnation. The situation isn’t much better in the United States, which, when it is not run by the minority party, is still polarized to the point of paralysis. In the last two decades, major bills have been signed into law only when one political party has controlled both the executive and the legislative branches.

The presidency of Donald Trump, with its constant turmoil, shadiness, and sheer ineptitude, is a big problem for the United States. But Trump is merely a symptom of a deeper disease. People take a bat to the political system—whether by supporting a candidate like Trump or by voting for a radical breach like Brexit, to name but two examples—when they feel not just economic discontent but a broader sense of frustration that the nation-state is utterly incapable of addressing their fundamental concerns. In 2016, the American public was willing to try anything new, no matter how nontraditional.

Cities offer disaffected citizens a different approach. They have become places where function has replaced dysfunction, intimacy has replaced distance, and immediacy has replaced dithering. A city’s constituents can, and do, truly affect policies and outcomes through their engagement. “Local government is where trust lives,” Eric Beinhocker, the executive director of the Institute for New Economic Thinking, has said. And indeed, according to polling by Gallup, 35 percent of Americans trust the federal government, but 72 percent trust their local governments.

Cities offer disaffected citizens a different approach.

The news media aim much of their focus and energy these days on what is going on in, and what is coming out of, Washington, D.C.: the president’s Twitter feed, the palace intrigue, the ineffectiveness of so many members of Congress. The impulse is natural, and oversight of the federal government is crucial, especially when the government turns out to be corrupt. But much of that focus would be of more use if directed away from Washington to places less mired in gridlock, including cities.

“It is one of the happy incidents of the federal system,” the Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis wrote in 1932, “that a single courageous state may, if its citizens choose, serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country.” Brandeis was right. A good portion of the New Deal was cooked up in the labs of a few states. Later, the Great Society and the Affordable Care Act were, too. These great ideas all flowed up into the national government from the states below. Today, however, cities, not states, are the laboratories. But unfortunately, their ideas no longer flow vertically to the national level (although perhaps, one day, the best of them will). Instead, they spread horizontally from city to city, not just in the United States but all over the world. As mayor of Chicago, for instance, I was a member of the Metropolitan Mayors Caucus, the United States Conference of Mayors, and the C40 Cities, a global coalition of cities devoted to addressing climate change.

When Trump initiated his administration’s travel ban, hundreds of cities around the country declared themselves sanctuaries for immigrants. And when he decided to pull the United States out of the Paris climate accord, Chicago held a climate conference during which dozens of the world’s biggest cities decided to opt in to the agreement apart from their respective national governments. In doing so, cities have become the beachhead of resistance to the ill-conceived decisions of national governments that go against the popular will.

Emanuel campaigning in Chicago, February 2015 Jim Young / Reuters

But cities and mayors don’t just use their autonomy to collaborate on playing defense. The ideas they generate, test, and share with one another are often forward-thinking and progressive. When former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg created a technology hub with partnerships among universities, businesses, and the local government, scores of other cities decided to follow suit. At a time when no one else was really addressing the opioid epidemic, Chicago sued big pharmaceutical companies for deceptive marketing. The idea caught on quickly, and more than 700 other cities are now involved in opioid lawsuits. Inspired by projects in Berlin, Buenos Aires, Dallas, and Paris to repurpose old industrial waterfronts, Chicago undertook a project it called Riverwalk along the Chicago River. And almost simultaneously, Boston, Chicago, and Louisville introduced initiatives to address public education beyond the usual K–12 range, from as early as pre-kindergarten all the way to college. “Good mayors imitate,” Nan Whaley, the mayor of Dayton, Ohio, has said. “Great mayors steal.”

What’s more, cities are sharing ideas across party lines. Although many of the world’s biggest cities are led by mayors who identify as liberals, not all are. The mayors work together regardless. “We maybe come from different broader philosophical ideas about the role of government,” Tom Tait, the Republican former mayor of Anaheim, California, has said. “But at the local level it’s about getting things done and serving people. And there’s not a whole lot of ideology in that.”

Says Knox White, the Republican mayor of Greenville, South Carolina, “Our federal politicians are in a bubble. We aren’t on the city level, and don’t want to be. We talk to our constituents. We work with each other to get things done. My job is to facilitate this. It’s what I do. That’s what a mayor does.” That fundamental task is the same in cities large (Chicago), medium (Louisville, Kentucky), and small (Carmel, Indiana). All of them are working together to trade goods, ideas, and innovations outside the channel of the national government. They have become nation cities.",-1,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2020-02-21/new-city-states
45,Emanuel,Rahm,wsj,"Conventional wisdom has it that the Democratic primary is little more than a battle between moderates and progressives. But something else is going on here. Beyond ideology, the party is yet again arguing about whether we’re more apt to win as agents of change or as beacons of the establishment. The six candidates still standing line up on different sides of that debate—but not in the way you might think.

The atmospherics are important. In the quarter-century since Newt Gingrich became speaker of the House, Washington has become increasingly dysfunctional. Whatever your theory for why that’s happened, Donald Trump’s surprise election in 2016 was born largely of presenting himself as a change agent for those angry at Washington. Now Democrats are faced with a fundamental choice: Should we promise to return Washington to the pre-Trump “normal,” or should we instead take back the mantle of change?

Two mayors offer answers to that question. Pete Buttigieg’s rise in New Hampshire was extraordinary. He had been deprived of the bounce candidates typically get from winning Iowa. His debate performance was not his best. But he came within a point of beating the senator from next-door Vermont and easily bested the senator from next-door Massachusetts. Few have noted the chief reason: Ahead of the primary, the Biden campaign released a digital spot diminishing his work installing streetlights, beautifying downtown South Bend, Ind., and improving the system for locating lost pets. Far from boosting the former vice president’s campaign, the ad redounded to Mr. Buttigieg’s benefit.

The central reason underpins a reality framing the race. State and local government today get things done, while Washington so frequently falls short. Recall that Michigan’s Gov. Gretchen Whitmer won office on the strength of a simple slogan: “Just fix the damn roads!” Mr. Biden’s ad highlighted Mr. Buttigieg’s core appeal—his record of driving change at the local level can be applied to the nation as a whole. Mike Bloomberg comes with an impressive “get it done” record as mayor. If he can brandish those accomplishments on the campaign trail (and actually prepare for debates), he could be a contender. The jury is still out on that question.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar is a remarkable case of a candidate who keyed in on a winning message late in the New Hampshire campaign. Throughout the battle in Iowa, she focused on the résumé she’d built in the Senate—which subcommittees she’d served on, which bills she’d drafted, which GOP co-sponsors she had. That focus framed her as an insider. Moderate or more progressive, her Washington résumé made her an embodiment of the status quo.",-1,https://www.wsj.com/articles/bernie-sanders-insider-11582243676
46,Emanuel,Rahm,wsj,"Reform is often more effective than revolution. Amid the heated rhetoric now blowing through Iowa, Democrats appear to be losing sight of that. Progressivism isn’t a destination—it’s an orientation. Purists are anxious to box some of us out by narrowing the definition, but we all share in the mission of using government’s tools to serve those who have been left behind. The next nine months will present our raucous coalition a rare opportunity to establish a new Democratic “metropolitan majority” that could last for years. We can’t afford to let internecine disagreements about how to reach our common goals get in the way.

In an autocratic system, those in power have a free hand to enact an agenda without considering the electoral implications. But because the Constitution guarantees regular elections, progressives are compelled to build agendas that balance policy and politics. (Message to activists: 270 electoral votes is the goal—not just winning the popular vote.) A well-intentioned progressive idea that’s liable to sink the rest of our agenda may well be worth doing on its own merits—but the upside needs to be weighed against the costs of handing power back to the GOP. Democrats heading to the ballot box need think about how not only to encourage progressive change but to sustain it.

In recent months both Presidents Clinton and Obama have come under withering criticism—not from conservatives but from Democrats arguing they were insufficiently progressive while in office. Set aside the unforced error of attacking fellow Democrats at a moment when retiring Donald Trump ought to be our singular goal. The underlying critique fundamentally misunderstands how we should judge any given leader’s stewardship of our agenda.

Consider the circumstances each president faced in office. Mr. Clinton governed a country much more suspicious of government than it had been a generation earlier (and than it is today). Mr. Obama assumed office amid the most significant financial crisis since the Great Depression. Nevertheless, both presidents left remarkable legacies of progressive success.

Both signed major climate-change accords—the Kyoto Protocol of 1997 and the Paris Agreement of 2015. Mr. Clinton created a major new health-care program to cover uninsured children, and Mr. Obama signed the Affordable Care Act. Both managed to make work pay through doubling the earned-income tax credit and to work toward fiscal discipline by demanding that the rich pay their fair share of taxes.",-1,https://www.wsj.com/articles/democrats-may-be-blowing-their-chance-11580514064

48,Emanuel,Rahm,hotair,"A vote to acquit, however, will force every senator to own Trump’s emboldened rhetoric of being exonerated. Which means they’ll have to defend Trump when the next embarrassing audio recording hits the airwaves, or when another witness surfaces to speak, or when John Bolton’s book comes out, or when internal memos about the “drug deal” come out via the Freedom of Information Act. Republican senators will become full-time exonerators.

That dilemma is now playing out in real time. Some 63 percent of voters in Arizona, Colorado, Maine and North Carolina look unfavorably on the Senate’s decision to date to disallow witnesses and hide documents — yet all five senators mentioned earlier have, so far, voted against transparency. That may partly explain why the five Republican senators are “underwater,” meaning that more constituents view them negatively than positively. And if that snapshot bodes poorly, the trend lines are worse: In the last quarter of 2019, McSally and Collins saw 5- and 4-point drops, respectively, in their “net” approval rating — an indication that a rising share of their constituents view them in a negative light.

For years, I’ve believed that the balance of the Senate almost invariably followed the outcome of a presidential election. This coming year, by contrast, the Trump impeachment may have such inertial power that the old truism of nationalized results during presidential cycles may no longer be valid.

49,Emanuel,Rahm,washingtonpost,"That’s not going to happen again. Last year’s Democratic victories in Kentucky and Louisiana illustrated that pursuing Trump isn’t the political kryptonite for Democrats that persecuting Clinton was for Republicans. That’s probably because even many of Trump’s supporters presume he is guilty of breaking the law. It is rare for an incumbent’s popularity to be in the low to mid-40s this close to reelection. It suggests that the country has grown numb to his Twitter tirades — and that character still matters.

Some will argue that the president is an outlier — that he’s immune to the laws of politics. Whether that proves to be right, there’s one arena in which impeachment is likely to have an outsize impact: in the battle for control of Congress. The House looks to stay in Democratic hands: Already, fear of a Trumplash partly explains why 26 House Republicans have announced they are retiring or seeking another office. Meanwhile, Democrats are said even by some Republicans to be “crushing” House GOP fundraising efforts. If Republicans are too busy defending their seats to run competitively in districts already controlled by Democrats, Pelosi’s double-digit margin in the House is likely to survive.

Fifteen of the GOP senators who will try President Trump's impeachment were in Congress during the Clinton impeachment. Only one voted to acquit Bill Clinton. (The Washington Post)

But if the scandal is working to preserve the Democratic tilt in the House, it could upend things in the Senate, where Republicans hold a three-seat margin. Impeachment will likely decide the fate of a handful of Senate Republicans currently in cycle. For Sens. Susan Collins (Maine), Thom Tillis (N.C.), Joni Ernst (Iowa), Cory Gardner (Colo.) and Martha McSally (Ariz.), a vote to convict is unthinkable: It risks the president’s wrath and a likely primary challenge. That combination would force each senator to embrace an agenda alien to most swing voters.

A vote to acquit, however, will force every senator to own Trump’s emboldened rhetoric of being exonerated. Which means they’ll have to defend Trump when the next embarrassing audio recording hits the airwaves, or when another witness surfaces to speak, or when John Bolton’s book comes out, or when internal memos about the “drug deal” come out via the Freedom of Information Act. Republican senators will become full-time exonerators.

If, as expected, the Senate votes to acquit the president, many may cast impeachment as a strategic blunder. But that analysis may be premature. Just as they overshot the mark by impeaching Clinton two decades ago, Republicans have overcorrected today by whitewashing Trump’s clear wrongdoing — at least so far.

If Democrats nominate a candidate who projects calmness, coolness and character in contrast with Trump’s chaos, corruption and constant conflict, we are likely to emerge from the November election in much better shape than many might now anticipate. And our success will be tied explicitly to the vote these senators take giving the president a pass for behavior most Americans now view as illegal.",-1,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/01/29/rahm-emanuel-oped-impeachment-senate/
50,Emanuel,Rahm,washingtonpost,"But whatever truth there is to that explanation, it has never encompassed the whole story. Christians weren’t unthinking when they supported this heathen. In 2016, many evangelicals simply prized his inclination to attack sneering elites more than they concerned themselves with his amoral conduct. Much as they might have disapproved of his personal behavior, his candidacy became an outlet and an instrument for their resentments. And in the great tradition of hating the sin and loving the sinner, they ate it up.

That speaks to an unacknowledged reality: Identity doesn’t solely define American politics. Voters aren’t vassals who blindly support candidates who look or act (or eat or pray) like them. And frankly, it’s insulting to presume that a certain slice of a demographic will support a candidate simply because they share a candidate’s characteristic or trait.

That same dynamic applies in the Democratic presidential contest. When Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) decided to center her campaign on an explicit appeal to women, her message fell flat, even among female voters. Former vice president Joe Biden has consistently polled better among African Americans than both Sens. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J). Before he dropped out, Julián Castro was tied for fifth in a poll of Latino voters, despite being the only Latino candidate. And Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the oldest candidate in the field, appears to be doing better among progressive millennials than the field’s youngest candidate, former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg. I could go on, but I think you get the point.

Identity is influential in a voter’s mind — but it’s informative, not determinative. John F. Kennedy explicitly disavowed accusations that he was nothing more than a representative of his religion in 1960, famously arguing, “I am not the Catholic candidate for president. I am the Democratic Party’s candidate for president, who happens also to be a Catholic.” In 2008, Barack Obama made the same point: “Despite the temptation to view my candidacy through a purely racial lens, we won commanding victories in states with some of the whitest populations in the country.”

In Iowa, like other early states, many voters are undecided explicitly because they’re considering what the candidates have to say, what they propose to do and how their narratives reveal how they might govern. They’re proving to be concerned with far more than identity politics. And while it’s not the same thing, you can see echoes of the evangelical community’s support for Trump in the way Democratic primary voters are willing to look beyond gender, race, ethnicity and sexual orientation in candidate selection. Why, for example, would anyone have presumed that young voters were likely to support the youngest candidate or that Latino voters would only back a Latino candidate?

In the end, candidates win elections by capturing the zeitgeist of the moment. After eight years of Ronald Reagan, Vice President George H.W. Bush promised Americans “a kinder, gentler nation.” Amid the Bush recession, Bill Clinton promised to be “change versus more of the same.” After the scourge of Speaker Newt Gingrich, Gov. George W. Bush promised to govern with “compassionate conservatism.” And after Bush committed the United States to what would become the longest war in the nation’s history, Obama personified “the audacity of hope.”

All of this is to say that demographics is not destiny. Most voters will look past any given candidate’s identity if their ideas appeal to what the electorate wants from a commander in chief at that particular moment in history. During a year when Democrats are justifiably consumed with anger at Trump, we need to focus on contrasting our competence and capability against the incumbent’s desire for chaos and constant conflict. Voters are ready for something different. But to win, we need to embody a hopeful future that Trump’s fear-mongering will never deliver.",-1,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/identity-politics-wont-win-this-presidential-election/2020/01/10/0195c978-33bc-11ea-a053-dc6d944ba776_story.html

What did that moment tell us? Riven though we are, we are also, on many matters, united. The paradox of this moment presents Democrats with an opportunity.

Trump knows that conflict is his lifeblood. Division fit the 2016 zeitgeist, a moment when the electorate was hungry to give the elite a long-awaited comeuppance. And the president can still find plenty of places in the country where his hateful rhetoric finds a hungry audience.

But things have since taken a turn. Today, the president’s inability to get more than 45 percent in most polls suggests the electorate’s thirst for conflict has morphed into something else — namely, an equal desire for consensus.

Story continues below advertisement

Ahead of 2020, voters are desperate for someone who will tap into the lost sense of community that Barack Obama embraced when he famously argued at the height of our national split over Iraq that “there is not a liberal America and a conservative America — there is the United States of America.” They are in search of someone who will provide a more accurate picture of how much we agree on, someone who will shine a light on how we can rise above the conflicts that divide us.

The evidence is irrefutable. By a margin of 74 percent to 21 percent, Gallup polling this year found that Americans believe trade is an “opportunity for economic growth through increased U.S. exports” as opposed to a “threat to the economy from foreign imports.” Some 83 percent of Americans believe that “dreamers,” the undocumented adults brought to the United States as children, should be protected from deportation. And 83 percent support staying in NATO, despite the White House’s insistence that the United States is getting a raw deal.

Consensus is deeper than we like to admit; it’s reflected in the country’s preferences on foreign, social and economic fronts alike. Roughly 80 percent believe that humans are driving climate change. A poll in 2018 found that more than 3 in 5 Americans believe that government is doing too little to preserve the environment, and that only 9 percent believe that government is doing too much. Roughly 2 of every 3 Americans favor stricter gun laws. And a broad majority support making the tax code more progressive.

Story continues below advertisement

This paradox — that conflict and consensus coexist — raises for Democrats a strategic choice. If Trump is going to do his best to deepen the conflict, should we do the same? Or, after three years of enduring the White House’s efforts to pit community against community, should we lean into the exhausted electorate’s desire to embrace a leader who will bind up the nation’s wounds?

I believe we should promise the American people a vision that brings the country together.

Having watched Trump’s political success — cognizant that, far from draining the swamp, the Trump White House has made politics much more treacherous — some have concluded that we should throw his strategy back in his face. They want to out-Trump Trump. But that would be taking his bait. Trump’s campaign strategists would inevitably like nothing more than for us to respond to his bullying in kind because they know that would undercut our biggest advantage — namely, that Democrats project the cool, calm, capable alternative to the president’s chaos, crassness and conflict.

Rather than try to win the political Hunger Games, we would be better off promising a vision that brings the country together around a common cause and common purpose.

Some may accuse me of being Pollyanna-ish — there’s a first time for everything. But at a moment when so many Americans agree on a wide range of crucial topics, we should strike a more vivid contrast by setting Trump’s divisiveness against our belief that America is far more than the sum of her disagreements.

We don’t need to tell Americans that the president’s decision to bully Greta Thunberg was wrong — they know that. We don’t need to tell them that his Dec. 18 attack on Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.) and her late husband, John, was beyond the pale and beneath this nation — they know that as well.

52,Emanuel,Rahm,greenwichtime,"Every so often, and frequently with no one paying much attention, something happens in Washington that goes against the grain. This month, House Democrats unveiled articles of impeachment the same morning they announced a deal with the Trump White House updating NAFTA. If everything in Washington centered on conflict, President Donald Trump and Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., would never have been able to align themselves on a major trade agreement.

And yet there they were, serving up evidence that division and consensus can sit, however uncomfortably, side by side.

What did that moment tell us? Riven though we are, we are also, on many matters, united. The paradox of this moment presents Democrats with an opportunity.

Trump knows that conflict is his lifeblood. Division fit the 2016 zeitgeist, a moment when the electorate was hungry to give the elite a long-awaited comeuppance. And the president can still find plenty of places in the country where his hateful rhetoric finds a hungry audience.

But things have since taken a turn. Today, the president's inability to get more than 45 percent in most polls suggests the electorate's thirst for conflict has morphed into something else - namely, an equal desire for consensus.

Ahead of 2020, voters are desperate for someone who will tap into the lost sense of community that Barack Obama embraced when he famously argued at the height of our national split over Iraq that ""there is not a liberal America and a conservative America - there is the United States of America."" They are in search of someone who will provide a more accurate picture of how much we agree on, someone who will shine a light on how we can rise above the conflicts that divide us.

The evidence is irrefutable. By a margin of 74% to 21%, Gallup polling this year found that Americans believe trade is an ""opportunity for economic growth through increased U.S. exports"" as opposed to a ""threat to the economy from foreign imports."" Some 83% of Americans believe that ""dreamers,"" the undocumented adults brought to the United States as children, should be protected from deportation. And 83% support staying in NATO, despite the White House's insistence that the United States is getting a raw deal.

Consensus is deeper than we like to admit - it's reflected in the country's preferences on foreign, social and economic fronts alike. Roughly 80% believe that humans are driving climate change. A poll in 2018 found that more than 3 in 5 Americans believe that government is doing too little to preserve the environment, and that only 9 percent believe that government is doing too much. Roughly 2 of every 3 Americans favor stricter gun laws. And a broad majority supports making the tax code more progressive.

This paradox - that conflict and consensus coexist - raises for Democrats a strategic choice. If Trump is going to do his best to deepen the conflict, should we do the same? Or, after three years of enduring the White House's efforts to pit community against community, should we lean into the exhausted electorate's desire to embrace a leader who will bind up the nation's wounds?

Rather than try to win the race to the bottom, I believe we would be better off promising the American people a vision that brings the country together around a common cause and common purpose.

Having watched Trump's political success - cognizant that, far from draining the swamp, the Trump White House has made politics much more treacherous - some have concluded that we should throw his strategy back in his face. They want to out-Trump Trump. But that would be taking his bait. Trump's campaign strategists would inevitably like nothing more than for us to respond to his bullying in kind because they know that would undercut our biggest advantage - namely that Democrats project the cool, calm, capable alternative to the president's chaos, crassness and conflict.

Rather than try to win the political Hunger Games, I believe we would be better off promising a vision that brings the country together around a common cause and common purpose.

Some may accuse me of being Pollyanna-ish - there's a first time for everything. But at a moment when so many Americans agree on a wide range of crucial topics, we should strike a more vivid contrast by setting Trump's divisiveness against our belief that America is far more than the sum of her disagreements.

We don't need to tell Americans that the president's decision to bully Greta Thunberg was wrong - they know that. We don't need to tell them that his Dec. 18 attack on Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., and her late husband, John, was beyond the pale and beneath this nation - they know that as well. The surest path to victory is to prevent Trump from playing the victim or anti-establishment outsider - and to ensure that we never let him infect our message with his invective.

Democrats will be tempted to respond to the name-calling in kind - to paint his supporters with the same broad strokes they paint various communities within our coalition. Many of us will want to put the differences between us and them in the starkest relief. We should be strategic.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) have done a masterful job baiting the rest of the field into fighting this campaign on their turf. Many voters inevitably presume today that redistribution of wealth is the Democratic Party’s animating creed.

But that’s simply not true to history: Since the New Deal, Democrats have thrived when championing ideas moored in the belief that rights come with responsibilities and that benefits are earned through work. If we fail to return to that agenda ahead of the 2020 election, we risk squandering a rare opportunity. Fortunately, we now have a chance to shift the narrative.

Amid all the talk about programs designed to redistribute America’s wealth, the phrase most glaringly absent from the 2020 campaign to this point is “inclusive growth.” With former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick entering the race last week and former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg emerging as another late entrant, we can begin to have an ideas primary in earnest.

Amid all the talk about programs designed to redistribute America’s wealth, the phrase most glaringly absent from the 2020 campaign to this point is “inclusive growth.” With former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick entering the race last week and former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg emerging as another late entrant, we can begin to have an ideas primary in earnest. We’re stronger as a party when we debate substantive proposals for how to expand prosperity and opportunity. But to meet the far left’s big ideas, traditional liberals need to show up with bold ideas of their own.

Admittedly, I’ve been critical of those trying to the steer the Democratic Party further to the left. I think Medicare-for-all is a pipe dream, though I support efforts to expand coverage and control costs. And much as I agree that concentrated power is a threat to American prosperity, I believe a universal basic income runs counter to America’s deep-seated belief that people should earn their living by working hard and playing by the rules. As power and money have flowed away from the working and middle classes — a change driven as much by technology and globalization as by a rigged system — government has too frequently turned the other cheek. Since we have consensus on the nature of the problem, the question then is how to level the playing field.

Traditional liberals need to begin offering their own bold ideas for three principle reasons. The first and most important centers on history. Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal, John F. Kennedy’s New Frontier, Bill Clinton’s New Covenant, and Barack Obama’s belief that “there’s not a liberal America and a conservative America. There’s the United States of America,” all appealed to voters by tapping into the nation’s firmly established belief that people should earn their prosperity through hard work. Social Security and Medicare aren’t handouts; they’re financed by what workers pay through a payroll tax. The GI Bill and AmeriCorps both offer tuition assistance in return for national service. The earned-income tax credit is designed to boost families working their way out of poverty.

By tying benefits to work, the programs that remain the central pillars of the Democratic Party’s legacy stand apart from the agenda the far left has embraced in this campaign. Our most sweeping successes fighting poverty have emerged when we’ve offered the American people a core bargain: If you work through the course of your life, the government will help you climb into the middle class. When our party has nominated candidates banging the drum for redistribution — such as George McGovern or Walter Mondale — we’ve lost. Hopefully, bids from Bloomberg and Patrick will serve as a wake-up call.

Second, if you want to help America’s middle class (and those trying to enter the middle class), it is much more effective to give breadwinners the tools to succeed than it is to hand them a bevy of unearned entitlements. Washington needs to invest in the nation’s education system, infrastructure, and research and development. But those priorities get lost when voters hear our candidates speak almost exclusively about how they intend to hand out additional entitlements no questions asked.

Third, Democrats need to be clear on the politics. President Trump’s reelection hopes hinge on his ability to scare suburban voters, a key constituency within our Metropolitan Majority, into believing they can’t trust Democrats with their hard-earned money. Let’s not be politically short-sighted or give Republicans opportunities to frame us as irresponsible tax-and-spenders by championing, for example, proposals to give free health care to new undocumented immigrants. Beyond harnessing Trump’s abysmal approval rating, we can use this moment to establish a governing majority that lasts well past 2020. Let’s not squander our advantage.

Good on Warren and Sanders for bringing their “A-game” to the debate — but let’s be clear: Big ideas aren’t necessarily good. With any luck, Bloomberg and Patrick will spur traditional liberals to re-animate the bold Democratic creed centered on work, responsibility, shared prosperity and equal access to opportunity.

What the party needs to learn from this week's elections.",-1,https://www.realclearpolitics.com/2019/11/08/dear_democrats_heres_how_not_to_blow_it_491992.html
56,Emanuel,Rahm,politico,"AP Photo/David J. Phillip Opinion Dear Democrats: Here’s How Not to Blow It What the party needs to learn from this week’s elections.

Rahm Emanuel is the former mayor of Chicago, former White House chief of staff, and former member of Congress from Illinois.

This week’s elections confirmed two things.

One: Democrats are on a winning streak. We flipped Kentucky’s gubernatorial seat and won control of the Virginia state Legislature—this on top of the gains from 2018, when Democrats retook the U.S. House of Representatives, flipped six state houses and picked up seven gubernatorial seats.

Two: The playbook Democrats have used to such success in swing states over the past year is being utterly ignored by our party’s presidential candidates.

Every Democrat shares in the conviction that our overriding priority is making Donald Trump a one-term president. Liberal or moderate, we’re united in wanting to win. And after our big victories last November and earlier this month—which saw Democrats victorious not just in safely blue areas but also in competitive suburban communities and battleground states—there’s no question about how to get that done.

Which is why, for the life of me, I cannot understand why our presidential candidates are failing to heed the lessons from Democrats’ 2018 and 2019 victories.

The Democratic candidates who have prevailed in battleground contests since 2016 didn’t embrace pie-in-the-sky policy ideas or propose a smorgasbord of new entitlements. They didn’t talk constantly about providing a guaranteed basic income. Or promising to make college free. Or eliminating private insurance and replacing it with a government-run health care system. Or giving $250 more each month in Social Security benefits. Or enacting the ""Green New Deal."" Or calling for the immediate and abrupt end of fossil fuels. Or vowing to seize guns from people’s homes.

During both cycles, we won swing districts and battleground states by using the same playbook: sticking to an agenda that meets voters where and how they live their lives. In tone, tenor and talent, those winning candidates spoke to issues that middle-class voters face every day. Which raises the question: Why aren’t our leading presidential candidates looking to replicate that success?

There’s a gaping disconnect between that successful playbook and the strategic choices on display during the ongoing presidential primary debates. Inexplicably, the men and women who want to be our party’s standard-bearer seem to be ignoring the unambiguous message voters are sending—and that should concern anyone who wants to defeat Trump in 2020.

Voters of almost all stripes want to vote against Trump. He’s remarkably unpopular, particularly given that unemployment is at 3.7 percent. From a political perspective, that’s an unusual gift for us. Other Republicans would know how to take advantage of the current economic conditions, but Donald Trump is no Ronald Reagan. No one would ever describe him as a “happy warrior.” (Frankly, he even makes Richard Nixon look like a ray of sunshine.) A majority of Americans don’t like Trump’s personality, his divisive rhetoric or his performance in office.

That’s a significant opening for Democrats—but not a guarantee. Even having been dealt a good hand, we need to play our cards carefully.

For too long, Democrats have been engaged internally in a fruitless debate about whether we ought to pursue a strategy that emphasizes persuasion or mobilization. Trump has made that conversation obsolete. He is all the impetus many voters need to get out to the polls. The 2018 midterm elections had a record turnout. And this past Tuesday, Kentucky’s incumbent Republican governor, Matt Bevin, lost despite getting roughly 200,000 more votes in this year’s election than he had four years earlier, when he won.

The good news for Democrats is that Trump doesn’t have enough die-hard voters to win without convincing some voters who are on the fence. The bad news for Democrats? Neither do we.

As the 2018 and 2019 elections proved beyond any doubt, if we’re going to prevail in battleground states like Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, we both need to get our base to the polls and we need to persuade voters that they can safely vote for our candidates, knowing that they are the right choice for the country.

Candidates like Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer and Kentucky Governor-elect Andy Beshear and a host of first-term members of the House of Representatives and a bevy of state legislators around the country have made absolutely plain how to win in battleground states and districts. They established a durable playbook for building coalitions between urban and suburban voters—an alliance that I term the “Metropolitan Majority.”

When Whitmer was running for governor, she made “Fix the Damn Roads!” her campaign slogan because that phrase spoke to Michiganders’ general frustration that government simply wasn’t doing its job. She wasn’t offering voters Shangri-La, in large part because she knew they wouldn’t believe any elected official could deliver it. Instead, she offered the public an appreciation that getting the basics done well would exceed most people’s expectations and help improve their lives in practical, tangible ways. By tapping into the prevailing view, Whitmer was able to fortify our party’s Metropolitan Majority—flipping a swing-state gubernatorial seat Republicans had held for eight years.

That’s why our party enjoyed so much success both in 2018 and then again Tuesday. What’s so odd is that despite the lessons of success, our candidates are taking positions during this primary campaign that will almost inevitably be liabilities during the general election.

The dissonance is remarkable. Compare what the candidates who won last year and this year’s elections have done to what the presidential candidates are offering ahead of 2020. On health care, successful Democrats didn’t mention ""Medicare for All;"" they explained how they would control prescription drug costs and preserve protections for preexisting conditions. They didn’t offer free college; they spoke about equity and fairness across the educational spectrum, from early childhood to higher ed. They didn’t talk about the Green New Deal so much as they proposed to expand renewable energy and invest in the jobs and growth that come with it. They didn’t offer to guarantee anyone’s income so much as explained how they would attract good jobs that would provide for a middle-class life. They didn’t talk about confiscating guns from law-abiding citizens; they promised to support the background checks that prevent criminals from getting access to weapons.

These distinctions matter. The substance of our ideas provides a window into what we care about, whose interests we’ll pursue and how we intend to govern. That’s why, as a political matter, the Democratic Party’s agenda needs to be practical, prudent and progressive. In his column yesterday, John Harris argued that it’s not always the “safe” Democrats who make history. Maybe so, but that’s putting the cart before the horse: You can’t make history if you don’t hold the White House, and that has to be the overwhelming priority this year.

Our proposals should be defensible when they’re attacked—or, even better, they should bait Republicans into revealing how out of touch they really are. How could they be against protecting the health insurance covering people with preexisting conditions? Or keeping automatic weapons out of the hands of convicted criminals? Let’s not give Trump the opportunity to claim that we want to take away people’s health insurance. Instead, let’s put him in a position of having to defend the people who offer nothing but thoughts and prayers when there’s yet another mass shooting in a schoolyard.

There’s a reason that successful candidates in state and local battlegrounds have chosen this approach: It works both electorally and as an agenda for governing. To win nationwide, we need to focus on building a lasting Metropolitan Majority that binds together the broad collection of liberal, moderate, urban and suburban voters.

This can be a historic moment for a party, one in which, beyond beating Trump, we establish a lasting coalition. Let’s let the lessons we’ve learned in the past three years point us in a direction that ends the current nightmare, puts the Democratic Party on firm footing and gets the country back on track.",-1,https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/11/08/democrats-2020-advice-rahm-emanuel-229909

I’m mystified as to why, at a moment when 90% of Americans already have insurance, our presidential debates are focused so exclusively on expanding coverage rather than containing costs. That’s the challenge that bedevils most families constructing their monthly budgets at the kitchen table. Moreover, let’s not forget that the Affordable Care Act represents the only time in a century of trying that universal coverage managed to get a vote on the floor of both houses of Congress. Lightning rarely strikes once. But twice, in fewer than a dozen years?

Maybe you think Medicare-for-all is the way to go. If so, please explain to me exactly how we get that bill through the Senate? Remember, in 2010, we had 58 Democratic senators — yet we weren’t even able to get a vote on a public option. Even if we draw a royal flush in next year’s election, we’ll have only 51 votes. Here’s an offer: You identify for me the nine Senate Republicans who are going to vote to break a filibuster against a single-payer system and I’ll publicly declare that New York’s thin-crust cardboard pizza is better than Chicago’s deep dish.

I believe we ought to work on a more politically palatable agenda, one that builds on the successes we’ve achieved incrementally by expanding coverage to vulnerable portions of the population — for the elderly (Medicare), the poor (Medicaid), veterans (Veterans Affairs) and children (SCHIP).

How to do it? To begin, let’s remind voters of how dangerous President Donald Trump is. His budget called for the largest cuts in Medicare ever proposed by a U.S. president. Highlighting Trump’s plan for “Medicare Cuts for All” should be the table setter before we explain what we’ll do to control costs and expand coverage.

Then, in an effort to build on our previous successes, we should focus on the fastest-growing portion of the uninsured community — the vote-rich demographic of early retirees. Here’s a simple fix: Expand coverage by allowing Americans 55 and older to buy into Medicare before they hit 65. Republicans will then be forced either to support an expansion or alienate a crucial electoral voting bloc.

Finally, we should make good on the promise of a true public option by giving private citizens access to the same insurance covering federal employees. Senators, Cabinet secretaries and their family members enroll in taxpayer-subsidized plans that leverage the size of the federal workforce to drive down premiums, co-pays and prescription drug costs. Opening those rolls to everyone would put the GOP in the uncomfortable position of having to explain why voters shouldn’t have access to the same plans they’re already purchasing for people being chauffeured around Washington.

The bottom line is that there’s simply no path to enacting Medicare-for-all in the current political environment, and promising something we can’t deliver will do nothing but depress Democratic turnout in years to come. Since we’re already proposing to rewrite the tax code, decriminalize the border, give everyone free college and eliminate the use of fossil fuels with the Green New Deal — all initiatives that will require us to expend enormous amounts of political capital — maybe we want to be strategic on at least one big-ticket item.

Our approach to health care needs to be centered on political reality, not a pipe dream. Let’s pursue an agenda that not only controls costs and expands coverage but also opens the door for us to succeed fighting inequality, improving education, saving the environment and delivering social justice.

I'm mystified as to why, at a moment when 90% of Americans already have insurance, our presidential debates are focused so exclusively on expanding coverage rather than containing costs. That's the challenge that bedevils most families constructing their monthly budgets at the kitchen table. Moreover, let's not forget that the Affordable Care Act represents the only time in a century of trying that universal coverage managed to get a vote on the floor of both houses of Congress. Lightning rarely strikes once. But twice, in fewer than a dozen years?

Maybe you think Medicare-for-all is the way to go. If so, please explain to me exactly how we get that bill through the Senate? Remember, in 2010, we had 58 Democratic senators — yet we weren't even able to get a vote on a public option. Even if we draw a royal flush in next year's election, we'll have only 51 votes. Here's an offer: You identify for me the nine Senate Republicans who are going to vote to break a filibuster against a single-payer system and I'll publicly declare that New York's thin-crust cardboard pizza is better than Chicago's deep dish.

I believe we ought to work on a more politically palatable agenda, one that builds on the successes we've achieved incrementally by expanding coverage to vulnerable portions of the population — for the elderly (Medicare), the poor (Medicaid), veterans (Veterans Affairs) and children (SCHIP).

How to do it? To begin, let's remind voters of how dangerous President Donald Trump is. His budget called for the largest cuts in Medicare ever proposed by a U.S. president. Highlighting Trump's plan for ""Medicare Cuts for All"" should be the table setter before we explain what we'll do to control costs and expand coverage.

Then, in an effort to build on our previous successes, we should focus on the fastest-growing portion of the uninsured community — the vote-rich demographic of early retirees. Here's a simple fix: Expand coverage by allowing Americans 55 and older to buy into Medicare before they hit 65. Republicans will then be forced either to support an expansion or alienate a crucial electoral voting bloc.

Finally, we should make good on the promise of a true public option by giving private citizens access to the same insurance covering federal employees. Senators, Cabinet secretaries and their family members enroll in taxpayer-subsidized plans that leverage the size of the federal workforce to drive down premiums, co-pays and prescription drug costs. Opening those rolls to everyone would put the GOP in the uncomfortable position of having to explain why voters shouldn't have access to the same plans they're already purchasing for people being chauffeured around Washington.

The bottom line is that there's simply no path to enacting Medicare-for-all in the current political environment, and promising something we can't deliver will do nothing but depress Democratic turnout in years to come. Since we're already proposing to rewrite the tax code, decriminalize the border, give everyone free college and eliminate the use of fossil fuels with the Green New Deal — all initiatives that will require us to expend enormous amounts of political capital — maybe we want to be strategic on at least one big-ticket item.

Our approach to health care needs to be centered on political reality, not a pipe dream. Let's pursue an agenda that not only controls costs and expands coverage but also opens the door for us to succeed fighting inequality, improving education, saving the environment and delivering social justice.

Rahm Emanuel is a former mayor of Chicago, Democratic congressman from Illinois and White House chief of staff.

63,Emanuel,Rahm,washingtonpost,"When it comes to health-care reform, Democrats need to mind three basic rules.

First, experience teaches us that much as Americans hate the status quo, they’re not too excited about change, either.

Second, policy is not everything — political communication counts, too.

Third, success ultimately rests with uniting your allies and dividing your opponents.

She intends to counter President Trump’s incessant and erratic tweeting about a “Witch Hunt” and “treason” with a strategy that is evenhanded and fully appreciative of the gravity of the moment. She knows that, while impeachment is an inherently political process, the public will recoil if it appears as though Democrats are waging a political campaign. Even as recent polling reveals that support for impeachment and removal has risen quickly, all Democrats will be smart to mimic her steadiness as they step forward, serious in their manner, strategic in their direction.

What we are about to witness is a balancing act for both parties: Pelosi needs to move the process expeditiously — but the process needs to be seen as fair, not just fast. The charges must be clear, and the evidence needs to prove beyond any doubt that any proposed punishment fits the severity of the crime. Democrats will do themselves no favors if they fail to hold the president accountable; but they should be wary of overstepping as well. Republicans may fear conservative voters will punish them for criticizing Trump. But the GOP could lose everything if their party is seen to be marching in lockstep with a president who violated his oath.

Pelosi has never been keen to explain her strategy in public; you don’t get to be speaker by oversharing. But because this is an impeachment inquiry — not an actual impeachment — the key for Democrats at this stage will be to focus their efforts on fact-finding, not yet making a case for conviction. Particularly in these early days, our posture needs to be about bringing sunlight to a murky reality, not convincing the public that it should support any given outcome. Over time, more facts will come out. And when they do, they could lead investigators in any number of directions.

If by mid-November, the evidence makes a clear case that Trump has used the power of his office to coerce a foreign government and advance his electoral interests, impeachment will undoubtedly be in order. In the unlikely scenario that this is all smoke and no fire, Congress would be wise to set the matter aside. But if investigators determine that the president should be admonished without being evicted from the White House, the House has a third option at its disposal: The House can sanction and censure the president, as the Senate did President Andrew Jackson nearly 200 years ago.

Republicans could have taken the censure route in 1998 against President Bill Clinton. Instead, they got greedy, becoming obsessed with political retribution. Their hatred of Clinton twisted their judgment and left them to lose five seats in midterm elections that, by historic patterns, should have been a boon for the GOP. That’s a lesson for everyone: voters have a role here, too. Ignore them at your peril.

Republicans, meanwhile, have been more conspicuously closemouthed than Breitbart and Fox News would have you believe. Some members are privately appalled by the rough transcript of Trump’s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. There is no telling how many might support some kind of accountability if the Democrats conduct the proceedings fairly and equitably.

Pelosi is deftly navigating treacherous waters. Instead of splitting the inquiry among six committees, she has thrown her clout behind Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. That move promises to keep the inquiry focused on grave questions of national security and the invitation to foreign intervention in U.S. democracy.

If the House impeaches the president and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) shuts the proceeding down, Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) should demand a vote to censure the president instead. A count-by-count set of censure votes would be a difficult challenge for many Republicans. Each would have to make a stomach-churning choice between whitewashing despicable behavior and offending the president’s most ardent supporters.

No one is above the law. If other administration officials are implicated in the high crimes and misdemeanors, they too should face the appropriate consequences. But in these early days, Democrats will do themselves and the country the greatest service if they merely ensure the investigative process remains thorough, judicious and fair. There’s no shame in applying the lessons of 1834 and 1998 to today’s circumstance. And there’s no virtue rushing to judgment, no matter how much we believe Trump is running roughshod over the country.

66,Emanuel,Rahm,wsj,"The campaign against America’s opioid epidemic earned a victory last month when an Oklahoma judge held Johnson & Johnson responsible for its role in oversupplying addictive drugs. Yet the opioid problem is far larger than one drug company, or even the entire industry. Preventing abuse of addictive drugs requires improvements in countless nooks and crannies of public policy.

Chicago’s experience fighting opioids offers a lesson in what municipalities can and can’t do to stem public-health crises. While I was mayor, the Windy City became one of the first two cities in the country to sue the pharmaceutical industry. After filing the lawsuit, we took additional immediate steps to reduce the drug supply. Last year we modified all municipal labor contracts to specify that no health plan could authorize more than a seven-day supply of addictive painkillers, except in extreme circumstances such as end-of-life care.

My administration also imposed a $750 annual licensing fee on medical sales representatives within the city limits, and dedicated 100% of that revenue to drug rehabilitation. Today more than 4,000 drug-industry personnel in Chicago have registered and paid the fee, creating a multimillion-dollar fund that goes directly to clinics and specialists helping victims overcome their addictions. We also coordinated responses with officials from Cook and DuPage counties. Without these changes, the epidemic in the Chicago area would be much worse—and it is still bad.

Why was Chicago forced to confront the opioid problem on its own? Because those who should have shouldered the burden refused to lead. The federal government has the resources, authority and mandate to stem national public-health emergencies. But its agencies were AWOL, including the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Meanwhile, doctors and pharmacies spent their time pointing fingers rather than policing bad actors. That left local governments, short-staffed and ill-equipped, on their own. None of this absolves the drug companies and distributors for their role in the tragedy. But as someone who was screaming for help from one of America’s city halls, I can tell you it was maddening and disheartening.

There’s no doubt what Washington and its regulatory agencies could have done if they wanted to address the crisis. And these policy options are still on the table.",-1,https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-chicago-tackled-the-opioid-crisis-11568933505

Rahm would save the Democrat Party from Joe Biden and the

Can you imagine that race? The crafty and vengeful political ace, Rahm Emanuel, against the fumbling, vengeful and loudmouthed Donald Trump? What fun that would be.

As Kass notes, both Trump and Emanuel make progressive heads explode.

Democrats can learn from how Trump beat a field of opponents to win the Republican nomination. Trump was the last man standing after the opponents polished each other off.

So too with the progressives who are looking to polish each other off unless they can settle on a consensus candidate. How likely is that?

Biden fills the wide-open void that moderate and traditional liberals would love to fill. But Biden isn’t the one. They need someone with experience, wide name recognition and the smarts to take on the asinine dreams of the far-left candidates.

68,Emanuel,Rahm,journalnow,"The EITC may be the most powerful tool government has to fight poverty. The program enables low-income workers not only to reduce their federal taxes, it puts additional money back in their pockets. The resulting refunds can be significant: If you’re in a family earning $24,000 a year, the credit can mean $6,000 a year. That’s equivalent to a 25% pay raise.

Here’s the first problem: As it currently stands, 20% of eligible recipients do not apply for the EITC because they either are unaware that it exists, not sure how to claim it or find it too complicated. In response, we hosted tax clinics throughout the city, helping residents apply. Congress ought to simplify the application and then incentivize the private sector to help workers apply.

69,Emanuel,Rahm,seattletimes,"Without much fanfare, two trends are aligning to shift the conversation about income inequality. Cities, states and many businesses have moved beyond the federal minimum wage, a figure last adjusted by Congress a decade ago to $7.25 an hour. At the same time, the Business Roundtable has now urged its members to think beyond shareholder return when planning for the future. The two vectors represent a profound opportunity for progressives and business leaders to join forces in a campaign to fight poverty and make work pay in the United States.

Of course, Congress should immediately raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. But raising the minimum wage is only part of the answer. To shape a complete poverty-fighting agenda, the federal government should combine a higher minimum wage with a more robust earned-income tax credit.

We did a version of this in Chicago, and the results have been better than good. In 2014, the city moved to raise the minimum wage gradually to $13 an hour by 2019, while also making the EITC much easier to claim and receive. Since 2011, the city’s poverty rolls have fallen by more than 130,000 people, with children making up half of this decline. Through the middle of the decade, Chicago outpaced both the rest of Illinois, as well as New York City and Los Angeles, in moving its residents out of poverty. This multifaceted approach is the most promising way to turn the minimum wage into a more livable wage.

The EITC may be the most powerful tool government has to fight poverty. The program enables low-income workers not only to reduce their federal taxes, it puts additional money back in their pockets.

Second, we ought to change how the credit is paid back to workers. At present, beneficiaries are awarded their refunds once a year – after they file their tax returns. That prompts many families to seek out usurious “payday lenders” willing to extend credit in the short term in return for a big slice of the final refund. As a result, much of the credit winds up in the hands of an industry known for taking advantage of the poor. In Chicago, we experimented with awarding EITC benefits on a quarterly basis – and it worked. As a study by the Center for Economic Progress established, spreading out payments helped workers better manage their finances and avoid more debt.

Third, following former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg’s lead, we ought to expand the benefits offered to single men. Currently, the EITC is weighted to help families with children. It’s time to lend a hand to men who have not yet formed families. As Obama often reminded us, it’s one thing to father a child and quite another to be a dad. We must give men the means to form and join families for life.

Good policy is almost always good politics. Combining the higher minimum wage with a modernized EITC is a proven winner. If Republicans would be willing to reform the EITC and add more resources, I’d be happy enough to see Democrats name the program for Gerald Ford or Ronald Reagan, a shift that would all but guarantee that the GOP never shortchanges the tax credit in the future.

We know what happens when the party eats its own. It’s not pretty.

72,Emanuel,Rahm,politico,"Scott Olson/Getty Images History Dept. Democrats, This Is Your Future If You Turn on Obama We know what happens when the party eats its own. It’s not pretty.

Rahm Emanuel is the former mayor of Chicago, former White House chief of staff, and former member of Congress from Illinois.

After the horrific mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton this past weekend, Democrats are focused on what should be their top priority: evicting from the White House a president known for spewing hateful rhetoric and blocking gun reform. But in the absence of immediate tragedy, the Democratic Party is in danger of losing sight of that goal, as they did on the debate stage in Detroit last week, when they directed their ire not squarely on Donald Trump, but also on President Barack Obama.

I don’t know what prompted so many Democratic candidates to throw Obama under the bus at the debates—but it was something to behold. If you’d predicted a week out that several wannabe Democratic standard-bearers would attack the first African-American president while the Republican incumbent was spewing racism right from the Oval Office, I would have said that was impossible. But here we are.

I’ve never bought into the idea that Democrats can win consistently with a strategy that focuses exclusively on driving up the “base” vote—I think long-term success depends on our ability to build a broad-based coalition. But that’s what’s so confounding. Even if you do believe that base turnout is everything, why would you think attacking the first African-American president was going to inspire more people of color to cast ballots? Unfortunately, this isn’t the first time progressives have chosen to eat their own. If you go back far enough, you’ll realize we’ve seen this before, and it doesn’t turn out well for the Democrats.

In the plast half-century, progressives have enjoyed two intense periods of dramatic and prolific legislative success. The first was in the mid-1960s when President Lyndon Johnson passed the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act and a whole slew of domestic initiatives: Medicare and Medicaid, vast federal expansions of aid to public schools, a new phalanx of environmental protections and a range of other programs known collectively as the Great Society.

Four decades later, Obama’s first two years in office marked the second progressive windfall. Working with a Democratic Congress, the young president pulled the country back from the brink of another depression, thereby kick-starting the longest period of economic growth in the nation’s history. He rescued the auto industry, saving hundreds of thousands jobs that would have otherwise disappeared across the country. He overhauled banking regulations so drastically that the financial industry subsequently decided to bankroll the GOP. And, of course, he signed the Affordable Care Act into law, a bill that has since provided health insurance to millions of Americans who would have otherwise gone without coverage.

Without a doubt, every Democrat in Detroit knew some version of both those stories. What they may not have realized is that both episodes have followed similar patterns. In each case, the right has responded with fury. Gov. George Wallace, who ran for president on a pro-segregation platform as a Democrat 1964 and an independent in 1968, didn’t arrive on the nation’s political stage by accident. Richard Nixon’s “Southern Strategy” and Ronald Reagan’s appeal to the evangelical right also emerged largely as a reaction to the Great Society and the civil rights movement. In the same vein, the Tea Party and President Donald Trump’s populism were born in reaction to Obama’s legislative triumphs—and also as a response to the president’s race (read: birtherism).

But it‘s not just conservatives who ended up angry; both periods of progressive reform also saw wedges driven within the progressive movement. In 1968, turmoil over civil rights and the Vietnam War tore apart the Democratic coalition. Wallace pulled the white working class in one direction; Vietnam War opponent Eugene McCarthy pulled northern liberals in another; in the middle was Johnson’s vice president, Hubert Humphrey, who was left with the nomination but without a unified party behind him. Nixon’s “Southern Strategy” was designed explicitly to exploit that break—and thanks to the division, Nixon won that year.

Today, we’re facing a similar moment. In the wake of Obama’s successes, Democrats once again risk turning on one another, and losing their focus on general election voters as a result. The analogy isn’t perfect, because Obama’s purported sin—that he wasn’t “big” or “bold” or “revolutionary”—isn’t the same as Johnson’s duplicitous strategy in Vietnam. Even so, it appears today’s grievances, highlighted on liberal Twitter, have convinced some Democratic presidential candidates that there’s some advantage to parroting the far left’s complaints that Obama, and Bill Clinton before him, were not radical enough.

Before things get out of hand, let’s recall the facts. The first issue is whether Democrats should aim to tear the Affordable Care Act apart in order to replace it with “Medicare for All” or, alternatively, should strengthen and expand a law that’s working remarkably well, given the headwinds. It’s certainly true, because the Senate elected in 2008 wouldn’t support the public option, that the Affordable Care Act left a role for the private sector. But that’s no reason to abandon a law that expanded health coverage to 20-plus million more Americans. And the politics don’t work either. The ACA passed without a Senate vote to spare nearly a decade ago. Is there any reason to believe that the Senate elected in 2020 will be capable of repealing the existing law or replacing it with Medicare for All? In an age of debilitating public cynicism, Democrats should be very careful not to promise something they can’t deliver.

Second, yes, the Obama administration deported undocumented criminals. That’s hardly the same as separating children from their families and using racially divisive language. There’s really no moral equivalence here. Remember, Obama explicitly fought tooth and nail to protect the Dreamers, even while maintaining that America is both a nation of immigrants and a nation of laws. Finally, the tax regime in place when Obama left office might not have been as progressive as some Democrats would have liked—and Trump’s tax cuts for the rich have since made it much worse. But let’s not forget that Obama raised taxes on the very rich as part of the ACA and then again after the 2012 election. That may not have been a total rewrite of the federal code—but Obama struck huge blows for economic fairness.

Here’s what everyone needs to understand: For Democrats, progress happens brick-by-brick, with one success built on the next. We’re not going to win the White House by proposing ideas that will never pass through Congress. We’re going to win by meeting voters where they live, explaining how we’re going to strengthen protections that already tangibly make their lives better. At a moment when Washington is spinning its wheels, we need to focus on specific and tangible plans to expand access to college, control health care costs, welcome new immigrants who believe in the American Dream and rebuild America’s transportation systems.

That’s how progress has always worked. Social Security initially passed with the support of 141 Southern Democrats—most of whom were eager to prevent African Americans from receiving benefits. To that end, the bill FDR signed into law in 1935 boxed out farmworkers and maids—a vestige of racism that wasn’t corrected until the 1950s. It then took us three more decades to create Medicare and Medicaid. Then it took another three decades for Democrats to pass President Bill Clinton’s Children’s Health Insurance Program, which covers 9 million children today. From there it took nearly 13 more years for Obama to pass the Affordable Care Act. To strike the next blow, we shouldn’t scare voters by offering a proposal that takes their health care plans away, which Medicare for All does. When it comes to scaring voters, leave that to Trump because he seems to have that market cornered. As Democrats, our best strategy, both in terms of policy and politics, is to explain how we’re going to build on progressive achievements that voters already know, understand and have come to appreciate.

But it’s not just that repudiating the most important parts of the progressive legacy is a fool’s errand—it’s a lousy electoral strategy as well. After 1968, progressives didn’t just lose an election—they lost a generation. With the exception of Jimmy Carter’s fluke win in the wake of Watergate, Republicans held the White House for the next quarter century. Clinton and Obama were the first Democrats to win reelection since FDR.

Right now, we actually have the benefit of hindsight. No matter how passionately Democrats of different stripes disagree on issues of tactics, or even on issues of policy, our problems aren’t with one another—they’re with Trump and his minions. The progressives who went to war with one another in the late 1960s didn’t understand that they were rolling out a red carpet for Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush—but we do. Our job is to maintain the strategic discipline required to keep the party focused on what really matters. To prevent this coming election from becoming a redux of 1968 and 1972, we need to hold fast to our policy accomplishments, understand how we achieved them and make that progressive approach our strategy for pushing the country further ahead.",-1,https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/08/08/emanuel-obama-2020-democrats-227511
73,Emanuel,Rahm,gen,"Primary debates are about two things. First, candidates need to distinguish themselves from the rest of the field — something some of you did more successfully than others in Miami. Second, and more important, these events are about delivering a message that will position your candidacy as our standard-bearer in the general election. Let me be subtle: On this second front, not so good. So here are some suggestions for the next go-round.

Let’s start with the basics. If you’re going to evict Donald Trump from the White House and secure the country’s future, you have to replicate what the last two Democratic presidents did so successfully on their campaigns. You need to unite all primary voters. There’s a reason Trump gleefully tweeted “That’s the end of that race!” during the first debate: Too often, you succumbed to chasing plaudits on Twitter, which closed the door on swing voters in Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. If you win the nomination in a way that forecloses a path to victory in the general election, we will lose, and your name will go down in infamy.

This time, don’t fall into the traps that had many of us shaking our heads during the debates in Miami.

This time, don’t fall into the traps that had many of us shaking our heads during the debates in Miami. Before our party promises health care coverage to undocumented immigrants — a position not even Ted Kennedy took — let’s help the more than 30 million Americans who are a single illness away from financial ruin. Before we start worrying about whether the Boston Marathon bomber can vote, let’s stop states that are actively trying to curtail voting rights of citizens. And before we promise a guaranteed minimum income to healthy adults who prefer to stay home and play video games, let’s increase the minimum wage and the Earned Income Tax Credit to benefit the millions of people who work hard and still live near poverty.

Most important, you need to convince us you have what it takes to win in the general election. Democrats and independent voters both believe Trump is the ringleader of the three-ring circus we call Washington, and we are all exhausted. We know that the country’s future is at risk. What we’re looking for is a candidate of character, competence, and capacity — someone with the vision and fortitude to be president of the United States. To prevail in the primary, you need to demonstrate you’re that candidate. Think of it as a five-step process.

First, remind people that our country has always won when we’ve invested in America. When the Russians launched Sputnik, we answered with Apollo. Fifty years later, Moscow is still looking at our flag. When the Soviets tried to spread repressive authoritarianism, we successfully championed democracy and free enterprise to close out the “American century.”

People understand that what’s past is prologue — so apply that wisdom. Today, China is practicing the worst kind of industrial espionage, stealing ideas from every sector of the economy. There’s a reason they’re so fixated on the U.S.: Our system is uniquely equipped to unleash the power of entrepreneurial innovation. But Trump isn’t about investing — much of his 2017 tax cuts went to foreigners. In the meantime, American taxpayers have spent the last 20 years both in blood and treasure building roads, schools, and hospitals in Iraq and Afghanistan. All the while, American wages continued to stagnate. People are tired of being treated as chumps. It’s time to invest in America again.

As Donald Trump spews hatred and divisiveness, offer unity through universal national service.

Second, every American knows that our schools aren’t hacking it. If we’re going to meet the goal of investing 3% of our GDP in biomedical research, artificial intelligence, and quantum physics, we need a well-trained workforce. To get there, every four-year-old should have a seat at a public pre-K, and every high school graduate should have a seat at a community college. If we start investing in American education again, the kids in Beijing will once again have to fear the kids in Battle Creek. We should make clear we know we’re in a global contest, and we intend to win again.

Third, everyone who spends their days stuck in endless traffic knows that the nation’s roads are going nowhere fast. This fact alone should be enough to convince people that we need to invest in our infrastructure. Most voters will take comfort knowing that we have to hire American workers to pave American roads; rebuilding America can’t be outsourced to New Delhi.

Fourth, as Trump spews hatred and divisiveness, offer unity through universal national service. Nothing would better unite our country like serving alongside each other.

Finally, make sure all Americans are aware that Trump’s only real idea on health care is Medicare cuts for all. No president has ever proposed to slash the program as drastically as this one. Rather than championing ideas that threaten to upend existing coverage, Democrats should promise to build on the success of the Affordable Care Act by allowing anyone over the age of 55 to buy into Medicare. That would both extend insurance to more Americans and strengthen Medicare.

When you’re looking into the camera at the coming debate, imagine you’re speaking to a voter in Grand Rapids or Green Bay who holds two core beliefs in her head: that the economy is OK — not bad — and that Trump’s presidency is worse than bad. Showing that you understand those two points will yield electoral gold. You need to convince that voter to fire a president who is acting like the leader of a circus rather than the leader of the greatest nation on Earth. While at her kitchen table, explain why you’re the candidate best equipped to secure her family’s future. Her vote is how you win the nomination and the White House. Everything else is secondary.

Good luck. We’re counting on you. Let’s make Detroit the place where we send Trump and the B-team packing.",-1,https://gen.medium.com/a-memo-to-our-democratic-presidential-candidates-7f168c563252
74,Emanuel,Rahm,washingtonpost,"First, those of us who practice politics know that sound does not always equal fury. No one denies that the progressives have gotten louder and angrier over the past several years. Even as Democrats have won more votes than Republicans in every presidential election except one since 1992, many on the left feel as though their demands have been deferred, denied or never addressed — not by the two Republican presidents elected since then, but worse, not by the two Democrats, either. Today’s activists are still angry about welfare reform, the bogus case of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, Guantanamo Bay and the failure of the public option during debate over the Affordable Care Act, just to name a few.

When people talk about the Democratic “base,” they tend to think of the party’s liberal wing. That’s a mistake. Roughly half of self-identified Democrats describe themselves as “moderate” or “conservative.” Even as “the Squad” grabs the spotlight, moderate Democratic lawmakers such as Conor Lamb (Pa.), Lauren Underwood (Ill.), Mikie Sherrill (N.J.) and Abigail Spanberger (Va.) are primarily responsible for today’s Democratic majority in the House. And that’s key: Our nominee will need the voters in their districts to win a sufficient number of purple states in next year’s election.

Second, some seem to think that the progressives are a new voice in the Democratic coalition. As someone who’s been doing this for a while, let me assure you that some of the people supporting Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s campaign today are cut from the same cloth as those who were heartbroken when Bill Clinton dispatched Jerry Brown during the 1992 primaries. They’re making many of the same arguments Ralph Nader made when he ran against Al Gore in 2000. Some are veterans of the Netroots, a group that emerged during the George W. Bush years.

The left didn’t just get here — it has been around for decades. In fact, it was progressives who controlled the Democratic Party’s agenda for the quarter-century before Clinton’s victory in 1992. That’s one of the reasons we lost every presidential election held between 1968 and 1988 except the post-Watergate win by Jimmy Carter. History has proved there aren’t enough voters on the far left, on their own, to elect and reelect a president or maintain a majority in Congress.

The only two Democratic presidents to win reelection since Franklin D. Roosevelt won the White House by reaching out to the center. Clinton spoke about responsibility and opportunity, arguing that you can’t have something for nothing. Barack Obama aired a commercial featuring a Republican state legislator’s endorsement, making clear he wanted to be a president for all America, not just those who agreed with him on every issue. And our successful efforts to win and maintain the House in 2006, 2008 and 2018 were built on a coalition that includes different sorts of people who have different ideas about the way to drive broad-based security and prosperity. Moderate Democrats may not spend time spewing snark on social media or even sending small donations in response to online solicitations. But you can be sure that they vote in the primaries and will make the difference in the general election.

What remains to be seen is whether today’s far left is more interested in defeating Trump than it is in drumming moderates out of the Democratic Party.

That then points to the third myth: namely that, to win, Democrats need to mirror Trump’s abrasive political style. When Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) riles up his supporters by boasting that “there is no middle ground,” he’s promising to be a liberal answer to Trump — to fight fire with fire as Trump’s liberal mini-me. That’s the wrong approach.

With the economy humming, Trump should have an approval rating well above 50 percent, if not higher. But he’s stuck in the 40s because Americans do not like the poison pouring out of his mouth and Twitter feed. Democrats shouldn’t lean into what Trump does poorly. We should offer a contrast — someone competent, balanced, thoughtful and capable of reaching across the aisle.

A quarter-century ago, Clinton pulled the Democratic Party out of obsolescence by arguing that Americans needed to reject the false choices the old leadership in Washington presented them year in and year out. Today, our party needs to reject the false choice between all or nothing. Voters both on the left and in the center need to come out in force for the Democratic nominee if we’re going to win next year.

Whatever disagreements we may have with one another, nothing is worth the cost of extending Trump’s tenure. The far left hasn’t taken control of the Democratic Party. Moderates are just as much an integral part of the party’s “base” as any group of liberals. And the key to winning next year isn’t to out-Trump Trump — it’s to ensure that our nominee offers a contrast of competence and character that inspires voters across the political spectrum to make a change at the top.",-1,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/rahm-emanuel-no-the-democratic-party-hasnt-lurched-to-the-left/2019/07/17/06e09d6e-a8ab-11e9-a3a6-ab670962db05_story.html
75,Emanuel,Rahm,politico,"When politicians discuss the crisis of higher education, they tend to focus on finding ways to reduce the price that students pay for college: tax-deductible savings accounts, better known as 529s; massive student debt cancellation, as Sen. Elizabeth Warren has proposed; free college, one of Sen. Bernie Sanders’ key talking points. All those plans presume that cost is the central barrier to college access — and admittedly, in far too many cases, it is.

But when I served as Mayor of Chicago, I discovered that focusing exclusively on student debt is the wrong approach — it attacks the problem at the wrong time and in the wrong place. We live in an age when a high school diploma is no longer sufficient for those looking to earn a middle-class living — almost every student needs something more. If we really want to broaden the gateway into higher education, we need to focus more directly on what comes before that, specifically, what students learn in the final two years of high school.

What if we transferred a huge slice of what previous generations of students learned in their first and second years of college to a curriculum that was broadly available in the junior and senior years of high school? That would help bridge the so-called diploma divide that separates privileged communities from those struggling to get ahead and brake one of the most powerful drivers of economic and racial inequality in America more effectively than anything we can do in college alone.

Take a step back. During the industrial era, the body of knowledge taught in high school was generally considered sufficient, and a college degree was something extra—a credential that some professionals might have needed, but certainly not everyone. That drove a certain mentality: High school graduation was the sine qua non of public education, the crucial demarcation of who could reasonably aspire to the American dream, and who was expected to fall behind. Today, that’s no longer the case. Even as we celebrate those who cross the high school stage in caps and gowns each spring, we shouldn’t confuse what those ceremonies signify.

If the end goal of high school isn’t the diploma itself, but rather a student’s readiness to take on the next phase of their education, the real question is whether those moving their tassels from right to left have a head start on the next challenge. If cost is the barrier preventing many worthy college students from earning the next degree, we should reorient the 11th and 12th grades so students don’t have to spend so much time (and money) on college. And we can do that. Public high schools have at their disposal established programs designed to help students accrue college credits, often free of charge, so that they can earn college degrees more quickly at many universities, and with less out of pocket.

It’s a model we implemented in my time as mayor, expanding Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate programs while attending Chicago’s high schools, and enabling high school students to take community colleges classes (dual credit—dual enrollment) before they graduate. This year, nearly 50 percent of the city’s graduating seniors already have college credits to their name that are accepted at the city’s community colleges, state universities and many private colleges. Nearly 400 graduates have accumulated at least 15 college credits, the equivalent of a typical college semester’s workload. Think what that means for those kids and their parents. Less money eaten up by tuition; less debt to burden their futures. They could potentially move through college more expeditiously, and enter the workforce months or even years earlier than they otherwise would take to do so.

The implications are real. When one Chicago student, Rikyah Wright, graduated from the South Side’s Kenwood Academy in 2017, the Advanced Placement course credits she earned in high school combined with college credits she earned through her simultaneous enrollment at Harold Washington Community College amounted to an entire semester toward her degree. She eventually matriculated to the University of Illinois, where she is set to graduate a mere three years after receiving her high school diploma. Boosted by the college credits she earned as a student at Solario Academy High School, another student, Salma Campos, was able to earn her associate degree at Daley Community College in two short semesters, at which point she transferred to Northwestern University with a very generous financial support package.

That’s the financial reason to expand these programs—but there’s also an important non-monetary benefit. Many kids don’t initially enroll in college because they’re worried they won’t be able to hack it. They don’t think they can succeed. But completing college classes in high school proves that they can, in fact, do it. That makes it much more likely that they’ll complete their degree. And the promise of a more hopeful future can incentivize high school students to run through tape as well. In Chicago, shifting the orientation to college preparation helped boost high school graduation rates from 56 percent to nearly 80 percent.

These programs need to be designed and implemented at the state and local level—but Washington can help. Just as President Barack Obama designed Race to the Top to improve American K-12 education, Congress and the White House could create incentives for districts and community colleges that work collaboratively to get a dual credit, dual enrollment program off the ground. The Department of Education could provide expertise, guidance, and standardized best practices. And the president could use the bully pulpit to get mayors, governors, and citizens engaged in the effort.

Speaking from experience, I know these are worthy investments. Eighty-three percent of Chicago’s public school students live at or below the poverty level. But in large part, because the Windy City’s public schools have the largest International Baccalaureate and Advanced Placement programs in the country, our college and community college acceptance rates match the national average. During my tenure, Janice Jackson and Chancellor Juan Salgado, the heads of Chicago’s public schools and community colleges, expanded the “dual credit, dual enrollment” program from 300 to 5,000 students, making it the largest program of its kind in the country. And those efforts are paying off.

Kenwood Academy, for example, had 77 students graduate with 15 or more college credits, enough to cut a full semester off their college journey. Thirteen students at the Sarah E. Goode Academy, a STEM school established in 2012 on the far South Side in partnership with IBM, graduated high school with a full 60 credits—enough to earn an associate degree, the two-year degree typically conferred by a community college. The College Board recognized the Chicago Public Schools as an “AP District of the Year.” Our strategy increased both college access and success rates for underrepresented communities.

But it shouldn’t end here. If high schools are going to reach into colleges, higher education should be doing its part by pulling students up out of high school. Just as the natural jump from middle-school graduates is to enroll into high school, community colleges need to emerge as the obvious next step for high school graduates. In Chicago, we built that bridge by creating the Star Program, which guarantees free tuition (plus aid for books and transportation) to every public high school graduate with a B average. Already 6,500 students have enrolled. Any student who maintains a B average in community college then qualifies for the Star Plus program, which reduces tuition if the student moves on to earn a bachelor’s degree at any of the colleges or universities in Chicago.

To be sure, these shifts aren’t a panacea. And we should honor those working to reduce student debt philanthropically, as exemplified by Robert Smith’s incredibly generous decision to wipe out the student debt accrued by Morehouse College’s 2019 graduating class. But the challenge is too vast to hinge on personal generosity. Allowing kids to earn the associate and bachelor’s degrees more expeditiously saves families money and improves college completion rates because kids have the confidence to know they can succeed. If income inequality is really a reflection of the “diploma divide,” we need to stop looking to solve the problem entirely during the college years. If we focus on high school, we can ensure that education acts as a bridge to the American dream, and not a wall.

77,Emanuel,Rahm,theatlantic,"Caitlin Flanagan: They had it coming

Ever since the disaster of the 2016 election, Democrats have engaged in (an often pointless) debate about whether President Trump’s supporters were drawn to him on account of economic or cultural grievances. Yes, Hillary Clinton drew more votes, but she was 1,000 times as qualified, and 10,000 times as personally appealing. She should have demolished him—but something drew many voters to Trump instead.

I’m not denying that racism (against President Barack Obama) and sexism (against Secretary Clinton) played their roles. Nostalgia surely played another. But beneath all of that was the American middle class’s belief that the Lori Loughlins and Felicity Huffmans of the world, let alone the Don Rumsfelds and Dick Fulds, aren’t asked to play by the same set of rules. The elite get all the breaks and are shown all the shortcuts. In the meantime, ordinary people are forced to pay full freight. And that’s the point. No matter how noxious he was personally—and despite the irony that he was a perfect example of elite privilege—Trump embodied the country’s desire to hit back. Justice was a long time coming.

Maybe the clearest early manifestation was the Iraq War. After 9/11, the Washington elite claimed that the country needed to neutralize Saddam Hussein’s weapons of mass destruction. Congress and the media largely went along for the ride. But $1 trillion and 5,000 lives and 16 years later, the public has been told that those WMDs had not existed after all. Yet as clear as that became, no one ever took it on the chin. No one from the Bush administration ever took responsibility. Middle-class families paid in both blood and treasure, but the people who had made the worst foreign-policy decision in U.S. history never owned their failure.

Read: The 9.9 percent is the new American aristocracy

The same thing happened during the Great Recession. The nation’s banking elite had lent billions to home buyers without any realistic hope of making good on their debts. Their irresponsible lending not only precipitated a global financial meltdown, but also necessitated a bailout from the nation’s financially stressed middle-class taxpayers. Yet even after being bailed out, the nation’s banking executives never faced any real consequences. No one went to jail. They never had to repay the personal fortunes they’d made by passing out those bad loans. Once again, the middle class was called to bail out the elites who were responsible for the mess while the elites got off scot-free.

And it was the same story arc with the auto bailout. For decades, executives in Detroit had made indefensible decisions. They’d been selling less reliable cars. They’d never found a way to compete effectively with their foreign competition. They’d continually lost market share. But when the bottom fell out and they were forced to ask middle-class taxpayers for a bailout, they never took responsibility. Most of the top brass kept their jobs. And once they’d recovered, they returned to business as usual. The middle class was once again expected to foot the bailout while the execs kept on like it had never happened.",-1,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/05/middle-class-americans-are-sick-elite-privilege/589849/
78,Emanuel,Rahm,nytimes,"CHICAGO — Two cities, following different road maps, have shown the possibilities and potential pitfalls of police reform. The challenges facing Baltimore and Chicago were seen as synonymous three years ago. Both cities embarked on reforms around the same time, which are still in the early stages.

In both cities, a police-involved citizen death brought long-simmering frustrations to the surface. In Baltimore, it was the death of Freddie Gray in the back of a police van. In Chicago, it was the killing of Laquan McDonald, shot by a police officer 16 times.

Baltimore’s effort is lagging, with violent crime rising to levels not seen in a quarter-century. As a big-city mayor, I know firsthand how difficult these challenges are to overcome. Chicago is still a long way from the level of public safety we want for every neighborhood. Since 2016, however, homicides are down 27 percent and shootings are down 32 percent.

It is too soon to draw a straight line from Chicago’s police reform efforts to the progress in crime reduction our city has made. But an effective and focused police department, along with increased after school activities, more summer jobs and greater local economic opportunities all contribute to safer neighborhoods.",-1,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/08/opinion/rahm-emanuel-chicago-police-reform.html
79,Emanuel,Rahm,chicagobusiness,"When Chicago businessman and Blackhawks owner Rocky Wirtz’s transition memo to Mayor-elect Lori Lightfoot came to light earlier this week—characterizing the business community’s relations with Mayor Rahm Emanuel as “frequently strained, often contentious and disappointingly counter-productive”—Crain’s offered Mayor Rahm Emanuel an opportunity to respond.

Since day one, I have been clear that what other cities have done with respect to public subsidies for privately owned sports teams is a mistake. Taxpayers should not be viewed as ATMs for wealthy owners and investors. Predictably, when powerful private interests who were accustomed to dictating public policy did not get their way, they became dissatisfied.

For example: My administration may have ruffled the feathers of Blackhawks owner Rocky Wirtz when we refused to accede to his repeated requests for an extension of a sweetheart property tax arrangement he had at the United Center, which he argued was necessary to construct a new practice facility. He said, “After the last few meetings with the mayor, I found out what it feels like to be checked.""

My administration further piqued Wirtz’s ire when we ended the tax exemption on skyboxes that had been in effect since 2005. Closing that loophole brings more than $4 million into the city’s treasury annually, and effectively ended a corporate welfare program that had been in place for a decade.

Finally, when we eliminated the amusement tax on neighborhood theaters and concert spaces, put the amusement tax for concerts on par with sporting events at large arenas like the United Center, and used those resources to support arts programs for Chicago’s children, Wirtz was particularly displeased.

Likewise, I denied the Ricketts family’s repeated requests for breaks in the amusement tax, which they argued were necessary for the modernization of Wrigley Field. And when Ald. Tom Tunney put the concerns of his constituents in Wrigleyville ahead of the appeals of the Cubs’ ownership, they mounted an expensive and ultimately unsuccessful campaign to defeat him at the ballot box.

At the end of the day, the Blackhawks’ and Bulls’ two new training facilities near the United Center, new office and retail space on the Near West Side, and the Wrigley renovations were all completed. And unlike recent cases in Milwaukee and Atlanta, the owners paid for it without any taxpayer subsidies. When you own something, you pay the costs and you reap the benefits. Welcome to capitalism and the private sector, Rocky.

Look, I get it. For those who have become accustomed to the rules of the road of crony capitalism, and have had sweetheart deals and special arrangements no one else receives, it is tough when you are forced to play by the same rules as everyone else. While I am certainly not against using public investments in infrastructure as a catalyst for economic growth, I believe we must draw the line at outright corporate welfare.

It is because we have invested in our economic fundamentals, not because of crony capitalism, that Chicago has led the country in corporate relocations and foreign direct investment every year for the last six years, a first for the city of Chicago.

My message to the private sector has always been clear: Chicago is open for business. We welcome your investment and job creation. My message to all those who sought favoritism and public benefits to amass more private wealth has also been clear and consistent for eight years: The answer is no. See you in the marketplace.

80,Emanuel,Rahm,theatlantic,"Yes, the gender of Mayor Pete’s spouse is remarkable. Just a few years ago, most of America had trouble imagining anyone but a white heterosexual man in the Oval Office. But Buttigieg is a lot more than a symbol of his sexual orientation. He’s a Rhodes Scholar who, unlike most graduates of elite universities, chose to join the military. He’s a veteran who fought in Afghanistan. And he’s a devout Christian who is, quite frankly, more comfortable than most Democrats (and journalists) talking about how faith shapes his perspective on national politics.

But journalists aren’t digging much deeper than his orientation—and I have a theory on why. In the places where they live—in the pockets of the country that the Donald Trump minion Stephen Miller has disparagingly labeled “cosmopolitan”—sexuality is a hot topic. Maybe even the hottest topic. Military service? Not so much. Religious faith? Not at all.

But voters will need a little more information to make informed choices in next year’s primaries and general election. If reporters are going to provide it to them, they need to start asking Buttigieg different questions when they meet him on the campaign trail.

Peter Wehner: Pete Buttigieg’s very public faith is challenging assumptions

When lots of his peers at Harvard and Oxford grabbed their diploma and headed off to Wall Street or Silicon Valley, Buttigieg decided to serve his country in the military. Why? What spurred that decision? What did he learn from the experience beyond what he saw on the battlefield? Why does he think more Americans aren’t choosing to serve their country in the same way?

Here’s another one: Buttigieg would be the first president to have deployed to a war zone since George H. W. Bush, a man elected more than 30 years ago. What did that experience teach him? How would it affect the decisions he would make as commander in chief?

Need a third line of questioning? How about this one: Mayor Pete was raised in the Catholic Church, and governs a city dominated by the nation’s most prominent Catholic university, Notre Dame. Nevertheless, he now worships at an Episcopal church in South Bend. Why the conversion? Has he ever had a crisis of faith? What does he think about (particularly blue) America’s increasingly secular orientation? What does it mean for our society over the long term?

Finally, they should ask about the professional struggles he’s had to overcome. Every chief executive faces moments of self-doubt. Has there ever been a moment in his military or elected service when faith has filled that void? Moreover, in an era where, per Robert Putnam’s Bowling Alone, people are desperately searching for community, is his religious faith born more of a search for spirituality or fellowship? Having been a mayor myself—and having spoken with hundreds of other chief executives—I know that, even for agnostics, faith can become a place of comfort. Is there a moment when faith brought him to a different decision than he might have otherwise made?",-1,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/04/journalists-only-focus-pete-buttigiegs-sexuality/587788/

82,Emanuel,Rahm,realclearpolicy,"We may be the better part of two years away from the next presidential election, but the central Democratic narrative of the coming campaign has already come into clear focus. Democrats are poised to employ a two-pronged strategy. First, they'll speak to the electorate's festering personal anger with President Donald Trump. Second, they'll promise a bevy of new benefits, including some combination of Medicare for All, free college for all, the Green New Deal, and reparations.

Here's my concern. While both these strategies may have something to recommend them, Democrats are missing a crucial third prong. While we are fighting for new rights, we also need to demand a reinvigorated sense of responsibility. We cannot simply promise the country more—we need also to ask more of one another. The Democratic Party is strongest when we challenge the public to give, not just promise the public more of what they get.",-1,https://www.realclearpolicy.com/2019/04/10/the_need_that_democrats_aren039t_addressing_41418.html
83,Emanuel,Rahm,theatlantic,"Democrats, however, also need to address a crisis bubbling below the surface: the sense that the country is being ripped apart, that red and blue America are alienated from each other, and that America’s higher moral purpose is being shredded by the divisive tenor of the national debate.

Read: What’s wrong with the Democrats?

At a moment when Americans are in search of a spiritual reawakening, we need to avoid the temptation to speak to voters only in a single dimension. The Democratic Party should offer a vision of citizenship that contrasts with Trump’s celebration of hedonistic consumerism. We should call on the nation’s sense of deep-seated patriotism to rebut his ugly nationalism. We must champion a spirit of unity and purpose that counteracts his self-serving schemes to pit one community against the next.

We can begin by issuing a simple but powerful call: a policy that requires all 18-year-olds to give at least six months of their life to national service. People from different walks of life, with different backgrounds, would serve with one another as a rite of passage. Once young adults graduate high school or reach college age, they would join the military, the Peace Corps, AmeriCorps, or some other service-oriented organization.

Some may recoil at the prospect of having to contribute anything more than they already do. But the Democratic Party’s greatest heroes have not simply extended the social safety net. Their success was born out of the nation’s desire to share in America’s mission to rid the world of tyranny. To beat back the specter of communism. To share the benefits of liberal democracy and free enterprise with societies mired in poverty and dysfunction.

Many may remember Franklin D. Roosevelt primarily for championing the New Deal. But when fascists rose up to threaten the free world, FDR inspired Americans to sacrifice in service to “the arsenal of democracy.” And it was that sense of shared purpose that most defined the character of the members of what came to be known as the Greatest Generation, including Roosevelt’s eventual successor, John F. Kennedy.

JFK, in turn, is often remembered for the famous line he delivered in his 1961 inaugural address: “Ask not what your country can do for you—ask what you can do for your country.” And that rhetorical flourish became a central theme of his administration. In 1961, he established the Peace Corps, a program that has since given 235,000 Americans the opportunity to extend America’s helping hand around the globe.

Subsequent Democratic leaders have thrived when calling on that same spirit of service. Few accomplishments were more meaningful to President Bill Clinton than establishing AmeriCorps, envisioned as a domestic version of the Peace Corps, through which more than a million Americans have now served their own (and often neighboring) communities. President Barack Obama beamed in 2009 while signing a vast expansion of the nation’s service programs two months after assuming office. (The bill was named for JFK’s brother Senator Ted Kennedy.)",-1,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/04/democrats-must-counter-trumps-nationalism-with-service/586735/

Lori Lightfoot has officially been elected as the next mayor of Chicago, according to the Associated Press. She is the first Black woman and LGBT person to be elected as mayor of the Windy City.

SEE ALSO: Some No Name, Pitchy R&B Singer Disrespected Keith Sweat And Gets Demolished On Twitter

After she and opponent Toni Preckwinkle were sent to a runoff election following a tight contest in February, Lightfoot captured more than 74 percent of the votes Tuesday night.

Lightfoot had two Black mayoral predecessors.

“Lightfoot becomes the third African-American to serve as mayor, The Chicago Tribune reminded readers. “Harold Washington was elected in 1983 as the city’s first black mayor and won re-election in 1987 before dying in officer later that year. Eugene Sawyer, the city’s second black mayor, was appointed to serve out Washington’s term until a 1989 special election.”

While some voices across social media said Lightfoot would bring the change Chicago needs, others have said she would simply continue the not-so-flattering legacy of outgoing Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who has been under heavy scrutiny on his way out of office after choose against seeking reelection.

See the tweet below from political commentator and activist Ameshia Cross.

Back in February, according to the Board of Election Commissioners for Chicago, Lightfoot won 17.48% of the vote and Preckwinkle had 15.96%, which meant there would be a runoff election.

Lightfoot is a former federal prosecutor who has specifically said she wants to separate herself from the city’s reputation for political corruption.

“I am an independent reform candidate. I do not represent the past. I am not tied to the broken political machine,” she told ABC News. “I didn’t aspire to climb the ranks of the Cook County Democratic Party to be the party boss. I am not affiliated with Ed Burke, or Joe Berrios or anyone else who really represents the old corrupt Chicago way.”

Lightfoot stands behind Democratic policies like a $15 minimum wage and legalizing marijuana. She also claimed to be for massive police reform but has been accused of giving “a personal loyalty oath to Rahm Emanuel,” which she has denied.

While only time will tell how Lightfoot’s mayoral legacy plays out, not everybody seemed to be pleased with her election. See an assortment of the mixed reactions on social media below in response to Lightfoot’s historic win.",-1,https://newsone.com/playlist/lori-lightfoot-mayor-twitter-chicago/

86,Emanuel,Rahm,chicagobusiness,"In 2011, Chicago was buying police cars that were made outside Dallas and CTA rail cars that were built in upstate New York. With all due respect to Dallas and Plattsburgh, we thought Chicagoans could do those jobs just as well—or even better.

On Feb. 15, 2012, we passed a bid incentive ordinance to give companies that manufacture in Chicago extra points in the procurement process. That policy change alone helped create more than 3,000 new manufacturing jobs in Chicago.



Ford was the first company to win a contract under the new rules. The company has already built 977 new vehicles for the Chicago Police Department, with 108 more to be delivered in the next two months. Today, the made-in-Chicago Ford Interceptor is outselling every other police car in the country combined. To meet rising demand for the Interceptor and Explorer, Ford moved production from Canada to Chicago, added a third shift and created 1,800 more jobs in the city.



Ford just doubled down with a $1 billion investment and 500 more manufacturing jobs at its Chicago plants. Its suppliers, including, recently, Flex-N-Gate, have followed Ford’s lead by creating new factories and manufacturing jobs nearby.



Because the CTA is buying its new 7000 Series of rail cars with a made-in-Chicago label instead of one reading Plattsburgh, rail car manufacturer CRRC is also building a new factory in Chicago. Last week, the company started hiring for 170 new jobs. CTA riders will soon be commuting on rail cars built in Chicago for the first time since the Pullman factory shuttered in 1982. The first cars will roll off the line in 2020, and 21 newly hired Chicago electricians and sheetmetal workers are now in Sifang, China, for a monthlong training.



CTA also now buys seats for its buses from a Chicago manufacturer for the first time, resulting in another 300 local manufacturing jobs, for a total of 800 factory workers at Freedman Seating in West Humboldt Park.



The city’s new LED streetlights are made at the Lyons View Manufacturing plant in West Garfield Park. And this week Lyons View is breaking ground on a new plant in West Lawndale to build solar panels, which will help Chicago meet our goal of powering public buildings with 100 percent renewable energy by 2025. The manufacturer created more than two dozen new jobs to fill the orders.



Chicago is not just using its purchasing power to create manufacturing jobs; we are home to a new collaborative, innovative research and development network at the heart of Midwest manufacturing.



Today we are celebrating the second anniversary of mHUB, America’s largest and fastest-growing manufacturing innovation center. The 63,000-square-foot facility is a shared space where manufacturers, university researchers and investors from around the region come together to test ideas and develop new products and processes that will help shape the future of the field. MHUB recently created a partnership with Argonne National Laboratory to equip local manufacturers with the tools and resources to bring new technologies to market.



This year also marks the fourth anniversary of Chicago’s digital manufacturing institute, MxD, created in partnership with the U.S. Department of Defense. The factory floor at the Chicago innovation center features the most advanced manufacturing equipment in the world, where more than 300 local industry partners have united on 60 joint research projects exploring the future of digital manufacturing.



And this January, we opened the state-of-the-art Manufacturing Technology & Engineering Center at Richard J. Daley College. It is the only community college center of its kind in the Midwest, and employers are ready to recruit students straight out of the classroom and into careers in manufacturing.



By rewriting Chicago’s procurement policies and nurturing a landscape of shared innovation, we have brought thousands of good-paying jobs to Chicago, helped strengthen the backbone of Chicago manufacturing and created certainty about the industry’s future here. Today, manufacturing jobs on Chicago’s Southeast Side are growing three times faster than the national average. New factories and “Help Wanted” signs are going up, and Chicago’s manufacturing future is built to last.

88,Emanuel,Rahm,theatlantic,"Read: Trump settles on his reelection message

“Tonight,” the president said in his State of the Union address, “we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.” That was a tell. Trump’s going to spend the next two years using the bully pulpit to convince voters that Democrats are big believers in “government coercion, domination, and control.” He’s making a bet that if he labels Democrats “socialists” frequently enough, he’ll be able to drive a wedge that scares swing voters out of the Democratic fold.

If 2016 proved nothing else, it demonstrated that Democrats ignore Trump’s antics at our own peril. In much the same way Democrats shouldn’t paint his supporters with a brush so broad that it alienates convincible voters—anyone else game to banish the word deplorable from the 2020 campaign?—the last thing we should do is serve him slow pitches over the plate that allow him to define us on his terms. Unfortunately, that’s exactly what Democrats have been doing since he went before Congress in early February. It’s almost as if we’ve been duped into reading from his ready-made script.

Earth to Democrats: Republicans are telling you something when they gleefully schedule votes on proposals like the Green New Deal, Medicare for all, and a 70 percent marginal tax rate. When they’re more eager to vote on the Democratic agenda than we are, we should take a step back and ask ourselves whether we’re inadvertently letting the political battle play out on their turf rather than our own. If Trump’s only hope for winning a second term turns on his ability to paint us as socialists, we shouldn’t play to type.

That’s not to say Democrats should abandon our priorities. We should work hard to combat climate change. We should fight to expand health-care coverage and reduce costs. We should find ways to make the tax code more progressive. But we shouldn’t fall for Trump’s sucker punch. By a margin of 56 to 33 percent, Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents would prefer us to nominate “someone who would be a strong candidate against Trump even if they disagree with that candidate on most issues.” In other words, this campaign is going to be less about ideological purity and litmus tests, and more about how voters size up the candidates’ personal qualities.

Read: Andrew Cuomo’s case for 2020—no, really

To borrow Richard Ben Cramer’s famous phrase, Democrats ultimately need to nominate the candidate who best demonstrates that he or she has “what it takes” to win. Bill Clinton might ultimately have won the 1992 election when, during a town-hall debate in Richmond, Virginia, he answered a voter’s question about the economy by describing personally the anguish he’d seen among those who had been left behind. Meanwhile, over Clinton’s shoulder, President Bush was checking his watch. In an unscripted moment, both candidates’ values came through. By walking toward the woman who asked the question, Clinton showed his underlying empathy for the squeezed middle class; by appearing bored, Bush exposed his lack of interest.

89,Emanuel,Rahm,baltimorejewishlife,"Rahm Emanuel: I’ve Faced the Charge of Dual Loyalty

By: Rahm Emanuel

It was anti-Semitic then, and it’s anti-Semitic now.

I’m all for new voices in the U.S. Congress. But lately, some of those new voices have been voicing some very old canards.

I’m talking about Representative Ilhan Omar, one of the newly elected Democrats who populate the 116th Congress. Omar has attracted much news coverage, and the condemnation of most of her fellow Democrats, for promoting some ugly tropes about Jews.

First, when questioning long-standing congressional support for Israel, she blamed the campaign money provided by pro-Israel supporters. “It’s all about the Benjamins, baby,” she tweeted.

After apologizing for that comment and acknowledging her need to be “educated,” she followed with another tweet, questioning the “allegiance” of supporters of Israel, intimating that we place the concerns of Israel above those of the country that we call home.

No one is questioning the right of members of Congress and others to criticize Israeli policies. But Omar is crossing a line that should not be crossed in political discourse. Her remarks are not anti-Israel; they are anti-Semitic.

Whether consciously or not, Representative Omar is repeating some of the ugliest stereotypes about Jews—tropes that have been unleashed by anti-Semites throughout history. She is casting Jewish Americans as the other, suggesting a dual loyalty that calls our devotion to America into question.

Maybe I’m sensitive to this charge of dual allegiance because it’s been wielded against me in some of my political campaigns. I’ve been accused of actually being a citizen of Israel. (That’s not true, although my father was an Israeli immigrant to the United States.) In 2002, well before Donald Trump and other “birthers” questioned Barack Obama’s citizenship, I had to produce my U.S. birth certificate in my first run for Congress to disprove false assertions about my background and loyalties.

But it’s not just me who’s been subject to questions of dual loyalty. For centuries, this trope has been aimed at Jews in countries around the world. In embracing it, Omar is associating herself with calamities from the Spanish Inquisition to the Russian pogroms to the Holocaust. That’s not historical company that any American should want to keep.

One doesn’t have to be Jewish to recognize the deep and abiding relationship between the United States and Israel. Yes, there might be serious problems with Israel’s democracy—just as we’re currently experiencing our own. But Israel shares fundamental values with the United States that most of its neighbors have never embraced.

In Israel, women can vote and serve in the armed forces. So can members of the LGBTQ community. Its Arab citizens can vote, form political parties, and serve in the Israeli Parliament. And Israeli women can drive—just as badly as the rest of the population.

As for Jewish Americans who support Israel as a friend and ally of the United States, we do so because we recognize the commonality of our values and national interests. And many of us don’t hesitate to criticize Israel when its policies are wrong—or to champion American interests when they come into tension with Israeli goals.

On my very first day after leaving Bill Clinton’s administration as his senior adviser in October 1998, I received a call at 5 a.m. from the president. He was at the Wye Plantation in Maryland, where he was hosting a summit meeting between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. The president was frantic that the summit would collapse if he didn’t release Jonathan Pollard, a U.S. intelligence analyst who had delivered sensitive state secrets to Israel, as Benjamin Netanyahu was demanding.

Clinton was getting conflicting advice from his political and national-security teams. Some members of the political team thought Pollard’s release was a small price to pay for a successful agreement. But members of his national-security team were strongly opposed because of the serious level of the security breach that Pollard had orchestrated.

I told Clinton not to give in on Pollard’s release, believing that Netanyahu needed the agreement more than he did. The president followed that advice, and Netanyahu ultimately signed the Wye River Memorandum.

Later, during my service as White House chief of staff in the Obama administration, I spoke out strongly against Netanyahu’s policy of expanding Israeli settlements in the Palestinian territories. For my troubles, Netanyahu labeled me (along with the presidential adviser David Axelrod) a “self-hating Jew.”

My allegiance to this country wasn’t in question then. And it shouldn’t be now—nor should that of other American Jews. That would be just as wrong as suggesting that all Muslims are potential terrorists and should be banned from entering this country. What president would possibly embrace such an un-American position—until the current one?

As mayor of Chicago, I denounced Trump for his anti-Muslim policies. I worked to make Chicago a welcoming city to Americans of all backgrounds, creating the Office of New Americans to help immigrants and refugees in my city, which has been a gateway for immigrants to the United States for generations. I appointed Seemi Choudry, herself the daughter of Pakistani immigrants, to lead that effort. Read more at The Atlantic

94,Emanuel,Rahm,theatlantic,"Instead, Trump just kept deepening the hole he has dug for himself and his party, doubling down on hard-line demands for a wall that the country doesn’t want and that congressional Democrats will never fund. What did he learn from his first government shutdown that he thinks will change a second time around?

The president also used the speech to make calls for bipartisanship and unity that sounded neither sincere nor authentic. For three years, Trump has shown himself to be a divider, not a uniter; a partisan and not bipartisan.

Read: Trump’s call for unity was never going to be real

If the president and his advisers were thinking strategically, they would have first looked to the past to guide them. There are three areas in the next six months that could help redefine the Trump presidency, make Trump look like a commander in chief, and give him a shot at reelection in 2020.

First—through no effort of his own—Trump is in a position to end the longest sustained combat mission in American history: the war in Afghanistan. Many Americans—Democrats, Republicans, and independents alike—would be happy if the president brought the war to an end with a responsible agreement that brings our troops home. My views on Trump are well known, but I also know that achieving a settlement in Afghanistan ain’t beanbag.

Second, Trump may get a breakthrough agreement with China on trade. If he is successful, the president will be able to say he pulled it off because he was willing to go to the brink with China. That’s another area where Americans across the political spectrum could applaud him, because they will benefit from his efforts.

Third, the president has rallied European, North American, and South American countries in opposition to an autocratic failed government in Venezuela. Helping to end a dictatorship in Venezuela would be the first sign that Trump can be a multilateral president who builds coalitions and consensus overseas to achieve strategic goals.

Those achievements, if they happen, aren’t nearly enough to get Trump out of the hole he and his party find themselves in, let alone reelect him. But it’s political malpractice for the president’s State of the Union address not to give more than a fleeting reference to what little he has to work with.

Peter Beinart: Trump shows why he can’t be counted out

Trump devoted a mere 140 words to Afghanistan, 118 to trade with China, and 62 to Venezuela. By contrast, he devoted 463 words to immigration and 180 to the wall—a total of 643 words on a subject where he is bound to lose. Think about that. Trump spent twice as much time trying to coax a political lead balloon into flight than highlighting these three promising areas.

Similarly, the president lip-synched political pablum about bipartisanship and unity that no one buys from him. Being willing to support objectives that garner bipartisan support is what it actually means to be bipartisan. Feigning bipartisanship with an obvious head fake is a good way to get legislators in the chamber to groan while Americans at home hit the mute button and head to the fridge.

Using the past as a guide, Trump could have set the stage for future wins, reset his presidency heading into reelection, and proved he has grown and matured in office. Instead, at the State of the Union, he came up short as he has done time and again throughout his presidency. He has one more shot to get the speech right, in 2020.

95,Emanuel,Rahm,routefifty,"During my first campaign to be Chicago’s mayor, in 2011, I promised to put education reform at the forefront of my agenda. Having participated in Washington policy debates for the better part of two decades, I felt confident that I knew what to do. Then, as now, education reformers preached a certain gospel: Hold teachers solely accountable for educational gains. Expand charter schools. Focus relentlessly on high-school graduation rates. This was the recipe for success.

Three years before that, when President-elect Barack Obama tapped me to be his White House chief of staff, I argued that leaders should never let a good crisis go to waste. I was now determined to take my own advice. At the moment of my inauguration, Chicago’s schools were unquestionably in crisis. Our students had the shortest school day in America. Nearly half of Chicago’s kids were not being offered full-day kindergarten, let alone pre-k. Teacher evaluations had not been updated in nearly 40 years. During my first months in office, I hit the ground running, determined to change all that. Then, much to my surprise, roughly a year into my reform crusade, circumstance prompted me to begin questioning the wisdom of the gospel itself.

My initial doubts emerged four days into what turned out to be the first Chicago teachers’ strike in three decades. After a series of arduous negotiations with Karen Lewis, the union president, we’d arrived at the basic contours of an agreement. In return for higher salaries, Lewis accepted my demands to extend the school day by an hour and 15 minutes, tack two weeks onto the school year, establish universal full-day kindergarten, and rewrite the outdated evaluations used to keep the city’s educators accountable.

One key issue remained: the autonomy of principals. The question was whether individual principals would have the ability to hire faculty of their own choosing, or whether, as Lewis preferred, principals would have to select from a limited pool maintained downtown with the union’s strong input. Honestly, because I’d gotten everything I really wanted, I was tempted to fold. The reform gospel doesn’t pay much mind to principals. Moreover, the new accountability standards promised to rid the schools of bad teachers.

But while I was preparing to brief reporters assembled at Tarkington Elementary on Chicago’s South Side, Mahalia Ann Hines, a former school principal (who happens to be the artist Common’s mother) pulled me aside. Hines, who holds a doctorate from the University of Illinois, had spent 15 years as a principal, at grade levels from elementary through high school. If we were going to make lasting improvements to Chicago’s schools, she argued, principals needed that flexibility. Without it, they would not be able to establish the right culture or create a team atmosphere. And, at least as important, principals would not have the leverage to coach teachers struggling to help their pupils succeed.

Thinking about it now, years after I decided to abandon the gospel of teacher-focused reform for an approach centered on empowering principals, Hines’s advice sounds almost like common sense. But at the time, it was a momentous decision. Parents are rarely surprised when I note that even the best teachers can be rendered ineffective in a dysfunctional school, or that a great principal can turn a good teacher into an extraordinary educator. But even today, reformers rarely take the impact of principals into account.

The union was loath to give in, and the strike dragged on for two additional days. But eventually they agreed, and I then decided to go all in on principal-centered reform. We raised principals’ salaries, particularly for those working in hard-to-staff schools. Chicago established a new program explicitly designed to recruit and train new school leaders. We collaborated with Northwestern University to improve professional development for principals. And we gave the best-performing principals additional autonomy by establishing a system of independent schools, subject to less oversight from the central office.

Today, the Chicago Schools CEO, its chief education officer, and two of the seven members of the board of education, including Hines, are former Chicago public-school principals. That evolution in thinking prompted me to also question other elements of the reform gospel, including the movement’s unbending support for charter schools. No one disputes that some charter schools, like the Noble Network here in Chicago, are terrific. But what many reformers fail to acknowledge is that a lot of more traditional alternatives—places such as Poe Elementary, an award-winning neighborhood school on the South Side—are great as well. That reality has profound implications. I closed both neighborhood and charter schools as mayor, because mediocre schools of any type fail their students. The 20-year debate between charter and neighborhood is totally misguided, and should be replaced with a focus on quality versus mediocrity. It’s high time we stop fighting about brands, because the only thing that really matters is whether a school is providing a top-notch education. The reform gospel’s focus on graduation rates obfuscates what’s really important for students in grades nine through 12. Sure, every kid should earn a high-school diploma, and in Chicago we’ve gone from a 59.3 percent graduation rate in 2012 to a 78.2 percent graduation rate in 2018. But we spend too much time talking about graduation like it’s the end of the line. If students don’t know where they’re headed after they finish 12th grade, they lose interest in their education well before the 12th grade. High school needs to be seen as a bridge to the next thing, no matter whether it’s college, military or civilian service, or a specific job. That’s why we’ve grown Chicago’s dual-credit/dual-enrollment program into one of the largest in the country, equipping half our high-school kids with college credits before they receive their diploma. Between 2010 and 2017, the percentage of CPS students enrolling in college grew from 53.7 to 68.2. That says something profound. Finally, before I became mayor, I largely ignored conservative complaints about government subsidies for the wraparound services that complement what happens in the classroom. Elitists love to argue that education dollars should be focused exclusively on improving classroom instruction. Today, however, I realize just how profoundly asinine those arguments are. It’s unconscionable for anyone who underwrites their own kids’ private tutors, music lessons, after-school activities, summer camps, and summer jobs to argue that children from less-advantaged backgrounds should not have the same privileges and support. Kids today spend 80 percent of their time outside the classroom, and most well-off parents have the resources to augment what happens at school. As mayor, I decided to extend those same sorts of interventions to everyone. Our after-school program has grown to serve 125,000 students. We hired teachers to staff libraries in order to help kids with their homework every school-day afternoon, and we created a summer reading program, Rahm’s Readers, to combat the so-called summer slide. Moreover, we implemented a new standard: To be eligible to land one of the now 33,000 summer jobs that the city sponsors, you have to sign a pledge to go to college. Closing the achievement gap inside the classroom requires investments outside the classroom.",-1,https://www.routefifty.com/management/2019/02/i-used-preach-gospel-education-reform-then-i-became-mayor/154667/
96,Emanuel,Rahm,theatlantic,"My initial doubts emerged four days into what turned out to be the first Chicago teachers’ strike in three decades. After a series of arduous negotiations with Karen Lewis, the union president, we’d arrived at the basic contours of an agreement. In return for higher salaries, Lewis accepted my demands to extend the school day by an hour and 15 minutes, tack two weeks onto the school year, establish universal full-day kindergarten, and rewrite the outdated evaluations used to keep the city’s educators accountable.

One key issue remained: the autonomy of principals. The question was whether individual principals would have the ability to hire faculty of their own choosing, or whether, as Lewis preferred, principals would have to select from a limited pool maintained downtown with the union’s strong input. Honestly, because I’d gotten everything I really wanted, I was tempted to fold. The reform gospel doesn’t pay much mind to principals. Moreover, the new accountability standards promised to rid the schools of bad teachers.

But while I was preparing to brief reporters assembled at Tarkington Elementary on Chicago’s South Side, Mahalia Ann Hines, a former school principal (who happens to be the artist Common’s mother) pulled me aside. Hines, who holds a doctorate from the University of Illinois, had spent 15 years as a principal, at grade levels from elementary through high school. If we were going to make lasting improvements to Chicago’s schools, she argued, principals needed that flexibility. Without it, they would not be able to establish the right culture or create a team atmosphere. And, at least as important, principals would not have the leverage to coach teachers struggling to help their pupils succeed.

Thinking about it now, years after I decided to abandon the gospel of teacher-focused reform for an approach centered on empowering principals, Hines’s advice sounds almost like common sense. But at the time, it was a momentous decision. Parents are rarely surprised when I note that even the best teachers can be rendered ineffective in a dysfunctional school, or that a great principal can turn a good teacher into an extraordinary educator. But even today, reformers rarely take the impact of principals into account.

The union was loath to give in, and the strike dragged on for two additional days. But eventually they agreed, and I then decided to go all in on principal-centered reform. We raised principals’ salaries, particularly for those working in hard-to-staff schools. Chicago established a new program explicitly designed to recruit and train new school leaders. We collaborated with Northwestern University to improve professional development for principals. And we gave the best-performing principals additional autonomy by establishing a system of independent schools, subject to less oversight from the central office.",-1,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/02/policymakers-need-new-path-education-reform/581995/

99,Emanuel,Rahm,theatlantic,"Read: America wakes up from its dream of free college

At the outset, we chose to make our program merit-based for two reasons. First, we suspected that setting a rigorous academic standard would change attitudes inside Chicago’s high schools. If students in grades nine to 12 know that good grades will earn them a guaranteed free education, they’re further incentivized to run through the tape. (Chicago’s high-school graduation rate grew from 56.9 percent in 2011 to 78.2 percent in 2018.) Second, we theorized that making the scholarship merit-based would help the program avoid the plague of college dropouts—and that’s exactly what’s happened. Chicago Star’s retention rate is 86 percent, well above the national average of 62.7 percent.

Next, we decided to institute a series of carrots and sticks. Unlike some of its sister programs, Chicago Star covers not only tuition, but books and public transportation as well. And we decided to require recipients to complete the program in three years, allowing students to earn their associate’s degree while working full-time, but precluding them from dragging the process out indefinitely. Our shot-clock approach works: 49.7 percent of Chicago Star recipients complete their degree, more than double the national average of 23.6 percent.

The demographic impact is remarkable. More than two-thirds of Chicago Star scholars are Hispanic (compared with 20 percent in Oregon)—and 80 percent are first-generation college students (compared with 43 percent in Tennessee). But proud as we are of these successes, there’s no substitute for rigorous data analysis, and Washington should get in the game of determining which approaches work best. Policy makers in Arkansas, Hawaii, Kentucky, Nevada, and other states working to shape similar programs should know how free community college affects high-school graduation rates, for example, and whether “use it or lose it” time limits drive completion rates. As cities and states serve as laboratories of democracy, our national leaders must look to these programs as models for modernizing and expanding access to higher education.

Chicago Star is already changing young lives. You need not look beyond Elijah Ruiz, who graduated from Whitney M. Young Magnet High School, attended Wilbur Wright College on the Star Scholarship, and then earned a full ride to Cornell. Or Rikyah Wright, who had earned college credits in high school through Chicago’s “dual credit, dual enrollment” program, and then took advantage of Star to enroll in fall 2017 at Harold Washington College with an entire semester’s worth of credit already under her belt. Wright went on to the University of Illinois, and is set to graduate in 2020.

I’ve spent most of the past four decades in public life. I helped President Bill Clinton turn the federal deficit into a surplus in the 1990s, and I worked with President Barack Obama to shape the Affordable Care Act. But I can say without reservation that I’m as proud of the Star Scholarship as I am of any other professional achievement. I can feel its impact in the embrace of tearful parents who understand how an associate’s degree will help their children achieve the American dream. This program matters. And all Americans—not just those fortunate enough to live in Chicago—deserve similar opportunities.",-1,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/01/rahm-emanuel-case-free-community-college/579319/

101,Emanuel,Rahm,theatlantic,"Read: John Kelly couldn’t fix the Trump presidency.

That’s simply not how Donald Trump does business—never has been. Does someone need to impose order on the West Wing? The answer is obvious. But it wouldn’t matter whom you put in the job—George Patton, Angelo Dundee, Judge Judy, Darth Vader. If the president is going to outsource significant authority to Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump, and other staffers, and allow them to report directly to him, no chief of staff can perform the role as other presidents have utilized it.

Second, consider the context. Obama installed me as his first chief of staff because he needed to hit the ground running to pull the country out of the Great Recession and drive the most progressive agenda since the Great Society. Having worked for Clinton, I already understood how the White House machinery worked. I knew the legislative landscape well, having been a member of the House Democratic leadership. And the president-elect trusted me because of our history working together in Illinois politics. On paper, at least, I appeared to be right for that moment, just as Howard Baker, who had been Senate majority leader, was uniquely equipped to lead Ronald Reagan’s White House during the Iran-Contra scandal. Chiefs of staff have to be paired against the challenges of their moment.

It appears that Trump is choosing a chief of staff based primarily on whether he’s equipped to help with his reelection effort. But let’s be honest—that shouldn’t be the president’s most immediate concern. He’s got other battles to fight before he can even think about 2020. The remarkable access his Cabinet appointees have given to a range of special interests—including oil companies and polluters—over the past two years will make him subject to intense scrutiny from House Democrats. President George W. Bush’s legacy was tarnished by the lackluster performance of his FEMA chief, Michael Brown, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Trump needs a chief of staff who can reassert control over Cabinet agencies, containing these potential scandals and minimizing the potential for more, regardless of whether he or she has an interesting take on the latest polling out of Michigan and Pennsylvania.

Moreover, the next chief of staff is likely to be in office when the Mueller report comes in for a landing. The days, weeks, and months that follow will present a challenge unique in the history of the modern presidency. To survive, Trump will need a true wartime consigliere—someone capable of managing the substantive, political, and public-relations challenges of what is likely to be an incredibly damaging set of allegations. There’s no reason to believe that true wisdom about when to stand tall and when to duck coincides with the capacity to conjure up quippy dog whistles.

103,Emanuel,Rahm,theatlantic,"Read: The midterms sent an unmistakable message to Republicans.

To this day, the two reliably Republican districts have a lot in common. Both voted for Mitt Romney over Barack Obama, and for Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton. Both districts boast a high proportion of college-educated voters. Finally, but maybe not surprisingly, large shares of both districts are white: more than 60 percent of residents in Gingrich’s old stomping ground, and nearly 86 percent in Hastert’s.

This year, both districts broke the Trumpian script by turning blue. Lucy McBath, who connected with thousands of voters by sharing the anguish she felt after losing her son to gun violence, won in Georgia. Lauren Underwood, a nurse who focused her campaign on health care, economic growth, and gun safety, prevailed in Illinois. Here’s what’s so remarkable: Representatives-elect McBath and Underwood are both African American.

Houston, Texas, has a similar story to tell. Harris County, which includes Houston, has elected white Republican men to run its local government in every election for decades. But this year, Harris County elected as its top executive a 27-year-old woman who promised to fight corruption, increase transparency, and champion criminal-justice reform. Lina Hidalgo is a Colombian immigrant.

These stories are part of an emerging trend. Antonio Delgado, an African American Rhodes Scholar attacked by the GOP as a “big-city rapper,” won a congressional race in New York’s Hudson Valley. Andy Kim, who is Asian American, won a congressional race in suburban New Jersey. I’m not convinced these places would have been willing to elect minority candidates or women when Democrats took back the House in 2006. This year, any doubts were put to rest.

David Frum: There is no progressive majority in America.

These results are both breathtaking and heartwarming. While there is ample evidence that the divisions we saw in 2016 only got deeper in 2018, there are also signs that Americans are finding common ground and unity. Just when you thought things could not get worse, they didn’t.

Activists should take heart in knowing that many Americans aren’t buying the message that they ought to retreat into their own corners, voting exclusively for people who look or sound like them. As Barack Obama said in Grant Park the night he was elected president: “If there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible, who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time, who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer.” That is still true.

Maybe even more important, these races should serve as a reminder that Democrats’ impulse to paint Trump supporters with a single brush can obscure what’s really happening in voters’ hearts and minds. Yes, too many Americans continue to cast their ballot on the basis of ingrained prejudice. But many of the men and women who voted for President Trump in 2016 saw beyond their own identity when voting earlier this month.",-1,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/11/signs-increasing-american-unity-2018-midterms/576127/

Here’s the political reality. In 2016, Democrats suffered because too many Americans viewed us as the urban-enclave party. I’m a big-city mayor—these are my people. But I’m experienced enough to know that the fate of Democratic candidates in 2020’s nationwide and statewide contests depends on their ability to win the hearts and minds of the new “Metropolitan Majority,” a bloc encompassing both the progressives who came out for Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and the swing voters who live in the suburban and exurban communities that recently turned from red to blue.

Republicans understand that. Their strategy over the next two years will be to drive wedges between the urban and suburban voters. Trump will be relentless in using his Twitter feed to paint Democrats as what Stephen Miller called “cosmopolitans”—urban liberals culturally at odds with the nation’s swing voters. No street brawler has ever won an alley fight by responding to every sucker punch. In the same vein, Democrats will need to be as disciplined in their responses as Trump is strategic in each of his provocations.

Democrats’ first step should be to go back and listen to the candidates who won in the places that swung from red to blue, like the areas surrounding cities such as Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Minneapolis, Houston, and Chicago. How did the new Democratic governors of states Trump won manage to turn the tide? They are best poised to point the way forward.

Read: What the midterms say about America’s divide

Take education as a prime example. Suburban and urban voters are united in their concern that their kids’ schools are getting shortchanged and that college students aren’t able to graduate without mountains of debt. That’s a big reason that, in Illinois, Democrats claimed the governor’s mansion, two new congressional seats, and numerous additional state legislative seats two years after making a massive new investment in schools and universities. Democrats need to stand with the teachers, among others, demanding adequate funding for education in states such as West Virginia, Oklahoma, and Colorado. They need to model programs on the successes that Tennessee, Oregon, Rhode Island, New York, and, yes, Chicago have had providing free tuition to community colleges and universities.

Second, on health care, it’s time for Democrats to move their focus from expanding coverage to controlling costs. The Affordable Care Act has done a world of good reducing the legions of American living without insurance and protecting those with preexisting conditions. But even as Trump tries to undermine the ACA, the more than 150 million Americans who rely on private health insurance are struggling with a different set of problems altogether: skyrocketing premiums, fees, and prescription-drug prices. We need to get tough on the pharmaceutical and insurance industries profiting from those hikes and help average Americans manage those costs.",-1,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/11/why-democrats-need-establish-metropolitan-majority/574966/

It is an image that came to mind over the weekend as 11 lives were stamped out in a hate-filled shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh.

The victims were not just practicing their faith in a higher power, they were practicing their faith in America — a nation founded on the principle of religious freedom.

In recent years, we have seen these horrific acts play out in places of worship across the country — in Pittsburgh, at the African Methodist Episcopal Church in South Carolina, at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, at the Sikh Temple in Wisconsin. In each, people were targeted because of their faith or their heritage.

We cannot lose sight of our common humanity and the threads that bind us together. And we cannot forget that the words we use can either bring us together or rip us apart.

OPINION

It is incumbent upon all of us as citizens in this great country and this great city to seek comfort in our common humanity. To understand and speak to the better angels of our nature.

Last Friday, I had the honor of speaking at a breakfast for One Million Degrees, a program that helps our students stay in community colleges and move onto their careers. I was introduced by Ahmed, a young man who emigrated with his family from Syria to Chicago four years ago.

Think about that for a moment. A Muslim, Syrian immigrant introducing the son of a Jewish, Israeli immigrant. Was he Muslim? Yes. Am I Jewish? Yes. But he introduced me as an American who honored the sacrifice and the struggle of his parents by studying hard and working hard for a better tomorrow.

Ahmed’s parents had no different aspirations for him than my father, Benjamin Emanuel, had for my brothers, Ezekiel and Ariel, and me. The power of this great country is that in the darkness of Damascus, Ahmed’s parents saw in America the promise of a better tomorrow for their son.

Here he is. An immigrant to this great city, graduating our community colleges, working at Accenture, and fulfilling not only his aspirations — but equally powerful — his dreams and honoring his parents’ sacrifice and struggle to come to a better place. Those same dreams, those same aspirations, those same hopes are what led my grandfather and my father to not only this great country but this great city.

In this moment of darkness for our country, as we are wondering how we got here and how we escape this horror, let us remember that in all of us regardless of our sexual orientation, the color of our skin, our faith, our heritage, there’s something more fundamental that binds us together. I saw it Friday morning, but I also see it in our schools, on the train, in grocery stores, at the park, and all throughout our city every day.

My hope is that all of us in Chicago lead by example at this moment and continue to come together as Americans. Because America is not just a place on a map, it’s a set of ideas and values. Those are the same ideas and values like a magnet that drew Ahmed’s parents to this country and drew my father and grandfather here.

If we do that, there is a path from this out to a lighter day. A day filled with love, affection and understanding of each other.

But we know the flip side as well. When the American people think the economy’s headed in the wrong direction, they’re liable to punish the president’s allies across the country. That’s what happened in 1982, 1994, and 2006. And that’s why it’s so remarkable that Republicans are struggling one week out from this year’s midterm.

If a political pundit arrived on the scene today not knowing anything about the past two years in politics, she’d likely look at the economic indicators and presume that the GOP was flying high. But President Trump’s divisive social agenda and pugnacious personality are so unpopular that he’s dragging his entire party down with him. Republicans are hemorrhaging mea culpa voters who regret having voted for Trump in the first place. And that will cost the GOP not just in House races, but also in state houses across the country.

What’s a wave election? It’s a force within the electorate that proves more powerful than the structural impediments it overwhelms. The barriers to Democratic success are formidable, including voter suppression, gerrymandering, and a 3.7 percent unemployment rate. But Democrats are seeing their support swell high enough that it’s likely to overtop those barriers, not because of the economy but in spite of it.

Read: Beto O’Rourke’s huge Facebook bet

No Democrat needs to be reminded why statewide elections in places like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin matter in presidential campaigns. But until now, the DNC has seemed intent on letting everyone ignore the GOP’s biggest vulnerability, namely the fact that those three states—not to mention swing states like Florida, Ohio, Iowa, and Minnesota—are electing governors next week. If Democrats end up flipping state houses in places Trump won in 2016, they will have proved themselves capable of winning in the places coastal elites derisively refer to as “flyover America.” You can’t overstate how big a deal that will be.

It’s not that power in Congress isn’t important—it is. But over the long haul, the gubernatorial contests are likely to have a much bigger impact for three reasons. First, swing-state Democratic governors will have road-tested the messages best equipped to sway voters in the most important swing states. Nothing could be more valuable for our 2020 nominee.

Second, across most of the country, state officials will soon be tasked with redrawing the nation’s congressional districts. A decade ago, Republican governors helped the GOP gerrymander itself a decade’s worth of political advantage in Washington. If Democrats do well this year and again in 2020, they’ll be poised to flip that advantage back on the GOP through 2030.

CHICAGO (WLS) -- Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel announced Tuesday morning he's not running for re-election.Emanuel, 58, announced at a City Hall press conference that he will not seek re-election at the end of his term. Chicago's mayoral election will take place on Feb. 26, 2019.""Today, the time has come to make another tough choice. As much as I love this job, and will always love this city and its residents, I've decided not to seek re-election,"" he said.Emanuel made the announcement with his wife Amy Rule by his side.""This has been the job of a lifetime, but it is not a job for a lifetime. You hire us to get things done, and pass the torch when we've done our best to do what you hired us to do,"" he added.Emanuel was visibly emotional during the announcement.He spoke about what he feels have been his accomplishments over the last seven and a half years: improving schools and transportation systems, and trying to rebuild trust between police and the community. But he has also battled a resurgence in violence this summer.""For the last seven and a half years I have given my all every day, and left everything on the field. This commitment has required significant sacrifice all around,"" he said.The mayor did not take any questions at the conclusion of his remarks and did not say if he supported any one candidate in the mayoral race. He did not offer any endorsements. There are at least 12 candidates currently running for mayor . But he suggested the decision was personal, not political.""Politicians always say they're going to leave public office to spend more time with their family. My children were smart enough to see that coming and they have scattered to the two coasts, so as of the other day we are empty nesters,"" Emanuel joked. ""Amy and I are still young and Amy still looks it. We look forward to writing the next chapter of our journey together.""Political strategist David Axelrod, who is one of Emanuel's closest friends, said he was not surprised by the announcement, and that the mayor had been mulling this decision for months.""He knew he'd have a tough race but was confident about winning that race, but the part that was nagging at him, and that he kept coming back to, was do I have-I love this job but do I have another four years in me doing it the way I want to do it,"" he said.Emanuel's decision leaves the candidate field wide open, analysts said, and drastically changes the landscape of next year's election.""The first thing they have to do is rethink their strategy, their political strategy for their campaigns, because to a person they've all been running against Rahm, they've been running to say that the mayor is not doing a great job, that they can do a better job, well they don't have anybody to run against in that sense,"" said Laura Washington, ABC7 Legal Analyst.As recently as last week, the mayor was noncommittal when asked about whether he was running for reelection. According to the State Board of Elections, he had more than $8 million cash on hand as of June.The announcement came the day before the start of one of the biggest police-shooting trials in the history of Chicago - the murder trial of police officer Jason Van Dyke. The release of a dashcam video two years ago of the white officer shooting black teenager Laquan McDonald 16 times in 2014 drew the sharpest criticism of Emanuel in his two terms as mayor.Axelrod said the trial was not a significant factor in the decision. It really was personal.""And one that he went back and forth on for a long time, really agonized over it because it's hard to walk away from a job you love. But it's also true in this business people rarely make the mistake of leaving. It's rarely a mistake to leave too soon, it's often a mistake to try and stay too long,"" Axelrod said.Emanuel grew up in the ritzy Chicago suburb of Wilmette, the son of an Israeli physician who moved to the United States. His start in politics came after college, when he worked for Sen. Paul Simon's 1984 Senate campaign and Richard Daley's run for Chicago mayor in 1989.Emanuel is the 55th mayor of the city of Chicago and has served in the position since 2011. He followed Richard M. Daley, who was mayor for more than 20 years. Emanuel was a member of the Clinton administration from 1993 to 1998, eventually serving as Senior Advisor for Policy and Strategy. He served three terms as the U.S. Representative for Illinois' 5th District, and then served as White House Chief of Staff to President Obama for part of his first term.For three hours today, WVON attempted to break down Emanuel's political bombshell. The news made waves around Chicago from every day citizens to community leaders left wondering what led to the mayor's decision, and who will fill the inevitable power vacuum in a city whose politics have nearly always been dominated by deep-pocketed incumbents.""We know that our mayor has been controversial and certainly a question is what legacy does he leave behind?"" said Sylvia Puente, Latino Policy Forum. ""His announcement comes on the heels of the Laquan McDonald trial that is about to begin leaves any astute observer questioning what is it that we don't yet know?""""We have to be very clear now to say, OK, it's a different race now. It's a different agenda now. But here's what's not different: the West and the South Side, equalizing the playing field. Housing, jobs. Education that's good in every school,"" said Father Michael Pfleger, St. Sabina Catholic Church.At City Hall, both the mayor's political allies and erstwhile critics also reacted. Many wondered aloud who will add their names to an already crowded field of candidates. And at least one, retiring 22nd Ward Alderman Ricardo Munoz, is now reconsidering his recent decision to withdraw from public life.""I'm considering it. Like I said, a comet has hit this morning and I'm considering running for mayor,"" Munoz said.""I don't blame him. It's a tough job and he's been getting a lot of heat. People going to his house.

113,Emanuel,Rahm,politico,"David Paul Morris/Getty Images on the bench Anthony Kennedy Was No Moderate Progressives mourning his departure from the Supreme Court have the guy all wrong

Rahm Emanuel is the former mayor of Chicago, former White House chief of staff, and former member of Congress from Illinois.

Conventional wisdom holds that Justice Anthony Kennedy was a moderate whose rulings hewed down the center of the fairway with the centrist wisdom of a modern-day King Solomon. I don’t buy it. Neither should you.

To paraphrase a famed retort, I have known moderate Supreme Court justices, I have worked with moderate Supreme Court justices, moderate Supreme Court justices have been friends of mine, and Anthony Kennedy was no moderate Supreme Court justice.

Although he wrote the majority decision in favor of marriage equality and cast crucial votes for reproductive rights, Justice Kennedy sided far more often with the powerful over the vulnerable. In opinion after opinion, he ruled in favor of corporations over average people and Big Money interests over the best interests of our democracy. Of the 35 justices who have served since World War II, Kennedy was the sixth most reliable pro-business vote. How’s that moderate?

With all the whitewashing of a staunchly conservative record that has been going on lately, it would be easy to forget that Kennedy cast the deciding vote in some of the most consequentially disastrous decisions of a generation. That’s right: This is the “moderate” who gifted a presidential election to George W. Bush on a silver platter in Bush v. Gore. In 2000, the popular vote did not count. It was Kennedy’s decisive vote from the bench that mattered.

This is the “moderate”’ who wrote for the majority in Citizens United v. FEC. He conflated money with speech and corporations with people. Wrong on both counts. That decision overturned a century of campaign finance law and opened the floodgates for unlimited special interest money, including from overseas, to flow unchecked into our elections. The results prove it. In 2016, 25 percent of the money spent on presidential and congressional races came from groups “with access to unlimited and unrestricted sources of funding.”

Kennedy is the “moderate”’ who last month handed powerful corporations yet another significant victory, in another 5-4 decision, in the case of Epic Systems Corp. v. Lewis. It made it more difficult for workers to seek recourse against employers engaged in wage theft and discriminatory pay practices.

Just last week, on his way out the door, Kennedy sided with another 5-4 majority to upend decades of precedent and progress for organized labor in Janus vs. AFSCME. It was a parting shot to workers before heading off to his own taxpayer-secured retirement.

I do not overlook the positive aspects of Kennedy’s legacy. I have fought for women’s rights and gay rights my whole life. But a few good votes that are close to my heart do not blind my eyes to a fundamentally reactionary record. They should not obscure your opinion of Kennedy’s tenure either.

The politically correct Beltway view that ce Kennedy stands among true moderates, like Justices David Souter and Lewis Powell, to name just two, is in fact a sign of how far the political center has moved to the right.

The costs of Kennedy’s decisions, and their unforeseen consequences, will reverberate for years to come. Overruling the popular vote in Bush v. Gore brought us the Iraq War. Overturning every post-Watergate campaign finance reform in Citizens United brought us the best democracy money can buy.

The American people deserve a Supreme Court justice who will stand firmly with us, not consistently throw in their lot with the country’s most powerful interests.

President Barack Obama nominated just such a jurist in Merrick Garland. Mitch McConnell robbed my old boss of his constitutional right to put forth his pick for the high court on the flimsiest possible grounds that it was an “election year.” In this election year, with Senator McConnell’s rank hypocrisy already exposed for the world to see, will the Senate confirm a judge even further to the right than Kennedy? If President Donald Trump has his way, the court will continue its rightward shift and leave the rest of us behind.",-1,https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/07/03/anthony-kennedy-was-no-moderate-218945

118,Emanuel,Rahm,chicago,"The National Rifle Association has it backward: When we let bad guys have guns, the good guys are the ones they go after.

Less than two months into this year, Chicago police officers have already recovered more than 1,000 illegal firearms. And less than two weeks ago, we suffered a tragic reminder of the daily dangers our officers confront when Cmdr. Paul Bauer gave his life in selfless service to our city.

OPINION

Our city can pass some of the toughest, smartest gun control legislation in the country, and we have. Our courageous police officers can do the difficult, dangerous work of taking guns off the street, and they do. But Chicago is not an island. If neighboring states and the federal government fail to follow our lead in passing tougher gun measures, too many of our police officers and residents are the ones who will continue to pay the price.

This week, the state Legislature in Springfield will take up the Commander Paul Bauer Act along with a package of complementary gun control legislation that would strengthen public safety, stem the flow of guns to Chicago and hold gun dealers accountable for their practices. It is about time.

The Commander Paul Bauer Act would ban the sale of high capacity magazines and body armor, like those Cmdr. Bauer’s killer was armed with, to anyone other than police officers.

The Gun Dealer Licensing Bill, mirroring an ordinance the Chicago City Council passed in 2014, would require background checks for gun dealers and their employees, mandate them to open their businesses for inspection and record their sales. The bill, which already passed the Illinois Senate last April, would additionally compel dealers to undergo training in conducting background checks, identifying straw purchases and preventing thefts while prohibiting them from operating within 1,000 feet of schools.

The Illinois General Assembly also will consider banning bumpstocks and trigger cranks, increasing the age requirements and waiting period for purchasing assault weapons, and making it more difficult for individuals with serious mental illnesses to get guns.

No one step will solve every challenge or prevent every tragedy, but taken together these sensible solutions will move Chicago and Illinois in the right direction.

I have spent almost my entire career working towards common-sense gun control. As a member of the Clinton White House, I was given the assignment of passing the Brady Bill in 1993 and the Assault Weapons Ban in 1994. That was back in the days when bipartisan cooperation on gun control was within reach. Even Ronald Reagan lent his voice in support.

It is past time for today’s elected officials to think less about their political safety and more about public safety. And if legislators do not back up our police officers and residents, voters must hold them accountable. Those of us who care about smarter, tougher gun legislation must be engaged in the political process at the same level of intensity as those who oppose it.

Today we have the wind at our backs, powered by the energy of young people, from the students in Parkland to people in Chicago and across Illinois who have raised their voices to say enough is enough.

We cannot let legislators do the bare minimum to get this issue off the table and move on. I know from experience that plenty of politicians will say one thing in public in the wake of a tragedy, but behind closed doors with the NRA they sing a different tune.

We must hold their feet to the fire. We must respond to the demand for action with public policies commensurate with the crisis.

I have spoken to the leadership of the Illinois House and Senate and they know that these key pieces of legislation are a priority for Chicago. The state has a responsibility to act, and Gov. Bruce Rauner has a duty to sign these bills into law.

Our residents and police officers are demanding tougher gun laws. Last year, the Chicago Police Department took more than 8,600 illegal guns off the street. Sixty percent came from out of state, but 40 percent came from right here in Illinois. We need Springfield to be part of the solution, and not just mimic the dysfunction and inaction of Washington, DC.

Enough is enough.

Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel was chief of staff to President Barack Obama from January, 2009 to October, 2010. He served as a senior advisor to President Bill Clinton from 1993 to 1998.

120,Emanuel,Rahm,chicago,"Last week, we reached an agreement with 31 labor unions on a new contract. It’s an agreement that protects the millions of taxpayers in Chicago. It’s an agreement that ensures our 2.7 million residents will continue to receive the high quality services they expect – that their streets will be plowed, that their garbage will be picked up and that their trees will be trimmed. And it’s an agreement that respects the 7,700 city employees who serve our city and are members of those unions.

OPINION

Yet, importantly, the contract is a departure from the previous agreement, signed in 2007. It’s half as long, it includes new work rule changes, the average annual pay raise is 2.1 percent as opposed to 2.6 percent and it includes increases in health care premiums for the first time in more than a decade. That’s why the city’s inspector general, Joe Ferguson, said the agreement “reflects the interests of the taxpayer.”

All negotiations involve give and take, but no one wins if the city’s finances aren’t stable. Not taxpayers, not residents and not employees. That’s why over the past seven years we have worked to stabilize our health care costs and shore up our pensions. This agreement is built on the foundation we laid through that collaborative work.

Skyrocketing health care costs are challenging governments and private businesses across the country. However, in the City of Chicago our health care costs are actually lower today than they were when I took office. In 2011, we spent $425 million on health care. In 2017, that figure is estimated to have been $417 million.

It has not been easy. It required many difficult and sometime contentious choices, year after year after year. But when I took office the city’s health care costs were growing at 5 percent each year – from $340 million in 2007 to $425 million in 2011. The hard truth was that it was simply not sustainable. That’s why I pledged in 2011 to put the city on a different path, and in 2018 we budgeted $44 million less for health care than we did in 2011.

By sitting down with our partners in labor, we were able to build on our work over the past seven years to lock in those health care savings as we work to keep our costs relatively flat.

We did it by being upfront, open and honest with each other. I was clear, the city needed additional health care savings and we needed work rule changes. So, health care premiums will rise for city employees, a new deducible for prescription drugs will be established and the city’s share of health care contributions will be reduced by $12 million.

These changes will help us continue to keep the city’s finances stable into the future. That in turn will allow us to provide residents with high quality services, invest in our neighborhoods, improve public safety and ensure our city employees receive fair compensation for their work.

There’s a lesson here for Springfield, too. If the governor actually sat down with labor unions, instead of trying to step on them, he might find his rhetoric doesn’t match reality. The unions are more reasonable than he thinks and ready to roll up their sleeves to get the job done.

Rahm Emanuel was elected mayor of Chicago in 2011 and re-elected in 2015. The 31 unions with whom the city reached a contract are members of the Chicago Federation of Labor, whose president, Jorge Ramirez, also is chairman of the labor-heavy investor group that owns the Sun-Times.",-1,https://chicago.suntimes.com/columnists/how-chicago-worked-with-labor-unions-rather-than-step-on-them/
121,Emanuel,Rahm,denverpost,"When Bill Clinton won the White House 25 years ago this month, he rescued his party from its worst electoral drought in more than a century. Today, as Democrats wonder how we lost the heartland and Republicans wonder how their base lost its mind, both sides could look to Clinton’s 1992 playbook for clues on how to revive a flagging party’s fortunes.

Before turning to Clinton in 1992, Democrats had lost five of six presidential elections, twice in 49-state wipeouts. The party was left for dead after back-to-back-to-back landslide defeats in the 1980s. “There are three things Democrats must do to take back the White House,” Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., joked. “Unfortunately, no one knows what they are.”

Fortunately for Democrats, Clinton knew what to do. While both parties face different challenges a quarter-century later, those three things are still the road back:

Fix your party’s problems or you’ll never fix the country’s. Every party’s greatest enemy is denial. After a loss, party leaders rush to blame a candidate or circumstance, rather than owning up to more fundamental problems. Clinton knew that if Americans had rejected us in three straight landslides, we had only ourselves to blame. His agenda of welfare reform, community policing and tax relief for the forgotten middle class confronted head-on the problems that Democrats for too long had avoided — and Republicans had done nothing to solve.

The GOP has now lost the popular vote in six of the past seven presidential elections. Republicans control Congress and the White House but can’t govern because instead of confronting their party’s demons, they nominated an even bigger one. The GOP’s own postmortem of the 2012 election warned there was no future in bashing minorities and favoring corporations over the middle class. Donald Trump took that autopsy and turned the party into a walking corpse. Repealing Obamacare, ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and passing tax reform are such a struggle because they expose, rather than confront, Republicans’ Achilles heel.

Democrats had a good night Tuesday, but there is a lot of work yet to be done. If we want to be a majority party again, we must avoid our own forms of denial. Too often, our party succumbs to a recurring fallacy that voter turnout matters more than persuasion. Clinton knew that winning and governing required both. In 1992, he forged a personal connection with his base and a philosophical connection with undecided voters. When Ross Perot made 1992 a three-way race, some Clinton advisers urged a “34 percent solution” focused on Democratic turnout. Clinton chose instead to compete with Perot for swing voters and cruised to victory. Now, as then, sophisticated turnout models are no substitute for winning the argument.

Show Americans what you’re for. Clinton understood that ideas are the most underrated weapon in politics and the best chance a party has to change minds. He ran the wonkiest campaign in memory and made real solutions to real problems — sending young people to college in return for national service, rewarding work with the earned-income tax credit, steering capital to poor neighborhoods through community development banks — the test for his opponents. Attacking “the brain-dead politics of both parties,” he declared: “Americans know what we’re against. Let’s show them what we’re for.”

A quarter-century later, President Donald Trump seems to be against everyone and everything. Republicans need to remember that whatever Americans may feel about how many National Football League players take a knee, they care far more whether their children can afford college or their employer will give them a raise.

In the Trump era of fake policy and fun-house mirrors, Democrats must be more focused than ever on real answers. Opposition parties talk about problems. A majority party has to make clear how it will solve them.

Leave no vote unturned. Clinton’s most remarkable political achievement was to transform America’s electoral map. He carried 32 states in 1992, more than the 31 states Democrats in the previous two decades had carried in five presidential defeats combined. He swept nine states no Democrat had won since 1964 and eight no Democrat has won since he left office. He prevailed in every age group and even split the rural vote, a breadth of support no Democrat since has matched.

Today, neither party may have the stomach for the long, hard grind of winning back the voters, states and regions it has lost. The party of Trump has retreated to its own private Alamo, with a base that doesn’t look like America and a strategy that depends on division, not addition. As a result, thoughtful Republicans and independents pine for a reasonable alternative. Yet instead of reaching out to the nearly 60 percent of Americans who disapprove of the president and may be looking for a new political home, Democrats are once again fighting over whether to purge one wing or frustrate the other.

Bill Clinton showed there is no such thing as an electoral lock: Candidates and parties choose whether to let themselves in or lock themselves out. Successful presidents and parties build enduring majorities, not energized minorities. That may seem a distant memory in these dark, polarized times, but like Clinton, both parties would be wise to believe America can still be a place called Hope.

Specifically, Chance was on-hand to oppose Emanuel’s efforts to invest $95 million into a brand new police academy for the city, citing the huge gap in education funding. “I guess the mayor had to step out, but it’s cool, it’s cool because I’m here to talk to you guys right now,” he said near the top of his speech. “It’s a very simple thing you guys have to do, we should understand financially that this proposed plan doesn’t make sense.

From small towns to metropolises and from the coasts to the heartland, Republican and Democratic mayors are united in common cause to curb emissions, shrink our carbon footprints and fight for a greener future.

Rather than accepting the White House’s wrongheaded withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement, cities are redoubling our efforts to meeting the landmark accords’ benchmarks. We not only have the power to take action, but unlike Washington we have the will to get the job done.

Just days after Donald Trump’s shortsighted decision, I signed an executive order formalizing Chicago’s commitment to adopting the guidelines of the Paris agreement and reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 26-28% by 2025 (compared with 2005 levels).

Chicago has a head start in this effort. We already cut carbon emissions by 7% from 2010-15, while our economy expanded by 12%.

How did we do it?

First, in 2012 we closed Chicago’s last two remaining coal plants.

Second, we retrofitted over 54m sq ft of buildings to make them more energy efficient, earning Chicago first place in the nation for green building adoption and the distinction as the only large American city to be granted the US Environmental Protection Agency energy star partner of the year award.

Third, to encourage alternatives to driving, Chicago is in the middle of an unprecedented $8.5bn modernization of our mass transit system. We also created the largest bike-sharing program in North America, adding 108 miles of new protected bike lanes and 47 miles of off-street public bike paths, earning Chicago the accolade of the best city in the country for cyclists from Bicycling Magazine.

Fourth, our Drive Clean Chicago initiative has supported $37m in low and emission zero vehicles, the equivalent of taking 1,700 cars off the road a year. We are now in the process of procuring Chicago’s first fleet of electric buses, charging stations and hybrid police vehicles.

These steps are just a downpayment on the work ahead to meet the benchmarks of the Paris climate agreement. Looking over the horizon, by 2025 Chicago will be the largest city in the country where every public building is powered by 100% renewable energy. Outside our buildings, we are converting all of our city streetlights to LED by 2021.

American cities have the power and the will to take action collectively and in our own communities. We control the levers of planning, land use and development – and we can use these tools to turn promises and commitments into results.

This fall, Chicago will host the first North American Climate Summit, a new forum for leaders from across the US, Canada and Mexico to exchange innovative ideas and strengthen coordination and collaboration in our common fight for a sustainable future.

The summit will build on the strength of successful existing partnerships including the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group as well as Climate Mayors, a bipartisan coalition of more than 300 municipal leaders from across the US. We are also proud to partner with America’s Pledge, a coalition made up of 227 cities and counties, nine states and more than 1,600 businesses committed to upholding the Paris climate agreement.

In Chicago and cities across America, we are sending a clear signal: we will not be deterred and we will not let the truth about climate change be obscured. When the Trump Environmental Protection Agency took down information on climate science from their website, Chicago put it up on our city website. More than a dozen other American cities followed suit.

Something is wrong when a president will do anything to protect every Confederate statue in every city and town, but not one thing to protect those cities and towns from rising sea levels, severe storms and other climate change impacts that threaten municipalities’ very existence.

We hope that Washington finds the courage to lead, but in the meantime we are going to keep pushing forward by cutting emissions, reducing our reliance on coal and adopting the Paris climate agreement locally. Our residents and businesses demand nothing less.",-1,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/29/if-donald-trump-wont-tackle-climate-change-then-chicago-will
126,Emanuel,Rahm,newrepublic,"IC: If I can go back on the record, how optimistic are you about a peace deal?

RE: I am uncharacteristically optimistic, just on the optimism side of fifty percent.

IC: Why now?

RE: I think it is a framework deal, which is different and easier than a final deal. And I think the parties have enough in common about the framework, which they have known for ten years.

IC: But why is there the will now?

RE: Hamas is as weak as it’s going to be. Abbas is ready to work with Israel. Israel has a security concern involving geography. But geography does not have the same value it did in 1967. And I want to say that there is nothing I just said that major figures in the national security apparatus of the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] and Israel haven’t said publicly. Nothing!

IC: Sometimes American politicians can’t say things that have already been said in Israel—

RE: You are not allowed to here! Because the American—well, for whatever reason, that is a whole different debate. I don’t want to talk about this. It is not my business. I don’t really care. But Israel’s national security apparatus has concluded what I have observed. [Laughs.]

IC: At the risk of making an awkward segue that you will mock—

RE: That was light jest. You haven’t heard mocking yet.

IC: How do you think the GOP has changed since you left Washington in 2011?

RE: It has been going downhill. Washington is not broken. The GOP is broken. They need a Bill Clinton moment with someone to figure things out. Let me just say, and I don’t agree with his policies so let me put a warning label on the side of the packet here: If George W. Bush had never gotten in the disastrous Iraq war, he was trying to modernize the party on a series of fronts. But on tax and foreign policy, everything cratered.

IC: Chris Christie was going to be the savior.

RE: He “was.” You said it in past tense.

IC: Do you think it is past tense?

RE: I do. Nothing is ever absolute in politics, but I am willing to go out on a limb and join you. It may take more than an immediate time frame for him to recover, and he doesn’t have more than that.

IC: Right.

RE: I am listening [for the next question].

IC: How is governing different in Washington versus Chicago?

RE: One you can actually run, and the other you don’t have a chance.

IC: I think I know which is which.

RE: You don’t get any bonus points for figuring that out. Look, I can’t imagine being mayor and not having had the experience working for President Clinton or President Obama, or, for that matter, working in Congress. On the other hand, I think I would have been a better adviser had I been mayor first. If I had had this job first, I could have seen the implications of things I was doing.

IC: Is it easier to set goals as mayor than in Washington? It seems like there might be fewer constraints in Chicago.

RE: It is not harder. Because of the powers and the history of this office, you are able to maneuver the government. The challenge for the president is—I don’t want to analyze this president.

IC: Forget this president. How about the challenge of the presidency?

RE: There is a diffusion of power. Here there is a focus of power. Let me give an example, and I don’t want to tout what we are doing, but since you asked. [Laughs.] We are redoing every playground in the city of Chicago. It is all paid for. All new equipment. Done. [Claps hands.]

I believe in parks as a dramatic improvement in the quality of life in the city. We are adding parks everywhere. We are trying to get the Interior Department to designate a local park to be a national designation, and it is like a three-year process. They have interest in doing it, but my God. In Chicago, I wanted to make sure every child in four years time was a ten-minute walk from a new park or playground. It’s done. We are going to get there one year ahead of time.

IC: You don’t have a Congress that prohibits you from passing the smallest thing.

RE: We have fifty aldermen but we do have a ... hmmm.

IC: A working majority?

RE: [Bursts into laughter.] We have a can-do spirit. Washington doesn’t think they have a lot on the line. We have a lot on the line.

IC: They do have a lot on the line, they just don’t act like it.

RE: That is true.

IC: A lot of mayors in the Democratic Party, or mayors like Michael Bloomberg who are ideologically similar to you or Obama, often seem to be tougher on fiscal and labor issues at the local level.

RE: I am not sure I understand the question.

IC: Mayors have to balance a budget or deal with pensions. Democrats at the local level seem more willing to be tough on these issues.

RE: I would change the terminology around the word “tough.” I think the president is hardheaded. My choices are more prevalent to people in the way they live their lives. We are getting to a point where we can make a pension payment or pave a road but we can’t do both. I am not tough on pensions. I am realistic. There is a difference. It is also realistic from a fiscal side that, if all we do is make no changes, I would have to raise taxes at a level that would harm the economy. I would become the federal government.

IC: With Bill de Blasio, we are seeing cleavages within the Democratic Party. Pensions. Negotiation with the unions. Charter schools.

RE: There are divisions, or I would call them differences. But I just left my staff meeting. We have differences, too.

IC: You can fire them.

RE: [Grimaces.] They’re good. They work hard. Doesn’t mean they agree with me. I think too much of the debate in Washington is about ideological gradations. I have a piece today [in the Chicago Sun-Times] about the Earned Income Tax Credit. I have negotiated to expand it. Now, is that considered left or right?

IC: Uh—

RE: It’s full of shit, OK? [Raises voice.] It’s crap.

IC: What’s full of shit?

RE: I consider myself a progressive. I have a passion for people who work. To me, this is about forward looking versus backward looking. Ideological gradations are the wrong way to look at it.

IC: Figures like de Blasio and Elizabeth Warren have been saying that inequality should be the focus of the party. Is inequality looking backwards or forwards?

RE: I think about this as a mayor. We have a great city. The principal reason is the people. We have very strong middle-class neighborhoods. The big challenge is the cities that become bell curves without the bell. I know Elizabeth says, “We are going to be the party of income inequality.” I want to stand up for the middle class. What we do with parks and public safety makes neighborhoods viable. You are in the city with the fastest-growing business district. The problem is whether it can still be livable with literally just the extremes. I will forget all the others talking about where the party should go. I am not interested in that.

IC: OK, but are there things going on with Wall Street and the broader economy that make it harder to protect the middle class?

RE: That is a different question than income inequality. I am giving you a different perspective. I am the mayor of the city. [Warren and de Blasio] want to have a debate. It is a relevant debate. But my focus is making sure Chicago is livable for all.

IC: Put aside inequality. I am wondering what you think about broader trends and the middle class in this country.

RE: Isaac, let’s just step back. Rather than the exodus of middle-class families to the suburbs, we have reentry into the city. We are at an incredible moment that is actually not momentary. It would be helpful if the federal government were a partner on infrastructure investment and research.

To the larger economy, the biggest thing that is happening is a skills deficit that inhibits us from doing what we need to do. Having a four-year college degree or better is key. I am not for this [smiles mischievously], but B.P. in Indiana is expanding a huuuuuuge refinery. They are bringing in people from Alabama and Kentucky because we don’t have enough pipefitters up here.

Look, the banks are going to pay what they are going to pay. Lawyers and accountants are going to get paid. But there are jobs that can pay people well, and we have been absent as a country on that.

IC: This isn’t an issue where you seem angry, yelling that Wall Street needs to pay.

RE: Look, I am not defending Wall Street. Wall Street has screwed up enough. But let me answer it this way: Wall Street is not to blame that we had a seven percent graduation rate in city community colleges. I fixed it—it is now fourteen percent. I doubled it in two years. Wall Street is not responsible for that. We allowed the colleges to deteriorate.

[Sits right on the edge of the chair, waving his finger in my face.] I met a young man on 35th street, right across from what you would know as Comiskey Park. I am shaking hands, and he says he was at Harold Washington College. He was getting a B.A. He said he works at Target and goes to school full-time. He is doing everything you want him to do. Now, can I say in good conscience that Harold Washington will help him the way Sarah Lawrence and Northwestern helped me? Where did you go?

IC: U.C. Davis.

RE: Well, U.C. Davis has economic value. It meant something when you put it on your résumé. Did Harold Washington mean the same to him? I don’t blame Wall Street for that.

IC: What do you think when you hear the word “gentrification”?

RE: It is funny you are asking in this sense. I just had a meeting with my head of economic development. There is an area called Fulton Market. You would think it was a typical area that is on fire. Google is moving in. Well, it’s not really on fire because then we wouldn’t be doing the interview. But there are restaurants in that neighborhood. It has exploded. It is one of the hottest areas in the country from a real estate perspective. We designed it in a way to protect the manufacturing, too.

I know there are a lot of bad connotations. High rents and people being forced out who have been there for years. And there is a reason it has that connotation. But if we are smarter about it, we can do things that allow improvements.

IC: What is the role for government in dealing with these issues? How active should the city be?

RE: Very active. Zoning laws, land use, all kinds of things. It can’t be the Wild West.

IC: Are you putting any pressure on the president to move his library here?

RE: You asked the right question in this sense: He will make the decision. Chicago is where he started his career in public life, because the same things that motivated him as a community organizer made him run for public office. And I think it is only fitting that it should be here, the place where his wife’s family is from, where his daughters grew up, and where he started his career. I will remind him.

132,Emanuel,Rahm,medium,"A Cluster of Atlanta Suburbs That Trump Won Only By A Hair, Transforms Suddenly Into a Momentum-Killing Pipe-Dream

Trump’s approval ratings are low and falling. Republicans in congress are cooking up, in secret, what seem to be wildly unpopular laws. And yet, they keep winning. Special elections to replace members of congress who joined the Trump Administration are over, with Republicans successfully replacing Republicans in 100% of them.

In Georgia, Republican Karen Handel handily beat Democrat Jon Ossoff, in the most expensive congressional race ever. Ossoff ended up losing by about 11,000 votes, or a margin of 52 to 48%. That means his campaign ended up blowing $185 on each losing vote.

A less-watched special election in South Carolina was a lot closer, with the Republican, Ralph Norman, winning by just a couple of thousand votes over Democrat Archie Parnell. (But as we’ve pointed out repeatedly, in politics, close doesn’t count. Even if you make up 75% of an enormous gap. You win, or you lose, that’s it.) Norman will fill the seat vacated by now budget director Mick Mulvaney. Democrats were more cautious about their chances in this race, but at the height of the Trump/Comey conflict considered the seat “in play.”

Is there anything for Democrats to be optimistic about? If you read what seems intended as kind of a rallying cry by Rahm Emanuel and Bruce Reed in the Atlantic, maybe yes. They say, “The most vulnerable seats in the current House majority belong to 23 Republican incumbents in districts Hillary Clinton carried, largely clustered in the suburbs of major metropolitan areas…” And they suggest focusing on these in 2018 midterm elections.

Problem is, that description sounds a lot like the Atlanta-area congressional district Democrats lost last night. (Hillary didn’t win there, but lost by just a point.) And even if Democrats were to flip all 23, they’d still be in the hole. Right now they’re in the minority in the House by more than 40. The Daily Kos continues to insist Democrats are outperforming (and says anyone who disagrees with them is either a “Republican flack or lazy”) because “neither of these seats should’ve been remotely competitive in the first place” and so it’s a signal “dozens of districts are considerably bluer.” To which we say, no: they should’ve been winnable. Because, Trump.

We are not saying Democrats can’t win in 2018. FiveThirtyEight’s Nate Silver writes this morning about how.

But we think the results mean Democrats (and also some Republicans,) have to deal with the fact that as astounding as it seems, people may actually like Trump. Maybe they won’t admit it publicly. Maybe they’ll even say to you they don’t like him. But as long as he’s shaking things up and entertaining the masses, it’s time to consider he may have an unseen layer of support that goes beyond his more vocal and fervent base. David Frum, also writing in the Atlantic, suggests even if you don’t believe what we’ve just asserted is true, there’s one person who certainly does, and that’s Trump, which means he’ll now pursue his radical agenda with renewed vigor.

We Often Warn Against Over-analyzing Trump’s Tweets, So We’ll Try To Keep This Simple

We think this perplexing proclamation could mean one of two things:

Trump is saying he’s going to take action of his own against North Korea. Trump was watching TV shows where they were talking about how China has failed in controlling or pressuring North Korea, and decided he agreed, but also wanted to get his two-cents in, and also let China know he still likes them.

Obviously, option #1 is far more menacing than option #2.

So what do we know?

• Trump has taken a strong personal interest in the case of Otto Warmbier, the 22 year old student who died this week after being sent home from a North Korean detention in a coma. Trump tweeted repeatedly and warmly about Warmbier and been in contact with his family. We will point out the last time Trump expressed this level of empathy, after he’d seen children on TV dying from a chemical attack, he bombed Syria. (That may not be a fair connection to make given the lack of information, but that’s not our fault.)

We also remembered this Tweet from the President, in April:

• On the other hand, right-wing media, which Trump seems to consume above all other, has been reporting on the Warmbier story incessantly, and Trump recently echoed some of their talking points, (which at their most extreme, blame Liberals and Obama for Warmbier’s fate.)

This dovetails into another story making the rounds: the seeming path to oblivion for daily White House press briefings. The kinds of Tweets we just talked about underscore why you need to do the briefings, and have your people there equipped with answers. You can scream and shout all you want about the media being an enemy of the people, but ultimately it is an advocate for the people. Because sometimes, things just need to be explained.

Saudi Arabia’s King Displaces Heir To The Throne With His Much Younger Own Son

In a surprise move, Saudi King Salman named his 31-year old son, Prince Mohammed bin Salman, as first in line to the throne, and removed his nephew, 57-year old Prince Mohammed bin Nayef from that position. The King also stripped his nephew of his duties as head of domestic security, which includes counter-terrorism. The official Saudi news agency reports the deposed prince has pledged his loyalty to the new crown prince. Prince Mohammed bin Salman will now also become Deputy Prime Minister. He will also continue as Defense Minister. He has been running the war in Yemen. This is the photo currently on the front page of the official Saudi News Agency website:

Why is this significant? King Salman is 81, and only became King two years ago. It’s unusual for someone as young as his son, popularly known as “MBS”, to become king, and he could end up ruling this Mideast monarchy for decades. Saudi Arabia is one of the world’s few remaining absolute monarchies.

Ukraine President Leaves Washington With One Very Big Unanswered Question

Will the U.S. provide weapons to Ukraine in its ongoing battle with Russian-backed forces occupying Crimea? After a meeting between Defense Secretary James Mattis, and Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko, a Pentagon spokesman said “Ukraine has a right to defend itself against aggressive Russian actions.” And on the question of providing lethal weaponry: “We don’t rule out the option of doing so in the future.”

President Trump wasn’t as directly supportive when he met Poroshenko, and in fact, didn’t outright condemn Russian aggression in Ukraine (something he has never done). But he did talk about more and stricter sanctions against Russians taking part in the incursion. (Poroshenko originally was only supposed to meet Vice President Mike Pence, but the Trump meeting was scrambled together at the last minute.)

Some say the new sanctions were intended to send a message to the Senate which, in a rare bipartisan move, overwhelmingly passed Russia sanctions legislation last week, and also voted to limit the President’s ability to lift sanctions. Trump-supporting House leadership is now holding up final passage of that measure on a technicality, saying the Senate did not have the authority to originate it.

We Were Poking Around For A Cheerful Note To End On, Found This Instead…

According to a really interesting investigative Washington Post report, Trump’s proposed cutbacks in public housing funds do not extend to benefits paid directly to landlords. And of course, this will benefit him personally, since he inherited a whole bunch of federally subsidized housing in Brooklyn from his father.

The Post asserts, while probably not the biggest, this may be one of the clearest examples of the President’s many conflicts of interest.

133,Emanuel,Rahm,theatlantic,"That referendum will be won or lost in swing districts—and they are much harder to find than they used to be. The Cook Political Report found that the number of swing seats—where neither party runs more than 5 points better than it does nationally—has dropped by more than half over the last 20 years, from 164 to 72. The most vulnerable seats in the current House majority belong to 23 Republican incumbents in districts Hillary Clinton carried, largely clustered in the suburbs of major metropolitan areas like Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and Washington. These districts tend to be mainstream in tone and interest. That’s a tough place to win the hand Trump has dealt Republicans of cutting student aid, denying climate change, and eliminating protections for pre-existing conditions.

But Democrats don’t just need to choose the right battles, they also need to choose credible candidates who can win them. Candidate quality may not make the difference in a place like Montana’s at-large district, where Greg Gianforte won handily just hours after assaulting a reporter. Winning hotly contested swing seats, however, requires candidates who closely match their districts—even if they don’t perfectly align with the national party’s activist base. In 2006, the Democratic base was energized and angry, but then as now, capturing a majority required winning some tough races in red and purple states across the heartland. As leaders in that 2006 effort, we recruited a football player in North Carolina, a businessman in Florida, an Iraq veteran in Pennsylvania, and a sheriff in Indiana. The Democratic Party won twice as many seats as it needed to gain control.

There’s a long-term payoff for a party that gets this right. Good candidates not only help build a wave, they help sustain it. Wave elections offer the chance to establish new beachheads in hostile territory, but it takes gifted leaders to survive when the pendulum swings back. In the 1980 Reagan landslide, Republicans gained 34 House seats—only to lose 26 seats two years later—and 12 Senate seats, only to lose 8 senators and Senate control when those seats came open six years later. With the right candidates, the impact of a wave can be felt for decades. Half a dozen “Watergate babies” elected to the House in 1974 went on to serve in the Senate. So have three Democrats who joined the House in the 2006 wave.

Even with the right candidates in the right districts, a wave won’t get far without a credible plan to address the country’s problems, not simply run attack ads against the parade of horribles from the other side. In 2006, we published a book called The Plan, which offered detailed proposals on college, retirement, health care, and the economy. One reason today’s congressional Republicans are struggling to enact an agenda is that unlike the Contract-with-America Republicans of 1994, the GOP waves of 2010 and 2014 were built only on saying no to Obama.

Donald Trump may hand Democrats the election next year, but Democrats should strive to earn the people’s trust on their own merits anyway. These are serious times for a country at the mercy of an unserious president. The damage may take years to repair, and voters deserve to know what Democrats are going to do about it.",-1,https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/06/riding-the-2018-wave/530952/
134,Emanuel,Rahm,abc7chicago,"CHICAGO (WLS) -- Mayor Rahm Emanuel formally announced Wednesday the city's support of the Paris climate agreement as Chicago welcomed mayors and leaders from around the world for a three-day conference about the global role of cities.The Chicago Council on Global Affairs' gathering seeks to get civic leaders and policy makers to brainstorm on the future influence of cities on the world around us. This year's focus was economics, and the discussion including growing concern about the impact of environmental policy on cities.""The decisions we make in the next two to three years will determine what our cities look like in the next 20 to 30 years,"" Emanuel said as he toured Millenium Park with Toronto's Mayor John Tory.The mayor's support comes after President Donald Trump pulled out of the agreement, but amid municipal leaders vowing to maintain environmental commitments independently.""This president, on this policy, is wrong and I will not silence my voice as it relates to the future of the city of Chicago,"" Emanuel said.Mayors from several cities gathered as part of the larger global affairs event.Tory emphasized their efforts to reduce climate change, but wanted Wednesday to take a closer look at Millennium Park as he is trying to a create a similar attraction in his city which is along the shores of Lake Ontario.""Finding and sharing solutions is now our highest priority,"" said Ivo Daalder, president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs.And climate change is an area where ideas and solutions could be shared, Emanuel said.Environmental policy advocate Andrew Szwak, of Openlands applauded Emanuel's announcement.""There's nothing that climate change does not impact in our natural environment,"" Szwak said.Szwak said the Chicago area has made strides in cleaning its waterways but damage has been done to the environment, like with the extinction of a species of butterfly. He fears erosion of the climate agreement and EPA funding for the Great Lakes could have long-term impact.The mayor signed the order just under a week after Trump withdrew the United States from the international Paris climate change accord, which is designed to fight climate change and reduce carbon emissions.""Chicago has proven you can create jobs while reducing your carbon footprint, and we will continue to do both. As the Trump administration pulls back we will push forward and reduce our fair share of carbon emissions in line with the Paris Accord. The world is depending on cities in the U.S. to take up the mantle of leadership on climate change. Chicago is accepting that challenge,"" Emanuel said.The executive order commits the city to the goal of reducing citywide greenhouse gas emissions to levels equal to or greater than 26 to 28 percent less than levels in 2005 by 2025, which was the original commitment made by the Obama Administration in the Paris Agreement.In order to meet that goal, the mayor's office will work with sister agencies, environmental advocates, environmental justice groups, community organizations, scientific experts, other cities, state actors and members of the business community on collaborative efforts to collectively reduce Chicago's greenhouse gas emissions.Emanuel said the city has reduced its carbon emissions by 7 percent between 2010 and 2015, while the region's economy grew 12 percent. In April, Emanuel announced all of the city's public buildings will be powered by 100 percent renewable energy by 2025.Emanuel is among the more than 200 mayors nationwide who have pledged to honor the Paris Agreement regardless of the Trump administration's actions.",-1,http://abc7chicago.com/news/mayor-signs-order-committing-chicago-to-paris-agreement/2070575/
135,Emanuel,Rahm,chicago,"Follow @csteditorialsLast week we stood shoulder to shoulder with members of the Woodlawn community to celebrate the latest chapter in a story of neighborhood renewal and redevelopment.

We were at the corner of 61st and Cottage Grove to announce that Jewel has chosen to locate its newest store there – the first full-service grocery store to locate in Woodlawn since Hillman’s closed more than 40 years ago.

The new grocery store will be more than a place to pick up fresh fruits and vegetables, although access to nutritious food is vital for healthy communities.

It will be more than a new employer of 250 people, although those jobs are important to the people who fill them and the families they support.

The new Jewel represents another vote of confidence in the future of Woodlawn, and a sign of the success of policies like the federal Choice Neighborhood Initiative and Chicago’s Neighborhood Now strategy that recognize housing without parks, schools, and transportation is just housing — not a neighborhood.

We are no longer relying on the failed “housing only” policies of the past, and our holistic Neighborhood Now approach is bearing fruit in Chicago communities from Woodlawn to Bronzeville, Belmont Cragin to Little Village, and Pullman to Englewood.

Where the private sector sees the investments the City of Chicago is making, they want to be part of it. Where investors see strong infrastructure and quality housing, they see a good bottom line. That is what they see in Woodlawn today, but the seeds of that success have been planted over time.

The City of Chicago and Preservation of Affordable Housing (POAH) have been working in close coordination with Woodlawn residents for many years.

When POAH was approached by the city and local Woodlawn residents to help redevelop Grove Parc Plaza, a three- block stretch of public housing that had fallen into disrepair, we not only saw the potential in Woodlawn, we saw a willing partner in the City of Chicago.

We won a $30.5 million federal Choice Neighborhood grant, and the POAH/City-led partnership turned that investment into $400 million in housing, stores and civic improvements, including more than 800 new units of mixed-income housing and more than 80,000 square feet of new commercial and retail space.

When we announced the new Jewel, we were standing inside MetroSquash, which opened in 2015 and is not just a new world-class athletic facility, but a new non-profit center for academic tutoring and mentoring. It is a safe space for students to go after school, and a community amenity that the whole neighborhood can access.

Up the street from MetroSquash will be the new Woodlawn Station, a mixed-use, mixed-income Transit Oriented Development adjacent to the Cottage Grove Green Line stop, which is also on the cusp of a major redevelopment.

Nearby, the University of Chicago is building a new charter school on 63rd Street that will open later this year, serving hundreds of students and increasing the vibrancy of the surrounding area. And no single development will do more to revitalize Woodlawn than the Obama Presidential Center in Jackson Park, which will break ground next year.

Expanding economic development also enhances public safety, and over the last five years violent crime in Woodlawn has dropped by 27 percent.

The transformation of Woodlawn would not have been possible without the block clubs and community groups, individuals and families who have worked for decades to bring about this historic resurgence.

That is why when we announced the new grocery store last week, while we gathered to welcome the developer, we were there to recognize and celebrate the wisdom and tenacity of the organizations and people who not only had a vision for a renewed Woodlawn but worked to make it happen.

A few days later, over lunch at the Robust Coffee Lounge on Woodlawn Avenue, I had a chance, as mayor, to celebrate another momentous milestone with Woodlawn residents. We not only talked about the success of the recent past, but continued planning for a shared vision of a brighter future.

It is a vision that is rapidly becoming a reality, and a Neighborhood Now success that is a model for community development across the city.

Rahm Emanuel was elected mayor of Chicago in 2011 and re-elected in 2015.

Bill Eager is president of Preservation of Affordable Housing, Chicago Area.

136,Emanuel,Rahm,time,"Reince Priebus and I don't share much beyond our Midwestern roots and unique names—and, of course, a love of politics. But we will always be in the small fraternity of those who answered a President's call to serve as White House chief of staff. In both our cases, we assumed the role at the beginning of a new Administration, after a contentious election and transfer of power. We started from scratch.

Chief of staff is the only White House job with two titles: chief and staff. The first allows for structure and accountability. The second, well, just remember whose name was on the ballot, check your ego at the door and understand you're there to serve the President and ensure that his—or, someday, her—vision is being executed.

When I had the role, I used to joke on Fridays, ""Lucky us, just two more workdays until Monday."" It's an all-consuming, thankless job—but walking through those gates at the beginning and end of each day, no matter how early or late, brings a tingle to your spine. The day that goes away is the day it's time to go.

137,Emanuel,Rahm,chicago,"Follow @csteditorialsOne-hundred years ago, my grandfather immigrated to the City of Chicago. He was just 13 years old. He had no money. He spoke no English. He knew no one, except for a third-cousin he had never met. He came to Chicago to escape anti-Semitism and the pogroms of Eastern Europe. He found a city where, if you work hard and play by the rules, you can succeed — regardless of your faith or national origin. He found work as a truck driver and meat cutter, and his children would go on to find success as a police officer and a nurse.

A century later, the hatred my grandfather was fleeing is on the rise. Synagogues are being vandalized. Fliers using the same propaganda tactics employed by the Nazis in the 1930’s are being placed around college campuses. Jewish cemeteries are being desecrated.

This is a moment across our country when it feels as if the common humanity and values that tie us together are unraveling. When a Jewish family can’t pray in peace, or Mexican-American parents are afraid to leave their homes to go shopping, or a Muslim woman has her hijab ripped from her head, or an African-American man and Indian-American couple are killed in attacks in just the last few weeks because of the color of their skin, our most fundamental American values and identity are under assault.

When the St. Louis, a ship of mostly Jewish European refugees, came to the shores of America in 1939, America’s moral voice fell silent. Hundreds of men, women and children were sent back to the horrors of a war-ravaged Europe. Today, too, we are living in a moral moment that requires a righteous response. We must stare down those whose mission is to create fear by responding with courage. We must stand up and speak out on behalf of any group that is marginalized and victimized, whether by institutions or by the narrow minds of cowardly individuals.

My grandfather came to a city of opportunity, not a country that breaks up families at the border. He came to a land of liberty, not a place where federal agents stop people on the street to ask for their papers. He came to a country that has prospered with each new generation of entrepreneurs, innovators and dreamers of every faith and nationality who have sought the promise of a better life in America.

When you enter Yad Vashem, the Holocaust museum in Jerusalem, you encounter a memorial honoring “The Righteous Among the Nations” — men and women of all faiths who stood up to the Nazis and saved people of the Jewish faith. We honor these individuals who gave up their comfort for the comfort of others, their safety for the safety of others, and their lives for the lives of others because of their courage.

Today, we must all be the righteous among the nations with the courage to speak out against the hatred and ugliness whirling around us, even if we are not personally the scapegoat de jure of would-be demagogues. We must ask ourselves if the St. Louis arrived on our shores tomorrow, filled with Syrian refugees or children from Guatemala, would we welcome its passengers with open hearts or turn our backs on those seeking safety and security in America?

Whether our families traveled across the Atlantic, the Pacific, the Rio Grande or up the Mississippi to arrive in this city, we are all equally Chicagoans and Americans and we share a common destiny that is bigger and brighter than the petty and misguided views of bigots and racists.

As a Jewish-American in public life, I have personally experienced my share of bigotry. But I know what defines the City of Chicago and the United States today is not the acts of hatred by a few, but the acts of love and generosity by the many. After the Loop Synagogue was vandalized, countless Chicagoans of every faith, color and nationality sent cards, flowers and raised reward money to track down the attacker. After a Jewish cemetery was desecrated in Philadelphia, Christians, Muslims and atheists came together to clean it up.

When Mayor Sadiq Khan, the first Muslim mayor of London, visited Chicago recently, he joined me at my synagogue on the Sabbath. On that morning we were not divided by our faiths, but united in our common prayers and dreams as fathers for our children.

That is the true definition of America. It is a definition that was captured clearly in a photograph at O’Hare Airport after the Trump administration’s first, unsuccessful attempt to enact a ban on Muslims attempting to enter the U.S. Two fathers, one Muslim and one Jewish, stood smiling with their children on their shoulders. They held signs calling for peace and empathy, and against hatred and religious discrimination. That is the picture of the Chicago and the America I know — the shining city and nation my grandfather sought refuge in a century ago.

Rahm Emanuel, the first Jewish mayor of Chicago, was elected in 2011 and re-elected in 2015.

139,Emanuel,Rahm,chicago,"CHICAGO (CBS) — Caterpillar moving its corporate headquarters out of Peoria to Chicago is a tremendous blow to the town where the giant manufacturer was born.

In many ways, Caterpillar Inc. is the very heart of Peoria. But as the company became a worldwide manufacturing power, it’s headquarters location became an increasing liability for its globe-trotting executives.

“The ability as our city to get anywhere in the world for a company like Caterpillar, anywhere in the U.S., is a tremendous economic advantage for us,” said Mayor Rahm Emanuel.

But most Caterpillar employees already in Peoria will stay put.

“We will maintain a significant presence in the Peoria area, said Caterpillar Spokesman Rachel Potts. “Those more than 12,000 people here today will likely by and large not be relocating.”

Still, a new headquarters building, announced just two years ago, and planned for downtown Peoria, won’t be built, which may come as a stinging blow to Peoria’s pride.

“I think its a tragedy for Peoria and the end of an amazing era,” said John Tillman, from the Illinois Policy Institute.

However, the Chicago area lands what might be Illinois’ best-known company around the world.

Its bright yellow tractors helped build the golden gate bridge, as well as roads around the globe from Mexico to India.

It remains to be seen where exactly Caterpillar’s executives intend to set up shop.

“We’re going to talk to them about what their plans ares, but know already today, over the last year, Caterpillar his moved people into the Merchandise Mart for the city of Chicago,” Mayor Emanuel said.

The construction machinery and equipment company hasn’t indicated whether its moving to Chicago or to the suburbs. In either case, the headquarters move is expected to be completed by the end of the year.",-1,http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2017/01/31/peoria-takes-a-hit-as-caterpillar-moves-its-headquarters-to-chicago/
140,Emanuel,Rahm,chicago,"The scourge of gun violence that plagued Chicago in 2016 is unacceptable. It breaks the hearts of all who care about our great city. Over the past five years I have looked into the eyes of parents and grandparents in their homes who just lost a child to gun violence, and marveled at their strength to persevere. I have held their hands and as a father, can’t imagine their grief and pain. We as a city owe them a different future, so others don’t have to experience that loss.

Gun violence is our shared civic disgrace. Ending it is our shared civic duty.

OPINION

There is an understandable desire to pin 4,368 shootings on a single cause, in hopes we could identify a single cure. But the hard truth is, that much bloodshed has neither one cause nor one cure.

Lack of economic opportunity plays a significant role, but jobs alone will not put a stop to violence. Young people need positive role models in their lives to teach positive values, but caring adults are not enough to put gangs out of business. It would make a real difference if Illinois finally held criminals who break our gun laws accountable for their crimes by demanding certainty of justice, but even that by itself isn’t a cure-all. Each of these elements is part of the answer, and we must address them all – and then some.

Likewise, some suggest that police simply must “get tougher” in those communities where violence has become routine. If getting tougher means serious and certain prison sentences for gun crimes – as is the case in New York – then I agree, as do many in Chicago.

But anyone who thinks toughness alone will solve the problem hasn’t looked into the eyes of young men and women struggling with alienation. What they need is the sense that tomorrow will be better than today.

The flip side of this argument holds that long-standing societal ills – particularly generational poverty – are to blame, and if we solve that, we’ll solve crime. It’s undeniably true that decades of disinvestment in certain communities, compounded by segregation and blatant racial discrimination, produced a stubborn form of poverty that breeds hopelessness and diminishes us all. If you look at Pullman, Woodlawn or Bronzeville, you can see the impact jobs and economic growth – and ultimately hope and prosperity – have on reducing violence.

But if poverty were the driving factor behind gun violence, Chicago should have seen a reduction in violent crime – not an increase. Since 2011, we have experienced the largest drop in families in deep poverty of any major U.S. city – a decline of 22 percent.

Poverty and alienation alone cannot be blamed for someone killing without conscience. Think of Tyshawn Lee. A nine-year-old boy lured into an alley and executed for the crime of being the son of a rival gang member. Did poverty drive that depravity? No. That’s rooted in either a rejection of the values we share as human beings and those that allow our society to function — or from never having learned them in the first place. We have to acknowledge that there is evil in the world.

Parents have the primary responsibility, of course, to instill these values and provide for their children the kind of structure and guidance that will enable them to thrive. When parents fail to do this, someone else will fill that void. Will children learn their values from a parent, a teacher, a coach, a police officer or from the gang members on the street corner? In Chicago, we know the difference, and we are making mentoring universal for 8th, 9th and 10th grade young men in high crime neighborhoods. But at the end of the day, we will not have the level of public safety we all want without an engaged, proactive police department that has earned the trust of residents.

As we await the expected release of the Department of Justice’s report on the Chicago Police Department, and as we continue building on the reforms we have made over the past year, we have to learn the hard lessons seen in city after city since the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, MO. Baltimore had a record high murder rate in 2015, and 2016 was only marginally better. Memphis and Indianapolis had record highs in murders in 2016. And last year many other cities saw significant increases in murders: San Diego (82 percent), Austin (75 percent), Las Vegas (39 percent), San Antonio (49 percent), Dallas (27 percent), Chicago (57 percent) and more.

If the reforms we must, and will, make are seen as demonizing the police, the police will naturally become reactive. They’re only human. The clarity, certainty and standards they need to do their jobs will be lost, and the result will be more violence. That is not a recipe for success in our communities. The only winners in that case are the gangbangers and drug dealers.

Still, there’s no question that further reforms are needed and much work remains to restore trust. So as we continue this important work, we have to make the highest professional standards and proactive policing heads and tails of the same coin. And the standards we set must be supported by strong training, superior technology and – ultimately – a sense of trust.

Every resident I talk to, no matter what neighborhood they live in, wants more police who know their community. They want those officers to be active partners in reducing crime. They know what I know: police are not the problem when it comes to public safety, they are a critical part of the solution.

Our city’s struggle against gun violence doesn’t have one simple solution. It requires a comprehensive approach, addressing a wide range of factors in a wide variety of ways. What we can’t do is retreat to our corners, insist there is just one answer, and point fingers at each other. We are all Chicagoans, this is all our struggle, and we will overcome it by being honest about its breadth, and coming together to do our part.

In every part of the city I’ve never met a rookie cop or a senior officer who doesn’t support mentoring or summer jobs for our youth. I’ve never met a resident who doesn’t want a robust, engaged police presence in their neighborhood. I’ve never met a family grieving the loss of a loved one in who doesn’t want the certainty of punishment for dangerous criminals. We agree on more than we sometimes realize.

It’s these people – the people of Chicago – that inspire me and give me hope.

This fall I participated in a BAM circle at Morgan Park High School. Those young men, who had once been on the precipice of dropping out, now had pride in their eyes as they discussed which college they want to attend and how they were buckling down to study for their ACT tests. I stand in awe of Nate and Cleo Pendleton, who have taken their unimaginable loss and turned it into a point of action to prevent violence and keep other parents from experiencing their pain. I have spoken with those who have made mistakes in life, served their time and now have a new opportunity through jobs initiatives like CTA’s Second Chance Program. I have seen people like Alfonso Johnson, a CTA employee with two kids in college now, beam when they succeed and are promoted to bigger roles. You can’t help but be inspired for our future, and know that we can make a difference if we come together and hear each other.

So as we start 2017, let us resolve to join together to ensure that Chicago is not defined or limited by our struggle with gun violence. Instead, let us strive to make Chicago a place of hope, opportunity and security for all its residents, no matter who they are, where they live or what their circumstances are.",-1,http://chicago.suntimes.com/opinion/opinion-4368-shootings-have-neither-one-cause-nor-one-cure/

NEW YORK (WLS) -- Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel met with President-elect Donald Trump Wednesday in New York City.He said Trump asked for the meeting when the two had a phone conversation a few weeks ago, when they talked his White House transition. Emanuel was President Barack Obama's chief of staff and also worked in the Clinton administration.The mayor said they also talked about the growth of Chicago's community colleges and the gains made by students in Chicago Public Schools.""We're one of only three school districts in the entire United States whose 4th and 8th graders' math and reading went up,"" Emanuel said.Emanuel also said Chicago would remain a sanctuary city, despite Trump's promise to withhold federal funds from cities that protect undocumented immigrants from deportation.""They are trying to achieve the American Dream. No fault of their own, their parents came here. They are something we should hold up and embrace,"" Emanuel said.The mayor's office tweeted Wednesday a copy of a letter he hand-delivered to the Trump, urging the president-elect to continue DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, program.It ensures immigrants who came to the U.S. before the age of 16, and are currently involved in higher education or military service, will not be deported.That letter was signed by about 14 mayors of cities across the country, including St. Louis, Phoenix, Philadelphia and San Francisco.The president-elect had not yet responded to the tweet as of 11 a.m. Wednesday.The meeting took place on the same day Trump was named Time magazine's Person of the Year. The cover declared him the ""President of the Divided States of America.""In his Time interview, the president-elect appeared to soften his stance, saying: ""We're going to work something out that's going to make people happy and proud.""""You can't threaten to deport people and uproot them from the only home they've ever known and then go back (and) say well maybe we'll look at this,"" Rep.

146,Emanuel,Rahm,chicagobusiness,"While most Chicagoans have been focused on the unusually hot weather, the possibility that the Cubs will finally put an end to the curse of the billy goat and summer plans with their families, something significant happened last month regarding the future of our city. An Illinois judge issued a ruling that will protect health care reforms that save Chicago taxpayers nearly $100 million annually—a number that will grow going forward.

These reforms are central to an accomplishment that has been overlooked amid coverage of pension reform: The amount of tax dollars that the city spends on employee health care costs has remained flat since 2011.

That is not a misprint. Over the past five years, as health care costs have risen for public and private employers by a total of more than 25 percent across the country, Chicago's employee health care costs have been stable since I first took office.

This fact has contributed to Chicago's lowest structural deficit in 10 years at $137 million. If we had not achieved these health care savings, our deficit this year would be larger.

We accomplished this in part by working with labor to solve problems and reduce the burden on taxpayers.

First, we changed how we cover the cost of retiree health care. As part of our most recent collective bargaining agreements with police and firefighters, those who retire at age 55 will pay 2 percent of their annuity toward their health care costs beginning in 2017. The city is also transitioning most of its retirees onto public health care exchanges made possible by the Affordable Care Act or other private insurance plans.

These reforms are standard practice in the private sector, where many businesses struggle with health care costs that raise their prices and make it tough to compete. But most governments let taxpayers pick up the tab. We changed that here in Chicago.

We are continuing to work with our partners in organized labor to implement many common-sense reforms. Through collaboration, we have made changes from promoting the use of generic drugs as substitutes for more expensive brand-name medications to encouraging providers to use standard diagnostic lab tests at a much lower cost.

These changes will add up to significant savings over the long term and double down on the philosophy behind the employee wellness plan that we adopted in 2013: The best way to reduce health care costs is to prevent and manage diabetes, heart problems and other chronic illnesses.

Keeping our health care costs stable, along with the agreements we have reached to secure all four of Chicago's worker pension funds, means stronger finances for the city, allowing us to invest in the building blocks of Chicago's future.

Our work will continue. We have set a goal of keeping the city's health care costs flat for another year. There are more ways to improve quality of life while managing costs, and we will seek additional changes to our collective bargaining agreements to save taxpayers an additional $10 million or more annually.

Potential reforms include:

• Restructuring benefits for certain specialty-care procedures to ensure the use of providers with track records of delivering high-quality, cost-effective care with lower long-term costs.

• Ensuring that high-wage employees pay their fair share for their insurance coverage by lifting premium caps.

• Bringing the share of health care costs paid by new employees in line with the share borne by taxpayers, which has doubled since 2006.

Our changes in employee health care policies might not grab headlines since they stem from cooperation rather than confrontation. Nor do they fit into the familiar, but false, narrative that Chicago is facing financial doom.

But they do show that our city is making steady progress in confronting some of our toughest fiscal challenges, through patient negotiations, better management and meaningful reforms.

148,Emanuel,Rahm,wsj,"At the state and local level, leaders of both political parties are pursuing solutions to one of America’s most pressing problems: the high cost of college. As the Republican governor of Tennessee and the Democratic mayor of Chicago, we have both launched efforts to improve access to community college and to increase educational attainment. The results of both programs provide proof that it’s possible to find solutions for the country’s most pressing problems—even in this fraught political era.

Two years ago Tennessee launched the nation’s first statewide program to provide free access to community and technical college. Tennessee Promise offers last-dollar scholarships and volunteer mentors to high-school graduates, eliminating barriers to college access and success. The program didn’t require a tax increase, and an endowment funded by state-lottery revenue ensures its financial sustainability.

In 2015, more than 16,000 students attended college on a Promise scholarship. Enrollment for first-time freshmen at community colleges in Tennessee rose 25%, with Promise participants boasting an 81% retention rate. And for students who want to transfer to a four-year school after completing two years of community college, the Transfer Pathways program ensures course-credit alignment. This effectively cuts the cost of a bachelor’s degree in half.

Meantime, Chicago launched the STAR Scholarship, which makes community college free for seniors graduating from public schools with a B average or better. Ninety-four percent of participants were retained from their fall semester to the spring semester. This year, STAR Scholarship applications are up 29%.

More than half of STAR scholars are first-generation college students and first-generation Americans. Almost two-thirds are female.

149,Emanuel,Rahm,chicagobusiness,"When O'Hare International Airport was formally dedicated in 1963, President John F. Kennedy visited Chicago to call it an “extraordinary national asset.” At the time, the airport served approximately 16 million passengers with 426,000 flights per year.

More than 50 years later, O'Hare serves nearly 77 million passengers with more than 875,000 flights annually. The days of the 1950s airfield are long past, yet the need to modernize O'Hare remains.

With our vision set on renewing Kennedy's promise of keeping O'Hare a national asset, we are taking crucial steps to invest in the future of the airport and the city. Last week, we marked the latest chapter of this effort with the announcement that new gates, expanded and redesigned terminals and upgraded amenities—all supporting tens of thousands of jobs—are part of a multibillion-dollar capital investment program being designed and developed with our airline partners.

This investment—and the benefits it will bring passengers, airlines and Chicagoans—is part of our larger plan to ensure that O'Hare is a 21st century airport built for a 21st century economy. Called O'Hare 21, the city's multilayered plan to modernize the airport is born out of the idea that O'Hare must be a convenient travel option for the millions of passengers who pass through it each year, while continuing to serve as an economic driver for the city of Chicago long into the future.

While there is much work to be done, we've made significant progress bringing the vision of O'Hare 21 to reality.

In January, we announced a historic $1.3 billion investment at O'Hare, which includes a new international runway and other critical airfield projects. This investment will support more than 6,000 jobs, shorten the time passengers spend on the plane once they land, decrease airline costs and ensure that O'Hare has the newest and most efficient runway system in the country.

A few weeks later, American Airlines announced that it is adding five more gates at O'Hare, expanding the airport's capacity and representing another win for travelers. It also signaled the first gate expansion at O'Hare since 1993.",-1,http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20160721/OPINION/160729968/why-we-are-investing-so-much-at-ohare

157,Emanuel,Rahm,chicago,"Five months ago, I pledged to the residents of Chicago that we would do whatever it takes to rebuild public trust and restore accountability in the police department. My goal is to bring safety to every community though building trust in our police department. That requires creating a new system for police accountability and oversight.

Today I can announce that in the coming weeks, we will have the final details worked out on a comprehensive plan to fundamentally reshape our system of police accountability and it will be introduced at the following meeting of the full City Council on June 22. It will be based on the thoughtful suggestions made by my Police Accountability Task Force. It will also be informed by the conversations my administration is having with aldermen, community leaders, the U.S. Department of Justice and experts in the field. We want to make sure the police accountability system is trusted by the members of the Chicago Police Department and the residents of Chicago.

OPINION

The framework for the new structure was outlined in the Task Force’s reforms and is driven by core principles that lie at the heart of the police accountability: independence, integrity, transparency and citizen participation.

First, we will replace the Independent Police Review Authority with a new civilian investigative agency that has more independence and more resources to do its work. Under the leadership of Sharon Fairley, IPRA has taken important steps to reshape and improve its investigative efforts. But it is clear that a totally new agency is required to rebuild trust in investigations of officer-involved shootings and the most serious allegations of police misconduct. As we create this new civilian agency, the Police Board will continue to hear cases regarding those police officers who face allegations of serious misconduct, as required by Illinois state law.

Second, we will create a new Public Safety Inspector General to audit and monitor policing in Chicago. It will have authority to conduct regular audits of the Chicago Police Department as well as investigations completed by the new civilian oversight agency. The IG’s goal will be to identify and address emerging problems and trends in order to prevent acts of abuse from occurring in the first place. The office will be led by someone with impeccable credentials and credibility.

Third, we will create a new Community Safety Oversight Board – comprised of Chicago city residents – to oversee the city’s entire policy accountability system. Consistent with the Task Force’s recommendations, this board will hold public meetings and require regular public reporting from the Police Department, the new civilian investigative agency, Police Review Board and Public Safety Inspector General. It will also be empowered to request audits and make improvements. The new board will give a voice to Chicago residents whose lives are affected daily by police practices. It will also provide a forum for our Police Department to respond to concerns and share information. Public dialogue is essential to building a common understanding of how best to keep our communities safe.

I believe these guiding principles and key reforms will meet our goals for transforming Chicago’s police accountability structure and reflect the conversations and proposals that have been offered by aldermen to me. Ald. Ariel Reboyras and Ald. Willie B. Cochran are committed to working with our office and leading the Council on drafting an ordinance that reflects these principles.

This plan represents the second installment of the original down payment that we announced days after the Task Force published its report. The first installment focused on technology, transparency and training. This second installment is focused on accountability and oversight. And it is just one part of the city’s work to restore trust between police and communities.

As the Justice Department continues its review into Chicago police practices, they have identified urgent issues to address. The Task Force recently added its own recommendations. We must address the concerns of both, as well as those issues we have identified through our continuing engagement with the community. Some of those issues can and have been addressed immediately — from expanding body-worn cameras, to purchasing Tasers, to making sure more police are certified in Crisis Intervention Training. Other reforms will take longer and will require leadership and sustained effort as we make important changes — like those I’ve outlined — and work to make them permanent.

Our goal has been to act quickly wherever possible but also to commit to the hard work to ensure all of our reforms will stand the test of time. As this process continues, we will issue quarterly reports so we can all be held accountable.

While much work still remains, we will continue to make significant strides on the road to reform. To fully fix Chicago’s police accountability system, we must be thoughtful and bold and have the courage to call out and address the root causes that have eroded trust between police and Chicago’s communities and some of Chicago’s residents.

We will be judged by whether our actions truly measure up to the demands of the moment. I am confident that by creating this new structure and committing to this comprehensive plan, Chicago will be better off because we are facing up to these difficult challenges and we are doing so together.

Rahm Emanuel is serving his second term as mayor of Chicago.

CHICAGO (WLS) -- The wife of ""Star Wars"" creator George Lucas said Tuesday afternoon that they are ""seriously pursuing locations outside Chicago"" to construct a Lucas museum.Mellody Hobson's statement follows statements by the Friends of the Park, a nonprofit suing to stop plans for a lakefront museum by the Chicago Bears' stadium, that indicated it will oppose any plan to build the museum east of Lake Shore Drive.Hobson, president of Chicago-based Ariel Investments, said the process of identifying a location has been ""co-opted and hijacked by a small special interest group.""Hobson's full statement read:Friends of the Park had opposed the Soldier Field location, arguing it violates lakefront-development restrictions, and filed a lawsuit. The city had asked a federal judge to stay the litigation for 30 days, and the group had agreed. The city then proposed putting the $400 million art museum where part of the McCormick Place convention complex now stands ""I don't want to see people go see the Lucas Museum in Los Angeles or San Francisco. I want them to come to the city of Chicago. Create the jobs here, the cultural and educational enrichment here,"" Mayor Rahm Emanuel said Monday.Late Tuesday, the city said it had withdrawn its 30-day stay request.McCormick Place is also by the lake, but construction would involve replacing existing structures, not building where nothing currently stands.""We do have many folks in our midst that would love to see the McCormick Place East building go, but we don't think that should happen in trade for another building being built on the lakefront,"" said Juanita Irizarry, executive director of Friends Of The Parks.Friends of the Park would like the city to come up with a third proposed location, indicating that they would like to see the museum built on the site of the former Michael Reese Hospital.""Geographically, it's not really that far from the sites that have been discussed, and it doesn't mean that tourists can't get there. And it would be a great way for folks in Bronzeville and other folks who need jobs to have jobs right there,"" Irizarry said.Shannon Breymaier, a city spokeswoman said: ""We're disappointed and baffled at Friends of the Parks' comments, which are contradictory to the decision they made less than 24 hours ago to stay the lawsuit. Friends of the Parks has taken inconsistent and incoherent positions, making it impossible to work with them.""Father Michael Pfleger, of St. Sabina, was also critical. He said, ""What's the real issue? What is the real issue of this elitist group? What are they really against? And who the hell are they to make the decisions that control Chicago?""Rev. Jesse Jackson, of the Rainbow PUSH Coalition, said in a statement Tuesday that he is sadden by the Friends of the Park's decision to oppose the proposed project, also noting the significance of the role of Hobson - an African American woman from Chicago.""We share the zeal of the Friends of the Parks to protect our cherished green space and lakefront. But the Rainbow PUSH Coalition is making a moral appeal to the Friends of Parks to reconsider its opposition to a project that will bring so much to Chicago. The Lucas Museum will add nearly 13 more acres of green space on our beloved lakefront. If necessary, we too will be in the courts and the streets, arguing for this once-in-a generation opportunity. In the history of our country there has never been a philanthropic gift of this size and scale from an African American, in this case an African American woman from Chicago. As I said before, it is time to stop the obstruction and start the construction.""",-1,http://abc7chicago.com/news/group-opposing-lucas-museum-oks-stay-skeptical-of-new-site/1320367/

CHICAGO—Mayor Rahm Emanuel, known for keeping vise-like control over Chicago and his own political image, finds himself in the weakest position of his long public career as he struggles to respond to a police scandal, claims of cover-ups at City Hall, and calls for his resignation.

But the former White House chief of staff has said repeatedly that he will not step down.

The nation’s third-largest city has no process for a mayor to be recalled. And most of the cries for Emanuel to resign have come from grassroots activists and residents, not from the city’s political powerbrokers. The next election—should he seek another term—isn’t until 2019.

No citizen is a second-class citizen in the city of Chicago. — Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel

On Wednesday, Dec. 9, the mayor used a special meeting of the Chicago City Council to try to calm the firestorm, apologizing for the fatal shooting of a black teen by a white officer and promising “complete and total” reform.

“I take responsibility for what happened because it happened on my watch. And if we’re going to fix it, I want you to understand it’s my responsibility with you,” Emanuel said during a sometimes-emotional speech that lasted nearly 45 minutes. “But if we’re also going to begin the healing process, the first step in that journey is my step.

“And I’m sorry.”

The remarks were Emanuel’s lengthiest and seemingly most heartfelt since the public got its first look last month at the squad car video that showed 17-year-old Laquan McDonald veering away from officer Jason Van Dyke before he began shooting, hitting McDonald 16 times. Van Dyke is charged with first-degree murder.

Critics have repeatedly accused him of keeping the footage under wraps until after he won a tougher-than-expected spring election for a second term. The mayor has denied the claim and acknowledged Wednesday that he should have pressed for prosecutors to wrap up their investigation sooner so the video could be made public.

But his contrition did little to ease the anger in the streets. Hours after the speech, protesters overflowed an intersection in front of City Hall, then marched through the financial district and blocked a major intersection for a short time as police directed traffic around them. Officers guarded the doors to the Chicago Board of Trade as demonstrators approached.

Outside City Hall, retired schoolteacher Audrey Davis carried a sign reading, “Mayor Emanuel is morally corrupt!”

Calling the speech “politically expedient,” Davis said, “I don’t want to hear anything from him except, ‘I tender my resignation.'”

Davis, who is black, said she fears for her 25-year-old grandson when he comes home from college.

“Each time he comes home, my heart is in my throat in case he meets up with a racist cop,” Davis said. “We shouldn’t have to live like this.”

Since the video emerged, Emanuel has scrambled to contain the crisis. He fired his police superintendent after days of insisting the chief had his support. He also reversed course on whether the Justice Department should launch a civil-rights investigation, saying he would welcome it only after presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and other top Democrats endorsed the idea.

In news conferences, he has appeared worn down, fumbling answers to reporters’ questions or avoiding them entirely by walking away, with cameras rolling.

“I don’t think I’ve ever seen him grapple with anything quite like this,” said longtime ally and adviser David Axelrod, who also served with Emanuel in the Obama White House.

Axelrod said Emanuel worked on the speech all weekend, with input from him and others. But he said the speech alone isn’t what matters.

“You don’t earn trust back with one speech,” Axelrod said. “You earn trust back with actions.”

The most likely effect of the crisis will come in the form of pushback from aldermen, who have long been considered a rubber stamp for the mayor’s initiatives, said political consultant Delmarie Cobb. She said the black community “has been awakened,” and Emanuel can expect a tougher re-election if he tries again.

“He definitely won’t run unopposed, and it will be a viable candidate,” said Cobb, who is black.

The mayor won re-election in April by a healthy margin, but only after suffering the embarrassment of not getting a majority in a five-candidate February election, forcing the first mayoral runoff in decades.

At the time, he pledged to listen more and to “bridge the gaps between the things that divide us.”

In the months that followed, his public schools CEO, who oversaw closings of about 50 schools that angered many residents, was indicted on corruption charges. Emanuel also pushed through the largest tax increase in city history to deal with a budget crisis.

His administration has warned of massive mid-year layoffs in the public schools and is in the midst of rocky contract negotiations with the Chicago Teachers Union. This week, union members are voting on whether to authorize a strike. They could hit the picket lines as early as March.",-1,http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/1916241-chicago-mayor-apologizes-for-2014-shooting-vows-reforms/
172,Emanuel,Rahm,usatoday,"Rahm Emanuel

The shooting of Laquan McDonald was horrendous. His family deserves justice, and every Chicagoan deserves fundamental changes in how our police officers are held accountable for any abuses they commit. The systemic issues that this incident highlights will not be solved overnight, but I am fully committed to ensuring there is significant, real, and sustained, long-term reform.

Within hours of the shooting, the city’s investigation began and within days, the city turned the video over to prosecutors to investigate and bring appropriate charges. Protecting the integrity of those investigations was critical. That is why the video was not made public. Nobody anticipated that they would take more than a year.

When a judge ruled last month that the videotape should be made public, we complied. Shortly before the tape’s release, the state’s attorney brought charges of first-degree murder against police officer Jason Van Dyke.

When the tape was released, people were outraged — and rightly so. There is no excuse for the actions of that officer. And, I understand people’s frustration that it took more than a year to bring charges.

We welcome a U.S. Justice Department investigation of our police department. But fundamental change does not need to wait. Next year, police officers serving one-third of our city will be wearing body cameras, which should reduce incidents of excessive force as well as unfounded complaints.

Chicago inquiry more than justified: Our view

I’ve also appointed a Task Force on Police Accountability to push significant reform in our police department and discipline system. The task force will scrutinize everything from training and monitoring officers, to crafting a protocol for the timely release of police videotapes, to ensuring the integrity of our investigations. It is empowered to offer fundamental changes, and I am committed to implementing them.

The shooting of Laquan McDonald was indefensible. We cannot let anything like it ever happen again. As mayor, I am committed to fixing our broken system and holding our police and my administration to the highest standards. That way, Laquan’s death will not have been in vain.

By Rahm Emanuel

The following is an op-ed written by Mayor Rahm Emanuel and submitted by the city in a news release Saturday.

Chicago is facing a defining moment on the issues of crime and policing and the even larger issues of truth and justice. To meet this moment, we need to conduct a painful but honest reckoning of what went wrong — not just in one instance, but over decades. Then we need to determine what to do differently to ensure that incidents like this don’t happen again.



We cannot afford to have any resident of our city living in fear of the police and distrusting their words and actions. And we cannot allow the crimes of a small number of officers to taint the good work of the vast majority who put their lives on the line every day.



What happened last October 2014 on South Pulaski Road should never have happened. Systems should have been in place to prevent it. Supervision and leadership at every level of the police department and the oversight agencies should have come into play.

READ MORE: New Laquan McDonald Documents Show Police Accounts Contradict Video



They didn’t, and that has to change.



What I strongly reject is the suggestion that the videotape of the McDonald shooting was withheld from the public because of the election. Here are the facts:



The videotape was handled in precisely the same way such tapes and evidence have been historically. Longstanding practice has been to release such material only after prosecutors and city investigators have finished their investigation. The reason for that was to prevent potential witnesses from tailoring their stories to fit the evidence.



Some say I should have ordered a departure from standard procedure and released the tape before the prosecutors had acted. Had I seen the video, I might have done that. But I don’t review evidence precisely because my own emotions should not interfere with criminal investigations.



The release of this type of evidence is one of many issues we need to rethink moving forward. How do we balance concerns against prematurely releasing evidence and jeopardizing prosecutions with the community’s right to see such material in a timely way? How do we promote accountability and transparency, without sacrificing one for the other?



In this case, the city followed its standard policy.



Within nine days of that shooting the city collected all evidence in the case, including the dash-cam video, and turned it over to prosecutors. No one could have predicted that it would take more than a year to finish the probe. It was just as likely that charges would be filed during the campaign, in which case the video would have become public before the election.

RELATED: Chicago Police Supt. Garry McCarthy Fired By Rahm: 'He Has Become An Issue'



At the end of the day, I am the mayor and I own it. I take responsibility for what happened and I will fix it. Nothing less than complete and total reform of the system and the culture will meet the standards we have to set for ourselves.



I know the history of police-community relations in Chicago. I am the mayor who agreed to provide reparations and bring important closure to the victims of Jon Burge and police torture in Chicago. I am the mayor who has committed to restoring community policing, because the only way to fight crime effectively is to build trust between officers and the residents they serve. I am the mayor who instituted body camerasfor police, to reduce incidents of police misconduct as well as unfounded complaints.



So I should have known that in the light of the checkered history of misconduct in the Chicago Police Department, that the long delay in releasing the videotape could raise concerns and suspicions across our city. Our goal was to protect the integrity of the investigation. But instead of establishing trust, the prolonged period between when the shooting occurred and when charges were filed created mistrust.

We need to fix that and restore the trust that was lost.



Some have alleged that our settlement with Laquan’s family was part of a cover-up. But nothing could be further from the truth. It was the lawyers for Laquan’s family who approached the city on February 27 and expressed a desire to settle the case quickly and without a lawsuit. The city’s lawyers began discussions with the plaintiff’s attorney shortly thereafter and came to an agreement in principle on March 24.

RELATED: Laquan McDonald Protesters Take 16 Laps Around City Hall



As part of that agreement lawyers for the family and the city sought to present the settlement for approval at the next City Council meeting, which was on April 15. The first possible opportunity to present the agreement to the Council’s Finance Committee was on April 13. At that meeting, our Corporation Counsel, Steve Patton, explained why a settlement was in the city’s best interest. Among the main reasons was the police dash-cam videotape, which he described in detail.



If there is any good to come out of this horrific incident, it has caused us to re-examine how we handle cases of police misconduct and excessive force in Chicago. And I’m committed to making the changes our city desperately needs.



If any good comes from this tragedy, it should be a historic set of reforms that prevents abuses, promotes transparency and rebuilds the confidence of all Chicagoans that they will be treated fairly. That is the marker I am setting for myself, the next police superintendent and the reform commission I’ve appointed. And it’s one by which I expect to be measured.

175,Emanuel,Rahm,huffingtonpost,"One of the ways that we are empowering small businesses in Chicago is through a partnership between Harold Washington College and Goldman Sachs that gives entrepreneurs access to the 10,000 Small Businesses program. Harold Washington College has a focus on business, entrepreneurship and professional services; thanks to this program, small-business owners enrolled at the college are receiving advice that is normally reserved for the Fortune 500 companies. I had the opportunity to meet with several graduates from the 10,000 Small Businesses program as we celebrated the Chicago alumni recently; seeing the impact it's had on those entrepreneurs, I am so proud that this program has come to Chicago and even prouder of the progress that it is making.

A recent report from Babson College found that more than 70 percent of the Chicago small-business owners who graduated from this program have increased their revenue, and 50 percent have created new jobs. Both of those rates outpace what you see in the broader economy. But more important than the statistics are the success stories that come from each class. John Griffin Jr., who owns an investigative services company in our Chatham neighborhood on the South Side, graduated from the first class. His company has seen tremendous growth, and John recently received the Illinois Small Business Person of the Year Award for 2015. Laurie Kohl, who graduated from the program in 2013, was also recognized for her success at another awards ceremony held just this month. Laurie leads a company that makes software to help building owners and property managers comply with regulations for elevators and other mechanical devices. She has recently increased her workforce by 86 percent and her revenue by more than 250 percent. I know that there are many more success stories waiting to be written about courageous entrepreneurs who are pursuing their dreams in neighborhoods throughout our city. That is why the 10,000 Small Businesses program is only one piece of our larger strategy to level the playing field for our small businesses and to make City Hall a partner in their success. Over the past four years, city officials have made a host of reforms to remove bureaucratic barriers to businesses' success, so they can focus on customers rather than City Hall. This includes everything from eliminating the per employee head tax, to consolidating business licenses, to making our small-business department entirely paperless by the end of 2016. We also created a microlending program to provide financing to entrepreneurs who need loans that are beyond the reach of their credit cards, but not enough for a bank to be interested. Recently we also announced our new Small Business Council, tasked with developing even more reforms going forward. It will help small businesses address challenges they face, from further reducing red tape to increasing their access to capital.",-1,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rahm-emanuel/rahm-emanuel-chicago-small-businesses_b_8483318.html

SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Airman 1st Class Spencer Stone, who helped stop a terror attack on a French train over the summer, was stabbed and seriously wounded Thursday in a fight outside a bar -- the latest tragedy to befall him and his buddies since they returned home as heroes.

On Thursday, Stone, 23, was stabbed repeatedly in the upper body outside a nightclub in a neighborhood in his hometown of Sacramento in what police described as an alcohol-related fight that had nothing to do with terrorism. He was listed in stable condition at UC Davis Medical Center, and officials said he was expected to survive.

Police searched for the two assailants, who fled in a car, and said there is no evidence they knew who he was.

""This incident is not related to terrorism in any way,"" Deputy Police Chief Ken Bernard said. Bernard said the fight was ""related to a nightclub incident"" involving Stone's circle and a second group, but he would not say what sparked the argument.

Police said they do not know whether the Travis Air Force Base airman was drinking, but others in his group were. In a statement, the hospital said Stone's family ""appreciates the outpouring of love and support"" and requests privacy.

Ex-schools chief faces fraud case

CHICAGO -- The former chief executive of Chicago Public Schools has been indicted on charges that she was involved in a scheme to steer $20 million worth of no-bid contracts to education companies in exchange for bribes and kickbacks.

Barbara Byrd-Bennett, who resigned earlier this year as leader of the nation's third-largest school district, ""takes full responsibility for her conduct,"" Chicago-based lawyer Michael Scudder said in a statement. Scudder said Byrd-Bennett would plead guilty and will continue to cooperate with the government, including testifying if called upon to do so.

Byrd-Bennett, 66, who was appointed by Mayor Rahm Emanuel in 2012, stepped down during a federal investigation into a contract between the district and SUPES Academy, a training academy where she once worked as a consultant.

Byrd-Bennett is charged with several counts of mail and wire fraud that each carry maximum 20-year prison sentences. U.S. attorney Zachary Fardon said the indictment accuses her of ""abusing her power to line her own pockets and those of her co-defendants.""

SUPES Academy and a related company, Synesi Associates LLC, also are charged, as are their owners, Gary Soloman and Thomas Vranas. Both men are charged with bribery and conspiracy to defraud, along with mail and wire fraud.

Memphis' mayor says election lost

MEMPHIS -- Incumbent A C Wharton Jr. has conceded defeat in Memphis' mayoral election.

Wharton's loss Thursday means City Council member Jim Strickland becomes the first white mayor in the majority-black city in nearly a quarter-century.

Wharton's concession at a campaign event came before complete results for the nonpartisan election were posted. Election officials reported a technical glitch in disseminating results to the public. Totals that had been reported Thursday night showed Strickland with a lead.

Strickland couldn't immediately be reached for comment.

Wharton was first elected as the city's mayor in 2009. He had sought another chance to work on repairing problems such as crime, poverty, blight and the city's troubled financial situation.

181,Emanuel,Rahm,usnews,"By MICHAEL TARM and SOPHIA TAREEN, Associated Press

CHICAGO (AP) — The former CEO of Chicago Public Schools plans to plead guilty to corruption charges announced Thursday that allege she helped steer more than $23 million worth of no-bid contracts to education companies in exchange for hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes and kickbacks.

Barbara Byrd-Bennett, who resigned earlier this year as leader of the nation's third-largest school district, ""takes full responsibility for her conduct,"" said her lawyer, Michael Scudder.

He said she would plead guilty at a later date to charges in the indictment, which also accuses the companies' owners of offering Byrd-Bennett a job and one-time payment — disguised as a lucrative signing bonus — once she left CPS, which is facing a steep budget shortfall and a severely underfunded pension system.

""If you only join for the day, you will be the highest paid person on the planet for that day,"" one of the executives wrote in an email to Byrd-Bennett about the bonus, according to the indictment.

The indictment alleges that Byrd-Bennett expected to receive kickbacks worth 10 percent of the value of the no-bid contracts, or about $2.3 million. It's unclear how much money was set aside, though the indictment says two trust accounts tied to her relatives — identified only as Relatives A and B — were set up to help hide the money.

Prosecutors allege the scheme started in 2012, the same year Mayor Rahm Emanuel chose her to become CEO of the nation's third largest school district. Rahm released a statement Thursday saying he was ""saddened and disappointed to learn about the criminal activity"" that led to the indictment.

""Our students, parents, teachers and principals deserve better,"" the Democrat said.

Byrd-Bennett, 66, is charged with several counts of mail and wire fraud; each count carries a maximum 20-year prison sentences. U.S. attorney Zachary Fardon said the indictment accuses her of ""abusing her power to line her own pockets and those of her co-defendants.""

The longtime educator stepped down from the post about four months ago, amid a federal investigation into a contract between the district and SUPES Academy, a training academy where she once worked as a consultant.

The company's owners, Gary Soloman and Thomas Vranas, are accused of offering her money — including plotting to place $127,000 into each of the two accounts set up under her relatives' names — along with sporting event tickets and other kickbacks in exchange for the contracts.

In emails included in the indictment, Solomon and Vranas appear to discuss payments to Byrd-Bennett. Vranas is quoted in one saying, ""Everyone sucks and is greedy."" In an email sent to Soloman on Sept. 10, 2012, Byrd-Bennett wrote: ""I have tuition to pay and casinos to visit.""

Both suburban Chicago men are charged with bribery and conspiracy to defraud, along with mail and wire fraud. The indictment also charges SUPES Academy and a subsidiary, Synesi Associates LLC, which specialize in training principals and school administrators.

Soloman's attorney released a statement saying Soloman has cooperated in the investigation and stands behind his companies' training and service. The statement says Solomon has acknowledged ""certain errors"" in judgment, but that he's disappointed he was charged.

Vranas and his attorney didn't immediately return calls for comment.

CPS suspended its contract with SUPES Academy and confirmed it had been subpoenaed shortly after Byrd-Bennett announced she was taking a paid leave of absence in April, about two months before she resigned.

The federal investigation followed a tough re-election bid for Emanuel, who spent much of his time on the campaign trail defending his decisions to close dozens of schools in 2013 and to choose Byrd-Bennett to lead the district with an annual salary was $250,000. At the time, Emanuel said he was proud of his choice of Byrd-Bennett.

He agreed to a private meeting which lasted about 30 minutes. City Hall released a statement afterwards that says, ""The mayor appreciates there are strong feelings about Dyett, and he understands there is a desire for a quick resolution about its future, however what's most important is the right decision.

The mayor, along with Forrest, is committed to an open dialogue with community stakeholders as CPS works toward a final decision on this issue. Everyone deserves to have their voice heard, which is why the mayor offered to hold the meeting tonight, it's why he has met with community leaders regarding Dyett in the past, and it's why city leaders from the mayor's office and CPS will continue to have an open dialogue on this issue moving forward.""The second public budget forum will take place Wednesday at the South Shore Cultural Center, and the third will be held Thursday at Wright College.",-1,http://abc7chicago.com/politics/mayor-emanuel-to-host-public-meeting-on-city-budget/964315/
185,Emanuel,Rahm,chicagobusiness,"Throughout my years in public service, I have believed that protecting our environment is not just our responsibility to our children, it's also a smart investment in our economic future.

Recently, President Barack Obama released the final version of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Power Plan, which calls on states to reduce energy plants' emissions 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. The president's leadership on this issue provides us an opportunity to protect future generations and help businesses and residents save money on their utility bills while creating jobs here in Chicago.

Since the beginning of my administration, Chicago has led the way in clean energy. Our Retrofit Chicago partnership has upgraded over 20,000 residential units in the past three years, creating huge savings for renters and homeowners. Our Commercial Buildings Initiative encompasses almost 40 million square feet, among the nation's largest voluntary private-sector efficiency programs. The result: We reduced carbon dioxide emissions by 28,000 metric tons, the equivalent of removing 5,800 cars from the road, and saved $2.5 million in energy costs.

In February I stood with business, environmental and labor leaders to announce a clean energy framework for Illinois that meets the president's call to action and will generate more than $400 million a year in new investment in Chicago, creating thousands of jobs annually.

The Illinois Clean Jobs Bill would boost Illinois' renewable energy requirements to 35 percent by 2030, while increasing energy-efficiency goals to 20 percent by 2025. It also would create a state “cap and invest” system similar to what was original proposed by the Obama administration during my time as chief of staff.

The Clean Jobs bill not only creates jobs—it would save customers $1.6 billion by 2030, according to the Citizens Utility Board, amounting to nearly $100 annually for the average household.

The bill also would create new community solar programs, incentivize the productive use of our brownfield sites and require a share of clean energy come from low-income and affordable housing.

We have the opportunity to expand on Chicago's role as a leader in clean energy; we know that the payoff would be considerable. What we need are policies at the federal and state level to build on our efforts. The president has done his part. I urge the Illinois General Assembly to do theirs by supporting the U.S. Clean Power Plan and Illinois Clean Jobs Bill.",-1,http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20150806/OPINION/150809911/rahm-emanuel-clean-energy-clean-jobs-for-chicago

It never came.The mayor and Interim CPS CEO Jesse Ruiz outlined on Wednesday who would be laid off and where cuts would be made.Ruiz said most of the 1,400 jobs cut were in administration and special education programs. Very few teachers were laid off. Funding for elementary sports teams was cut, the facility maintenance budget was reduced 25 percent and highs schools are starting 45 minutes later. The mayor said schools will open on time in the fall and class sizes will not be affected.""I think paying more into a fund when I've been contributing into the fund with integrity, and (we're) the only group that has done so in the past 20 years, I think it's ridiculous to ask us to pay more,"" said Crain Cleve, a CPS teacher.""I feel like I do really well at my job and I work really hard, I'm not looking to take a pay cut,"" said Karen Trine, a CPS high school teacher.""We owe our teachers, our kids and our families, better,"" Emanuel said. He outlined two plans on how to tackle the pension problem.Option ""A"" would be for state lawmakers to create one pension system statewide. Right now, Chicago residents are taxed twice. They pay for Chicago teachers' pensions, as well as suburban and downstate teachers. Option ""B"" is what Emanuel calls an ""all in"" approach: ask Springfield to boost funding, make teachers contribute more to pension costs, and increase property taxes.The CTU is against asking teachers to pay, but would like to see targeted tax increases.""They can declare a TIF surplus, which would bring in tens of millions of dollars, they can work with us and go down to the Illinois legislature and talk about things like a LaSalle Street tax, which would bring in tens of billions of dollars, they can talk about a graduated tax,"" said Michael E. Brunson, Chicago Teachers Union recording secretary.Teachers have paid into the pension fund. CPS has not and now it's coming back to haunt the city. For years, the district took what they called pension holidays, skipping payments to fund other things.""The reason CPS was doing this because the state was providing inadequate funding to educate children, they didn't want to go after property tax, so let's borrow what we owe the pension system,"" said Ralph Martire, Center for Tax and Budget Accountability.Martire says for years, the city used the teachers' pension fund as a credit card, but the state constitution says pensions must be fully funded, and the time has come to pay it back.""We are going to keep fighting, we need to come up with revenue solutions, we are out of money,"" said Kristine Mayley, Chicago Teachers Union.""We agree that these cuts are painful and intolerable - and we wouldn't be here if Springfield were prioritizing education funding.

194,Emanuel,Rahm,preaprez,"Photo montage of Rahm at Wicker Park incident: Kenzo Shibata.

– By Matt Ginsberg-Jaeckle as posted on the Mental Health Movement’s Facebook page.

Mental Health Movement members Debbie Delgado and Matt Ginsberg-Jaeckle just confronted Rahm face-to-face about his mental health clinic closures. Rahm was about to address a small room of developers and residents at the Wicker Park field-house. 3 years after he closed half of Chicago’s public mental health clinics, he may have thought the issue had gone away. But then Debbie, sitting in the front row, a few feet from the mayor, stood up to tell her story. She told of losing her son to gun violence.

She told him how her other son was holding him as he died. She told about how the city’s Northwest Mental Health Clinic in Logan Square saved their lives, helped her and her son deal with the PTSD and depression.

Then she asked why he took that clinic away from her. Why he closed a clinic and now a bar sits in that space. Why he closed five other mental health clinics. Why he thought she would be able to travel an extra hour past three cemeteries to get to the clinic she was supposed to be transferred to without having an anxiety attack on the way. Why he has left her with no options. Why he has left her with her son closed in, barely leaving the house anymore, refusing to see a new therapist since Rahm Emanuel took away their clinic.

After trying to keep his cool, he told us that he would speak to us after the event in a separate room. There, we saw the Real Rahm.

Now off camera, Rahm’s voice raised, his demeanor changed, in no time he was shouting in Matt’s face, nose-to-nose “YOU’RE GONNA RESPECT ME!”

He corrected Rahm’s faulty statistics, saying that no, psychiatric services were not expanded, that in fact the city cut $2.3 million by closing 6 clinics and only redistributed $500,000 of that to private clinics and that those clinics have only seen a couple hundred additional people, whereas 3,000 people are unaccounted for since he announced the closure of those mental health clinics.

The Real Rahm accused Debbie and Matt of “creating a circus in there,” to which we responded that two close friends – Mental Health Movement heros Jeannette Hanson and Helen Morley – had lost their lives because of his decision to close their clinics, that there is nothing humorous to us about what we did in there, that we had tried since months before the clinic closures to meet with him, that Helen (who was looking at Rahm from Debbie’s t-shirt) had shouted to him “If you close my clinic I will die” only to die a month after he ignored those shouts.

When Rahm told Debbie he is going to have the new Commissioner of Public Health personally find her a new mental health clinic to go to, she said “this isn’t about me, this is about all of us, about the movement, about the south and west sides of the city that don’t have mental health now. Don’t try to just fix my situation, re-open all of our clinics.”

He had his PR guy take our number and left, unable to respond. This is the Real Rahm. Calm and collected in public, raging angry and self-defensive behind closed doors.

The only people in the room were two PR staff, two body guards, us and the man that closed half of Chicago’s public mental health clinics – Rahm Emanuel.",-1,https://preaprez.wordpress.com/2015/03/05/rahm-screams-at-mental-health-activists-youre-gonna-respect-me/

196,Emanuel,Rahm,preaprez,"Illinois Federation of Teachers President Dan Montgomery at 2011 protest in front of the Chicago Hyatt Regency. UniteHere Local 1 member and Hyatt housekeeper speaks to a crowd of union supporters.

– In These Times has published my post.

In the winter of 2011, I was running as a delegate to the annual Representative Assembly (RA) of the Illinois Education Association (IEA), the largest teacher union in the state. The 1,000 delegates to the state’s RA had long met at the Hyatt Regency O’Hare in Rosemont. Running as a union delegate in 2011, my platform was simple and concise: “If the IEA RA is held at the Hyatt Regency O’Hare, don’t vote for me because I won’t attend. I don’t cross picket lines.”

UNITE HERE Local 1, who represents the housekeepers and other employees of the Hyatt Hotel chain in Chicago, were engaged in a labor dispute with the company. The downtown Hyatt Regency and North Michigan Park Hyatt were targeted with mass protests and non-violent arrests.

Members of my teachers local and I had joined with hundreds of others demonstrating union and labor solidarity against one of the city’s wealthiest and powerful corporate families, the Pritzkers. The owners of the Hyatt chain, the Pritzker family were prominent supporters and funders of the national and local Democratic Party. Penny Pritzker had been the chief fundraiser for Obama’s first presidential bid, and would soon serve on Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s hand picked board of education; later, she would leave to be President Obama’s Commerce Secretary.

I wrote to the president of Local 1 and asked that a letter be sent to Ken Swanson, then-President of the IEA, supporting my call for the RA to leave the Hyatt for another location. And the IEA did move its convention. So did the National Education Association, which held its 10,000-delegate national meeting in Chicago the next year. Soon after, many other large organizations also cancelled their meeting contracts with the Hyatt.

This history with UNITE HERE makes my disappointment in the union’s support of Rahm Emanuel in the 2015 Chicago Mayoral election that much more bitter.

In service to Mayor Emanuel’s campaign, UNITE HERE produced a slick and, assumedly, expensive video showing Rahm and a group of hospitality workers who are members of the union. Near the beginning of the video, Local 1 President Karen Kent introduces the mayor by saying, “The best city in the world, the best hospitality in the world, [and] the best mayor.”

RCEd Commentary

Protecting children at risk, and ensuring that all children get a quality education that prepares them for college and careers, has always been at the heart of federal education policy.

We, respectively, oversee the third largest school system in America and run a scholarship foundation that sends more than 10,000 young people of color to college each year. We believe in the power and promise of public education. And our government in Washington should share and uphold that core American conviction.

Lately, however, Republicans in Congress have pushed this shared national goal to the back burner in the service of a false political idea: ""Restoring"" local control. To appeal to Tea Party conservatives, they have created a false narrative of a voracious federal government taking education decisions out of the hands of local leaders and putting them the under the thumb of faceless Washington bureaucrats. Don’t believe it.

The fact is, despite 150 years of federal involvement in public education, states remain firmly in control of their learning standards, classroom curriculum, school funding, and all essential elements of schooling. The federal government funds research and a variety of grant programs, but its core job is to foster greater equity in education with funding and oversight to ensure that low-income children, minorities, children with disabilities, and English language learners are protected. Today, however, even that limited federal role is at risk.

The new Congress is moving quickly to rewrite the federal education law known as No Child Left Behind (technically the “Elementary and Secondary Education Act”) so states and districts no longer have to meet ambitious performance targets. GOP leaders want to weaken accountability and eliminate consequences for chronically under-performing schools.

They are eliminating any incentives or rewards for meeting high learning standards and strengthening the field of teaching. And, as if that’s not enough, they are changing the rules around funding for low-income schools, allowing states to transfer billions of dollars from our poorest schools to middle-class communities.

America is already one of the only developed countries in the world that spends less to educate poor children than to educate wealthier children. Almost every other developed country realizes that it costs more to educate poor kids who do not have the same supports and opportunities as their wealthier peers.

Nevertheless, according to a White House analysis of a proposal in Congress, Los Angeles could lose up to $80 million and Chicago could lose up to $64 million to middle class schools in surrounding high-income communities.

In a society already plagued by staggering economic inequality, allowing states to shift billions in federal dollars away from the poorest kids is indefensible. As it is, we don’t do nearly enough to serve our disadvantaged populations.

Not surprisingly, disadvantaged students score lower on tests, have less access to rigorous curriculum and highly effective teachers, are less likely to finish high school, and far less likely to earn a college degree. As a result, their lifetime earnings are considerably lower and the cost to society is considerably higher.

America has always been the land of opportunity for people willing to work and study hard. But today, in a global, knowledge-based economy, education is more essential than ever to climbing the economic ladder.

At critical points in our history, the federal government has stepped in to pave a path to success that runs right through America’s classrooms. In the 1860s, the federal government helped states create public colleges. After World War II, a grateful nation embraced FDR's GI Bill to send millions of GIs to college.

In the 1950s, the federal government ended institutionalized segregation in schools. In the 1960s, America committed to providing extra funding for low-income K-12 students. In the 1970s, we did the same for students with disabilities.

In both Democratic and Republican administrations, Congress has funded grants and loans to move our nation closer to the day when any qualified young person who wants to go to college can go to college.

As a result of this national action and commitment, America's high school graduation and college enrollment rates hit all-time highs in recent years, driven largely by increases among minorities.

In Chicago, we’ve boosted the high school graduation rate to nearly 70 percent and we’re on track to meet or beat the national average within four years. At the other end of the grade span, we’ve nearly doubled the percentage of kids in quality pre-school.

For all of our progress, however, we still have far too many underperforming schools and children at risk. Too many young people from low-income backgrounds arrive at college academically unprepared. Too many others can never even afford to attend college. Our cities, our communities, our colleges, and our country cannot afford to squander so much talent.

America cannot go backwards to a time when educational equity was optional. It's time to put aside the false arguments, ideologies, and political agendas. Local control is not at risk. Our children are.",-1,http://www.realcleareducation.com/articles/2015/02/20/education_bills_put_neediest_children_at_risk_1160.html

The most important words a business owner can say are often the hardest to achieve. In Chicago, our Innovation Delivery Team has developed new programs and streamlined city hall to help make those words a reality for thousands of entrepreneurs, startups and small businesses.

Small businesses support nearly half of Chicago's workforce, and they are major drivers of community and economic growth in the city. Yet these businesses are also the most at risk, often struggling to access the necessary capital, resources and skills to succeed.

City Hall should be a partner to small business rather than an obstacle.

That is why I tasked Chicago's Innovation Delivery Team, funded through a $6 million grant from Bloomberg Philanthropies, to tackle this challenge.

The Innovation Delivery Team is able to prioritize fact-finding and planning that is often secondary in a city's day-to-day operations. This capacity allows my office to continuously connect with small business owners on their own turf, in the neighborhoods that are incubators of innovation, and work to understand their issues in order to test and tweak solutions in real time.

In the past three years, the city has launched a new Small Business Center, restructured Neighborhood Business Development Centers, launched a microlending program, and appointed the city's first Chief Small Business Officer.

Working with the new Small Business Center, the Innovation Delivery Team developed a streamlined approach that reduced the time it takes to open a restaurant in Chicago by 33% -- from 66 to 44 days. The program identified and eliminated bottlenecks, created new materials in five languages, designed training programs to improve transparency, and implemented team-based building inspections in restaurants, which were previously reserved for large buildings.

Since the program launched, over 1,000 restaurants have benefited. And now these efficiencies have been extended to all businesses.

On a larger scale, the team helped evaluate data on the number of business licenses Chicago issued and identified redundancies that were costing small businesses millions of dollars each year. Using these findings, the city passed an ordinance reducing the number of business license types by 60% -- from 117 to 49. As a result, 7,500 small businesses saved $1.3 million in 2013 and continue to save $1 - $2 million annually.

In addition to saving small businesses money, the city is working on innovative solutions to get them funding. A partnership between Chicago and local banks and lenders launched the Chicago Microlending Institute, a first-in-the-nation program that trains new lenders to make targeted micro-loans to the city's smallest businesses. The city provided $2 million in seed funding to create a revolving loan fund that will be able to support small businesses for years to come.

Already, $1.4 million in micro-loans has been allocated to 160 business, 80% of which are minority-owned and 56% women-owned. These loans have helped create and retain 700 small business jobs.

At a micro-lending fair held last month, I had the pleasure of meeting one of our loan recipients, Sarah Gullette Johnson, who used her $25,000 loan to add three employees to her property management company this year. She was back looking for additional capital to continue growing her company.

Given the success of the micro-lending program, we are now piloting a program to help small businesses attain the next level of funding, between $25,000 and $500,000.

Chicago continues to innovate on the small business front, connecting suppliers with retailers, helping businesses establish an online and social media presence, and supporting new incubators to fuel start-ups. All of these efforts are now embedded in our Small Business Center, allowing the Innovation Delivery Team to tackle new challenges.

We've now deployed our Innovation Delivery Team to tackle some of our city's more pressing social challenges, like placing youth into social support programs and helping the Community Service Centers deliver social service referrals and public benefit enrollments to more residents. Both of these priorities will benefit from the team's fresh thinking and will translate directly into better lives for our friends, neighbors and families throughout our city.

When it comes to innovation, Chicago is open for business.

Nobel Economics Prize holder Robert Mundell has left the building. Why should we care? He wasn’t a celebrity like Elvis or Kim Kardashian or Donald Trump. Rather, Mundell quietly and emphatically improved the lives of billions of people.

Including you and me.

Mundell was the founder of a golden age of world equitable prosperity. It wasn’t utopian. Yet the likes of it have rarely, if ever, occurred in world history.

Mundell was the prime mover of lofting the Dow from 814 to 33,000, of a near doubling the wealth of average Americans, of bringing something like a billion people out of poverty into affluence. We still have much to learn from him. Higher heights beckon.

The eulogies for Mundell exalt him. Rightly so. Yet by focusing on his accolades they obscure his world-transformational outcomes.

Brian Domitrovic, at Forbes, called Mundell the “Zeus” of economics: “Mundell was an impossible amalgam of theoretical genius, algebraic and especially geometrical lucidity, cultural sensibility, and unmeasurable practical influence.” (Memo to Brian: it’s largely unmeasured but measurable.)

The Wall Street Journal: “The pantheon of great 20th-century economists includes John Maynard Keynes, Friedrich Hayek, Joseph Schumpeter and Milton Friedman, among a few others. Less well known but as tall as any of those giants was Robert Mundell….”

Dr. Arthur Laffer said, “Bob Mundell changed the world all for the better. I was blessed to spend lots of quality time with him as his sidekick trying to hold back the forces of evil and push truth to the fore. I loved him dearly and believe him to be the greatest economist of at least the past century.”

Praise gushed from the New York Sun and The New York Times among many others.

In this era of hyperbole à outrance you could be forgiven for mistaking this praise as an exaggeration. You would be wrong. Mundell was the prime mover, in practice, in bulldozing away the inane neo-Keynesian economic dogma making America miserable.

Future vice president, then president, George H. W. Bush indicted Mundell’s thought as “voodoo economics.” The GOP Establishment considered balancing the budget through spending restraint and economic growth heresy. The Democratic Establishment indicted it as “trickle down” (a wisecrack coined by Will Rogers to indict Herbert Hoover, the consummate anti-supply-sider), considering prosperity from free enterprise fostered by low tax rates and stable money as blasphemy.

Economic heresy and blasphemy, as it happens, saved the world.

America and the world were immiserated in an era of stagflation, the “misery index.” Mundell and Laffer hit the scene, working through their polemicist-in-chief, Jude Wanniski and their policy quarterback, Rep. Jack Kemp, prescribing, then crusading on, the inversion of the toxic Neo-Keynesian policy mix of high tax rates and easy money. And then?

About a decade ago, in the Washington Examiner I wrote a Tribute to the $100 trillion man about Mundell.

It was an honor to meet the man who (along with Ronald Reagan, Jack Kemp and a few others) created the policies that created $100- trillion-plus of world wealth. Yes, that is ‘trillion,’ with a t.

“When Reagan campaigned against Carter, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was well below 900. Applying what Jude Wanniski … called ‘the Mundell-Laffer Hypothesis,’ America rode the wave to a Dow now still well over 10,000… “According to the World Bank, the world’s GDP in 1980 was around $11 trillion. Today it is around $60 trillion. The added $50 trillion-per-year capitalizes to over $100 trillion in new wealth… even when adjusted for inflation.”

It gets better. In November 1979 when Reagan announced his presidential candidacy the Dow was at 814. In the past decade the Dow has soared from 10,000 to 33,000+. World GDP has grown from $60T to $88T. While not adjusted for inflation or population growth, one takes the point.

Real per capita GDP (how much we each, on average, make a year) in chained 2012 dollars has risen, since 1979, to over $56,000 from around $30,000… almost doubling the affluence of working families. Factoring in uncounted technological advances we’ve far more than doubled personal wealth. Mundell was the grand architect of this universe.

China, embracing Mundell’s economic wisdom, went from Maoist poverty to Dengist “to get rich is glorious.” Supply-side policies there created generations of blazing economic growth rates while America mostly coasted.

China’s transformation is easy to overlook. So pay attention to what supply side icon David Goldman, author of You will be Assimilated: China’s Plan to Sino-form the World, observed recently:

“…I calculate that per capita household consumption in China has risen nine times, 900% in the past 30 years. That’s one generation. When you talk to Chinese, they’ll tell you, ‘Well, I grew up with a dirt floor and an outhouse and an outside pump. Now, my kids have indoor plumbing and central heating and a car.’ It’s a completely different kind of world…”

Goldman, the grandmaster of the Asian wing of supply-side, closes his recent Asia Times obituary for Mundell:

“Bob knew before almost anyone else that the economic future lay in China. He… spent years lecturing and teaching in China, and had enormous impact on Chinese thinking.”

So … was Mundell, a Canadian, culpable in turning China into a burgeoning geopolitical Godzilla? I hope so. As I wrote at Forbes a few years ago in How Great Presidents Like Washington, Lincoln, FDR, And Reagan Dominated Political Chaos:

“Reagan’s experience playing onscreen roles of heroic figures, whether cowboy or WWII soldier, gave him a deep and invaluable skill set. He transformed into America’s dramaturge. America, and its allies, were invested in his epic narrative …. There is an interesting, although almost unnoticed, coda to that, however. As a ranking, and wise, Soviet official, Georgi Arbatov, declared toward the end of the Cold War: ‘Our major secret weapon is to deprive you of an enemy.’ By dissolving itself, the USSR also dissolved the narrative by which America had defined itself for two generations. We have been without a narrative since.”

Having a worthy adversary is a blessing. It makes life bracing and calls out our best. America has prevailed over every rival, like the British empire, and enemy, like the National Socialists, a/k/a Nazis, and the International Socialists, a/k/a the Soviets. The latter two were far more virulent than the merely repugnant authoritarian People’s Republic. Never doubt that “truth, justice, and the American way,” Superman’s old slogan, is a winner.

Game on!

I give credit, not blame, to Mundell as a geopolitical as well as economic benefactor. Will America rise to the occasion? Of course. Just, expect a cliffhanger. As spuriously attributed to Churchill, “You can depend upon the Americans to do the right thing. But only after they have exhausted every other possibility.”

Some of Mundell’s cabal preceded Mundell on the stairway to Heaven. There, he reunites with Jack Kemp, Bob Bartley, Jude Wanniski, Robert Novak, Jeff Bell. Other OG supply-siders live on, off on new quests: Arthur Laffer, Lewis E. Lehrman, George Gilder, Steve Forbes, Larry Kudlow, Dave Hoppe, John Mueller, Alan Reynolds, Steve Entin, Howard Segermark, David Goldman, Paul Craig Roberts and the beloved apostate Bruce Bartlett. And me, the “little drummer boy” of the supply-side reincarnation of the Spirit of ’76.

This moment is not, however, valedictory. Mundell’s passing offers a teachable moment as the GOP drops deeper and deeper into a serious dalliance with reactionary policies. In fact, the GOP lost the thread on economic growth a generation ago.

Our thought leaders have forgotten that The Mundell-Laffer Hypothesis which served as the “constitution” for a supply-side golden age of equitable prosperity was overwhelmingly about good money—preferably currency legally defined by and convertible into gold—rather than tax rate cuts, the footnote.

Our leaders should have held tax rates low across-the-board and pivoted to great money, preferably gold defined and convertible certificates, to promote higher heights of equitable prosperity. Instead, the Donks subsided back into stale NeoKeynesianism and forgetful Pachyderms built a cargo cult based on business tax cuts having forgotten that the essence of supply-side was good monetary policy and across-the-board tax rate cuts.

That grotesque caricature of supply-side economics failed, of course, to bring about sustained equitable prosperity, tarnishing the brand. The GOP has failed to deliver the goods since the turn of the millennium. Now ambitious Republican politicians are reverting to the mean, pre-Ghost-of-Christmas-Yet-To-Come Scroogonomics: tax cuts for the rich.

So, is the Mundellian Golden Age sputtering out? Perhaps not.

The American economy, with rational exuberance bursting out of the pandemic-induced contraction, is now growing 6.4% a year. That’s the best rate since supply-side’s heyday in 1984. Many will claim credit. Let’s give credit where due: to the policy formula first devised by Robert Mundell.

The stable money prescribed by Mundell was put into place by Volcker and lives on. Volcker ratcheted inflation from double digits in 1979, 1980 and 1981, to the 1%-3% range where it has largely remained. Let us never forget the insidious power of inflation. As Keynes, citing Lenin, wrote in The Economic Consequences of the Peace:

“Lenin is said to have declared that the best way to destroy the capitalist system was to debauch the currency. By a continuing process of inflation, governments can confiscate, secretly and unobserved, an important part of the wealth of their citizens. By this method they not only confiscate, but they confiscate arbitrarily; and, while the process impoverishes many, it actually enriches some… Lenin was certainly right. There is no subtler, no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency. The process engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction, and does it in a manner which not one man in a million is able to diagnose.”

Reagan, building on Mundell’s blueprint, restored capitalism’s legitimacy as well as America’s equitable prosperity. Reagan’s victory, however, was incomplete. In his farewell address Reagan said: “I’ve been asked if I have any regrets. Well, I do. The deficit is one.”

I was part of Reagan Gold Commissioner Lewis E. Lehrman’s tiny deficit-hawk wing of the supply-side. I was and remain an anti-profligacy hawk, appalled by wasteful federal spending under both Republican and Democratic presidents. And, like Ishmael after the sinking of the Pequod, I only am escaped alone to tell thee.

Bill Clinton’s robust Mundellian economic growth and restrained federal spending produced massive and sustained federal surpluses. That’s the ticket.

Now here’s the Big Reveal. Had Mundellian growth rates continued over the past 20 years US GDP now would be around $30T rather than $20T. That 50% larger tax base would yield over 50% more in federal tax revenues without raising rates. That would have more than eradicated the yawning persistent federal deficit.

A federal budget surplus is just a side effect of prosperity. Most of the benefit goes to us as higher wages, savings and investments compounding by the trillions of dollars. Nothing trickle-down about that.

Perhaps this spike to Reagan-era growth will awaken a political leader to the glories of equitable prosperity and the policies that generate it. That’s not apparent on the horizon. That said, all it would take is one worthy successor to Rep. Jack Kemp to pick up Robert Mundell’s neglected blueprint … and up, up and away we will go.

Mundell left us the architectural plans for a renewed golden age in his 1999 Nobel Prize speech, A Reconsideration of the Twentieth Century. Broad hint: the first section is entitled Mismanagement of the Gold Standard.

Thereby we can enter the higher heights of prosperity. A new golden age beckons. Appropriate you went out with a boom, Bob Mundell. Rest in peace.

Our nation turns its lonely eyes to you.

211,Benko,Ralph,newsmax,"Here in suburban Maryland, as across much of America, flags are at half-staff. They are dipped in mourning for the victims of the tragic mass murder in Atlanta. Followed by Boulder. President Biden? Preserve, protect and defend us as well as the Constitution!

Here’s how, a way first proposed at Forbes at ""After Sutherland Springs, Use The Second Amendment To Prevent Mass Gun Violence""and ""After Orlando, Let’s Require Gun Owners To Join The National Guard."" Now, yours for the taking.

The solution lies in more, not less, respect for the Second Amendment. Safety cannot be legitimately secured by eroding the right to keep and bear arms. Eroding any element of the Bill of Rights is a political nonstarter by virtue of America’s love of liberty. Per Ben Franklin, ""Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.""

What to do? Follow Switzerland. Switzerland has a gun culture that makes Texas’s look like a Quaker meeting … with one-tenth of America’s gun violence.

How does that work? Switzerland has, in effect, a ""well regulated militia.""

Time Magazine, in a 2012 article, ""The Swiss Difference: A Gun Culture That Works"":

""Even as the gun-control debate rises again in the U.S. in the aftermath of the horrific school shooting in Newtown, Conn., the gun-loving Swiss are not about to lay down their arms. Guns are ubiquitous in this neutral nation, with sharpshooting considered a fun and wholesome recreational activity for people of all ages.

""Even though Switzerland has not been involved in an armed conflict since a standoff between Catholics and Protestants in 1847, the Swiss are very serious not only about their right to own weapons but also to carry them around in public. Because of this general acceptance and even pride in gun ownership, nobody bats an eye at the sight of a civilian riding a bus, bike or motorcycle to the shooting range, with a rifle slung across the shoulder.

…

""Switzerland trails behind only the U.S, Yemen and Serbia in the number of guns per capita; between 2.3 million and 4.5 million military and private firearms are estimated to be in circulation in a country of only 8 million people. Yet, despite the prevalence of guns, the violent-crime rate is low: government figures show about 0.5 gun homicides per 100,000 inhabitants in 2010. By comparison, the U.S rate in the same year was about 5 firearm killings per 100,000 people, according to a 2011 U.N. report.""

The Second Amendment provides not one but two guarantees. It states: ""A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed.""

The first clause has been dangerously abdicated. Shame on the NRA for failing to defend the full Second Amendment

The evidence is overwhelming that the purpose of the Second Amendment was to create a states-based military counterforce to a potential future tyrannical national government.

Yes, the right of self-defense is virtuous.

Yes, hunters need rifles with which to hunt game. That said, neither of these virtues propelled the right to keep and bear arms into the Constitution.

Respect! The Second Amendment is a firewall against tyranny.

In the young United States of America there was no standing army. There were, rather, state militias which later mostly got subsumed into the National Guard. The Constitution’s chief architect James Madison observed to the Constitutional Convention: ""A standing military force, with an overgrown Executive will not long be safe companions to liberty.""

As one eminent historian states: ""Well-regulated in the 18th century tended to be something like well-organized, well-armed, well-disciplined.” The way to Make America Safe Again,while uniting all but the lunatic fringes of the body politic is by taking more, not less, seriously the full Second Amendment.

President Biden! By restoring well-regulated militias you can create Constitutionally pristine mechanisms, in keeping them well regulated, to keep guns out of the hands of those dangerous to public safety … while putting them securely into the hands of the rest of us. The U.S. Army is not required to and does not accept those with criminal histories or psychological problems. The militias won’t either.

Such discipline is legitimate in a way that background checks to buy weapons are not. As in Switzerland, gun violence will plummet, likely by as much as 90%.

Joe Biden wishes to unite America. He sympathizes with those, like Newsmax readers, who greatly desire reduced gun violence. He has an opportunity to avoid getting jammed by the gridlock that thwarted his predecessors.

President Biden? Restore the Second Amendment’s orphaned guarantee of a well-regulated militia… necessary to the security of a free State. Thereby enter history as a truly consequential president.

212,Benko,Ralph,newsmax,"Fox News bad boy Tucker Carlson is stirring things up again, hippie-punching the New York Times’s Taylor Lorenz, accusing her of snowflakery. The New York Times counterpunches with charges of cruelty. Both charges quite possibly are well founded.

That said, there’s a backstory. Tucker has Hippie roots.

He attended more than 50 Grateful Dead concerts in his day. Per Fox News, ""…Tucker Carlson – who has attended at least 50 shows – named his latest book 'Ship of Fools,' an homage of the Grateful Dead song of the same name.""

Carlson has company in his transformation from gentle Hippie to tough guy Hells Angel: Rush Limbaugh and Donald Trump.

Matt Taibbi (paywalled at Substack and worth every penny), reminds us that Rush started off as a mildly Hippified personality, ""Jeff Christie."" Rush, who was more about pwning progressive pieties than promoting authentic conservatism, pivoted to tough guy and went on to fame and fortune.

His pivot from pussycat to grizzly bear (dancing or not) soon was emulated by one real estate mogul named Donald Trump. Trump began his own political adventures singing Kumbaya. As Fintan O’Toole reminds us in the New York Review of Books:

""At the beginning of this century, Trump was testing the market for a run at the presidency. This was the product he thought Americans would buy: Oprah on his ticket, a guarantee to serve one term only, and an insistence that ‘one of our next president’s most important goals must be to induce a greater tolerance for diversity.' In his manifesto The America We Deserve (2000), Trump claimed that his friendships with the rapper Sean ‘Puff Daddy’ Combs and baseball outfielder Sammy Sosa had left him with 'little appetite for those who hate or preach intolerance.' The horrible murder in Wyoming of a young gay man, Matthew Shepard, had convinced him of the need to ‘work towards an America where these kinds of hate crimes are unthinkable.'""

""Most strikingly, Trump’s analysis in 2000 was that his putative rival for the Reform Party nomination, a right-wing populist, could never be elected because he had spent too long as a professional loud-mouth: 'Simply put, Pat Buchanan has written too many inflammatory, outrageous, and controversial things to ever be elected president.' This kindly, tolerant, politically correct President Trump… never found a market. Trump soon realized that it wouldn’t fly. He dropped it and eventually worked his way toward the presentation of a very different commodity. He realized that overindulgence in the 'inflammatory, outrageous and controversial’ was not an obstacle but a springboard to the presidency.'""

America recently elected the touchy-feely Joe Biden in preference to the swaggering Donald Trump. And yet … even with President Joe in the White House, Limbaugh gone to his Eternal Reward and Trump in quasi-exile many millions continue to yearn for tough guys. Some of us saw this coming.

As I observed way back in 2015 at Forbes.com, Politics, Noir:

""Donald Trump continues to dominate and fascinate. Why? Politics, like comic books, thrillers, detective stories, science fiction, professional wrestling, movies and TV is a pulp medium. … What’s going on now in Campaign 2016 isn’t strictly politics. It is melodrama. …

""Donald Trump, 'Reality' TV star, grasps the conventions of the pulp world better than any of his (far more qualified, far more distinguished, and far more likable) rivals. Trump is getting the best ratings because Trump is presenting a more compelling pulp Story.

""It surely is no coincidence that Trump’s emergence comes in the era where Breaking Bad entered the Guinness Book of World Records as 'the highest rated TV series' of all time. Popular culture now is dominated by stories of antiheroes: Walter White, Don Draper, Barksdale, Frank Underwood, Tony Soprano … the list goes on.""

And as I wrote for The Transpartisan Review, in Political Armageddon, in 2019:

""[W]e pivot to demonizing one another. As an aside, one can trace the evolution of the American narrative from Hollywood’s output. In the ‘30s you had frontier Westerns with heroic sheriffs fighting brutal outlaws. The ‘40s gave us heroic soldiers fighting evil Nazis and imperial Japanese troops. The ‘50s, ‘60s, and ‘70s gave way to heroic fights against Communist agents. All gave way to noir anti-heroes, dystopian futures, Imperial Storm Troopers and, eventually, Zombies.""

Rush Limbaugh walked, as Tucker Carlson and Donald Trump walk, on the wild side.

Progressives are appalled, having forgotten (as I, another right wing Deadhead, remember) how the greatest poet of our generation, Allen Ginsburg, saw how the Hippies and Hells Angels, who detested each other over their respective opposition to and support of the Vietnam War, both, as outlaws, had undiscovered affinities.

Ginsberg invited them both to a wild party. The Hippies and Hells Angels became, for a time, fast friends.

So… word up, Tucker. Keep on Truckin’!

213,Benko,Ralph,newsmax,"In a recent column I upped the ante on conservative big shot Charles Koch's proposition to let the Dreamers stay, endorsing Joe Biden's call for an eight-year path to citizenship for America's tax-paying, otherwise law-abiding, undocumented residents.

That's not your everyday conservative doctrine. It should be. Here's why.

Most of the 11-million stranded undocumented foreign-born residents are conservative-leaning, especially so on social issues where we most need support. They will be a conservative El Dorado.

As I wrote here, they hold ""core American, and conservative, values, including pro-life, traditional marriage, family and community minded, hard-working, entrepreneurial, respectful of property rights, religious and deeply patriotic."" It makes no political sense for conservatives to oppose bringing 11 million new conservative-leaning voters onto the voting rolls.

There's more. We conservatives exalt the founders of America such as Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton, both of whom were even more enthusiastic about giving immigrants a fast path to citizenship than is President Biden. Let's attack Biden for delaying citizenship by eight years rather than making it immediate, as Jefferson proposed, or imposing a five-year wait, per Hamilton.

Hamilton, himself an immigrant from very humble Caribbean origins, writing in 1802 under the nom de plume of Lucius Crassus, in The Examination Number VIII, called for a five-year residency before citizenship. That's a considerably more generous stand than that of the Biden proposal.

He wrote: ""But there is a wide difference between closing the door altogether and throwing it entirely open; between a postponement of fourteen years and an immediate admission to all the rights of citizenship. Some reasonable term ought to be allowed to enable aliens to get rid of foreign and acquire American attachments; to learn the principles and imbibe the spirit of our government; and to admit of at least a probability of their feeling a real interest in our affairs. A residence of at least five years ought to be required.""

Jefferson and Hamilton are two of our most revered founders, Jefferson with a temple-like memorial on the Tidal Basin, Hamilton with a smash hip-hop hit on Broadway. Honoring the Jeffersonian/Hamiltonian call for a path to citizenship is the conservative way.

Further, legalizing our stranded residents is consistent with the signature conservative issue of ""law and order."" Overstaying your visa is a synthetic ""crime,"" not the kind of thing that true small government conservatives admire. As conservative icon Grover Norquist has observed, real conservatives are for repealing, not reflexively enforcing, stupid laws like the former 55 mph national speed limit.

Small government, anybody?

The former conservative talk show host (and convicted Watergate burglar) G. Gordon Liddy used to make a distinction between ""malum prohibitum,"" acts criminalized by statute — a Big Government practice that most conservatives deplore — rather than malum in se, something traditional values condemn as morally bad like theft and murder.

A prohibition on ""overstaying your visa"" is nowhere to be found in the Ten Commandments. I haven't been able to find it even in Leviticus. It's no biblical abomination. My ancestors, the Hebrews, strangers in a strange land, got trapped in Egypt in ways rather reminiscent of America's undocumented. Hello?

Evangelical Christians and Catholics take note! These are your people, mostly themselves evangelicals or Catholic. Are they akin to trespassers? My dear Christian friends! When did ""forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us"" get cancelled from the Christian canon?

Last but not least, there's the matter of justice. Justice is a profoundly conservative value. As Anatole France ironically observed, in The Red Lily: ""The law, in its majestic equality, forbids rich and poor alike to sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets, and to steal loaves of bread."" Any true conservative would argue, following Blackstone, that a ""law"" that works injustice is unworthy of the name.

President Reagan signed the last big immigration reform law, providing citizenship to around 3 million who were then here stranded. It also adopted standards for future legal immigration … which America studiously failed to enforce.

There's a doctrine at law called ""equitable estoppel."" In plain words, ""use it or lose it."" By not asserting a right for a long time you become ""estopped"" from doing so. It's very much woven into the order of the law in the service of justice.

Bottom line: Providing a path to citizenship for the stranded will add 11 million mainly conservative voters to the U.S. electorate. Most of our revered founders were all for a path to citizenship. The path is a small government imperative. It is essential to law, order and justice. Providing a path to citizenship, while seriously enforcing smart, clear, beneficially written immigration laws, is the conservative way.

214,Benko,Ralph,newsmax,"Most conservatives are eager to commence hostilities with President Biden. Big mistake.

Charles Koch, by contrast, in an interview with The Washington Post's James Hohmann to promote his new book ''Believe in People: Bottom-Up Solutions for a Top-Down World,'' stated, ''We're going to be looking for common ground [with Biden] and things that we can work together on for as many issues as possible,'' among which are repealing ''President Trump's tariffs, restore protections for 'Dreamers' and enact police reform that addresses systemic racism.''

Amen.

President Biden has already proposed some policies that archconservatives like me find problematic. One is a federally mandated minimum wage of $15 per hour.

Nobly intentioned, letting people earn a living wage.

Yet wages, like all prices, are determined by supply and demand.

Raising the minimum wage by statute is akin to purporting to repeal the speed of light by statute. This violates the Ten Commandments of humanitarian capitalism.

Thus, it will hurt those it intends to help.

And, in an order designed to help destigmatize those identifying as transgender, President Biden allows biological males to compete in Title IX women's sports.

This, I submit, is inequitable to women.

Additionally, shutting down the Keystone XL pipeline is already drawing protests from Biden's own organized labor base.

As a dues-paying member of the AFL-CIO, I concur in those protests.

Yet these policy errors aren't existential threats to America.

They are Biden's ''sop to Cerberus'' that I had previously predicted at Newsmax.

Per The Free Dictionary: ''In the Aeneid Virgil describes how the Sibyl guiding Aeneas to the underworld threw a drugged cake to Cerberus, thus enabling the hero to pass the monster in safety.''

These disputed policies are politically expedient by the shrewd Biden.

They do not betray him as a sleeper Communist agent.

Conservatives will be making a mistake if we obsess over our (perfectly legitimate) disagreements with President Biden. Few other than Judge Judy groupies relish a scold.

If we become policy shrews, always carping and criticizing, we will erode our public support. Let's not cast ourselves as Grumpy Cats.

As Peter Drucker wrote in his ur-supply-side classic, ''The Effective Executive'' (p.98), ''In every area of effectiveness, one feeds the opportunities and starves the problem.'' (Original emphasis.)

If we make Biden's policy missteps our focus we court the fate of the peg-legged Captain Ahab. At the climax of Ahab's vendetta against the great white whale that had bitten off his leg in a previous expedition, ""Moby Dick"" rams and sinks the Pequod.

Ahab precipitated his own doom, losing his ship and all hands except Ishmael.

Bad policy, bad politics.

We needn't weaponize every issue.

In addition to the areas of common ground enumerated by Charles Koch there are other areas where true conservatives can, fully consistent with our principles, cooperate with Biden. Three marquee Biden initiatives immediately come to mind. These promote values that, while not betraying the Democrats' progressive faction, are highly appealing to many conservatives.

Paramount is Biden's shifting the discourse from ''equality'' to ''equity.''

Second is his offering to add 11 million new conservative voters, the trapped undocumented, to America's voting roles.

Third is getting serious about restoring America's world technological leadership.

I will address these more extensively in a future column. For now, the most subtle and, therefore, powerful of these is Biden's shifting of the discourse. Astoundingly, Biden instantaneously, without fanfare, redefined goodness from ''equality'' — long a Democratic Party darling — to ''equity.''

I have been protesting the progressives' misguided focus on ''inequality'' for many years. ''Equality'' is a grotesque caricature of the legitimate value of equity. Protesting ''inequality'' overlooks the legitimacy of merit-based differentiated outcomes based on qualities such as, among others, those identified by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King. Jr. (on Aug. 28, 1963 in his ""I Have a Dream"" speech) on ''the content of their character.''

""Equity'' is legitimate and consistent with the American sense of fair play.

Joe Biden is singing from our hymnal.

I have been preaching in vain the doctrine of ''equitable prosperity'' for a generation or two.

To be clear, ''equitable'' means that nobody gets special privileges and nobody gets prejudiced by the ground rules. The call for a level playing field is something most conservatives give lip service to, albeit only sometimes. Biden effortlessly shifted the discourse from the progressive shibboleth of equality to conservative-compatible equity. This achievement is, to quote then-Vice President Biden, a ''big f*****g deal.'' Bravo!

My fellow conservatives? ''And I only am escaped alone to tell thee.''

It would be self-defeating to engage in a dreary vendetta making Joe Biden our very own ""Moby Dick."" Let us experiment with laying aside our rhetorical harpoons and, instead, feeding the better angels of President Biden's nature.

215,Benko,Ralph,newsmax,"Now America inaugurates Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. president of the United States. Farewell to President Trump.

Politics is forward-looking. We voters aren't even ''What have you done for me lately?'' to our elected officials. We're ''What are you going to do for me next?'' As American philosopher-poet Steven Tyler, of Aerosmith, observes, ''The past is gone.''

Yet indulge me in a brief farewell to Donald Trump. Some of my friends exalt Trump, celebrating his boldness. Some abhor Trump, citing shocking crudeness.

As for me? I stand by my friends.

Relitigating Trump, political messiah or pariah, is bootless. The past is gone. Here comes Biden with a fragile, fraught, Democrat majority. Here comes the GOP on the brink of its own internecine warfare. So, what's next?

As I previously observed here at Newsmax, the first hundred days of an administration are crucial. FDR, Reagan and Clinton showed that if you capably launch an ambitious and relevant agenda, you can parlay the political capital of your election victory into momentum-generating legislative victories, more political capital, and ultimately — reelection.

Joe Biden's off to an impressive start. As no less than Christopher Ruddy, FOT (Friend of Trump), creator and CEO of Trump's favorite legitimate news source, Newsmax, wrote, ''The big story, lost in the mayhem of election-related news, is that Biden clearly wants a moderate Democratic administration.''

Ruddy inventories the Biden administration's team picks, noting that there isn't a single strand of lunatic fringe there. Biden designates a pragmatic, not dogmatic, team. Impressively, he does so without triggering a revolt by his party's left wing. I predicted Biden would succeed at taming his fractious progressives. So far, so good.

Notwithstanding (Morton) Blackwell's Law, ''Personnel is policy,'' Biden's team roster is but prelude. He now unveils his first hundred days agenda. Biden grasps the importance of the first hundred days as Trump did not.

I had friends in the Trump transition. The groundwork was trashed, binders into dumpsters, shortly after the election when Jared Kushner torpedoed Chris Christie in a power struggle. The plans for Trump's first hundred days were collateral damage. President Trump ended up winging it.

Word was that Trump's transition team had worked out an elegant, simple, and superior replacement for Obamacare. President Trump cavalierly discarded this, kicking the job of designing the Obamacare replacement over to Congress, and was caught flatfooted.

That played right into House Speaker Paul Ryan's hands, allowing him to seize the opportunity to produce some magical budget numbers on the basis of which he could try to achieve his personal holy grail, ''reforming'' Social Security and Medicare (which Trump had campaigned to protect). This led to a deformed Obamacare repeal bill that Trump couldn't get passed by a majority Republican Congress.

Trump thereby failed to deliver on his premier campaign promise and, instead of starting his first hundred days with a big win, replacing Obamacare with something better and more popular, following up with a popular tax cut, and building political capital. Instead, Team Trump squandered its political capital and Trump's legislative agenda got bogged down in a quagmire on Capitol Hill, never to fully recover.

Biden, conversely, has shown himself master of this game. Last week he telegraphed that he was immediately going to concentrate on delivering the two things that Americans most urgently desire: vaccinating 100 million in his first hundred days, more soon thereafter, and providing meaningful relief to sustain the economic casualties — waitresses, bartenders, hotel workers and so forth — from the economic carnage that fighting the pandemic wrought, and pushing relentlessly to provide other ''keep the lights on'' services.

This irks hard-shell libertarians, but Trump himself belatedly signaled support for more generous relief. Americans, mostly kind-hearted pragmatists, are receptive. Then Biden announced he would be prioritizing fighting against climate change and for racial equity, both intensely popular with his base and, done right, broadly popular with voters.

By thus setting his legislative table Joe Biden is investing his political capital shrewdly. My colleagues on the Committee to Unleash Prosperity may gag. But Adam Smith, the progenitor of capitalism, prescribes magnanimous pragmatism, not parsimonious dogmatism, capitalism. Biden could well use Adam Smith's ""The Theory of Moral Sentiments"" to out-capitalize (both economically and politically) some of us free market champions. We shall see.

Conservatives must remain vigilant, yet not act like vigilantes. For example, there is a right (fostering technological progress, as Uncle Sam did with the space program and internet) and a wrong (carbon taxes) way to address climate change. So, let's put away our rhetorical arquebuses and muskets, for now.

And President Trump? Consider Steven Tyler, again. He offers a coda to light the way forward. ""You got to lose to know how to win."" Join us in wishing President Joe Biden Godspeed on his path to building America's health and wealth back better.

216,Benko,Ralph,newsmax,"The storming of the U.S. Capitol showed how, like the priestess Cassandra endowed with prophetic power, cursed never to be believed, my own five years of cautionaries, in Forbes.com, The Transpartisan Review and at Newsmax were not clickbait. The somber Mitch McConnell, too, used a phrase identical to one of mine: “Death spiral.”

Last week the liberal republic held.

We can’t take that for granted.

“Liberal” means respecting unalienable rights. The First Amendment holds sacrosanct the free exercise of religion, of the press and of speech. And of “the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.”

Each of our inalienable rights must be exercised consistently with the others. Per Holmes (Oliver Wendell, Jr., not Sherlock), ""The most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing a panic.""

Last week’s storm was feral, not peaceable and, thus, not constitutionally protected. President Trump’s precursor tweet, “Big protest in D.C. on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!”? Unlike my own, surely meant as a self-fulfilling prophecy.

In my long day I have attended many peaceable assemblies.

I attended the massive A16 march on Washington, April 16, 2000, held to protest the IMF and World Bank. Archconservatives like me shared the left’s fury at these oppressive multinational bureaucracies. So, inviting along the distinguished public intellectual Peter Roff, I went to check it out. We were the only two wearing ties in a sea of tie-dye clad protesters. Peter, wiser than me then as now, departed when a tiny faction called the “black bloc” – violent anarchists, the precursors of antifa – began breaking windows.

I, inveterately curious, wondered who was running the show. Nearby, a tall, rail-thin young man wearing a blazer and nicely creased slacks was carrying a walky-talky. Detecting an instrument of authority as a march organizer I went over and said to him, “I propose to liberate one of those batik banners lashed to the top of the lamp posts for my collection.""

He replied, “Oh sir, please don’t do that. They are private property, promised to the Smithsonian. You may buy one on our website.” A protestor with excellent manners and stated respect for private property, cultural institutions, and commerce? Like a character out of Chesterton!

He, Patrick Reinsborough, turned out to be one of the left’s largely unheralded strategic geniuses and a worthy adversary — Moriarty to my Holmes (or, perhaps, Holmes to my Moriarty). Despite his repeated failures to recruit me to his movement we remained in occasional touch, me providing a glowing review of his co-authored brilliant book of cultural strategy, Re:Imagining Change. It belongs in the canon with Rules for Radicals and The Prison Notebooks of Antonio Gramsci … and irrespective of your ideology on your bookshelf.



Forward to 2009, I attended a RightOnLine conference in Pittsburgh. MoveOn.org’s then political director Ilyse Hogue, another formidable progressive strategist, graciously invited me to the afterparty for their continuing protest of the IMF, deejayed by Shep (“Obama Hope Poster”) Fairey. There I learned: Capitalize with capitalists but socialize with socialists. They throw much better parties.

Around then I had become a Tea Party leader, honored to co-emcee the July 4th 2009 Boston Tea Party in Boston Common. Brad Marston, a Tea Party mastermind, expressed concern that Boston was not issuing the required permits. So, I cold-called Sen. Ted Kennedy’s Boston office and asked his chief of staff to look into it, acknowledging our differences, citing our mutual respect for the Bill of Rights.

Within an hour, the permits quietly appeared … thanks to Sen. Kennedy, another worthy adversary and an honest liberal. Like, say, Joe Biden.

In 2011 I hung out occasionally with Occupy Wall Street in McPherson Square, D.C. I trekked to OWS’s epicenter, Zuccotti Park in Manhattan, to see for myself. In 2017 I observed the Greenpeace RESIST protesters flamboyantly hanging from a crane over downtown D.C.

Sometimes raucous, with occasional constrained violations by unwelcome fringe agitators, none significantly violated the peace. Unlike, say, those who stormed the Capitol.

Beforehand, the president’s own proxy, Rudolph Giuliani, wound up the crowd, declaring “So let’s have trial by combat.” And one cannot honorably ignore the coy declarations of a president who, as Washington Post senior political reporter Aaron Blake observed, “is a master of hinting at things and then gently disavowing them when it becomes untenable, to give himself plausible deniability….”

Last week the republic survived the storming of the Capitol. Now heed me, your Cassandra. Ben Franklin, cautioned that the Constitutional Convention had given us “a republic, if you can keep it.” Keeping “it” was essential to making America great.

It is essential to making America great again.

217,Benko,Ralph,newsmax,"This is the way the world of 2021 begins, not with a whimper but a bang.

On January 5th, Georgia wraps up its two runoff Senate elections, both too close to call. Once again, the tossed political coin lands on its edge, wobbles, then topples.

If both Democratic nominees win it will hand President Biden the mixed blessing of Democratic Party control of the legislative as well as the executive branch. Mixed? It will simplify the confirmation of his appointments yet give his party's lunatic fringe a bit more leverage on a pragmatic President Biden, portending Democrats' losses in 2022 … and 2024.

Then, on January 6th, Congress will go into full political theatrics on the certification of the electoral college results. This will create a Capitol Hill spectacle, to the delight of sly and ambitious rabble-rousers, and put Vice President (and presidential aspirant) Pence into a painful double bind. To his many rivals' delight.

Meanwhile, in the streets of the capital the ""Antifa"" Lumpenproletariat will demonstrate, clashing with the ""StopTheSteal"" Trumpenproletariat. The latter's propensity for wilding is being stoked by their political magister ludi. Mob rule hooligans meet conspiracy theorist hobgoblins to enact lurid political theater.

America is torn between its ideals, per Joan Didion our dreampolitik, and a healthy recognition that we have fallen short of our ideals, realpolitik. Yet out of this thesis and antithesis we just might achieve a synthesis of better liberty and justice for all.

""Lumpenproletariat"" is a word yearning to return to the discourse. The Britannica helpfully tells us: ""(German: ""rabble proletariat""), according to Karl Marx in The Communist Manifesto, the lowest stratum of the industrial working class, including also such undesirables as tramps and criminals. The members of the Lumpenproletariat — this 'social scum,' said Marx — are not only disinclined to participate in revolutionary activities with their ""rightful brethren,"" the proletariat, but also tend to act as the 'bribed tools of reactionary intrigue.'""

History repeats, ""the second time as farce."" Proud Boys and Antifa? Leave no graffiti on my front door! Respect the doors of Speaker Pelosi and Leader McConnell. By violating our portals you indict only yourselves.

Let's recall Progressive Republican Teddy Roosevelt's indictment of the lunatic fringe. ""Then, among the wise and high-minded people who in self-respecting and genuine fashion strive earnestly for peace, there are foolish fanatics always to be found in such a movement and always discrediting it — the men who form the lunatic fringe in all reform movements.""

Foolish fanaticism discredits that which it purports to support. And there is TR's speech before the American Historical Association in 1912. Teddy Roosevelt, schismatic Republican, founder of the short-lived Populist ""Bull Moose"" Party, there offered a vital message to today's ""progressives"" who have culturally appropriated his brand but not his vision.

There's the loud but tiny progressive elite who promotes a cancel culture. Their message is Hell-bent on cancelling America. The labor and ethnic left celebrates America's commitment to justice despite its imperfections. Progressives purport to but do not authentically represent labor or people of color. The left is not monolithic.

The progressive faction loudly virtue signals yet was definitively repudiated by the Democratic rank-and-file. Joe Biden, crusading on making America better, appealed to those who wish to join, not wage class warfare upon, the middle class. Biden won.

Teddy Roosevelt's message after departing the White House and before his ascent of Mount Rushmore:

""The hard materialism of our age will appear, and also the strange capacity for lofty idealism which must be reckoned with by all who would understand the American character. A people whose heroes are Washington and Lincoln, a peaceful people who fought to a finish one of the bloodiest of wars, waged solely for the sake of a great principle and a noble idea, surely possess an emergency standard far above mere money-getting.

""Those who tell the Americans of the future what the Americans of to-day and of yesterday have done, will perforce tell much that is unpleasant. This is but saying that they will describe the arch-typical civilization of this age. Nevertheless when the tale is finally told, I believe that it will show that the forces working for good in our national life outweigh the forces working for evil, and that, with many blunders and shortcomings, with much halting and turning aside from the path, we shall yet in the end prove our faith by our works, and show in our lives our belief that righteousness exalteth a nation.""

President-elect Biden? There are not one but two transformational President Roosevelts to emulate. Franklin Delano, for his capitalist social democracy programs such as Social Security. And Theodore's excommunication of the kind of hooligans who infest our streets and the hobgoblins – the lunatic fringe – of both parties now haunting American politics.

Righteousness exalteth a nation.

218,Benko,Ralph,newsmax,"We lay the Soap Opera of a Year 2020 to rest and prepare to launch America into an uncharted 2021. Yet ""the fundamental things apply as time goes by."" So … pause with me momentarily to consider how the secret recipe for the pursuit of happiness is ""hidden in plain sight"" in a pledge we all have taken but now honor only in part.

We all (me included), conservative Republicans and progressive Democrats, tend to be in violation of a crucial piece of the Pledge of Allegiance, our national oath. We have all taken it so many times it has become rote. Pity. It's not empty rhetoric. It's an exceptional credo: ""One nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.""

America's presenting social ills are largely caused by the conservatives' under-emphasis of justice and the progressives' under-emphasis of liberty. Both are crucial. They're complementary, not contradictory.

A word to conservatives.

I have written elsewhere how conservatives' abdication of a commitment for justice is morally and politically indefensible. Justice is the foundation of the conservative worldview. I cringe when I hear a politician talking ""law and order."" The right formulation is ""law and justice.""

The great legal sage William Blackstone, in his Commentaries, observes:

""As, therefore, the Creator is a Being, not only of infinite power, and wisdom, but also of infinite goodness. … For He has so intimately connected, so inseparably interwoven the laws of eternal justice with the happiness of each individual, that the latter cannot be attained but by observing the former; and, if the former be punctually obeyed, it cannot but induce the latter. … This law of nature, being coeval with mankind and dictated by God Himself, is of course superior in obligation to any other. It is binding over all the globe in all countries, and at all times: no human laws are of any validity, if contrary to this; and such of them as are valid derive all their force, and all their authority, mediately or immediately, from this original.""

Justice is a moral imperative. It also is politically inane to allow progressives to monopolize a claim to the commitment to justice.

Now a word to progressives.

Giving short shrift to liberty in preference to justice is morally and tactically wrong. Both are requisite. Obsessing over inequality is a perversion of the legitimate critique of inequity.

When I was born, in 1952, the American economy per person, adjusted for inflation, averaged $23,000 (nominally $2,349). In 2019, it's $65,000. During my lifetime Americans have grown, on average, almost three times wealthier. Inequities exist. It is morally and politically imperative to address these, especially those based on the enslavement of ancestors.

Yet, the vast majority of us really are much better off.

No ""trickle down"" about it!

Prosperity helps people flourish. Yo, progressives! It is morally and politically wrong to impose penury by strangling free markets in the name of achieving ""equality."" Nobody aspires to equality of poverty.

One can legitimately introduce and expand social insurance programs in matters such as healthcare and education without infringing liberty. Hayek himself, a socially conscious free marketer, propounded exactly that. Government produces misery by meddling in the markets. Yet it's fine for the state to create social insurance programs funded by taxation. That's ""social democracy,"" not ""democratic socialism."" From The Road to Serfdom :

Where, as in the case of sickness and accident, neither the desire to avoid such calamities nor efforts to overcome their consequences are as a rule weakened by the provision of assistance — where, in short, we deal with genuinely insurable risks — the case the for the state's helping to organize a comprehensive system of social insurance is very strong. … [T]here is no incompatibility in principle between the state's providing greater security in this way and the preservation of individual freedom.

Americans aspire to equitable prosperity. Not to equal austerity.

Progressives trademarked ""equitable."" Conservatives patented ""prosperity."" (I myself founded the Prosperity Caucus around 30 years ago.) Both virtues are essential.

As Sen. Barry Goldwater said in his ringing 1964 presidential acceptance speech: ""I would remind you that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice. And let me remind you also that moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue.""

Let's both defenders of liberty and pursuers of justice unite to honor Goldwater's credo. Let's rededicate ourselves to both. The secret recipe for that very American commitment to the pursuit of happiness is hidden in plain sight. We are all pledged to it.

So, in 2021 let's honor, in full rather than only partially, our pledge of allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

Happy New Year!

219,Benko,Ralph,newsmax,"Thank you Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., for courageously defending Section 230 and opposing government censorship of the internet. I'm a writer. So I am biased in favor of free speech and a free press. It's flattering having President Trump, via repeatedly tweeted veto threat, and so many legislators of both parties trying to tell us what we can and cannot say, technically called ""censorship."" Also, annoying.

It makes no sense, operationally, morally or constitutionally, to hold social media platforms liable for user postings. Bashing social media betrays deep ignorance of (or, in the case of legislators such as the ambitious Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., animus toward) how social media works.

Sasse to the rescue! And on the Democratic side of the aisle, Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., the godfather of Section 230, together with former Rep. and then SEC Chairman Chris Cox, a Republican, observes: ""repealing the law entirely would return us to the legal no-man's land that necessitated Section 230 in the first place. It can't be that every one of the over 200 million websites available to Americans — all of them governed by Section 230 — will have to either stop publishing their user's contributions, or let ""anything go"" — no matter how gross or illegal.""

Robert Bork, Jr., at Real Clear Politics, summarized Sen. Sasse's observation: ""I am more skeptical than a lot of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle about whether or not there is a regulatory fix that will make it better instead of worse. … Sasse then noted that his Democratic colleague, Sen. [Richard] Blumenthal, was 'giddy' about creating 'a new government agency to police online speech.'"" Weird to see ""conservatives"" massing to weaponize Big Government and empower our erstwhile nemesis, tort lawyers.

Conservative media-bashing isn't surprising. We conservatives have been bashing media since time immemorial. I recently saw an '80s-era bumper sticker, ""I Don't Believe the Liberal Press."" Goes back much further.

In 1807, the iconic libertarian President Jefferson wrote of my journalistic predecessors in a letter to John Norvell, ""To your request of my opinion of the manner in which a newspaper should be conducted, so as to be most useful, I should answer, by restraining it to true facts and sound principles only. … It is a melancholy truth, that a suppression of the press could not more completely deprive the nation of it's (sic) benefits, than is done by it's (sic) abandoned prostitution to falsehood.""

Politicos routinely reciprocate reporters' antagonism. Alas for politicos, there's that pesky First Amendment. It says that Congress (and by extension all government) ""shall make no law abridging freedom of speech, or of the press."" But hey, what's a mere Constitutional right to U.S. Senators as ambitious as Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley seeking to fan the embers of their presidential ambition with cheap shots designed to stoke their CPAC base?

Many decades ago I was a young conservative activist in Albany, N.Y. We wannabe firebrands merrily complained about how establishment media, The New York Times, Washington Post, Time, Newsweek, and the three broadcast networks discriminated against us.

We had safe space in our little magazines, National Review and The American Spectator. But the federal ""Fairness"" Doctrine kept conservatives off radio and TV much as the proposals of anti-230 Senators would keep us off the internet. After Reagan's repeal our little magazines were joined by great big Rush Limbaugh, Fox News, Matt Drudge and Newsmax, much to our advantage.

Memo to Sens. Cruz and Hawley: Don't poison your own well.

True, we conservatives rarely get sat at the cool kids' lunch table. We're rarely interviewed on PBS or NPR, much less broadcast networks or CNN. We aren't likely to be haloed by Time as Person of the Year. Now, ambitious politicos are sucker-punching Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and hippie-punching Twitter's Jack Dorsey.

Let's face an embarrassing reality. Social media companies' interest in politics is minimal. Washington is the center of our universe. Not theirs. Zuck, whatever his faults, is obsessively focused on the experience of his 2.7 billion active users (who, de facto, ""elect"" Facebook by using it). Sheryl Sandburg focuses on monetizing that traffic.

Politics barely registers on their radar screens (to their peril). Same deal with Twitter, Amazon and Google. They're not insidious. They're naïve.

Political advertising contributes around half a percent of Facebook's revenue. Since it is expensive to moderate political postings Facebook probably loses money on its political content. Zuckerberg allows political content out of a commitment to free speech and civic duty. Let our legislators emulate rather than savage him.

My conservative friends are having hysterics over Joe Biden's election. I am investing my own conservative hysteria in the GOP's abdication of championing free speech and ethical free market capitalism.

Thank you, Ben Sasse, for being a rare conservative profile in courage.

220,Benko,Ralph,newsmax,"The electoral college count is behind us. Now please let this old, battle-scarred, swamp fox let you in on an important open secret about politics and government. A spanking new administration comes off its electoral victory with political capital and momentum.

The first hundred days matter. A lot.

A new president's success depends on two factors. How he invests (or squanders) his political capital. And, will his rival political party come up with a compelling counter narrative?

Or sulk?

I can't speak for the Biden administration. But I have a few choice words for the GOP.

It's hard to overstate how potent ""the first hundred days"" of a new administration are in setting the national tone. The narrative it generates, for better or worse, typically becomes intractable for the remaining four years. A president has about three months, rhetorically called ""the first hundred days,"" to parlay his (someday her) electoral momentum into major, meaningful, policy victories. If he succeeds he can build political capital and go from victory to victory to … re-election and then, potentially, succession.

The ""first hundred days"" was coined for FDR and his massive legislative successes in getting the New Deal passed. Roosevelt thereby captured the popular imagination and went on to a landslide re-election (plus a couple of bonus rounds). Ronald Reagan astutely used his political capital to wring inflation out of the economy and get Congress to cut dramatically marginal income tax rates, setting the stage for a roaring economy that propelled him to a 49-state re-election landslide and ... then victory in the Cold War.

William Clinton, having been tutored by James Carville that ""it's the economy, stupid,"" put together a great economy team, later featured on the cover of TIME as ""the Committee to Save the World."" Team Clinton pulled America out of the Bush recession, generated robust prosperity and a hefty federal budget surplus. Bill Clinton went on to a handy re-election despite his pretty-well-known Peccadillo Circus.

If a president stumbles he will find himself bogged down in a quagmire that resembles what Sen. John Warner eloquently referred to, in another context, ""a byzantine thicket filled with potholes and quicksand.""

Quagmire. Remember Jimmy Carter's ""malaise"" and his widely mocked Sunday School teacher response: ""the Moral Equivalent of War,"" derided as his great MEOW? One-term president.

The unknown unknown is whether the GOP is going to stop sulking and put forward its own vision of a Shining City on a Hill. ""We wuz robbed,"" a self-pitying message, isn't a vote-getter. A powerful vision would position the Pachyderms to, in 2022, take back the House, keep or regain the Senate and launch a formidable challenge in 2024.

Biden's ""first hundred days,"" January 20 to May 1, and the Republican response, will set the tone for the entire Biden-Harris term. Or terms. Right now, the GOP is stuck in the early stages of the grieving process: denial and anger.

Will it move on to bargaining, depression and acceptance? Yes, if the Republican party hasn't defaulted into puppet status for the Trump family dynasty, regaining its will to live. We shall see.

There are zero votes in crying sour grapes. If the GOP keeps up its snowflakery the establishment media will gladly paint us as sore losers … especially since Republicans won almost everything south of the presidency. If the GOP goes on offense with an inspiring, exciting message it will put the left on its back foot and give America something worth voting for going into 2022.

I consider the right message to be that propounded by Claremont Institute chairman Tom Klingenstein, with whom I have had an indirect professional relationship: ""America is Good."" It is politically, rhetorically and morally a great counter to ""Cancel America.""

America The Good splits the left, isolating the tyrannical ""Blame America First"" progressives from the America-loving labor and ethnic left. Featuring this declaration would force the Dems into internecine warfare and, if the good guys win, force them to play catch up. Win-win.

And let the GOP give America someone, as well as something, worth voting for. Sen. Marsha Blackburn's standing up to counter the Left's ""Change America"" Vision is powerful. Blackburn would make a superb national spokesperson for the Republican Party. And a wonderfully appealing first round presidential draft pick in 2024, surely for all those whose last name isn't Trump.

Per the Daily Signal, ""Blackburn's commitment to promote strong conservative ideas is also the mission of her new podcast 'Freedom Rings.' The podcast will discuss 'faith, family, freedom, hope, and opportunity, with great patriots who are seeking to advance the conservative cause and who are working to ensure every American has the opportunity to live the American dream,' Blackburn said. ...""

America the Good. America the Beautiful.

221,Benko,Ralph,newsmax,"A dozen years ago, when the Web still was young and social media but a gleam in Mark Zuckerberg's eye, The Washington Post tapped me for a real time online Q&A with its readers. They recruited me as one of the leaders of, and an ad hoc spokesman for, the Tea Party.

Based on the hostile and clueless tenor of the questions directed at me from my audience I felt, I imagined, like Klaatu (played by Michael Renee) confronting a frightened mob upon landing his flying saucer on the national mall in The Day The Earth Stood Still. The heroine (played by Patricia Neal), at the climax, told the robot Gort not to destroy the Earth.

""Klaatu barada nikto!""

Close call ...

Sometimes I still feel that way.

The Washington Post's editor Fred Hiatt recently flagged a column by their esteemed Eugene Robinson. Hyatt observed that it stood on its head what Gene calls the ""numbingly comprehensive sociological and anthropological examination"" of the Trump voter that followed the 2016 election. ... Who are they and what drove them to vote in such huge numbers, even during a pandemic?""

Robinson's column begins. ""What makes them tick? Is it culture? Tribalism? Race? How did they come to their worldview, and why do they cling to it so passionately? What do they mean for the future of American democracy? I'm talking about the opaque and inscrutable Joe Biden voter, of course.""

Pshaw! The voters, both of the Democratic Party and the general electorate, are just looking for a mildish form of social democracy, such as we find in the world's happiest countries like Sweden and Denmark.

Social democracy (antithetical to democratic socialism) means pure free market capitalism coupled with universal social insurance for things like health care and education. Vermont Capitalist League director Betsy Dorminey recently wrote it up as Vermont style 'crunchy conservatism' is what the country craves. She called it ""capitalism with a heart.""

Dorminey extolled Vermont's Republican governor, Phil Scott, as a great example of how to get it right. And for those who have been misled by those who libel the Nordics as socialist, that's just not so! As public intellectual Marian Tupy wrote in the Atlantic several years ago, those social democracies are more capitalist than us.

That analysis does not however throw much light on the amazing, sustained, popularity of Donald J. Trump. Trump drew the most votes ever received by a Republican presidential candidate and has, per AP as of the 25th of November, 74,113,538 votes. Many from passionate admirers.

I contend that Donald Trump is widely admired for, rather than despite, his brutal qualities. Before my Trump-devoted readers rise up against me, tar and feathers at the ready, this is not a slur. And we've seen it before.

TR, too, was a populist, a nationalist and a renegade. (Also, a Progressive.) President Donald Trump in some ways resembles President Teddy Roosevelt, last spotted on Mount Rushmore. After his tenure as president Teddy split with the GOP to create the Progressive (""Bull Moose"") Party. Teddy thereby stole the election from William Howard Taft, his successor and estranged former protégé. Teddy unrepentantly fomented the election of America's worst president ever, before or since, Woodrow Wilson. ""Stop the steal,"" anyone?

One of the whitewashed facts about Teddy Roosevelt was his brutality. He forged his political persona (if not, in reality, identity) as a ""Rough Rider,"" emerging from obscurity as the American commander of the Battle of San Juan Hill and went on to brutally conquer and occupy the Philippines.

And Teddy vaunted his prowess as a big game hunter who, together with his son Kermit, shot and killed over 500 elephants, giraffes, zebras, rhinos and other animals on a single African safari. Teddy told his psychologist, G. Stanley Hall, in a private 1899 chat, that ""Over-sentimentality, over-softness, in fact washiness and mushiness are the great dangers of this age and of this people. Unless we keep the barbarian virtues, gaining the civilized ones will be of little avail.""

Our era has abandoned heroes. Rather than embracing villains we have embraced the antihero. As Dr. H. Eric Bender wrote in Psychology Today, ""Antiheroes liberate us. They reject societal constraints and expectations imposed upon us. Antiheroes give our grievances a voice. They make us feel like something right is being done, even if it is legally wrong. Antiheroes do things we're afraid to do. They are who they are and they do as they want — without apology.""

So, let's look at the 2020 election as a fight between America's superego, Joe Biden, and America's id, Donald Trump. America's superego narrowly prevailed. Still, in our prevailing culture of anti-heroism, Donald J. Trump, political anti-hero, lives on, fascinating the teeming masses.

To which I can but say:

Klaatu barada nikto.

223,Benko,Ralph,newsmax,"Many of my conservative colleagues have succumbed to Biden Derangement Syndrome. It's the corollary to the Trump Derangement Syndrome that has plagued most of my progressive friends. If the report that Biden will appoint Janet Yellen as his Treasury Secretary bears out conservatives can exhale. And celebrate.

I wrote here recently in America Rises Up to Crush the Left: ""Biden, suave but nobody's patsy, will domesticate his party's left by throwing a sop or two to Cerberus. Big Reveal: The left was and is an imaginary hobgoblin.""

Full disclosure. ""An imaginary hobgoblin"" was an allusion to H.L. Mencken's In Defense of Women, wherein he wrote: ""Civilization, in fact, grows more and more maudlin and hysterical; especially under democracy it tends to degenerate into a mere combat of crazes; the whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed (and hence clamorous to be led to safety) by menacing it with an endless series of hobgoblins, most of them imaginary.""

Still true. Don't fall for it. Yet Biden is selecting distinguished, capable candidates to populate his White House and Cabinet. With a distinguished woman about to be put in charge of the most important economic office in the world Mencken's ""defense of women"" is nicely fulfilled.

In that column I wrote that Biden pacified his left wing during the campaign and will surely pacify it further upon taking the reins. So, let's leave the delicious theatricality of pearl-clutching terror in anticipation that Joe Biden is the second coming of Hugo Chavez. He's not.

The mere mention of Bernie Sanders, among others, as a possible secretary of labor is just the kind of ""sop to Cerberus"" that I also predicted. The Department of Labor, since FDR's distinguished New Deal architect Frances Perkins, has been an agency with modest influence. Moreover, mentioning Sanders is politic, not serious. President Biden cannot afford to create a Senate vacancy that could readily be won in the ensuing special election by the wildly popular Vermont governor, the Republican (yet still Honorable!), Phil Scott.

All of the names being floated for the Big Four federal agencies – State, Treasury, Defense and Justice – are consistent with my observation that ""America elected a calm and pragmatic social democrat, Joe Biden, not a Democratic Socialist delightful kook. … And he will preside over a center right Congress and center right states.""

Biden's short list of leading Treasury secretary candidates provides powerful evidence of Biden's pragmatic, pro-labor yet capitalist-friendly philosophy. Biden, like FDR, is a social democrat, not a socialist, and does not buy into the socialist class warfare nonsense that pits workers against the middle class. What does the Treasury appointment tell us?

Exhibit A: ""the dog that did not bark in the night."" Sen. Elizabeth Warren was actively jockeying to be Treasury secretary. She wasn't even on the Whisper List. Warren, a doctrinaire progressive, is probably the Democratic Party's loony left's favorite figure other than ""democratic"" socialist Bernie. Her name's absence is telling. Joe Biden is no Trojan Horse for the tiny but loud Bolshevik wing of the Democratic Party.

Exhibit B: The top of Biden's short list held superb choices. Per Politico's Transition Playbook: ""Janet Yellen as a potential Treasury Secretary, after Lael Brainard of the Federal Reserve Board initially seemed to have a lock on the position."" For Biden, as well as those of us (even Republicans!) committed to equitable prosperity, picking out Yellen and Brainard was a ""can't lose"" choice for America.

The Washington Post's contrarian Robert Samuelson, in December 2017, plausibly gave credit to Yellen for the original strong Trump-era economy. Samuelson: ""Under Yellen, the economy has made huge progress. Here's the record since she became Fed head in February 2014: Payroll employment has expanded by nearly 10 million jobs; the unemployment rate has dropped from 6.7 percent to 4.1 percent. … Yellen leaves a solid legacy, built on professional competence, integrity and dignity.""

As for Brainard, The New York Times recently, convincingly, extolled her. ""Jerome H. Powell, the Fed's chair, often praises Ms. Brainard's intellect in private conversations and has placed her in key roles at the central bank, including tapping her to play a major part in devising and overseeing the Fed's emergency lending programs. Ms. Brainard joined calls with staff members and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, the Fed's partner in planning those efforts, 21 times in April alone.""

We shall soon find out these, and more of, Biden's, appointments. Yellen to Treasury and Brainard to chair the Fed after Powell fulfills his term would maximize President Biden's chance of creating a climate of great job creation. Both women have proven capability, integrity and grace under pressure, giving Biden Derangement Syndrome sufferers more great reasons to climb down from the ledge.

224,Benko,Ralph,newsmax,"Turning and turning in the widening gyre

The falcon cannot hear the falconer;

Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold….

So proclaimed Yeats 100 years ago this month.

Classical liberal republicanism indeed may be falling. I'm a hardened classical liberal (meaning, conservative) republican (small r). Liberal as in committed to liberty, God-given and so fundamental that the government cannot legitimately infringe it. Republican? Citizens electing representatives to conduct the affairs of state so we can spend our time on more important things: family, work, and binge-watching streaming videos.

I've been decrying the death spiral of the republic, declaiming on Independence Day 2016 at Forbes.com, drawing, in part, on my old friend Jon Rauch's cover story in The Atlantic, How American Politics Went Insane. More recently, at Newsmax, I envisioned The End of Republican America, Dawn of a Trump Imperial Dynasty.

Donald Trump owns (we who speak leet: pwns) 73-plus million voters. His stubborn unwillingness to concede his election loss endears him further to his teeming millions.

Rauch, in his column, archly observed ""Donald Trump, [Jeb Bush] said, is 'a chaos candidate, and he'd be a chaos president.' Unfortunately for Bush, Trump's supporters didn't mind. They liked that about him.""

I myself am not enamored of chaos. That said, I did not vote for Biden. Nor, for that matter, for Trump, instead writing in the most qualified person I know. (America deserves the best. She lost, 150 million-to-one.)

Yet I consider the election outcome great. Notwithstanding Yeats' The Second Coming, the center can and did hold. Mere anarchy is not (quite) loosed upon the world. The center held from the state legislatures to the U.S. House of Representatives to the U.S. Senate to, notwithstanding mass hysteria, the presidency.

Yet Trump drew 73-plus million votes. A dire assessment of that phenomenon appeared in the canonical New York Review of Books, written by Fintan O'Toole, Democracy's Afterlife: Trump, the GOP, and the rise of zombie politics: ""Trumpism now is the GOP's death warmed over. … But the Trump presidency has been no nightmare. It has been daylight delinquency, its transgressions of democratic values on lurid display in all their corruption and cruelty and deadly incompetence. … The faithful … embraced that authoritarianism with renewed enthusiasm. The assault on democracy now has a genuine, highly engaged, democratic movement behind it.""

A democratic anti-democracy movement? We encounter a paradox! As Niels Bohr observed, ""Now we have some hope of making progress.""

As the wonderfully unsentimental Dima Vorobiev, an unabashed former Soviet propaganda executive observed:

""Democracy is like beauty. It's in the eye of the beholder. … You may say that people in different cultures have different concepts of democracy. So true. We in Russia have a very different idea of freedom compared to the West. In Russia, democracy means a ruler keeping an ear to the ground to stay in tune with the popular mood. We don't need Western-style accountability for our rulers and rotation of power. For us, it's just as well — and maybe even better — if they simply don't inconvenience us too much, but rather intuit our collective will and translate it into forceful action.""

My own obsession with classical liberal republicanism is old school, even revanchist. Representative democracy? The Bill of Rights? Quaint.

And an increasingly lonely stand.

The conservative and GOP establishments have joined ""the Trump Can Do No Wrong"" school. Unsettling. Yet if, per Thomas Picketty, democracy (which the Founding Fathers detested, as do I) does not deliver equitable results, maybe it is time to try something new.

Or return to something whose twenty centuries of stony sleep were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle?

Liberal republicanism served America, and the world, beautifully for a quarter millennium. I'm still enamored of my boyhood political heroes: Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, FDR and JFK. All liberal republicans, even the Democrats.

Maybe that's over. Then again, as Ethel Lina White once wrote, ""Lost causes are the only ones worth fighting for."" Do President Joseph Robinette Biden, Jr. and his second-in-command, Kamala Harris, have the mojo to sustain the American ""Empire of Liberty""?

Strong men now abound around the world. One recalls when my people, the people of Israel demanded a king. Samuel warned that a king would ""take your sons and appoint them to his chariots and to be his horsemen, and to run before his chariots. … He will take your daughters to be perfumers and cooks and bakers. He will take the best of your fields and vineyards and olive orchards and give them to his courtiers.

""But the people refused to listen to the voice of Samuel; they said, 'No! but we are determined to have a king over us, so that we also may be like other nations.'""

226,Benko,Ralph,washingtontimes,"ANALYSIS/OPINION:

Welcome, President-elect Biden! You will “preside” over a federal government nominally 40,000x bigger than it was in 1789 at its creation. Adjusted for inflation and population, it’s really “only” >300x bigger. In real dollars, Uncle Sam spends in a day close to what he used to spend in a year.

Election’s over. Back to business. The business of government is to spend our money. Love Big Government? Beyond your wildest dreams.

Uncle Sam has grown so massive that, Democrat or Republican, Washington Insider or citizen, we humans, officials like the president or congresspersons, card-carrying members of the Columnist Party like me, normal people, like you, have become as relevant to the scope of the government as barnacles on a derelict ship of state.

Love maxing out your AmEx? Here’s great news for you: The explosion of federal spending intensified under both the Obama-Biden administration and achieved apotheosis in the Trump-Pence administration. Credit, you should pardon the expression, where due. The unending spending frenzy is certain to continue.

But wait a second. Is our federal government really 40,000x bigger than the federal government President Washington ran?

Nominally, yes.

The mind boggles.

A nice summary of federal outlays, provided by infoplease.com, shows that Uncle Sam is now spending every day about what it spent, cumulatively (not per year), from 1789 to 1900 — 111 years of spending every day. Nominally. Yet: epic.

Welcome to a congressperson’s, and lobbyist’s, paradise.

From 1789-1849, altogether, Uncle Sam spent $1.09B. It took 60 years, cumulatively, to expend what the federal government now spends every 90 minutes or so. From 1850 to 1900 (including the Union’s bill for the Civil War), it spent $14.46B. That’s less than a day’s federal spending, now.

2010, when I first noted this? Annual spending of $3.55 trillion.

2020? $6.3 trillion.

Truly, spending of epic proportions.

The Congressional Budget Office projects 2020 federal spending of $6.6T or… over $18 billion a day. Datalab puts it at a svelte $16B/day. Hey, let’s not quibble. Uncle Sam’s spending more per day than it spent over its first five score and eleven years.

Beggars the imagination.

Paleoconservatives like me say we are against “Big Government.” How big is big? Hello my friends at Cato Institute, the epitome of small government advocacy. It was founded in 1977 when the federal government spent around $400B/year. Cato’s heroic small government advocacy has constrained Uncle Sam’s spending to $6.6 trillion/year.

Something to celebrate?

Let’s break it down. Nominally Uncle Sam is spending something like a nominal 40,000X more than in George Washington’s day. But let’s play fair.

Politicians rarely play fair. I’m not a politician. So let’s adjust for inflation and population growth. Thus, our federal government is merely ~300x bigger.

The classical gold standard on which America was, in practice, founded made the U.S. dollar retain its value for well over a century. A dollar was worth about the same in 1900 as at our founding in 1789. Thanks to Lyndon Johnson’s killing and Richard Nixon’s burying the gold standard, now it takes about $30 in 2020 dollars to buy an original dollar’s worth of goods.

So, adjusted for inflation, the federal government is merely around a 1,333X bigger than it was during the presidencies of the dudes of the Mount Rushmore club. Playing even fairer the population was 76,212,168 in 1900. Now it’s 331 million. About 4x bigger.

So, Uncle Sam is only nominally 40,000x bigger. Not really even 1,333x bigger. Only a mere ~300x bigger than back in the days of the statesmen portrayed on the $1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $50 and $100 bills.

When Americans for Tax Reform President Grover Norquist says he wishes to shrink the government down to fit into a bathtub, he has his work cut out for him. The famously corpulent President Taft had a 7-foot-long, 41-inch-wide, tub installed in the White House. We’d have to lay out about seven football-field-lengths of Taft tubs to begin to drain this swamp.

Of course, a rigorous economist would (and did) point out that comparing government spending as a percentage of GDP would be the fairest of them all. True. That said, do you really relish disposing your disposable income in taxes to support a Leviathan-scale state?

If so, congratulations.

As for me? Not so much.

Underneath all that lovely pomp and circumstance, the federal government surely will retain gargantuan proportions. The Pachyderms lavish our dough on the military. The Donks blow it on social programs.

Guns? Butter?

Matter of taste.

Profligate federal spending, whoever gets elected, has become the constant. Not a variable. We’re all just barnacles on a derelict Ship of State.

Welcome, President-elect Biden. Care to exit the federal deficit orgy? Try a capital gains tax-rate cut and a 3% spending cap.

Worked for President Clinton.

227,Benko,Ralph,newsmax,"We of the media, thanks to the yearning of our readers and viewers, are slaves to melodrama. Thus we fixate on the defeat of President Trump.

That's the story.

Not the takeaway.

Trump was beloved by millions (and detested by more millions). His fate is full of pathos. He fully deserves a few days basking in, per Shakespeare:

And all our yesterdays have lighted fools

The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!

Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player,

That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,

And then is heard no more. It is a tale

Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,

Signifying nothing. ...

One doubts that Trump will be heard no more. Whether he declares himself the leader of the Government-in-Exile or founds a media company (or both) we have not heard the last of him. More on that soon.

The takeaway?

America — the electorate, not Trump, not the GOP, not the Donks, and despite the Establishment media's shilling — crushed the left. Bravo, America! The electorate — the shareholders of the USA, as it were — retains control. Notwithstanding the pretensions of us Washington Insiders™ the voters can't be durably manipulated by us hired help.

The political class will either fail to notice or studiedly ignore this. That said, Judge Groo was right: you cannot fool all the people all the time. Take note.

Above and beyond this inconvenient truth, the crushing of the left is epic.

Is this just me reveling in my confirmation bias? Probably not. The Democratic Party primary voters crushed the hardest-left media darlings: Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, along with leftish curios like Pete Buttigieg, Beto O'Rourke, and Andrew Yang, among others. It buried their leftist billionaires Mike Bloomberg (who governed New York City pragmatically but listed so far left in the presidential race he politically capsized) and Tom Steyer.

The Democratic Party voters handily chose Joe Biden, the Establishment social democrat (very different from a ""Democratic Socialist,"" and carrying the endorsement of Frederick Hayek, one of liberty's greatest saints). Biden chose a strikingly pragmatic running mate, Kamala Harris, suavely domesticating his party's left wing during the race.

Biden, suave but nobody's patsy, will domesticate his party's left by throwing a sop or two to Cerberus. Big Reveal: The left was and is an imaginary hobgoblin.

The left's annihilation only begins there. Looks like the GOP will keep the Senate. Even if not, the Donks' failure to dominate means that the Senate crazies — I'm talkin' to you, Tammy Baldwin, Tom Carper, Mark Warner and Elizabeth Warren, the cabal boldly setting out to ""fundamentally reform"" capitalism — had their wings clipped good and hard.

But wait! There's more!

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who was always tough on her left-wing ""Squad"" — hi AOC, I still love you! — is getting hippie-punched by Democratic centrists for not being hard enough. Lesson learned!

The Establishment-Media-Political-Industrial Complex took notice. The center-left-leaning The Week points out that The Left Just Got Crushed. That merry libertarian mazik Dan Mitchell collects the white flags flown by the center-left Washington Post and New York Times. The giddily leftist New York Magazine headlines The 2020 Election Brought Progressives to the Brink of Catastrophe.

I have tediously repeated that while the Progressives have grabbed the microphone the pro-capitalism labor and the ethnic left (which I noted at Newsmax last March made Biden Trump's most formidable foe) voted for Trump in, relatively speaking, droves. Progressives do not legitimately speak for workers!

The left-wing DailyKos eloquently bemoans the Donks' failure to pocket any state legislatures. This thwarts their sinister plan to counter-gerrymander the House. ""Election night delivered nothing short of an unmitigated catastrophe for Democrats — and democracy — heading into the coming redistricting cycle. … Tuesday saw the GOP's edge expand to potentially four or five times as many districts as Democrats. ...""

There's far more carnage on the left but I don't wish to get penalized for unnecessary roughness. That said, the left has the resilience possessed by all fanatics, maniacs, lunatics and saints. 2020 might be a temporary setback.

Conservatives have a rare opportunity to raze the Progressive political edifice to the foundations and salt their earth. Democratic Party regulars will banish the Democratic Socialists to the Sierra Maestra. If only we conservatives could stop our internecine feuding long enough to politically eradicate the left we could make their political exile permanent.

One can dream. Alas we conservatives prefer circular firing squads to winning.

America is good. America elected a calm and pragmatic social democrat, Joe Biden, not a Democratic Socialist delightful kook. Biden is in the tradition of FDR, Harry Truman and JFK. And he will preside over a center right Congress and center right states. The calliope crashed to the ground.

Furthermore, I consider that Carthage must be destroyed.

228,Benko,Ralph,newsmax,"Donald Trump now rounds out his first term. He is sliding into home plate before a stadium of transfixed fans and foes. None are confident that he will be scored safe ... or out. To heighten the melodrama, Trump has called into question the integrity of the ump, positing that if he is called out it will be a travesty of justice. Perhaps one that he will not accept.

One thing is certain. Trump consistently manages to baffle both his friends and foes. White House advisor Jared Kushner, among those who know Trump best, passed the code book for decrypting Trump to Bob Woodward, four texts required to make sense of Trump. The most important one is cultural critic Scott Adams's ""Win Bigly: Persuasion in a World Where Facts Don't Matter.""

Whether we wish to treat Trump's first term as a teachable moment or whether we will need to equip ourselves to deal with a second (and, if the increasing likelihood of a Don, Jr. run in 2024 manifests, perhaps a third and a fourth) term it is valuable to crack the Trump code. Let's begin.

Scott Adams was one of very few public intellectuals to have predicted Trump's victory way back when 538 scored a Trump win at 2%. I noted with respect Adams's prediction at Forbes.com in 2015 and at Fortune.com in 2020. Adams and I have an unfair advantage.

We're both professionally trained hypnotists, me accredited by the National Guild of Hypnotists, the oldest, largest and most respected professional association of nonclinical hypnotists. What is hypnosis? To simplify per the late Stanford professor Ernest Hilgard simply ""believed-in imagination.""

I have the additional unfair advantage of having myself served as a White House official, under Reagan, and having worked intimately and successfully, for or with, executive branch agencies and the Congress. Given that in 1763 George Washington almost bankrupted himself by investing in a venture to drain the Great Dismal Swamp, Adams might consider my long-term immersion in the Swamp a disadvantage. I myself prefer to consider myself a swamp fox than a swamp rat.

In March 2016, Michael Cavna writing at The Washington Post distilled to six the persuasion techniques that really should go down in history as the Adams Principles. These are the factors that Trump used to win and to dominate.

As a side note, let's consider Trump's eerie resemblance to Rufus T. Firefly, the leader of Freedonia in Duck Soup. (""Rufus T. Firefly: You're a brave man. Go and break through the lines. And remember, while you're out there risking your life and limb through shot and shell, we'll be in be in here thinking what a sucker you are."")

So, thanks to Scott Adams, we can watch these principles at work in the endgame to the 2020 election (and, possibly, beyond). The Adams Principles?

1. Trump knows people are basically irrational.

2. Knowing that people are irrational, Trump aims to appeal on an emotional level.

3. By running on emotion, facts don't matter.

4. If facts don't matter, you can't really be ""wrong.""

5. With fewer facts in play, it's easier to bend reality.

6. To bend reality, Trump is a master of identity politics — and identity is the strongest persuader.

Want more? Adams, now blogging and tweeting at ScottAdamsSays, keeps up a running commentary. I have argued that Trump's profound hypnotic powers, initially beneficial to him, have frequently overflowed to the point where he hypnotizes himself to his catastrophic detriment.

Adams took my point, wittily tweeting in rejoinder that ""I never rule out the possibility I am the one hallucinating. But let's see who predicts the best."" My purpose was not to dispute Scott Adams but to ponder whether Adams has taken his own thesis, as to Trump's hypnotic prowess, to its logical conclusion.

Trump drives the left apoplectic by his proficient and consistent use of ""the Adams Principles."" Thus, in watching the televised conclusion to this episode in political history let's consider one final, delicious, irony.

Trump did not invent the rhetorical principles he employs. And Adams simply codifies them. One of the most significant pioneers in promoting the principle that ""facts don't matter"" surely is left-wing icon Jacques Derrida, founder of deconstructionism.

Per the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ""In his final works on sovereignty, in particular, Rogues (2003), Derrida shows that the law always contains the possibility of suspension, which means that even the most democratic of nations (the United States for example) resembles a 'rogue state' or perhaps is the most 'roguish' of all states.""

So to my many progressive frenemies may I say? What goes around comes around.

And to add insult to irony …

even Derrida had a precursor.

Rufus T. Firefly.

229,Benko,Ralph,westernjournal,"Thomas Klingenstein, the chairman of the Claremont Institute, has recently precipitated a national discussion on an important topic: America the Good vs. Cancel America. Klingenstein confidently proclaims that Donald Trump, despite his real flaws, is the man of the hour because he unflinchingly stands for the proposition that America is good.

Klingenstein concedes that Joe Biden also believes that America is good. That said, he believes that Biden is undermined by being the leader of a Democratic Party contaminated, perhaps dominated, by a “Cancel America” faction.

The activist left wing of the Democratic Party believes that America is fatally flawed and morally bankrupt. This sentiment goes way back. It is now reaching a crescendo in a “cancel America” crusade. It must be countered.

The 1958 bestseller “The Ugly American” used the title epithet ironically. It was meant to convey that the protagonist, Homer Atkins, was physically, not morally, unattractive — motivated by compassion, not insensitivity.

Innuendo, however, trumps irony. “The Ugly American” became an anti-U.S. epithet. It was used by America’s own cultural elite to flagellate our nation. It became a progenitor of our current “cancel America” jihadis.

Hostility to patriotism creates a notable headwind in the wind tunnel that is American media. Despite that, The Washington “Democracy Dies in Darkness” Post recently departed from spreading the darkness of cultural Marxism and “ugly American” slurs.

The Post published an article celebrating the hundredth birthday of a living, if obscure, humanitarian American airman, Hal Halvorsen, aka the “Candy Bomber.”

Postwar Berlin’s supply lines had been blockaded by the Soviet Union. America was doing an airlift of basic necessities to the German people. Halvorsen was an American pilot who encountered a group of emaciated German children inspiring Halvorsen to take his relief mission one step further.

He promised the children he would airdrop them chocolate bars, wiggling his wings so they would know which plane to look for. He took up a collection from fellow GI’s, tied handkerchiefs to hundreds of Hershey bars and rained them from the sky the next day and on many other occasions.

The image of an American soldier giving his candy to liberated children used to be a regular thing. Then, Gen. William Westmoreland ruined it all by maniacally imposing the doctrine of overwhelming force on the people of Vietnam.

Laboring under the bankrupt Westmoreland doctrine, Capt. Ernest Medina, before the battle of My Lai, was asked by one of his men, “Are we supposed to kill women and children?” The answer? “Kill everything that moves.”

The result was a catastrophic setback to America’s reputation for goodness, to American morale and to America’s political will. Westmorelandism also replaced the image of the benevolent GI handing out candy bars to the local kids with that of American airmen napalming innocent children.

The American cultural narrative went from John Wayne’s heroic “Sands of Iwo Jima” to Marlon Brando’s “Apocalypse Now.”

The damage to America’s reputation as good lingers to this day. But it’s an atavism.

RELATED: Dick Morris: Tucker Carlson Gets It Wrong

Westmoreland was an anomaly. David Petraeus replaced Westmoreland’s doctrine of “overwhelming force” with an insight from a novel about the loss of French Indochina, “The Centurians” by Jean Lartéguy, uttered by the fictional Pierre Raspéguy: “You’ve got to have the people on your side … if you want to win.”

Petraeus restored both effectiveness and sheer goodness to the U.S. Army. We await someone to restore a deserved sense of goodness to American political culture. Perhaps that time now arrives.

I have elsewhere made the analytical and rhetorical case for America’s true red-white-and-blue goodness. That said, experience matters more than mere logic. One of the lessons learned from spending most of my adult life in Washington is that Congress governs more on anecdote than analysis.

Common sense trumps logic. As well it should.

So, thank you Washington Post, for retelling the story of the American “Candy Bomber.” Let’s savor the recollection of his sweetening the lives of those immiserated by the Red Army. More to the point, this is just one of thousands of anecdotes to bring to the fore in restoring America’s appreciation of its own goodness.

Crypto-fascist “antifa” and their “allies” relentlessly indict the sins of America’s founders, icons and heroes. That’s scorched-earth politics. Rejecting that toxic tactic let us sweeten, rather than poison, the American political well from which all drink.

Liberal — liberty-loving — Americans of the right, as well as the patriotic, labor and ethnic left, have innumerable stories to tell of American generosity, kindness and goodness.

Let’s recover and tell those stories of goodness to re-establish the civic narrative on which our future happiness depends: America is good. Not just a great story. It has the added benefit of being true.

Happy 100th birthday, Hal Halvorsen.

230,Benko,Ralph,spectator,"America’s goodness is self-evident to me, and to most conservatives and, not insignificantly, to most labor and ethnic Democrats. That said, when the civic cornerstone of America comes under assault, we must root our conviction in fact rather than in faith.

This is the call to action by Claremont Institute chair Thomas Klingenstein, with whom I have a professional association, who triggered a big Amen Corner with his new speech exhorting conservatives to extol, and the GOP to avow, America as good and fight the “Cancel America” crusaders.

Those who extol America must not seek to persuade the Adversary, as Satan was considered in Jewish theology. The far Left is merely the Devil’s Advocate in the court of public opinion. We will never persuade cultural Marxists who consider America an “insane monster” as a matter of dogma.

No, most of those who vilify America as bad to the bone are operating in bad faith. I have called progressives out at large and on campus as totalitarians.

The vilifiers of America were doxed by Thomas G. West and William A. Schambra, who wrote lucidly about this way back in 2007 at Heritage.org:

While the Progressives differed in their assessment of the problems and how to resolve them, they generally shared in common the view that government at every level must be actively involved in these reforms. The existing constitutional system was outdated and must be made into a dynamic, evolving instrument of social change, aided by scientific knowledge and the development of administrative bureaucracy.

Consider, for instance, the recently self-humiliated Jeffrey Toobin. Well before his recent fall from progressive grace, Toobin had gone on record as a leader in the “War on the Constitution.” He aggressively inveighed, in the New Yorker, against “Our Broken Constitution.”

Toobin made a thinly veiled totalitarian critique:

It’s often noted that the United States is governed by the world’s oldest written constitution that is still in use. This is usually stated as praise, though most other products of the eighteenth century, like horse-borne travel and leech-based medical treatment, have been replaced by improved models.

Totalitarians believe that “government at every level must be actively involved” in our lives. Thus, whatever stands in the government’s way — atavisms such as checks and balances, separation of powers, federalism, the Bill of Rights — must be disposed of.

Make no mistake, totalitarianism has informed the euphemistically veiled progressive movement since progressive President Woodrow Wilson slyly undermined the black letter and original intention of the Constitution by his insidious demand, “All that progressives ask or desire is permission — in an era when development, evolution, is a scientific word — to interpret the Constitution according to the Darwinian principle; all they ask is recognition of the fact that a nation is a living thing and not a machine.”

Underhandedly suave!

Wilson, who has been indicted and convicted for his racism and eugenics in the court of public opinion, had your typical progressive messianic tendencies. He was all for accumulating as close to total power in his own hands as possible. And he was explicit in invoking “Darwinism” — as in Social Darwinism — as his ethos. Upping the ante, the Nazis and the Soviets, the most prominent exemplars of totalitarianism of the 20th century, were nihilists engaged in domination for domination’s sake.

Most classical liberals, libertarians, and conservatives consider the Constitution to be just fine, thank you. It’s not the Constitution that is broken. It’s the rogue federal government that has loosened where it has not fully broken free of its constitutional shackles.

Many conservatives, because they operate in good faith, mistakenly impute good faith to our ideological adversaries. Big mistake. Our adversaries are not operating in good faith. They are engaged, as I have previously written in The American Spectator, in a fanatically egalitarian cultural revolution.

America, the nation, is good for specific, irrefutable reasons. Nobody serious entertains the pretense that America is “perfect or all-wise.” That said, America simply has been history’s greatest political force for good.

That’s a bold claim. Not a chauvinistic one. It is provable.

America was self-consciously chartered to be a noble experiment in classical liberal (as in “liberty” and human rights sacrosanct even from government violation) republicanism (small “r,” denoting representative democracy). The United States was conceived, from its idealistic inception in Thomas Paine’s Common Sense, to “cancel” the legitimacy of monarchy and establish the legitimacy of classical liberal republicanism.

That was a radically humanitarian proposition. It remains so to this day.

That radical proposition was reiterated in the Declaration of Independence. It was anchored in the Constitution. It was embellished by the Bill of Rights and subsequent Amendments expanding voting rights and enshrining further rights in the supreme law of the land.

The revolutionary achievement of liberal republicanism is so monumental as to be hard to absorb. For all human history the world was governed by despots, kings and emperors. Enter American republicanism, deemed by the conventional wisdom of the day a near absurdity.

Liberal republicanism gained power with practice. Thomas Jefferson dreamed that America would prove not a mere enclave of liberty but that it would go on to generate an Empire of Liberty. Americans are pledged to, and continue to expand, liberty and justice for all.

America, after achieving continental scope, entered World War I to “make the world safe for democracy.” Before the Great War something like 80 percent of the world was governed by five empires. By 1922, the four most autocratic, the Ottoman, Russian, Chinese, and Austro-Hungarian, disappeared. The least autocratic, Great Britain, entered terminal decline.

America entered World War II to fight Nazi Germany and fascist Italy and imperial Japan. We won, implanting liberal republicanism throughout Western Europe and in Japan. We then joined that long, twilight Cold War against totalitarian communism, a war which ran hot and heroic in Korea and Vietnam and throughout perched the free world on the precipice of a nuclear holocaust.

America won. We liberated the Soviet satellites from totalitarian rule to embrace liberal republicanism, freed the constituent Soviet republics such as Georgia and Ukraine, and softened the communist metropoles, Moscow and Beijing, from totalitarian to authoritarian. By heroically achieving such humanitarian political, economic, and social goods, for itself and for the world, America surpassed all other nations in recorded history for sheer goodness.

Is there more to be done? Always. That said, it is wrong to make the best the enemy of the good.

America is good.

For those of us, center right, center left, and center who believe in republicanism, liberty, and unalienable rights, America’s political compromises and moral blemishes are dwarfed by America’s humanitarian accomplishments. At great risk and cost in blood and treasure America succeeded in liberating much of the world from despotism.

Epic sacrifices by America and Americans in a century of guerre à outrance against autocrats and tyrants vastly outweigh our imperfections. That America is good is not merely self-evident. The case for America’s goodness is irrefutable.

To live up to the goodness of our history and secure the goodness of the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, Americans in 2020 and henceforth must unequivocally affirm that America is good.

231,Benko,Ralph,newsmax,"In the past year we've heard a great deal about ""Democratic Socialists"" thanks to Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez. Now, both Halloween and Election Day are approaching. A night and a day devoted to the kooky and the spooky ...

Come closer, children. Let me tell you a spooky story for this spooky season.

Once upon a time, within living memory of the very elderly, like me, actual Democratic Capitalists roamed the land, unashamed! Democratic Capitalists were considered ""normal.""

They may return! Insert ominous organ spike here!

As I revealed in Chapter Two of my latest book, The Ten Commandments of Capitalism, the most radical Reagan tax-rate cuts, cutting the top rate from 70% to 28%, were initiated and led by Democrats. Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, a loyal Chicago Democrat, cut the top income tax rate from 70% to 50%. Then, Sen. Bill Bradley and Rep. Dick Gephardt, both real-deal labor Democrats, led the charge to cut the top rate to 28%.

Spookier! Democratic Capitalism didn't end there.

President Clinton signed into law a whopping cut in the capital gains tax rate from 28% to 20%. Clinton reformed welfare, cut tariffs, kept inflation in check and restrained federal spending growth so well that, compared to his successors, he resembled that icon of capitalism, that skinflint, Scrooge McDuck. As supply-side thought leader Charles Kadlec wrote at Forbes.com, ""The boom was on.""

Scared yet? No? Well.

Even spookier! Democratic Capitalism didn't begin there.

JFK promised and LBJ enacted cutting the top rate from 91% to 70%. President Jimmy Carter, although hopeless on inflation and taxes, was wonderfully pro-capitalism in cutting onerous bureaucratic red tape.

President Jimmy ""Killer Rabbit"" Carter?

Hero of deregulation?

Spooky but true.

This month we celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, passed by a Democratic Congress and signed by President Carter.

Per a press release issued by the Association of American Railroads, ""Today's nimble, resilient rail network is built upon the rock-solid foundation laid 40 years ago with the signing of the Staggers Act,"" said AAR President and CEO Ian Jefferies. ""In the face of a dynamic competitive landscape, the smart regulatory framework, which predominantly relies on market forces to govern rail rates, still empowers railroads to invest, innovate and deliver for customers and communities every day. Staggers has stood the test of time and remains just as relevant and essential in 2020 as it was in 1980.""

But wait. There's more.

On Election Day, 2020, there is a chance, some say a majority chance, that the Democrats could regain the White House and even take the US Senate majority.

Political and economic apocalypse now? Insert ominous organ spike here!

But consider … the craft beer renaissance. During the Epoch of Reagan I founded the capital's most iconic monthly gathering of free market economists, the Prosperity Caucus , now entering its 35th year, its leadership having devolved from me to Steve Moore, Bob Stein, James Carter, James Lucier, and, now, Ike Bannon.

(Warning! Jon Decker, national director of the 138,000+ Capitalist League's youth league, is staging an even more convivial monthly gathering of free market thinkers. OK, as that great capitalist Ludwig Erhard once wrote, ""Prosperity Through Competition!""

Up your game, Ike!)

What do these two ferociously festive free-market groups have in common?

Beer.

$5 at the Prosperity Caucus still buys you (now, as when I subsidized it in the 1980's and 90's) all the beer you can drink and all the pizza you can eat (before the rations run out). Deregulation cuts consumer costs!

Cheap great beer, along with lowered shipping costs, may be another feather in President Carter's wee war bonnet. There's a merry argument among libertarians (who live to argue, no, not you, Libertarian Party presidential nominee Jo Jorgenson, your partisans) about whether to credit America's craft beer renaissance to Jimmy Carter's deregulation of that industry.

John Harry, writing for The National Museum of American History, states: ""The next time you raise a glass of craft beer, make sure you toast former President Jimmy Carter. No, really. You should be offering your suds up to the man who was reported by the media during the 1976 election to be a non-drinker. As crazy as it may seem now, homebrewing used to be illegal and Jimmy Carter actually played a part in changing that, contributing to the craft beer revolution."" James Fallows at The Atlantic reports the controversy swirling around crediting the abstemious Jimmy Carter with our craft beer renaissance.

While we endure election night… week … month … whatever … raise a mug of deregulated craft beer to the Staggers Act … and to Capitalism. Could a Democratic sweep two weeks from now usher in a new age of Democratic Capitalism?

Spooky thought!

232,Benko,Ralph,newsmax,"Most of America's political elites misunderstand politics. They think elections, and the endless political skirmishing between them that has replaced governing, is about personalities. Or issues. Or policy.

That view is largely true in ordinary times when both Republicans and Democrats readily stand and cover our hearts during the National Anthem. Not so in this extraordinary time of existential challenge to the very legitimacy of America. These are the times that try men's souls.

Seeing politics as a clash of personalities or policies is counting trees, blinded to the forest itself. Today politics is fundamentally about who wields the power to support, or destroy, our esteem for America. Now comes one man, Thomas D. Klingenstein, [replace with , with whom I am professionally associated, chairman of the board of one of the most distinguished intellectual centers of the center right, the Claremont Institute.

From that commanding height Klingenstein unflinchingly makes the case for the goodness of America: ""What the election is about is the character of America: Specifically is America a good country or a bad country."" (Emphasis supplied.)

He indicts the fanatics who opportunistically infect the Democratic Party: ""They have told us and what they have withheld (because it still sounds too radical) we can infer from their purpose. They want reparations, endless affirmative action, genuine socialism, open borders, hassle-free abortions, gun confiscation, and they want destroy, or radically restructure, those institutions that teach the values and principles that undergird the American way of life: family, education , religion , community life , and much more.""

And he strips away their sugar coating, ""progressive,"" ""social justice warriors,"" ""political correctness,"" calling them out for what they are: ""As is patently clear, this new society can only be imposed by a tyrannical government.""

Tyranny? This indictment has power. The left's primary source document, The Communist Manifesto, unleashing the specter of a declaration of class warfare that has haunted the world ever since, explicitly calls for ""despotic inroads"" to destroy the middle class (the ""bourgeoisie."")

Klingenstein makes a bulletproof case for his proposition that ""Republicans should frame the election just this way."" He is right both as to the only viable political strategy for 2020, and, come what may, the existentially necessary strategy for America.

My own writings, over years, have called out the ""progressives"" as totalitarians. As I put it most succinctly toward the end of Donald Trump's first year as president, ""Is America beautiful? Or evil?"" Just last month, right here at Newsmax, I stated, ""The hard left is actively working to eradicate the classical liberal republican culture conscientiously created by America's founders. The left is attempting to obliterate, or at minimum create a revisionist, history to advance another political order. What order? Totalitarianism.""

Do I overstate the case for Klingenstein's potential impact? By no means.

Moral clarity, consistently applied, is the most powerful force in politics.

Consider a previous Thomas: In 1775, the colonies that would become the United States of America were demoralized, confused, and ineffectual in opposing the oppressions of Great Britain. Then came one thin pamphlet by a previously obscure figure, Thomas Paine, titled Common Sense. History.com describes its impact as ""one of the most influential pamphlets in American history. Credited with uniting average citizens and political leaders behind the idea of independence, 'Common Sense' played a remarkable role in transforming a colonial squabble into the American Revolution.""

Klingenstein who recognizes, something the left is clear about but few on the right grasp, that we are confronting not a culture war but a cultural revolution, injects comparable moral clarity. The left is making ""the long march through the institutions"" to eradicate classical liberal (as in liberty) Judeo-Christian republican (as in representative democracy) capitalism with totalitarian, agnostic, radically undifferentiated equality and socialism.

What is crucial, what Klingenstein commands, is a cultural counterrevolution. Moral clarity will provide the winning tailwind to the cultural counterrevolutionaries much as Paine did the original American revolutionaries. That said, it's not ""one and done.""

After Common Sense, Paine wrote a series of pamphlets called The American Crisis to sustain the original revolution. The first issue, written by campfire light using a drumhead as a desk, began: THESE are the times that try men's souls. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country; but he that stands by it now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered; yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.

233,Benko,Ralph,newsmax,"Let us all, Republican and Democrat, conservative and progressive, old and young, pray for a speedy recovery for President Trump.

Both nominees belong to an age group (Trump, age 74, Biden, age 77) especially vulnerable to the coronavirus. That highlights a key fact about this election. It's not so much right vs. left. It's more about the last hurrah of us boomers before passing the torch to a rising generation there in the on-deck circle waiting for its at-bats.

OK, boomers?

I'm a baby boomer and proud of our record. We won the Cold War, defeating the Communist Evil Empire. We did the impossible by sending (thanks JFK!) heroes to the moon and bringing them back safely (hello there, Buzz Aldrin!). We invented the Internet (thanks, Bob and Vint) and deployed it (thank you, Al Gore!) worldwide via the Web (thanks Sir Tim!). We more than octupled world GDP, from $11 trillion in 1980 to close to $88 trillion (thanks Jack Kemp and Bob Mundell!). We rescued billions from the brink of famine and from dire poverty.

And, oh, yeah, we created Rock 'n' Roll.

Impressive.

But then….

It's been a hard day's night.

We boomers ran out of steam around the turn of the millennium. Around 20 years ago we lost our mojo. The tide of world prosperity we generated began to ebb. 9/11 and our subsequent invasion of the Middle East disrupted the peace. America faltered in its mission of spreading the ""Empire of Liberty.""

The internet continued to support human flourishing. Thank you Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft! Yet we boomers dropped the ball by deeply cutting government R&D spending. Technological progress became more incremental than transformational. (Sorry, Elon.)

Yet we boomers clung, and cling, to power. Nobody voluntarily gives up power and its perks. We boomers aggressively wrested power from our parents, the generation that so heroically vanquished the Nazis, Fascists, Imperial Japan. Tom Brokaw dubbed them ""the Greatest Generation.""

We vanquished them. We boomers marched in the street to protest the draft, end the Vietnam War, agitate for civil and women's rights. The Greatest Generation did not docilely turn over power. We took power.

And had a great run. Then, we ran out of steam. Generation X defaulted when it was their time to seize power from us. They were just too darn good natured. Millennials, fortunately, not so much.

We boomers did not end history. Good! No challenges, no glory! Bismarck is said to have said, ""We must leave some problems for our grandchildren to solve."" We boomers replaced the threat of world starvation with … an obesity epidemic. Our prosperity generated serious, although solvable, ecological problems: habitat collapse, soil degradation, ocean pollution, which the left's hobgoblin of CO2-induced climate change tends to obscure but not evade.

W, Obama, and Trump's comparatively weak economic growth led to horrendous deficits, public and private. If we had kept the Reagan/Clinton policies and attendant growth rates for the past 20 years America's annual income would be $30 trillion, not $20 trillion, solving many social problems. And due to our fumble the world started edging away from liberal republicanism, America's signature political achievement.

The risk of a reactionary Little Dark Age is real. OK, boomers?

My problem with the 2020 election is not with the candidates. Biden belongs to the tail end of the Greatest Generation, Trump to the vanguard of the baby boom. The candidates are not the problem. The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars / But in ourselves….

The real problem? This election is but an echo of yesteryear, a reenactment of a bygone era. The story we boomers grew up with – a Cold War, the world perched on the edge of a nuclear holocaust – has collapsed. Yet America is still acting like we're at war.

War's over. We won.

We blessedly confront rivals, not enemies.

Russia is a shadow of the USSR.

China is a formidable rival, not an enemy.

OK, old habits die hard. America spent a century at war. We fought World War I to make the world ""safe for democracy"" against Empire. WWII was an epic fight against the totalitarian dictators of the West. WWIII, the Cold War, was a noble fight against the dictatorships of the East. And won.

So here we are Election 2020, watching reruns of the 20th century. Zzzz….. We boomers lack the imagination and energy to scale new heights, transcending the world's presenting problems.

2020 doesn't matter nearly as much as the media hype would suggest. It's the demography, stupid!

The real deal?

In 2024 the millennials will take over.

High time.

234,Benko,Ralph,newsmax,"The Democrats may or may not win the presidency and majority control of the U.S. Senate. If they do, left wing hotheads are proposing some extremist rule changes. Progressives lust to dominate the federal government and are proposing to rewrite some venerable political rules.

Democratic Party militants are agitating to eliminate the filibuster, pack or term limit the U.S. Supreme Court, abolish the electoral college, and add D.C., Puerto Rico and maybe Samoa to spangle Old Glory to pad their Senate majority.

Armageddon?

I say, game on!

There are plenty of countermoves by the regulars in both parties to make these advocates of mob rule rue the day they decided to start playing with fire. To paraphrase Dirty Harry, ""Feeling lucky, Punk?""

Per Politico, one guy they will need to steamroller to get their way is the genial-but-nobody's-patsy Joe Biden. ""Reforming the Supreme Court and ending the Senate's legislative filibuster are emerging as litmus test issues by progressive activists intent on addressing the anti-majoritarian biases of those two conservative-dominated institutions. Joe Biden is on record as opposing both reforms.""

Unlikely that the progressive malcontents, who Biden handily domesticated during his presidential campaign, are going to roll their party's newly elected president. Biden is avuncular but he's been winning at big stakes political poker for longer than most of his dissidents have been alive. He'll make an example of a few to show the rest what it feels like to have your head politely but firmly handed to you.

Abolish the Electoral College? As even the pretty-in-pink NPR reported, there is virtually zero chance of passing a constitutional amendment to abolish the electoral college. That said, it would be tactically useful — and rather fun — to bait Tom Steyer into squandering some billions riding into this political box canyon.

In politics, like baseball (as slugger Wee Willie Keeler said), one secret to winning is to ""Hit 'em where they ain't."" So, hey lefties, bring it on!

And how can you stack or term limit the Supreme Court if your own president refuses to flip flop and nominate supplementary justices? Progressives? If you do roll Biden, then there's keeping enough of your Congressional centrists on board this incendiary plan. And in the unlikely event that the wild-eyed malcontents can roll their pragmatists … wake up GOP!

There's nothing in the Constitution setting the number of members of Congress at 435. Counterpunch with a demand to unpack the House, cutting the number of congressional districts by, say, half. We just eliminated CA-12, Speaker Pelosi's district? Mirabile dictu!

Could the Republicans pull that off? Of course not! The threat alone could be enough to engage the party regulars to sober up their ""squads"" lest the genie of fiddling with the number of seats escape the bottle of public ignorance.

Add three new states? It's not at all clear that the Constitution allows D.C. to become a state without a constitutional amendment. That's no trivial obstacle. Puerto Rico? Its politics are, well, turbulent. It had three governors within one week last year. Not necessarily a mulligan for adding Democratic senators. Then there's that pesky $74 billion debt to deal with. Assuming that Puerto Rico even wants statehood. Potential quagmire.

Samoa? God bless Samoa! Population of 55,212 sprinkled over 77 square miles, almost 5,000 miles off America's coast. Giving Samoa two U.S. Senators would make gerrymandering, that imaginary hobgoblin of the loony left, look like statesmanship by contrast. Won't happen.

Plus the GOP owns the real .44 Magnum here: Texas. Texas has the unalloyed right, without congressional approval, to create four new states. Texans haven't split Texas up because Texans are big galoots. They've assumed Texas would have to break up into 5 Tennessee-size states. Texans like Texas big. But hold on, pardner.

This overlooks a key fact. The Texas annexation joint resolution of 1845 allows Texas to split into 5 states of ""convenient"" size and having ""sufficient"" population. Anything bigger than Rhode Island is ipso facto of convenient size and anything with a population greater than Wyoming's 586,107 is of sufficient population.

(Republican) Texas Governor Greg Abbott in concert with the (Republican) Texas legislature could deftly carve out four ""Tiny Texases"" – coincidentally, all Republican! – sacrificing only maybe 3% of the Lone Star State's territory and less than 10% of its population.

Big Texas stays Big while lifting Texas's presence in the Senate from two to 10. Bonus: four new governors and four new congresspeople, all Republican, 16 new statewide offices. Texas could gift wrap and give each of President Trump's kids a high office with plenty left over, swamping any possible gains from feckless Democratic maneuvering. (Governor Abbott? What's stopping you?)

So. Should we fear progressive hooligans rigging the game if the Dems run the table next month?

Go ahead punk.

236,Benko,Ralph,newsmax,"We are enjoying, or suffering, an epoch of the toppling of statues. Now consider the recent demand for the ""contextualization"" (meaning the embedding of critical plaques) on, among others, the Washington Monument and Jefferson Memorial. What's really going on?

It will come as a surprise to some, especially anti-big-government libertarians and my fellow paleoconservatives, that Washington, D.C., was abolished … 150 years ago. Yet its ghost persists. This persistence would not have surprised Ronald Reagan (whose name still adorns, however temporarily, the main airport serving our nation's capital.) Reagan, in 1964: ""A government bureau is the nearest thing to eternal life we'll ever see on this earth.""

When D.C. was first created it included two incorporated cities, Georgetown and Washington. Both were abolished (although nobody, as a colloquial matter, seems to have noticed) in 1871 when the Congress revoked these cities' legal existence and replaced them with the District of Columbia. As an aside, in the ""the more things change, the more things stay the same"" department an early D.C. governor undertook infrastructure projects costing 3 times the amount authorized, bankrupting the District.

We've seen the denaming of Mount McKinley in Alaska and, recently, Princeton's Woodrow Wilson school. Why not dename a gargantuan obelisk on the national mall and a domed colonnade on the tidal basin? While at it, why not persecute those who persist in referring to America's capital by its deadname, ""Washington?"" While at it, why not change Columbia, an allusion to that imperialist Columbus?

Let me tell you why. Doing so represents a step away from liberal republicanism and toward totalitarianism.

President Franklin ""Big Government"" Roosevelt commissioned and dedicated the memorial to the libertarian Jefferson. FDR concluded his dedication: ""He believed, as we do, that the average opinion of mankind is in the long run superior to the dictates of the self-chosen. During all the years that have followed Thomas Jefferson, the United States has expanded his philosophy into a greater achievement of security of the nation, security of the individual and national unity, than in any other part of the world. It may be that the conflict between the two forms of philosophy will continue for centuries to come; but we in the United States are more than ever satisfied with the republican form of Government. ...""

FDR, a social democrat (not ""democratic socialist""), could also recognize himself as, as he was, a liberal (as in libertarian) republican. He knew that his predecessors like Washington and Jefferson were worthy to be exalted in spite of their faults. Their sin of slaveholding is, as it deserves to be, condemned. That said, to tarnish the monuments to their heroic, noble, achievement of creating a liberal republic — one that eventually eradicated slavery — by ""contextualizing"" is tone deaf and wrong-headed. The context of that context is all wrong.

Abhorring slavery, I stand in opposition to the denamers and ""contextualizers,"" extensions of ""cancel culture,"" itself a euphemism for the suppression of our freedoms of speech and of the press. I, an old school liberal republican reprobate, deplore every totalitarian impulse. And that is what this is.

The left's playbook was written by Antonio Gramsci, who died a martyr imprisoned by the Italian fascists for his real (rather than mob rule ""antifa"") antifascism. Gramsci was that rara avis, a liberal, non-totalitarian, Communist. One of Gramsci's most powerful contributions to political thought, something now fallen into enemy hands, was the concept of ""cultural hegemony.""

The hard left is actively working to eradicate the classical liberal republican culture conscientiously created by America's founders. The left is attempting to obliterate, or at minimum create a revisionist, history to advance another political order. What order? Totalitarianism.

George Orwell anticipated this. ""Cancel culture"" is the action of the ThinkPol, the ""Thought Police,"" prosecuting ""Thought Crimes,"" political adjuncts to ""Newspeak,"" the foundation of the totalitarian cultural hegemony. Orwell anticipated the current effort to rename or, by ""contextualizing,"" defame America's founders as intrinsic to the ""pro-fa"" crusade under way.

Orwell spelled it out in The Principles of Newspeak. ""The purpose of Newspeak was not only to provide a medium of expression for the world-view and mental habits proper to the devotees of Ingsoc [English Socialism], but to make all other modes of thought impossible. It was intended that when Newspeak had been adopted once and for all and Oldspeak forgotten, a heretical thought — that is, a thought diverging from the principles of Ingsoc— should be literally unthinkable, at least so far as thought is dependent on words.""

As one of those few remaining fluent in Oldspeak let me give it to you straight up. Abolish Washington? Been there, done that.

Dename or defame the Washington Monument and Jefferson Memorial? Washington Monuments Falling Down, Falling Down, Falling Down? One giant leap for totalitarianism.

237,Benko,Ralph,newsmax,"Trump. Donald, Melania, Ivanka, Donald Jr., Eric, Lara, Tiffany. The cavalcade of Trumps during the Republican National Convention conjures up the fantastic possibility of an imperial Trump Dynasty.

President Donald Trump, succeeded by Donald Jr, then by Ivanka ... with her vice president, Jared, ready to succeed her? Unless, as Donald Trump recently suggested, suspend the Constitutional limitation on the presidency to two terms. That might confine the succession from Donald to Donald Jr., then on to the most gifted of the Trump grandchildren.

Impossible? Tell it to the Romans.

As Jason Daley wrote in Smithsonian Magazine: ""The U.S. Constitution owes a huge debt to ancient Rome. … Leaders like Thomas Jefferson and James Madison read the historian Polybius, who laid out one of the clearest descriptions of the Roman Republic's constitution, where representatives of various factions and social classes checked the power of the elites and the power of the mob. It's not surprising that in the United States' nascent years, comparisons to ancient Rome were common. And to this day, Rome, whose 482-year-long Republic, bookended by several hundred years of monarchy and 1,500 years of imperial rule, is still the longest the world has seen.""

Interesting. America's great seal bears the (Latin!) motto ""Novo Ordo Seclorum."" New Order of the Ages. America was constituted to overthrow an imperium going back to Rome with liberal republicanism.

We did so, and splendidly.

For a while.

Is that era over?

Julius Caesar ended the Roman republic. He infamously assumed dictatorial powers and was then assassinated by those more remembered for treachery than for heroism. Then, Gaius Octavius took Julius's patronymic ""Caesar,"" coupled it with the epithet Augustus, and, over four years, made himself emperor in all but name.

Rome thrived under Caesar Augustus. He ruled for 40 years, succeeded by the less distinguished, some scandalous, Caesars of the Julio-Claudian family dynasty. Such was Augustus's prestige that ""Caesar"" echoed through millennia as ""Kaiser"" and ""Czar.""

How might this be relevant to America?

On July 4, 2016 I wrote a column with the nicely understated headline Independence Day 2016, The Death Spiral of the Republic, ""The Chaos that Caused Trump."" It began by recounting: ""The close of the Constitutional Convention of 1787: A lady [one Mrs. Powel of Philadelphia] asked Dr. Franklin Well Doctor what have we got a republic or a monarchy[?] — A republic replied the Doctor if you can keep it[.]""

America has kept its republic for almost a quarter millennium. Short of Rome's. Yet impressive. If ""you"" – the American people – do not care keep ""it"" – a republic – cheer up! You are not alone. Throne and Altar ""conservatives"" such as the American Principles Project and Dark Enlightenment Neo-Reactionaries appear sympathetic to putting our sclerotic, degenerate, republic out of its misery.

Replacing it with something more, well, authoritative.

Authoritarian, even. Meanwhile….

Sarah Ellison of The Washington Post contemplates Donald Trump Jr. and The future of Trumpism: He upended expectations four years ago. What is he now?: ""To prepare for his convention speech four years ago, Don Jr. practiced each day for a week. When he took the lectern, he started by praising his wonderful wife and mentioning their five children — and then identified himself as the son of 'a great man.' The political world was dazzled. 'Poised and focused,' wrote the New York Post's John Podhoretz, calling it a speech Trump Sr. would never have been able to pull off. 'I think I watched the speech of a future politician there,' said David Chalian, CNN's political director. 'In fact, a much better politician than his own father,' added Democratic strategist Maria Cardona.""

Jason Zengerle, writing in the New York Times Magazine, devoted a feature to Donald Trump Jr. Is Ready. But for What, Exactly? Of all the president's children, he has the strongest connection to the politics, voters, and online disinformation ecosystem that put his father in the White House. What will he do with it?: ""So it is one of the many surprises of Trump's presidency that Trump Jr. has grown into arguably his father's most valuable political weapon. … 'Don Jr. represents the emotional center of the MAGA universe,' says Jason Miller, a senior adviser on Trump's re-election campaign. Before the pandemic, he was crisscrossing the country as his father's most-requested campaign surrogate. Since the coronavirus curtailed his travel plans, he has become one of the Republican Party's top virtual fund-raisers. His Twitter, Instagram and Facebook accounts have a combined 11 million followers and are vital cogs in the Republican messaging machine.""

A few old guard conservatives, like me, prefer the principles of the American founding. Notwithstanding:

Now, my noble fellow conservatives are locked in an epic struggle with our arch-enemies, the perfidious progressives. The struggle is not what it pretends to be.

The real struggle? Who can dig their heels more deeply into ""knowing so much that ain't so.""

President Trump is digging in his heels to defer, maybe waive, the 6.2% payroll tax that funds Social Security for four, maybe 16, months. How depressingly different from the glorious Reagan years.

We intrepid Supply Siders fought to cut marginal income tax rates bigly. With bipartisan support we cut the top rate from 70% to 28%. Hey Pachyderms? Leave neo-Keynesian stimulus packages to the Dems!

Candidate Biden is digging his heels into whopping tax increases on capital, corporations and wealth to pay for expensive new goodies. Hey! I like a good handout almost as much as defense contractors do! I'm disgusted by economic inequities wherein goodies keep going to the rich and powerful (instead of me)! But hey, Donkeys? Economic policies that stifle growth make fewer goodies to dole out!

Both parties descend into dogma, the worst equitable prosperity killer, rather than keeping their eye on the ball. Equitable prosperity comes from smart economic policies. It's not partisan. Equitable prosperity was wonderful under Reagan … and Clinton. And mediocre under Bush (both!) and Obama.

What prosperity-recipes are Washington neglecting? Many. Today let's focus on just one big one: We can only get richer by learning to do more with less. This takes tools. Tools take investment.

Example? An average car packs the same power as 120 horses. The University of Maine estimates the average annual cost of a horse at $3,876. It would cost you slightly less than half a million dollars a year to get the same power from horses as from your horseless carriage. Then, there's your housing, food, medical care and other necessities and amenities. Technology lets middle class people live a 19th century's millionaire lifestyle!

One of America's most respected technology thought leaders, Norman Augustine, has observed that new tools originate in research and development. While not cheap, the return on investment is astronomical. The Internet cost Uncle Sam $124.5 million. It generated many trillions in value. Apple, alone, recently exceeded $2 trillion in value.

As The Washington Post recently reported ""Along with Apple, the overachievers — Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Microsoft and Google's parent, Alphabet — are household names that have leveraged digital expertise to prosper amid the new, socially distanced reality. Through Tuesday, these six stocks collectively were up more than 43 percent this year, while the rest of the companies in the index together lost about 4 percent.""

The prosperity that tech generates is the good news. The bad news? Uncle Sam (yes, I'm talking to you, Sen. Josh Hawley!) lusts to crush America's greatest tech companies.



Even worse? Malign neglect.The technologies that enrich our daily lives and pocketbooks were not conjured out of thin air. As I have previously written:



""Christopher Mims writing recently in the Wall Street Journal:'Taxpayer-funded basic scientific research has again and again paid huge dividends to society, both in improving our quality of life and boosting our economy. Indeed, many of the industries the U.S. dominates these days, like software, were seeded in a Silicon Valley where the U.S. government was the area's first and most important venture capitalist. Since the mid 1960s, the proportion of U.S. gross domestic product spent on public R&D has gone from a peak of 2% to the present figure of 0.6%, and the U.S. went from first in the world in terms of such spending to 13th. China rocketed ahead….""

Supply-Side icon David Goldman recently told Law and Liberty: ""The Chinese People's Congress, at the end of May, just approved a $2.2 trillion five-year technology budget for any number of things. I mean, 5G itself, the Chinese are spending, according to a study by Deloitte, three times what we spend per capita on 5G. They'll have the fastest rollout.""

And there's worse to come. Both parties are bashing China for its successes. Meanwhile, both parties are actively forfeiting the tech race. They're killing the goose that lays the golden eggs.

The political parties are squabbling about masks, lockdowns, how to redress systemic racism. Important? Sure. Yet meanwhile, the Republicans and the Democrats both are attacking and neglecting the at least equally important roots of America's equitable prosperity and world leadership, technology.

239,Benko,Ralph,newsmax,"Want to know who is going to win the 2020 presidential election? If not, stop reading now! Will Trump or Biden win? Read on or skip to the end to find out what the modern political Nostradamus predicts.

Meanwhile: Voters are not stupid. In practice, we Insiders are irrelevant to political outcomes. Our role in the ecosystem is to fill up airtime so that cable news can sell advertising. Plus we, like court jesters, make the naïve political big-dollar donors feel important. While empirical proof shows they are not, at least not as to influencing the outcome of presidential elections. The myth of Big Money distorting politics is a myth.

So, what's the joke? Once upon a time a Russian seismologist (Vladimir Keilis-Borok) and an American political history professor (Alan Lichtman) walked, metaphorically speaking, into a bar. They proceeded to identify 13 things that voters really care about. Then, they used these factors to predict the outcome of presidential elections. It works.

Their predictions turned out to be right 9 out of 9 presidential elections (popular vote, with the 2000 electoral college escaping by a handful of hanging chads in 2000) in a row. This included the wildly underpredicted, except by Lichtman and cultural critic Scott Adams, 2016 Trump upset. They then turned around and tested the same factors back to 1864. The same factors have invariably predicted the outcome of presidential elections for 120 years.

Apologies for withdrawing the drama from presidential elections. That drama turns out to be about as authentic as professional wrestling's fake animosity ""kayfabe"" (which I contend to be the etymological precursor to President Trump's mysterious ""covfefe"" tweet).

Almost none of the factors that Pundits, Talking Heads, and we Political insiders use to predict the outcome of elections matter. Not polls. Not campaign strategies. Not Super PACs. Not clever commercials such as Bill Moyer's anti-Goldwater Daisy Girl nor Lee Atwater's anti-Dukakis Willy Horton. Not FiveThirtyEight-style statistical analysis. Not Russian troll farms. Not Cambridge Analytica.

All that matters is what we-the-voters care about. No matter how cleverly political operatives spin things, we voters are fully capable of figuring out the truth. And we vote according to our values and our interests. Not campaign rhetoric or media stray voltage.

Notwithstanding the media-politico complex's quadrennial full court press of a ""tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury signifying nothing"" we aren't fooled. We treat that as the infotainment while figuring out what's really up then vote shrewdly. Lichtman and Keilis-Borok figured out what we care about.

Alan Lichtman boldly stated, recently, that ""Voters are not fooled by the tricks of the campaign. Voters vote pragmatically based on how well the party holding the White House has governed the country.""

Flattering. Rings true.

Lichtman compiled the factors in The Keys to the White House. Per Wikipedia their pattern recognition succeeded ""in correctly predicting 128 out of 150 U.S. mid-term Senatorial elections since 1986. (Keilis-Borok) also applied the method to predicting rises in murder rates in Los Angeles, recessions, spikes in unemployment and, most recently, terrorist attacks.""

What are the keys?

Did the party that holds the White House gain or lose House seats in midterms? Is the incumbent being primaried? Is the incumbent president running for re-election? Is there a real third-party challenger? Is the short-term economy strong? Is long-term economic growth as good as the past two terms? Has the White House made major changes to national policy? Is there social unrest? Have there been scandals? Major foreign or military failures abroad? Major successes abroad? Is the incumbent charismatic? Is the challenger charismatic?

Lichtman does the math for us.

He observes that the Republicans lost seats in the midterms. Trump is running for reelection with no meaningful primary challenger. The short-term economy is in recession. Due to the pandemic, long-term economic growth isn't as good as the previous two terms. Trump has made major changes to national policy. Only Trump's most devoted loyalists would deny the presence of scandals. America is experiencing social unrest. Trump had neither major foreign policy failures nor successes. He calls Trump a great showman but scores him, along with Biden, as uncharismatic.

The envelope please! Our modern Nostradamus calls this race for Biden.

Neither Lichtman nor I believe in predestination. He observes that there are relevant factors external to the 13 keys. I say, surely the pandemic is a wild card. One thing only is really certain.

We voters aren't as stupid as the politicos think! Politicos? We'll see you and raise you on November 3rd.

240,Benko,Ralph,newsmax,"Giraffes, Flamingos, Defund, Defend, and the Wisdom and Madness of Crowds

To belabor the obvious America, and the world, is going through upheavals. We unpleasingly argue our way through a pandemic.

It's hard to know who or what to believe.

We’ve pivoted from the melodrama of threatened, and then, in 2018-19 real (if partial and overhyped), government shutdown. Instead we have a massive social/economic shutdown.

The stakes are far higher.

Is it more dangerous to keep the economy (and school systems) closed?

Or, to open them?

Meanwhile, many hold that the calls to ""defund the police"" represent a blow against oppression and ""systemic racism.""

Which they, at least in part, are.

Yet, many see the calls to ""defend the police"" as taking a stand for our protection and for respect toward the thin blue line between order and anarchy.

Which they, at least in part, are.

The federal government swings like a weather vane in a hurricane.

Elected officials are pretty expert at reading public sentiment.

They are fixated, as they should be, on whether their actions are responsive to voters’ wishes and, thus, on their reelection prospects. And as bigfoot journalist James Surowiecki persuasively argued in ""The Wisdom of Crowds"" there are some great, scientific, reasons to consider crowds, which use ""collective intelligence,"" wiser than individuals.

Good politicians can read those tea leaves.

Or . . . they don’t last long.

That said, the crowd also is foolish. Charles Mackay established that definitively almost two centuries ago in ""Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds.""

To frost that cake, Sir Isaac Newton, perhaps the smartest man who ever lived, lost a fortune in the South Sea bubble.

He is widely reported by the omniscient internet to have said, ""I can calculate the motions of heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people.""(Newton’s actual words, as recorded by Joseph Spence of the recollection of Lord Radnor, were ""that he could not calculate the madness of the people."" Close enough.)

So. Many elected officials, rather proficient in calculating the madness of the voters, are at loggerheads with each other. And with career civil servants. The latter are technocrats.

The technocrats’ expertise resides in interpreting scientific data. They tend to rely on computer models. These sanitize and make sacrosanct a lot of judgment calls programmed in by scientists. Scientists, after all, are only human. And ""To err is human.""

Meanwhile, to those of us in the bleachers the only positive certainty is that the elected officials are busily contradicting each other — and the experts.

U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., elegantly characterized the most recent offspring of the pachyderms and the donkeys as ""giraffes and flamingos.""

There seems no arbiter in whom we can safely repose our trust.

The Establishment never fully recovered from the credibility gap it bought itself by systematically lying about the Vietnam war, as revealed in the Pentagon Papers (and elsewhere). This mendacity generated countercultural bumper stickers for many of us Hippies to the effect of ""Question Authority"" and ""Don’t trust anyone over 30.""

It really does seem like the collapse of Western Civilization began in earnest in the 1970s. It is now visibly gaining momentum. Many of the causes of the protests of yore — anti-war, women’s lib — have been long resolved.

The civil rights movement made gains and was slowly (yes, far too slowly) continuing progress.

Just one piece of President Nixon’s perverse economic legacy, the ""temporary"" closing of the gold window, lingers. Might this matter? What should we make of John Maynard Keynes’s observation in his prophetic 1919 ""The Economic Consequences of the Peace""? Keynes there embedded a clue to the possible cause of the existential crisis underlying so many of our institutional crises.

“Lenin is said to have declared that the best way to destroy the capitalist system was to debauch the currency. By a continuing process of inflation, governments can confiscate, secretly and unobserved, an important part of the wealth of their citizens. By this method they not only confiscate, but they confiscate arbitrarily; and, while the process impoverishes many, it actually enriches some. The sight of this arbitrary rearrangement of riches strikes not only at security, but at confidence in the equity of the existing distribution of wealth. . . . “Lenin was certainly right. There is no subtler, no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency. The process engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction, and does it in a manner which not one man in a million is able to diagnose.”

Our political leaders, our experts, and our authorities obsess on symptoms.

The media and the pundits obsess upon the attendant palace intrigue. Meanwhile we in the wise and foolish crowd await the one-in-a-million capable of diagnosing what is unleashing all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction.

241,Benko,Ralph,realclearmarkets,"In the bad old days, the major newspapers and networks served as gatekeepers, controlling the flow of information and excluding conservative ideas and voices.

The Internet and its large search and social platforms have broken the stranglehold of elite opinion and made it possible for conservatives to organize and distribute facts and information with a speed and scale that was previously impossible, creating pathways that completely bypass the legacy media, which has reacted by becoming even more monolithically left-wing.

As a result, the tech giants – including especially Facebook and Google – have come under intense pressure from the left to impose large-scale suppression of conservative views through censoring, banning, shadow-banning, and sometimes invasive “fact-checking” on the theory that the genie of conservative organizing at scale can be put back in the bottle.

Conservatives have reacted by adopting a wartime footing, many of them partially or wholly jettisoning free-market doctrine based on the same rationalization that President George W. Bush adopted when he embraced the TARP bailout and announced he had chucked his free-market principles: as necessitated by crisis.

Some have suggested an indirect regulatory attack may be possible without sacrificing principle, via scaling back the scope of liability protection the technology companies or ""interactive computer services"" enjoy under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.

Such conditional regulation could generate the same economic and political inequities, however, as more direct approaches. Moreover, the legitimate debates about the scope of Section 230 and parallel provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act should be considered on their merits, not bootstrapped as a lever for attempting to induce structural or behavioral changes.

Nonetheless, the emergence of this policy debate must be understood in the context of widespread alarm among conservative base voters and activists over apparent left-wing bias in the Internet and social media sector.

We contend that rapprochement is overwhelmingly in the interests of both conservatives and the dominant American technology companies, and can be achieved if these companies can take steps to reassure consumers that they are friendly to users across the political spectrum and in turn conservatives oppose policy changes that enhance the power and influence of government to break them up or regulate them.

The digital market leaders should also show good faith by ceasing their long-running advocacy of what amounts to price controls on the physical infrastructure companies – cables and telcos – and agree to consistent, market-based rules of the road for all.

It is conservatives who have the most to lose if government power over the Internet is expanded, because that power is likely to be used most aggressively by future politicians and career civil servants with their own left wing biases and strong priors to reestablish the gatekeeping function of elite opinion – consistent with their ideology – than by conservatives who would deploy it only reluctantly and in conflict with their own core beliefs.

Indeed the true, natural, allies for the leading digital companies are on the liberty-minded right, because any understanding or accommodation reached with the left would be of necessity only prudential and not ideological. The impulse to tear down the country's most successful companies, precisely because they are successful, is endemic to the soaring “class warfare” ideology that has infused the Democratic Party.

The antitrust attacks on America's most successful companies, in particular, are the latest in a long tradition of attacking and penalizing success – in the face of falling prices and ever-increasing consumer benefit. Indeed that is the true story of antitrust actions dating back to enactment of the Sherman Act, from the dissolution of the Northern Securities and Standard Oil to more recent actions against IBM, AT&T, and Microsoft.

The U.S. economy and American society are the beneficiaries of a vibrant Internet sector that is free of overbearing government interference. The market leaders are far from perfect and many complaints from the right are legitimate. But we need to resolve these differences without putting more power over free speech and the decisions of consumers into the hands of the federal government.

244,Benko,Ralph,newsmax,"The Senate Banking Committee is scheduled to vote, tomorrow, on Trump nominee Judy Shelton as a member of the Federal Reserve Board. The vote is too close to call. There may be reasons to oppose Dr. Shelton's nomination. Her occasional calls to adopt the gold standard, however, provide the best reason to vote aye.

The gold standard (toward which President Trump is on record as favorable) has put a lightning rod on the Shelton nomination. David Wilcox, a former director of the Division of Research & Statistics at the Federal Reserve Board, acidly criticized Dr. Shelton in The Hill. Her support for the gold standard drew his unmitigated wrath. That said, methinks the gentleman protest too much.

His criticisms of the gold standard are, simply put, factually wrong. Dr. Wilcox calls America's almost 200-year-long, largely successful, use of the gold standard ""a disastrous experiment in monetary policy making."" Simply untrue.

Per Financial Stability Report No. 13 by analysts of the Bank of England (the oldest and most distinguished of central banks) in 2011 the gold standard and the modified Bretton Woods gold standard far outperformed the fiduciary monetary system in place since 1971. In a summary of that paper for Forbes.com, economic policy thought leader Charles Kadlec summarized its findings that compared to the Bretton Woods gold standard, under the post-Nixon fiduciary management of the dollar, ""Economic growth is a full percentage point slower, with an average annual increase in real per-capita GDP of only 1.8% ... World inflation of 4.8% a year is 1.5 percentage point higher… Downturns for the median countries have more than tripled to 13% of the total period; The number of banking crises per year has soared to 2.6 per year, compared to only one every ten years under Bretton Woods … The number of currency crises has increased to 3.7 per year from 1.7 per year; Current account deficits have nearly tripled to 2.2% of world GDP from only 0.8% of GDP under Bretton Woods.""

The ""disastrous experiment"" was in departing from, not adhering to, gold.

The head of the German central Bank, Herr Dr. Jens Weidmann, had this to say about the gold standard in a 2012 speech titled Money Creation and Stability:

""A great deal of trust was placed in particular in precious and rare metals – gold first and foremost – due to their assumed intrinsic value. In its function as a medium of exchange, medium of payment and store of value, gold is thus, in a sense, a timeless classic. … Indeed, the fact that central banks can create money out of thin air, so to speak, is something that many observers are likely to find surprising and strange, perhaps mystical and dreamlike, too – or even nightmarish.""

The great Paul Volcker, while no gold standard proponent, observed in his foreword to Marjorie Deane and Robert Pringle's The Central Banks (Hamish Hamilton, 1994): ""By and large, if the overriding objective is price stability, we did better with the nineteenth-century gold standard and passive central banks, with currency boards, or even with 'free banking.'""

Volcker's successor Alan Greenspan told the World Gold Council's Gold Investor, in 2017, ""I view gold as the primary global currency. … It wasn't the gold standard that failed; it was politics. … But if the gold standard were in place today we would not have reached the situation in which we now find ourselves. … When I was Chair of the Federal Reserve … US monetary policy tried to follow signals that a gold standard would have created. That is sound monetary policy even with a fiat currency.""

The gold standard deserves respect. Furthermore, Dr. Wilcox's claim of central bankers' ""spectacular success"" absent the gold standard is, to put it politely, spurious. As Ylan Q. Mui wrote in 2015 in the Washington Post Wonkblog, Why nobody believes the Federal Reserve's forecasts, ""The market recognizes that the Fed has repeatedly erred on the optimistic side,"" said Eric Lascelles, chief economist at RBC Global Asset Management. 'Fool me 50 times, but not 51 times.' Even the government's official budget forecasters are dubious of the Fed's own forecast.""

And as three distinguished monetary scholars honorably revealed wrote in the New York Fed's own Liberty Street Economics in 2015, ""Model uncertainty is pervasive."" An understatement.

Dr. Wilcox's bold conclusion that ""We (the Fed) know how to do better (than the gold standard)"" is striking rhetoric. Would that it were also true! Dr. Shelton's occasional advocacy of the gold standard, a system which has demonstrated itself to be the gold standard of monetary policy for high employment, upward mobility and price stability, is the best reason to vote to confirm Judy Shelton's appointment to the Fed.

Opinion contributors

The resurgence of the coronavirus has thrust the pandemic back to the fore of our national consciousness. Living vs. making a living? A false dichotomy. We don’t believe that these values to be mutually exclusive. Both are possible, both necessary. And we need each other to figure out how to make both happen.

Political heresy? No.

The pandemic represents what folklore holds as the Chinese character for crisis: a “dangerous opportunity.” As supply-side economist Paul Romer first observed, “a crisis is a terrible thing to waste.” The surface tension between maintaining both physical and fiscal health points to a deeper underlying crisis. It offers a path out of both the surface and the deep crisis.

What deep crisis? Prof. Daniel Dellaposta observed recently in the American Sociological Review, “The structure of U.S. opinion has shifted in ways suggesting troubling implications for proponents of political and social pluralism.” Only a threat of the complexity and magnitude of the pandemic is powerful enough to bring hereditary enemies, like us, together. One of us is the cofounder of MoveOn.org, the other the co-founder of TheCapitalistLeague.com.

I, Ralph, the conservative Republican, recognize my adversary Joan’s authentic compassion in holding that without a coordinated response, including government action, to flatten the curve she would have reasonable grounds to fear waves of infections that could overwhelm our medical personnel and capacity, intensifying both loss of life and economic devastation. This is a counsel of practical compassion. Not tyranny.

I, Joan, the progressive Democrat, recognize my adversary Ralph’s heartfelt concern that an overbearing, “one-size-fits-all,” quarantine can produce an unacceptable level of economic agony, especially among members of the working class. Not everyone has sufficient resources, nor is the government capable of indefinitely funding an economy many times larger than the resources it can responsibly command. This is a counsel of practical compassion. Not callousness.

Let's see each other as allies

Our survival appears at stake. Thus, to paraphrase a wise insight of second wave feminism: the political becomes personal. The political class now politically weaponizes everything. Democrats vilify Republicans as taking reckless life-and-death risks by premature openings. Republicans demonize Democrats for inflicting unwarranted and possibly catastrophic damage to our ability to subsist economically.

So let’s experiment with seeing one another as allies facing a mutual enemy, the novel coronavirus. Our respectively hated and feared political leaders really are not the primary enemy. (Yes, assuredly we will slug that out Nov.)

The primary enemy is the virus. It confronted (and confronts) our leaders, left and right, with huge unknowns. Of course, people are entitled to their political opinions. That said, common humanity calls for us to tone down the contempt. “Kill the ump” style heckling is better suited to baseball than it is to a truly mortal threat.

Physical and fiscal health are not antithetical. To get both will require greater trust and trustworthiness in government, in media, in our communities and in what Ben Franklin, during the Constitutional Convention, called “the virtue and spirit of the common people.” And, yes, trust in the good faith in our political opponents.

That the left and right disagree is neither novel nor interesting. The interesting thing is that we represent proof-of-concept that both sides can show respect for one another and are willing to work together against a common foe.

Pandemic isn't about politics

So, are we going to keep politically weaponizing the pandemic (as we have weaponized practically everything else)? We will remain passionate foes on many issues. The pandemic is fundamentally different. It is a common enemy and a mortal one.

There are judgment calls about priorities and what measures to take. That said, neither of us knows anyone who does not believe in the importance of protecting both lives and livelihoods. We must, and can, work together. American independence was predicated on the self-evident truth that foremost among our unalienable rights are both life and liberty. Governments are instituted to protect these rights. We demand both values be fully honored. This is not paradoxical.

We’ve gotten out of the habit of working together even where we agree. That is the deeper existential crisis the pandemic brings to light. That said, the pandemic is so epic that it compels cooperation. Knowing that we are on the “same team,” we can pull America out of the wreckage of lives and livelihood the pandemic has wrought.

Rediscovering that there are areas in which we can fruitfully cooperate, perhaps our cooperation in the face of the pandemic could transform the future of politics.

246,Benko,Ralph,newsmax,"July 13 is the anniversary of the birth of the late, great, Jack Kemp. Kemp, half-forgotten, was one of the most consequential figures of the 20th century. His birthday is a moment for valuable recollection.

Kemp dragged America out of a misery index that makes today's look puny and short-lived by comparison. (So far.) America, thanks to its political, economic and academic Establishment, had to be dragged into prosperity kicking and screaming.

Memory is short, especially in politics. As Aldous Huxley once observed, ""That men do not learn very much from the lessons of history is the most important of all the lessons history has to teach."" Let's give our current batch of leaders a brief refresher course on how Kemp made America great again.

In High and Far Off Times, Oh Best Beloved, meaning the 1970's, the economy was in horrendous shape. The Dow Jones was bumping along around 1,000. Less than four percent of where it is today. What happened?

Inflation was soaring. Prosperity was withering. Lyndon (""Guns and Butter"") Johnson, Richard (""I am not a crook"") Nixon, Gerald (""I am a Ford, not a Lincoln"") Ford and Jimmy (""I cannot guarantee that our joint effort will succeed."") Carter bequeathed us that torment.

The conventional wisdom then was to raise taxes and sink the dollar. Prof. Robert Mundell and Dr. Arthur B. Laffer channeled by flamboyant journalist Jude Wanniski taught an inquisitive Kemp that the solution to stagflation lay in stabilizing the dollar and cutting tax rates. In that order. Mundell later received the Nobel Prize in economics, Laffer the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

Kemp, a former champion quarterback, modestly described himself as a ""phys ed major from Occidental College."" Then a junior Congressman, he stood up to a tsunami of ridicule by proposing to stand the conventional wisdom on its head. He crusaded, with courage and good cheer, on a 30% across-the-board marginal tax rate cut and the gold standard as propounded by businessman/philanthropist Lewis E. Lehrman.

Foremost among those who endorsed the tax-rate cut (and gave lip service to the gold standard) was Ronald Reagan. Jeff Bell, a member of Kemp's inner circle, once told me that Reagan endorsed that controversial tax rate cut to gain Kemp's endorsement. He wished to preempt the possibility Kemp might declare for the 1980 presidential contest, splitting the right and throwing the Republican nomination to George H.W. Bush.

Then Bush ridiculed Reagan's plan as ""voodoo economics."" Carter attacked it as ""inflationary."" Reagan defended it again and again. By the time Reagan was elected this tax rate cut had emerged as his signature economic campaign pledge. Reagan's economic advisers were dismayed.

After the election Kemp relentlessly held Reagan to his campaign commitment to offer the 30% across-the-board cut in marginal tax rates. Reagan's team delayed and slightly diluted it but could not avert it. Reagan delegated stabilizing the dollar — of great or greater importance — to Fed Chairman Paul Volcker who painstakingly slew the inflation dragon that President Carter considered bewildering to the point of insoluble.

The political establishment showed trepidation. The (Republican!) Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker called it a ""riverboat gamble."" Kemp, playing David to the Establishment's Goliath, won.

So did America. And the world.

Reagan and Volcker, following Kemp's playbook, wrung out inflation and phased in the tax rate cut. Then the American economy soared. It continued to soar, albeit with stumbles like President George H.W. Bush's violation of his ""read my lips, no new taxes"" pledge and the mediocre economic policies of George W. Bush and Barack Obama.

On the day in November 1979 that Reagan officially declared for the presidency the Dow was at 814. As of this writing, the Dow is at 26,000. U.S. GDP for 1979, per the St. Louis Fed, was about $2.7T. It's now at $21.5T.

Other nations, like the Russian Federation and the People's Republic of China, followed Reagan's lead in cutting tax rates. Everyone benefited from the stabilization of the dollar, the world's reserve currency. World nominal GDP soared from $11T then to $88T today.

Jack Kemp is the hero of this economic epic.

Inflation is no longer the problem. Some believe that a deflationary Fed policy was the cause of the rather modest performance of the economy prior to the pandemic. Kemp's unfinished symphony, the gold standard, surely would be the best way to restore sizzling economic growth and equitable prosperity. President Trump himself is on record as favorably disposed toward the gold standard.

Celebrating Jack Kemp's birthday is not an exercise in nostalgia. It is an opportunity to reflect on the economic formula that Kemp sold to a recalcitrant capital.

Low marginal tax rates. And the very monetary policy that made America great: the classical gold standard.

Happy Jack Kemp's birthday, America.

Onward to a golden age?

247,Benko,Ralph,townhall,"The opinions expressed by columnists are their own and do not necessarily represent the views of Townhall.com.

Many prominent free-market thought leaders are loudly objecting to the proposed extension of federal unemployment benefits. They point out that some of the recipients receive more from a modest unemployment check than from working. My comrades-in-conservative-arms claim fear of a moral hazard that discourages people from working. They fear this could inhibit the recovery upon which they believe President Trump’s re-election depends.

Yet for many workers, there is no work. Tweak the benefit? Perhaps. Balking, wholesale, at the extension of the benefit would be bad policy and bad politics. And, let it be said, “laissez-faire,” yes, Supply-Side, no.

Being miserly tarnishes the conservative brand. It conjures up one of the tarter provisions of William F. Buckley’s mission statement for the National Review: “Radical conservatives in this country have an interesting time of it, for when they are not being suppressed or mutilated by the liberals, they are being ignored or humiliated by a great many of those of the well-fed Right whose ignorance and amorality have never been exaggerated for the same reason that one cannot exaggerate infinity.”

My colleagues’ stance also brings to mind another classic, Charles Dickens’ ‘A Christmas Carol.’ Per Matthew Caruchet writing for The Economic Opportunity Institute, “When he was 12 years old in 1824, Charles Dickens worked 10-hour days in a rat-infested shoe-polish factory for six shillings a week. That’s the equivalent of £30.68 or $41.06 in 2017 currency. It was all the money he had to get by. His father, mother, and five siblings aged 2-11 were in prison because the family was in debt. ... Needless to say, Charles Dickens grew to hate the system and rail against it in his works.""

‘A Christmas Carol’ isn’t anti-capitalist. It is anti-miserliness, pro-benefactor. These are two entirely different states of affluence. The institutions “for” the poor Scrooge vaunted to his charitable solicitors were designed to punish and kill off paupers. That’s utterly contrary to capitalism. Adam Smith defined it as that “which occasions, in a well-governed society, that universal opulence which extends itself to the lowest ranks of the people.”

The original Supply-Side quarterback Representative Jack Kemp used to refer to himself as a “bleeding-heart conservative.” He designed his policy propositions for the general welfare, leaning toward workers and the poor. Kemp emulated Jack Kennedy, whose ethos was, “A rising tide lifts all boats.”

Good solid working-class Democrats such as Dan Rostenkowski, Bill Bradley and Dick Gephardt embraced equitable economic growth policy (although not quite Supply-Side rhetoric). One United States Senator from Delaware who you may have heard of, Joe Biden, voted for the 1981 Reagan tax rate cut that cut the top rate from 70 percent to 50 percent. He voted to reduce the top marginal rate from 50 percent to 28 percent.

Good Democrats, by reducing marginal tax rates further and faster than even Kemp proposed, out-Reaganed Reagan, paving the way to sizzling job creation and upward mobility for workers. For which, let it be noted, Biden has, rhetorically, repented of but has not been absolved by the hard-shell democratic socialists.

That said, for the benefit of those then unborn, let us note that the original Supply-Side was never designed to privilege capital over labor, creditors over debtors. Let us note that voting for across-the-board reduction of tax rates is far more classic “Supply-Side” than the cutting of corporate tax rates, such as President Trump delivered.

Back in Supply-Side’s heyday, Jude Wanniski, Kemp’s premier economic swami (and a self-described lifelong “Marxian”) famously proposed what he called the “Two Santa Claus Theory.” He urged Republicans to advocate policies (tax rate cuts and monetary stability) to create equitable prosperity. He weaned the GOP from its propensity to inflict, in the name of rectitude, gratuitous suffering on those struggling to subsist.

Wanniski in National Observer, 1976: “Either way, of course, they (the Republicans) embrace the role of Scrooge, playing into the hands of the Democrats, who know the first rule of successful politics is Never Shoot Santa Claus. … They were not always so dumb. The GOP’s heyday was in the 1920s, when, acting on the advice of Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon … the Republicans cut tax rates no less than five times. Mellon, the embodiment of the Republican Santa Claus, argued that a cut in tax rates would provide business an incentive to expand, increase prosperity, expand the tax base … .”

The GOP, confronted by Wanniski, like Scrooge after encountering the three Christmas ghosts, transformed from skinflint to benefactor. America flourished, with real GDP more than tripling over time. The GOP flourished politically when it displayed the Kempian quintessence of true capitalism, generosity to workers. And then, it didn’t.

The political and moral benefits of generosity appear lost in the mists of time. Regression to mean? Mean seems like the apt word here.

Memo to my fellow free-market champions:

Never shoot Santa Claus.

248,Benko,Ralph,newsmax,"America and the world are beset by a pandemic of unknown origin. Confused authorities and experts issue conflicting and changing directives. We get muddled advice about whether or not to reopen for business. There's tension between measures designed to save people's lives and livelihoods.

Meanwhile, legitimate demonstrations against police brutality and systemic racism are commingled with vandalism against monuments, even anarchy. Polarization reaches epic proportions. How bad is it?

A few years ago, writing at Forbes.com, I warned that unless the political class took decisive steps to restore equitable prosperity America faced a 'Little Dark Age.' I recalled ""A Saturday Evening Post reporter asked, in 1932, John Maynard Keynes if there had ever been anything like the Great Depression. Keynes replied, 'Yes. It was called the Dark Ages and it lasted 400 years.' While the Great Recession is not so severe as was the Great Depression, it begins to appear that the world is enduring something that could be called 'The Little Dark Age.'""

We no longer face the possibility of the Little Dark Age. We have entered it. Will it be the beginning of a new, long, neo-feudal Dark Ages? Let's saddle up, not whine.

Most know (or should) that July 4th is celebrated as the anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. Fewer know (but should) that the idealistic legitimacy, and even success, of the American Revolution was set by Thomas Paine. He began with Common Sense and then a series of pamphlets called The Crisis.

The Crisis has Paine at his most memorable:

THESE are the times that try men's souls. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country; but he that stands by it now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered; yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.

I deplore the emergence of a victim mentality by populist leaders (who style America as victimized by our neighbors, trading partners, allies, and adversaries) and self-styled conservatives. I expect the left to play the victim card. We have long made fun of progressives easily triggered into hysterical reactions. We dismiss these hypersensitive souls as ""snowflakes,"" defined at Wikipedia as implying ""overly-emotional, easily offended, and unable to deal with opposing opinions.""

The emergence on the right of such fragility does not offer a glorious triumph. For instance now, many (by no means all) conservatives claim victimhood at the hands of digital media. Trigger warning! If you look at the companies' standards and practices these by and large are simple good taste and their enforcement generally even-handed. No, not infallibly. Neither, however, are any conservatives I know infallible.

I don't agree with every interpretation by the companies. That said, I will defend to the death a private company's right to decide in good faith what statements are inappropriate, as needed to protect their brands. Nobody forces me to tweet or post on Facebook or search on Google. I do so because I choose to. So what's up with the call for government censorship or breakup of these companies, or, worse, legislation making them liable for posts by their users?

The First Amendment prohibits the Congress (and by extension the States) from ""abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press."" What, exactly, do my fellow conservatives find ambiguous about ""no law abridging?"" When will Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Missouri) propound legislation holding Apple, Dell or HP liable for defamatory material typed on their laptops?

Conservatives can and do thrive on social media. We can be fiery so long as we are not bullying. I'm co-proprietor, along with Tea Party progenitor Bill Collier, of the Facebook group The Capitalist League. We have grown this 200-proof conservative group worldwide from fewer than 6,000 to over 100,000 followers in just the past six weeks. We're hard core and Facebook hasn't jailed us. And we're not unique. Heritage Foundation, the Mecca of conservatism, has over 2 million Facebook followers. Judicial Watch, unflinchingly conservative, has over 6 million followers.

Facebook's prohibitions are almost entirely unexceptional and former U.S. Sen. Jon Kyl found no evidence of bias. They readily permit people (including hard-right wing nuts like me) to ""share diverse views, experiences, ideas and information""... ""even if some may disagree or find them objectionable.""

Conservatives? Leave the whining to the left! It's time for my fellow members of the Vast Right Wing Conspiracy to become proficient in using social and digital media to advance the conservative cause. Do conservatives encounter an occasional rebuff? (Yes. So, too, does the left.) Oh darn!

Enough with conservative snowflakery! We have this consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph. On to a golden age!

249,Benko,Ralph,newsmax,"What do we want?

Prosperity!

When do we want it?

Now!

There are 10 tried and true policies that would rekindle American prosperity. These will work even in the face of the doom and gloom strewn by the pandemic.

These sort of policies ignited an ""economic miracle"" after WWII. After the world war Germany was an economic basket case, far worse off than pandemic America. Then, Ludwig Erhard used free market policies to turn the zombie economy around, fast. West Germany became the prosperous colossus of Western Europe.

Each of the ""Capitalist Ten Commandments"" has power. They're not a left vs. right thing. There are varied carols of free market capitalism. One end of the capitalist spectrum (Hello Democrats!) is ordoliberalism, ""socially conscious free markets."" It also provides lots of government-supplied social insurance. (Hayek approved!) The Nordic states thrive by this. The other end (Hello Republicans!) is laissez faire, ""classical liberalism,"" leaving it to the private sector to provide universal opulence. Hong Kong and Singapore prosper.

Both are authentic capitalism.

Then, there are some prosperity-strangling, dignity crushing, illegitimate alternatives. On the left, socialism and its bratty little sister, progressivism. On the right, fascism and its bratty little brother, nationalism. Both pave a road to Hell. Democrats are toying with inane socialist nostrums like the Green New Deal and progressive nonsense like minimum wage legislation. Republicans are descending to insane crypto-fascist government spending orgies and nationalist schemes like tariffs.

What to do?

America is a republic. Its citizens — yeah, I'm talking to you, Bub! — have the power and duty to direct our officials in the right direction and to retire officials who are incapable of delivering equitable prosperity. Every two years we conduct well-publicized national elections for the House of Representatives and one-third of the Senate. Every four years, like 2020, we are treated to the flamboyant sound and fury of a presidential election.

That's the easy part.

As the continuing poor performance of our economy shows, elections, while necessary, are not sufficient. We ""folks back home"" need to provide adult supervision between elections. But … how?

Observing the Capitalist Ten Commandments would get the economy growing again. President Clinton, like President Reagan, honored most of them. It's not a partisan thing. We got the ""rising tide that lifts all boats"" that JFK prophesied. The side effect under Clinton was such a large federal budget surplus that then-Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan went about sounding the alarm that we might actually pay off the national debt!

Here they are:

1. The highest marginal income tax rates for individuals and businesses shall not exceed 28%.

2. There shall be no reduction or elimination of income tax deductions and credits unless matched dollar-for-dollar by further reducing tax rates.

3. All assets will be indexed to inflation for the purpose of calculating capital gains.

4. No gift, estate or inheritance tax shall have a top rate of more than 10% and no such tax shall be imposed on any such transfers of $10 million or less, annually adjusted for inflation.

5. The federal government shall generously fund research and development which are the foundation of the nation's prosperity, skilled jobs and material quality of life.

6. The dollar shall be defined as a fixed weight of gold legally convertible thereunto by any person or entity, foreign and domestic.

7. The Treasury and any other instrumentality of the United States shall not incur any additional bonded liabilities except upon approval by two-thirds of the legislatures of the states.

8. Civil asset forfeiture to the federal, state, or any municipal government is prohibited and criminal and civil fines shall be proportional to both the ability of the adjudicated party to pay these and to the severity of the infraction.

9. No regulation affecting more than $100 million in economic activity shall be adopted until enacted by the Congress of the United States and signed by the president.

10. No government shall exercise control over wages or prices, including the pricing of telecommunication services, rent or imposition of a minimum wage.

Are there other policies worth adopting? Sure!

That said, conservatives are competitive, even fractious. They like to jostle each other to advance their pet ideas (and win the attendant glory). The Ten Commandments of Capitalism picks the best of the best of these ideas. They unite the right.

Because … united we stand, divided we fall.

Bonus! The Ten Commandments invite the left to compete via socially conscious free markets.

Because … country over party!

Now all that's needed is for enough citizens to teach our national elected officials, especially our representatives (whose job it is to Represent us!) and even our senators, the Ten Commandments of Capitalism. Equitable prosperity will follow.

It's up to us.

What do we want?

Prosperity!

When do we want it?

Now!

251,Benko,Ralph,newsmax,"The war of ideas goes on. Toward the end of the 20th century the USSR dissolved itself. China shifted to thinly-veiled capitalism. Looked like ""the Battle of the Century"" was over and that we had won. Not so fast.

On February 21, 1848, Marx and Engels produced The Communist Manifesto. It began: ""A spectre is haunting Europe — the spectre of communism."" In practice, Communism proved something more like a bloodthirsty vampire than a ghost.

Per History.com, ""Its idea … reverberated with increasing force into the 20th century, and by 1950 nearly half the world's population lived under Marxist governments."" Then came Reagan and the overthrow, worldwide, of Marxist policies and governments.

Let's revisit the scene of the crime, our apparent but illusory victories. It may help us better understand the current struggle between Capitalism and Communism.

Dima Vorobiev, a former Soviet propaganda executive, wrote at Quora: ""Instead of saving the USSR and transforming it into a State-oligarchical one-party Capitalist system like modern-day China, Gorbachev went about saving Communism. This was a dead man's journey (here's why). What Gorbachev should have done instead, was try to roll back the Communist project, introduce a market economy, and steer away from nationalist unrest and the resistance from Stalinists in the Party.""

Meanwhile in China, Deng Xiaoping suavely retired Marxism. He did so by replacing it with ""Socialism with Chinese characteristics,"" e.g. capitalism. Deng displayed a becoming pragmatism by noting that ""it doesn't matter whether the cat is black or white so long as it catches mice."" He declared that ""Poverty is not socialism."" And ""To get rich is glorious."" He thereby unleashed history's greatest wave of economic growth, letting an impoverished billion Chinese rise toward middle-class affluence.

And yet. As Anne Applebaum wrote at Prospect magazine, ""If we don't feel at least as much revulsion for the crimes of communism as we do for the crimes of Nazism, we will be condemned to misunderstand both our own past and that of others."" Such revulsion is not much in evidence.

There is an unsettling resurgence of favorable sentiment toward, and influence of, Communism and its slightly less feral bratty little sister, socialism. The Democratic Party, wherein ""democratic"" socialism has found a host, rejected nominating socialism's top champion, Sen. Bernie Sanders. Yet the Dems have given the passionately intense left great power over writing policy.

As reported by Michael Tomasky in the New York Review of Books, recently: ""After Sanders withdrew, the discussions between the two turned more toward substance — and the extent to which Biden would be willing to adopt pieces of the Sanders agenda. Thus were formed the six task forces that the Biden campaign unveiled on May 13. The left-wing presence on many of them is remarkable.""

Is Joe Biden an asymptomatic carrier of Bernie Sanders's socialist virus? Or merely placating a fractious faction?

The Democrats have long flirted with the agenda of ""progressives,"" socialists-in-drag. Their pink slip showing would be less troubling if the GOP were not so ready to succumb.

The GOP, for example, shows unseemly enthusiasm for trillions of dollars of fresh debt. The Republican Party seems to have lost the proud Reagan capitalist mojo much as they lost Lincoln's emancipationist mojo. The Pachyderms pay lip service to capitalism (and equal rights), reduced to a slogan. Not a program. Not a governing philosophy.

The Democrats are much clearer on their purpose. As I noted in The American Spectator during 2016 the Democratic Party national platform unabashedly, although without attribution, leaned toward or embraced all six of the still-relevant 10 planks of The Communist Manifesto. These are abolition of property in land and application of all rents of land to public purposes [rent control]; a heavy progressive or graduated income tax; abolition of all rights of inheritance [raising the estate tax]; centralisation of credit in the hands of the state, by means of a national bank with State capital and an exclusive monopoly [hello, Fed!]; centralisation of the means of communication and transport in the hands of the State [net ""neutrality!""]; ""free"" education for all children in public schools [adios, school choice!].

The Democratic Platform 2020 is likely to be even more enthusiastic about these and other sinister totalitarian devices, like prosecuting thoughtcrimes.

Meanwhile, what's the Republican Party stand for?

""Make America Great Again, Again"" is a slogan.

Not a program.

Not even a credo.

The GOP has gone limp.

One is reminded of Yeats's prophetic words:

""…and everywhere

The ceremony of innocence is drowned;

The best lack all conviction, while the worst

Are full of passionate intensity.""

Will a political champion, à la Jack Kemp, of true capitalism and equitable prosperity arise to save both the GOP and America? If not…

And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,

Slouches toward Bethlehem to be born?

252,Benko,Ralph,newsmax,"I had planned to devote today's column to ridiculing communists for yet another infantile ""Manifesto."" This one by then-Bolivian President Evo Morales . His December 21, 2013 speech at a solstice celebration in Lake Titicaca, in the Andes, is published as the ""Manifesto os Isla del Sol.""

A cheap thrill, though, refuting the words of romantic New Age sentimentalists. Or pointing out the confabulations of a cottage industry of recent communist manifestos, Aaron Bastani's Fully Automated Luxury Communism and one by the editor of Jacobin Magazine Bhaskar Sunkara's The Socialist Manifesto: the case for radical politics in an era of extreme inequality.

Then I encountered an impressive Marxist thinker in the LA Review of Books , Professor Jodi Dean, author of 13 books of what appear Marxist political thought and cultural criticism. Dueling with an adversary as formidable as Prof. Dean is a worthier and more interesting challenge.

Prof. Dean sets forth trenchant arguments in her essay Neofeudalism: The End of Capitalism? Rising neo-feudalism indeed is a legitimate, and properly major, concern. William Collier and I recently addressed neo-feudalism in our book The Capitalist Manifesto: ""As even orthodox Communists admit Socialism is inferior for the production of wealth. The transition to that neo-Feudalism called Socialism leaves less to distribute. That further weakens society's ability to realize the Capitalist goal of universal opulence to the lowest ranks.""

Prof. Dean notes that neo-feudalism is being addressed by Joel Kotkin, another first-rate thinker and member of my own conservative tribe. Kotkin has recently published The Coming of Neo-Feudalism: A Warning to the Global Middle Class. Kotkin: ""Following a remarkable epoch of greater dispersion of wealth and opportunity, we are inexorably returning towards a more feudal era marked by greater concentration of wealth and property, reduced upward mobility, demographic stagnation, and increased dogmatism.""

The emergence of neo-feudalism is real. It is pernicious. It presents as dire.

Thus let's welcome the attention of rigorous minds, including those on the far left.

After inventorying the libertarian (Tyler Cowen) and conservative (Kotkin) position, Dean moves to the tech perspective: ""A number of technology commentators share the libertarian/conservative critique of technology's role in contemporary feudalization even as they don't embrace fossil fuels and suburbia."" She concludes that ""Capitalism is turning itself into neofeudalism."" I dispute both the role of technology and the proposition that capitalism, rightly understood, is even capable of turning itself into neo-feudalism.

Prof. Dean also provides a trenchant critique of left-wing shibboleths.

""The big confrontation today is not between democracy and fascism. Although popular with liberals, this formulation makes little sense given the power of oligarchs — financiers, media and real estate moguls, carbon and tech billionaires. …. Organized labor in much of the Global North delivered a cooperative working class in exchange for a piece of the good life. Labor's defeat and the subsequent dismantling of the welfare state should have demonstrated once and for all the bankruptcy of a strategy requiring compromise with capitalist exploitation. … Universal Basic Income is an untenable survivalist approach. It promises just enough to keep those in the hinterlands going and barely enough for urban renters to hand over to their landlords. Catastrophism becomes that hip negativity denigrating hope and effort, as if the next hundred years or so just don't matter.""

I hold neofeudalism as antithetical to capitalism while applauding Prof. Dean's analysis of ""a new socioeconomic structure with four interlocking features: parcellated sovereignty, new lords and peasants, hinterlandization, and catastrophism."" I dispute that the cause of neofeudalism is ""capitalist expropriation of the social surplus"" while concurring that ""neofeudalism brings with it the insecurity and anxiety of an overwhelming sense of catastrophe. There is good reason to feel insecure.""

Workers, the ""proletariat,"" wish to and, with true capitalism, can enter the middle class, the ""bourgeoisie."" The communist call for class warfare is toxic. Yet the emergence of neo-feudalism is toxic as well.

Attacking neofeudalism is a moral imperative. Shame on us, the thought leaders of the free market, if we do not grapple with the emergence of neofeudalism as forthrightly as Prof. Dean. If we don't rise to the occasion of re-educating an intellectually bankrupt GOP and a stale conservative movement as to the armature of true capitalism we are derelict in our duty to champion the moral imperative of fashioning and implementing policies the deliver equitable prosperity.

Prof. Dean? Game on!

253,Benko,Ralph,newsmax,"The ""Tenth Commandment"" of Capitalism prohibits imposing wage or price controls. The left demands Congress raise the statutory minimum wage to $15. It also has demanded imposing price controls over your internet service providers, cunningly calling this government price control ""net neutrality."" And so forth. This is well intended. That said, we know what road to where is paved with good intentions.

Ronald Reagan, promptly after being sworn in as president, decontrolled oil and gas prices. Conventional Republicans, expecting blame for a spike in gas prices at the pump, were apprehensive. Reagan was unfazed. No such spike occurred. In talking about what he was doing he genially alluded to a Roman emperor, Diocletian, who ruled almost 2,000 years ago. Diocletian catastrophically imposed price controls. Reagan, whose political enemies had tried to use his age against him, jovially said: ""I am one of the few persons old enough to remember that.""

One of the most fundamental laws of nature is that prices are determined by two things only: supply and demand. Yes, the government has the power to ""set"" prices. That's what the Soviet Union did. The result? Long waits for shabby goods. The Nixon/Carter price controls gave us gas lines. Surprise!

Yes. The government has the power to step in and punish people for selling something at a higher-than-officially-mandated price. When the government does that it makes people's lives worse. That repeated ""Lucy and the Football"" outcome doesn't stop officious officials who think they can repeal a law of nature. King Canute, lore has it, demonstrated the limitations of political power to rebut the flattery of his courtiers by commanding the incoming tide not to wet his feet and robes. He got soaked. Q.E.D.

But let's get one thing straight. A good capitalist, like me, is in favor of raising wages. The question is how one does that? By economic growth polices increasing demand for labor! If the government raises wages by diktat, ignoring the fact that if a job pays more than the value it adds to the world, the job soon disappears? Not good!

An unskilled job with mediocre pay is better than no job at all. This is especially true when it can lead to skill development and to a higher paid job as is common on the climb from unskilled to semi-skilled to skilled labor. Paul Ryan started off as a waiter on Capitol Hill. Being a shrewd dude he worked his way up to Speaker of the House and vice presidential nominee. If a too-high minimum wage had locked him out of that waiter's job he could not have gotten onto the first rung of that ladder.

Another example? ""Net neutrality"" was a cunning way of forbidding the companies who provide the (expensive) equipment that connects us to the internet to charge Netflix more for delivering thousands of times more content than it charges for delivering a measly email. Nothing ""neutral"" about that! Happily, the Trump FCC stopped this price control madness before it crippled internet access.

The more the government dictates prices the worse off we become. Politicos are always on the lookout to deliver goodies to their voters (and donors). Free goodies? What's not to love? Looting the economy can bring short term benefits but always causes long term destruction, that's what.

Mises, as conveyed to us via Ebeling at Fee.org, wrote of how Diocletian destroyed Rome:

""The marvelous civilization of antiquity perished because it did not adjust its moral code and its legal system to the requirements of the market economy. A social order is doomed if the actions which its normal functioning requires are rejected by the standards of morality, are declared illegal by the laws of the country, and are prosecuted as criminal by the courts and the police. The Roman Empire crumbled to dust because it lacked the spirit of [classical] liberalism and free enterprise. The policy of interventionism and its political corollary, the Fuhrer principle, decomposed the mighty empire as they will by necessity always disintegrate and destroy any social entity.""

Yes, socialism can offer the minimum wage illusion. But capitalism is the path to creating real, higher, maximum, wages. The Nixon/Carter price controls on oil and gas created shortages, not ample affordable energy. The seductively framed ""net neutrality"" would have taken us back toward dial-up rather than letting us vault ahead to the power to download a movie in less than 10 seconds rather than 7 minutes. Rent control induces housing shortages. And so forth.

Respect the law of supply and demand. Hence the importance of the Tenth Commandment of Capitalism: ""No government shall exercise control over wages or prices, including the pricing of telecommunication services, rent, or imposition of a minimum wage.""

Phil Kerpen, one of the top proponents of the power of free markets to create prosperity in Washington, provided the backstory here: ""The REINS Act started as an idea in the head of a remarkable 78-year-old tea party activist in Alexandria, Ky., named Lloyd Rogers. In 2009, Rogers went to meet with his then-congressman Geoff Davis at a town hall meeting. Both were outraged about an EPA storm water management consent decree that cost the three northern Kentucky counties in a consolidated sewer district about a billion dollars, doubling water fees. … Davis took the idea back to Washington and huddled with his key advisers to develop the simple idea into a robust, workable piece of legislation. That idea became the REINS Act…. The REINS Act cuts to the heart of abuse of regulatory power by requiring any major regulatory action to pass the House and Senate and be signed by the president … before it can take effect.""

The philosophy behind this goes way back. Back to the Declaration of Independence, in fact, which predicated the legitimacy of declaring independence from Great Britain in part on a list of grievances. Among these were the King's having ""erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.""

The political partner to true capitalism — the economic system that allows us to freely own and invest our savings legitimately earned — is representative democracy. Sometimes this is even more precisely called liberal republicanism. This was (and still is, if tarnished by progressives) the American Way!

There is a terrible internal contradiction on the hard left, those bold enough to admit to being socialists as such as well as those closeted as ""progressives."" The left routinely sings the praises of ""democracy."" At the same time it sneakily prefers to use the government institutions least responsive to the will of the people to advance its socialist agenda.

The left uses the courts — judges, generally appointed and for long terms, and, in the federal judiciary's case, life — and the career civil service (known less gloriously as ""bureaucrats"" or, in the words of the Declaration, ""swarms of Officers"") to cram its socialist policies down our throats. The left's phony praise for democracy is at best hypocritical and, really truly, dishonest. Relying so heavily on the courts and the bureaucrats, not our elected officials, tramples the Constitution.

What's the left's real game of which I have written at length elsewhere? The left is determined to destroy the classical liberal republican Judeo-Christian capitalist culture that makes America exceptional. The left is determined to replace the American Way with a totalitarian (meaning all power is vested in the government) nihilistic (meaning there is no meaning) undifferentiated radically egalitarian (which in the French Revolution led to wholesale guillotining in a ""Reign of Terror."")

As I wrote: ""The left believes that by dominating the culture, including civic groups, and using the courts and insulated government agencies, it will change the facts on the ground. Then it will win the political mandate. … The left has notched many victories and its morale is high. The left also believes that by putting its policies in place it will, in the end, win the political battles.""

The left chronically takes liberties with the truth. That said, sometimes it is candid about its agenda and its commitment to ruthless means. The Communist Manifesto, the left's charter document, explicitly calls for using the ""means of despotic inroads on the rights of property, and on the conditions of bourgeois production.""

""Despotic"" is the antithesis of representative democracy.

""The rights of property"" are the foundation of capitalism.

Read it and weep. The left is waging relentless war on the legitimacy of capitalism and liberal republicanism. Hence the importance of the Ninth Commandment of Capitalism to shift the power back from the bureaucrats and into the hands of our elected, and accountable, elected officials.

The Ninth Commandment would go a long way toward thwarting the left's despotic means and neutralizing its hostility to the ""conditions of bourgeoise (meaning, middle class) production"" by restoring to our elected officials both authority and accountability for regulations that have a big impact on our livelihoods.

Tell your elected officials to pass the REINS Act!

255,Benko,Ralph,newsmax,"Many politicians pay lip service to the rule of law. For a statute — a legislative enactment — to rise to the dignity of law it must serve justice. Justice is at the very basis of the British common law as influentially set forth in Blackstone's Commentaries. Blackstone summarized the law imported wholesale into the early United States. It is the law that underlies the jurisprudence in most states today. As the Pledge of Allegiance to which I, and so many of us, have taken concludes: ""with liberty and justice to all.""

Justice?

Blackstone, in his Commentaries, observes:

""As, therefore, the Creator is a Being, not only of infinite power, and wisdom, but also of infinite goodness, He has been pleased so to contrive the constitution and frame of humanity, that we should want no other prompter than to inquire after and pursue the rule of right, but only our own self-love, that universal principle of action. For He has so intimately connected, so inseparably interwoven the laws of eternal justice with the happiness of each individual, that the latter cannot be attained but by observing the former; and, if the former be punctually obeyed, it cannot but induce the latter. … This law of nature, being coeval with mankind and dictated by God Himself, is of course superior in obligation to any other. It is binding over all the globe in all countries, and at all times: no human laws are of any validity, if contrary to this; and such of them as are valid derive all their force, and all their authority, mediately or immediately, from this original.""

Blackstone, the fountainhead of American law, has been forgotten except by antiquarians (like me). Justice thus wanes. Civil asset forfeiture and disproportionate fines are symptomatic. For the rule of law to be restored to respect we must reverse this travesty.

The Pulitzer Center tells the chilling story of how ""the federal government took in $36.5 billion in assets police seized from people on America's roads and in its poorer neighborhoods, many of whom never were charged with a crime or shown to have drugs."" That exercise of arbitrary power is a disgrace to Justice. And to America. Per the Pulitzer Center:

""Police watch for suspicious cars with out-of-state license plates and stop them for minor traffic violations, such as changing lanes without a blinker or touching the fog line on the edge of the road. If police find occupants with suspicious stories or mannerisms, they ask to search the vehicle. If they find large amounts of cash and other suspicious circumstances, they seize the cash as drug-related, send it along to the federal government for forfeiture, getting back 80 percent to buy new equipment, computers, jail cells, guns and ammunition.""

What sneaky legal loophole could the police be exploiting to confiscate the property of those never found guilty of a crime?

""In 1996, the U.S. Supreme Court embraced the ancient notion of property as the offender. The case involved a woman named Tina Bennis, whose husband, John, had been caught by the Detroit police having sex with a prostitute in the family car. The authorities declared the car to be a public nuisance and seized it. Tina Bennis, who knew nothing of her husband's escapades, claimed she shouldn't lose her half of the car. The Supreme Court disagreed, 5-4.

""Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist based this decision on an old precedent involving the Palmyra, a ship commissioned as a privateer by the King of Spain to attack U.S. vessels. A 19th-century court ruled ""the thing is here considered as the offender."" The ship would be seized even if the owner was innocent of the privateering. In the same way, a state could seize the Bennis family car even though Tina Bennis didn't know about her husband's illegal use to cheat on her.""

In retrospect this represents a miscarriage of justice. Rehnquist must be turning in his grave.

The Constitution's Fifth Amendment, applying to the federal government, and the 14th Amendment, applying this to the states, provides that no person shall ""be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law."" Surely forfeiture of property without trial cannot, whatever its antique antecedents be comfortably considered ""due process.""

The Eighth Amendment to the Constitution explicitly prohibits excessive fines and, thus, Justice demands that any such fines be proportionate to the severity of the offense and the ability of those adjudicated guilty to pay.

True capitalism is ever rooted in Justice. Always. The Eighth Capitalist Commandment, ""Civil asset forfeiture to the federal, state, or any municipal government is prohibited and criminal and civil fines shall be proportional to both the ability of the adjudicated party to pay these and to the severity of the infraction"" will, adopted, restore Justice.

256,Benko,Ralph,newsmax,"Going into massive debt is rarely consistent with prosperity. Rather the opposite.

President Trump once bragged that ""I'm the king of debt. I'm great with debt. Nobody knows debt better than me,"" Trump told Norah O'Donnell in an interview that aired on ""CBS This Morning."" ""I've made a fortune by using debt, and if things don't work out I renegotiate the debt. I mean, that's a smart thing, not a stupid thing.""

Meaning: Trump repeatedly stuck it to his presumably gullible creditors. He there was bragging about defaulting on millions of dollars of business borrowing. Now, he raises the stakes by a million-fold! And guess what? We, the people, are now the ones on the hook!

Now, under President Trump's leadership, the federal government is incurring trillions (millions of millions), not mere millions, of dollars in new debt. Donald Trump may have been King, but President Trump is securing his claim to the title of Emperor of debt.

That said, a few of us still prefer that the government confine its spending to its income except when incurring debt for appropriate public capital improvements such as roads, bridges, aqueducts and sewer systems. When dealing with elected officials, getting spending restraint is easier said than done. What to do?

President Ronald Reagan, at a fundraising reception for Sen. Orrin Hatch, once said:

""I made a speech a while ago comparing their spending habits to those of drunken sailors. And then a number of my staff members told me that that was unfair to drunken sailors because they at least were doing it with their own money. Seriously though, it's clear that Congress is incapable of coming to grips with the challenge of deficit spending. It is time for structural change, for a line-item veto, and for a balanced budget amendment. Eighty-five percent of the American people say they want just that — think of that, a balanced budget amendment. … It's an idea whose time has come. It's an idea that was first thought of by Thomas Jefferson. He said it was the greatest omission in the Constitution that the government was not denied the right to borrow. Well, let's make old Tom happy.""

Per Wikipedia, ""Balanced-budget provisions have been added to the constitutions of most U.S. states, the Basic Law of Germany, the Hong Kong Basic Law, Spain, Italy and the Swiss Constitution. It is often proposed that a balanced-budget rule be added to the federal United States Constitution. Most balanced-budget provisions make an exception for times of war, national emergency, or recession, or allow the legislature to suspend the rule by a supermajority vote.""

There are many different ways to structure a balanced budget amendment. Given the importance of the First Commandment (a 28% top tax rate) and Second Commandment (not taking away deductions and credits except to cut rates) of Capitalism it is important that such an amendment be written to withhold from Congress any pretext for raising taxes.

This version seems to have generated the greatest consensus: ""The Treasury and any other instrumentality of the United States shall not incur any additional bonded liabilities except upon approval by two-thirds of the legislatures of the States."" This requires a supermajority of states to raise the debt ceiling. Now the Congress, after some wild posturing and playing chicken, inevitably grants itself an increase in its credit line. Facepalm!

PolitiFact reports that (at least) 46 out of the 50 states are legally required to balance their budgets. Most conventional economists, having been indoctrinated in the Keynesian deficit spending to prime the pump during downturns, are appalled at the idea that the federal government would have to balance its budget. The requirement of a balanced budget does not seem to have damaged the citizens of those states.

The Capitalist League's mission is to create universal affluence. Not hardship. That said, note that the citizens of Latvia and Estonia, after tightening their belts during the Great Recession of 2007-09, ended up with the fastest growing economies in Europe. Hence our support for a balanced budget amendment.

Per The Guardian: ""The example of Latvia is particularly stark. The small Baltic state suffered the worst recession in Europe, with a 24% drop in GDP between 2007 and 2009. Two years later its economy was the fastest growing in the EU, putting Latvia in a position possibly to join the euro. Estonia, meanwhile, grew by 7.6% last year, five times the eurozone average.""

So! We don't buy the idea that forcing government to live within its means is economically suicidal. Welcome to the Seventh Commandment of Capitalism, the requirement that Uncle Sam spend no more than he takes in (and not raise taxes to take in more!)

257,Benko,Ralph,newsmax,"The Fifth Commandment of Capitalism? ""The federal government shall generously fund research and development which are the foundation of the nation's prosperity, skilled jobs and material quality of life."" This one is the most controversial to libertarians, who mistrust every word that government says including ""and"" and ""the."" Sometimes they go too far.

Don't get me wrong. Hardcore libertarians provide an excellent corrective to the prevailing sentimentality over government! I had the privilege of government service, spending a strange but educational thousand days as a career civil servant in the days of Reagan.

Turns out that career civil servants (""bureaucrats"") are about the same as the rest of us. Those who work in government are not obviously smarter or nobler than you. (Nor, typically, less so.)

They tend to be constrained by an inherently risk-averse system. That said, the federal government has done some remarkable things on the R&D front. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency invented the internet.

Thanks, in part, to inventive genius animating DARPA you are reading this. Thank you, Robert E. Kahn. Thank you Vint Cerf. And thank you, Al Gore, who, per Kahn and Cerf, let the internet genie out of the bottle by leading the effort to deregulate it. Credit where due.

And do consider the space program. This reached its apotheosis with Apollo. NASA yielded far more than Tang. NASA was instrumental in giving us the multi-trillion dollar gold mine called Silicon Valley.

Hope Reese, author of The Code: Silicon Valley and the Remaking of America, interviewed at OneZero, reveals how the government (especially NASA) as a customer engendered American digital dominance.

""Dwight Eisenhower never declared, 'I shall build a science city in Northern California.' Yet the military spending and space program spending that started under Eisenhower was the launching pad for Silicon Valley's rocket. ... Federal contracts were Fairchild Semiconductor's bread and butter. The integrated circuit was developed at Fairchild by Bob Noyce and others which proved to be an extraordinary advance in transistor technology — the beginning of the microprocessor that would eventually become a computer on chip miniaturization. It was an extraordinary device, but there was no commercial market for it. Then the Apollo program becomes a customer, and when NASA orders up a whole slew of those chips, that drives down the price. Then you were able to scale it up and make it something that can be a commercial product. No one was sitting behind a desk in Washington saying, 'Oh, this is how we're going to build a tech industry.' But that is what happened.""

That's by no means all. Per Christopher Mims writing recently in the Wall Street Journal:

Taxpayer-funded basic scientific research has again and again paid huge dividends to society, both in improving our quality of life and boosting our economy. Indeed, many of the industries the U.S. dominates these days, like software, were seeded in a Silicon Valley where the U.S. government was the area's first and most important venture capitalist. Since the mid 1960s, the proportion of U.S. gross domestic product spent on public R&D has gone from a peak of 2% to the present figure of 0.6%, and the U.S. went from first in the world in terms of such spending to 13th. China rocketed ahead, and has done other forward-thinking things like co-locating manufacturing with its publicly funded R&D centers, allowing a direct translation of that research into new industries and millions of new jobs.

Credit the inclusion of the Fifth Commandment of Capitalism to the greatest lawgiver since Hammurabi, the Honorable Norman Augustine. He is the holder of almost countless technology honors. Per Augustine, numerous studies including those that won Robert Solow and Paul Romer Nobel Prizes in Economics, demonstrate that as much as 85% of the long-term growth in America's economy is attributable to advancements in science and technology.

The payoffs from the successes of federal R&D dwarf the cost of the failures. This inconvenient truth is supported by abundant evidence, however horrifying to libertarians.

Augustine, a former undersecretary of the Army, later CEO of Lockheed Martin, isn't credulous about the follies of Big Government. His Law Number XVI states that ""In the year 2054, the entire defense budget will purchase just one aircraft. This aircraft will have to be shared by the Air Force and Navy 3–1/2 days each per week except for leap year when it will be made available to the Marines for the extra day."" And yet, government R&D is a cause of national prosperity.

Deal with it. Depart from the libertarian dogma. To propel America back to prosperity adhere to the Fifth Law of Capitalism: ""The federal government shall generously fund research and development which are the foundation of the nation's prosperity, skilled jobs and material quality of life.""

258,Benko,Ralph,newsmax,"I know a lot of people who are consumed with anxiety about whether they, their family, America, and the world will be ruined by the Pandemic Panic. I don't blame them. Our politicians, both Donks and Pachys, terrify me, too, by their ignorance of what works. They are flirting with creating a new Dark Ages.

I've seen this before, back in the 1970s. Have they learned nothing?

There are countless examples of how smart leaders have taken a country from ruin to sustained prosperity. I've written about or alluded to some here , here and here. There's lots more. Generating prosperity is simple. So, it's up to us. Email your Congressperson and tell them how!

Step up and help guide our officials' footsteps onto the Paths of Righteousness. And Affluence? Because, you know, I cannot do it alone. (Believe me, I've tried.) Let's together exercise our Citizen Superpower and rescue America from its leaders. The good news? I actually know how. During my lifetime America tentupled (if that's a word) the size of its real economy. I was watching! Apparently our pols missed it.

The St. Louis Fed's chart from around the time I was born, 1952, shows that then real GDP was around $2 trillion growing to over $21 trillion in 2019. (Not adjusted for population, which has about doubled, yet quintupling per capita GDP.)

From 1980 my team, the Supply-Siders, drove world GDP up from $11 trillion to $88 trillion (an octupling.) The Dow soared from 814 on the day in 1979 Reagan declared for the presidency to >20,000 today. Twenty-sixtupling in nominal terms.

Back in 1986 I founded the Prosperity Caucus. Last year I co-authored The Capitalist Manifesto and co-founded The Capitalist League and the Prosperity Coalition. So … we know how to pull the economy out of its tailspin. Not only do we know. We've done it. Let's do it again.

If you'd like to see America rescued from economic ruin and hear the economy roar again it's all up to us to get our leaders to embrace the Ten Commandments of Capitalism. Find the Big Ten all here. I've written about the First here, the Second and Third.

Today: the Fourth: ""No gift, estate, or inheritance tax shall have a top rate of more than 10% and no such tax shall be imposed on any such transfers of $10 million or less, annually adjusted for inflation.""

This is one of my personal favorites because it is the antithesis of the Third Commandment of The Communist Manifesto which calls, verbatim, for the ""Abolition of all rights of inheritance."" I'm an old school anti-Communist. I fought in the Cold War. USA! USA! USA!

And, also, because I despise grave robbery.

Another reason is that I, a constitutional lawyer, consider the death tax unconstitutional. I once pointed out its unconstitutionality to the late, great, U.S. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan on a flight we shared from Albany N.Y. to D.C. Moynihan professed interest. Nothing came of it.

I never give up.

The most obscure provision in the U.S. Constitution states that ""The Congress shall have Power to declare the Punishment of Treason, but no Attainder of Treason shall work Corruption of Blood…."" Only legal history geeks like me know what ""Corruption of Blood"" is.

Per lawstack exchange, ""In English law during the late Medieval and early modern period … it was possible for Parliament to pass a ""Bill Of Attainder."" This declared a person guilty of a crime, often treason, by legislative act, without any trial or other legal process. … Often a Bill of Attainder … confiscated the convicted person's property, preventing his (or rarely her) heirs from inheriting…""

The statesmen who wrote the Constitution believed that preventing heirs from inheriting their ancestor's property was so heinous that they prohibited it even as a punishment for the most vile crime they knew: high treason. Yet Congress now can ghoulishly hijack as much of our life savings as it likes — currently up to 40%, but 77% between 1941 and 1976 — merely for the offense of having lived the American dream and grown wealthy.

Abominable! Griswold vs. Connecticut found penumbras to Constitutional rights. The prohibition against Corruption of Blood surely deserves its own penumbra.

The Fourth Capitalist Commandment honors the letter and spirit of the U.S. Constitution and gives a Big Diss to Marx and Engels by severely constraining the estate tax. Admittedly, I don't much care for trust fund prep school princelings. Yet the right to leave your estate to your overprivileged suburban monster children is a small price to pay for prosperity for the rest of us.

To regain prosperity all we have to do is take our elected officials by the ear and teach them the Ten Commandments of Capitalism. End the Death Tax!

259,Benko,Ralph,newsmax,"We are watching the Pandemic Panic which could turn into a long, deep, Depression. Here's how to end it. There are many examples of countries emerging from much worse conditions into prosperity with astonishing speed. You just have to know how.

Fortunately, we do know exactly how. It's called ""Capitalism.""

Unfortunately, Congress doesn't understand how capitalism works. The Republicans pay lip service to the capitalist brand but think that it means borrow trillions and mail checks to their donors. Democrats attack the brand and demand that Uncle Sam borrow trillions and mail checks to their voters.

Neither plan will end the panic. They're simple souls. Congress really should change its name to ""Clueless"" for the duration. Luckily, I am here to educate them, through you.

Don't thank me. Instead, please do your duty as a citizen and email them with how to make America prosper again. That's how America was designed to work. So … go do your part!

What do they have to do to get the economy sizzling again? Just follow the Ten Commandments of Capitalism. The First Commandment caps the top income tax rate at 28%. The Second Commandment prohibits taking away deductions and credits except for the purpose of cutting tax rates.

Now let's look at the Third Commandment: ""All assets will be indexed to inflation for the purpose of calculating capital gains."" Why is this important enough to be a Commandment?

One of the core doctrines of Communism, right there in The Communist Manifesto, is that the middle class (""the bourgeoisie"") is evil, oppressing workers (""the proletariat."") The Communist prescription? ""Class struggle."" The workers must confiscate the life savings (""capital"") of the middle class.

No really! You could look it up!

The Communists want to take our life savings. They're not shy about their goals. Some leading Democrats are openly proposing a wealth tax. Supposedly only on the super-rich. Ha! The original income tax was a tiny percentage on the top income of the super-rich. See what happens when we let the camel stick his nose into our tent? Don't fall for it.

And there's already a wealth tax on everyone who owns property. The government taxes the nominal ""profit"" on the sale of an investment even if sold at real cost or a loss.

Suppose you invested $1,000 20 years ago and the investment was just breaking even, just keeping up with inflation. For you to just break even you would have to sell it for $1,500 which, due to inflation, would buy the same amount as the $1,000 you invested.

When you sell it, Uncle Sam now makes you pay taxes on that phony $500 ""gain."" That's not a real gain. It's just breaking even. Uncle Sam is confiscating your savings. Sneaky!

If you're a Communist that's great. Sam's doing exactly what the Communist Manifesto calls for: ""despotic inroads on the rights of property."" Congress confiscating capital — looting our savings — and giving it to their donors or voters? Hey! The rhetoric about doing right by working people is the sugar coating on the Satan-sandwich of communism.

Communists gloat on their plan to loot the middle class' life savings. The rest of us should be shocked. Capitalists have a more noble goal. Per Adam Smith, our mission is to create ""universal opulence which extends itself to the lowest ranks of the people.""

Meaning, capitalists are out to make even poor people rich.

The Communists? Make rich people poor.

It is easy to understand why many Democratic presidential contenders, pandering to their socialist (and, let it be said, otnay-ootay-ightbray) base, would oppose indexing capital gains for inflation. Confiscating people's life savings is what communists are supposed to do! What's mystifying is why Republicans aren't righteously demanding this index.

Maybe they just need some help from us. The Way Washington Works is that constituents — we voters who can vote for (or against) the Representative who represents us — have a superpower. If enough of us — known on Capitol Hill as ""the folks back home"" — communicate our will most Representatives will bend over backwards to please us.

If they don't obey us we will pick someone who will listen to us and elect a new Representative. But they can't read our minds. We have to tell them what to do!

So if you would like to see America rescued from the Pandemic Panic and see the economy roaring again you have to take action. Let your own pet Representative know that you want them to embrace the Ten Commandments of Capitalism, including The Third Commandment: ""All assets will be indexed to inflation for the purpose of calculating capital gains.""

They can find them all here.

All ten commandments.

Capitalism alone makes us prosperous.

The Ten Commandments are the laws of policy that allow workers to achieve economic security and even affluence.

These commandments are so powerful that, taken together, they can end a recession even a depression, fast, even one induced by something as horrible as a pandemic. (They've cured worse.) The First Commandment is to keep the top income tax rate at 28% or less. Currently it's 37%. We explained here why 28% is better.

Capitalism's Second Commandment codifies Grover Norquist's famous Taxpayer Protection Pledge: There shall be no reduction or elimination of income tax deductions and credits unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates.

In 1986, Grover Norquist, founder of Americans for Tax Reform, encouraged by President Reagan, formulated a simple pledge for political candidates. Candidates were asked to pledge, in writing, to not take away tax deductions or credits unless for the purpose of cutting tax rates. Per ATR,

""Politicians often run for office saying they won't raise taxes, but then quickly turn their backs on the taxpayer. The idea of the Pledge is simple enough: Make them put their no-new-taxes rhetoric in writing. By signing the Taxpayer Protection Pledge, candidates and incumbents make a written commitment to oppose any and all tax increases. While ATR has the role of promoting and monitoring the Pledge, the Taxpayer Protection Pledge is made to a candidate's constituents, who deserve to know where candidates stand on the tax issue.""

The success of the Pledge has been remarkable. Other advocacy groups have formulated pledges only to discover candidates invincibly opposed to signing even when they agree! Politicians hate to be pinned down even on principles that they claim to passionately support. But Grover's pledge was and is a success.

Norquist, an old friend, is also one of the wittiest, kindest and most effective people in the policy arena. These qualities were on display during his appearance on 60 Minutes almost a decade ago, reprised at Business Insider:

Steve Kroft: But you make it pretty clear. If someone breaks the pledge, you're gonna do everything you can to get rid of them. Norquist: To educate the voters that they raise taxes. And again, we educate people — Kroft: To get rid of them. Norquist: To encourage them to go into another line of work, like shoplifting or bank robbing, where they have to do their own stealing. Kroft: You've got them by the shorthairs. Norquist: The voters do. Yeah.

Why is the Pledge so important as to warrant inclusion as the Second Commandment of Capitalism?

First, eliminating tax deductions is a sneaky way of covertly raising taxes. It allows Uncle Sam to take more money out of our pockets without raising tax rates. Taking money out of our pockets is, per Norquist, ""like bank robbing,"" however done. It makes us taxpayers poorer. The Second Commandment of Capitalism does not prohibit eliminating deductions if the money is used to reduce tax rates, checkmating Big Government!

Second, there is a strong consensus in favor of the Pledge, at least among Republicans. Per ATR, 47 Senators (enough to filibuster any proposal to the contrary) and 171, a supermajority, of the 238 Republican representatives in the current Congress, have taken the Pledge. A supermajority already agrees with it and we've codified it! (Constitutional Amendment, anyone? Bring it on, ATR!)

There are many ways that Uncle Sam likes to piously erode, even destroy, us workers' economic security. One is bad monetary policy. (We'll put paid to that with Commandment 6!) Another is bad regulatory policy. (Commandment 9 will constrain that!) Then there's extravagant government spending. (See Commandment 7!) Government's first go-to, however, tends to be onerous taxation. That's what the First, Second, Third and Fourth Commandments are designed to stop.

Governments' addiction to over-tax their people goes back to before the dawn of history. In The Way of Life, written well over 2,000 years ago by Lao Tzu (translation courtesy of Poetry in Translation) says:

The people are starving.

It's because their rulers over-tax them

That the people are starving.

To keep ""we the people"" from starving it is crucial, and certainly legitimate, to stop our rulers from overtaxing us. The clear-cut, no-fooling-around terms of the ATR Taxpayer Protection Pledge provide important protection. That's why it is the Second Commandment of Capitalism.

Desire prosperity? Demand that our politicos embrace the Ten Commandments of Capitalism, including the ATR Pledge.

261,Benko,Ralph,newsmax,"The current coronavirus pandemic is inducing an economic depression.

Capitalism has regularly proved the most effective generator of equitable prosperity.

When we administer capitalism’s high octane version, its ""Ten Commandments,"" it works like a charm.

Hey Washington: Use capitalism to get the economy roaring again.

The ""Ten Commandments"" are 10 high-powered prosperity inducers.

They are pragmatic, not dogmatic.

First, though, let’s dispel the big myth that is paralyzing our officials’ ability to take decisive action.

‎Karl Marx's and ‎Friedrich Engels' ""The Communist Manifesto"" (1848) propounded the myth that capitalism oppresses workers. This myth lingers, especially among the ""progressives"" who infest the Democratic Party.

Don’t fall for it.

True capitalism benefits workers as well as businesses.

There are two flavors of true capitalism.

The left-leaning version is known as ""social market capitalism.""

Germany invented it and the Nordic countries are its most enthusiastic practitioners, most happily. The market is left free to generate wealth. The government uses the abundant tax revenues from that to fund a suite of popular public services, services which aren’t abused.

Like public libraries. Or, health insurance.

The right-leaning version is popularly known as ""laissez-faire capitalism.""

Singapore, Hong Kong, and, to a lesser extent, the United States practice this. This holds that the private sector is better at providing more affordable, higher quality, services and giving people opportunities to earn and afford them.

Both lead to human flourishing.

The snake in the woodpile?

Class warfare. ""The Communist Manifesto"" opens with the words ""A spectre is haunting Europe — the spectre of communism."" Then it states its fundamental doctrine: ""The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles. Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight. . . . ""

This specter — really, an imaginary hobgoblin — still infests the world’s imagination, including that of the intelligentsia. It is wrong. It’s not merely wrong, it’s toxic.

It undermines the spirit of cooperation between labor and capital.

That cooperation is the source of mutual prosperity.

The mass media generates narratives — stories with heroes and villains — rather than simply reporting the facts.

Don't blame the mass media for pandering to us with what we prefer to consume: melodramas.

That said, this process generates some weird myths.

One of these myths is that the ""supply-side"" revolution was a ""right-wing thing,"" designed to privilege the rich and prejudice workers. Utterly untrue.

Rep. Jack Kemp kicked off the tax rate reduction process with his proposal of a 30% across-the-board (meaning, for everybody) income tax rate cut. Few now remember, but Kemp’s main policy swami, Jude Wanniski, was a self-proclaimed Marxist.

Or, as Jude put it, ""Marxian."" (A distinction without a difference.)

Kemp himself had been a labor union founder and president. Kemp, and Team Kemp, was passionately pro-labor. Reagan, too, had been a union president.

Reagan was elected twice as president of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG).

But wait. There’s more:

Kemp’s proposed tax rate cut was drawn directly from President John F. Kennedy’s own proposal for a 30% rate cut. Kemp embodied the spirit of general prosperity that JFK was advocating in his last major public speech when stating that ""A rising tide lifts all the boats.""

Both JFKs opposed class warfare.

But wait. There’s still more:

Good pro-labor democrats, under the inspiration of House Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, trumped Kemp’s proposed rate cut by immediately cutting the top tax rate from 70% to 50%. Surely Kemp and Reagan approved but did not dare to propose this for fear of being painted as just shills for the rich.

The Dems led.

But wait. There’s even still more:

Reagan’s second major income tax rate cut, also initiated by Kemp, dropped the top tax rate to 28%. That that rate cut was propelled by two good pro-labor Democrats, Sen. Bill Bradley and Rep. Richard Gephardt.

The reduction in tax rates — with the top rate getting dropped from 70% to 28% — was part of the recipe that supercharged America’s job growth.

Per commentator Peter Ferrara: ""During this seven-year recovery, the economy grew by almost one-third, the equivalent of adding the entire economy of West Germany, the third-largest in the world at the time, to the U.S. economy. In 1984 alone real economic growth boomed by 6.8%, the highest in 50 years. Nearly 20 million new jobs were created during the recovery, increasing U.S. civilian employment by almost 20%.""

Welcome to the Secret History Hidden in Plain Sight behind the first of the Ten Commandments of Capitalism. The First Commandment banished the specter of class warfare, at least for a time. Supermajorities of both Democrats and Republicans came together to enact this low top rate and usher in the attendant prosperity.

Welcome to the First Commandment of Capitalism. ""The highest marginal income tax rates for individuals and businesses shall not exceed 28%.""

263,Benko,Ralph,westernjournal,"Mr. President? A potentially fatal miscarriage of justice for former Texas Rep. Steve Stockman, among others, is occurring. You, sir, uniquely are in a position to see that justice is done. Exercise the powers of your office.

I just signed a letter for conservative leaders calling for clemency for at-risk nonviolent offenders including Stockman. Stockman, who I knew slightly and liked greatly before he left office, is a conservative firebrand. He is a flamboyant, sometimes over-the-top, dude.

He is far to even my right. That isn’t easy. I’ve been told that I’m to the right of Genghis Khan.

Stockman is now serving a 10-year sentence for misusing some charitable contributions for personal and political purposes. I am not here to relitigate his guilt or innocence after what The Texas Tribune called “a bizarre, weeks-long criminal trial” that “included hot air balloon rides, kennel bills and several purchases from one of those once-ubiquitous SkyMall catalogues — not to mention a new dishwasher, a pricey New Orleans hotel, flights to Africa, rehabilitation for alcoholism, an undercover intern and a trip to Disneyland.”

I am here to state that Steve Stockman’s 10-year sentence is painfully excessive and unjust. Some insist that the prosecution of Stockman was politically motivated. Not me. OK, Stockman was a political maverick who nettled the establishment. Among other mercurial acts he gave up a safe congressional seat to primary the politically invincible (and, in my view, admirable) Sen. John Cornyn.

TRENDING: Soccer Player Files Lawsuit Alleging She Was Forced Off Team for Refusing to Kneel

Stockman was buried by more of an avalanche than a landslide. That loss at the ballot box is a punishment befitting his eccentricity. A decade behind bars does not do him, or America, justice. No Bernie Madoff, he.

I do not cast aspersions on the motives of Stockman’s prosecutors. My concern? Per Statista, Stockman’s sentence is longer than the average time served for violent felonies. That’s an injustice. And now the pandemic is putting prisoners with comorbidities, like Stockman, at risk of death.

Death by pandemic does not serve justice. Justice is best served tempered with a dash of mercy. The Texas Tribune reported that “Ryan Patrick, the new U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Texas and the son of Lt. Gov Dan Patrick, was in the courtroom for the verdict.”

“‘When public officials use their office to defraud donors and violate federal law, we will hold them accountable,’ Patrick said in a statement Thursday afternoon. ‘Corrupt officials like former congressman Stockman make it harder for the honest ones to do their jobs.’”

Yes. Let justice be done. That said, a 10-year sentence is wildly excessive. It does not serve justice.

“My husband is not a danger to society. At a minimum, I want Steve to shelter at home so that he’s not sent to me in a body bag in a few weeks,” Patti Stockman said, calling on President Trump to pardon her husband, former GOP Rep. Steve Stockman. https://t.co/kx09cDrMCx pic.twitter.com/MnNNN2sSoc — The Hill (@thehill) April 9, 2020

H.L. Mencken writes in “Notes on Democracy”:

“I enjoy democracy immensely. It is incomparably idiotic, and hence incomparably amusing. Does it exalt dunderheads, cowards, trimmers, frauds, cads? Then the pain of seeing them go up is balanced and obliterated by the joy of seeing them come down. Is it inordinately wasteful, extravagant, dishonest? Then so is every other form of government: all alike are enemies to laborious and virtuous men. Is rascality at the very heart of it? Well, we have borne that rascality since 1776, and continue to survive. In the long run, it may turn out that rascality is necessary to human government, and even to civilization itself.”

Even if Steve Stockman were guilty of aggravated rascality – for which he was not convicted – a 10-year sentence is wildly excessive. Putting Stockman, and other nonviolent offenders, at risk of death by pandemic is horrific. It does not service justice.

Anatole France once ironically observed, “The law, in its majestic equality, forbids the rich as well as the poor to sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets, and to steal bread.”

To be worthy of the name law, law must always be conjoined with justice. Ten years — and, now, the real threat of death by pandemic — does not serve justice.

Mr. President? You recently said on declaring an end to social distancing: “Couldn’t it lead to death? Staying at home leads to death also, and it’s very traumatic for this country. Staying at home, if you look at numbers, that leads to a different kind of death, perhaps, but it leads to death also.”

“I’m going to have to make a decision, and I only hope to God it’s the right decision. But I would say, without question, it’s the biggest decision that I’ve ever had to make.”

Releasing Steve Stockman, if only to house arrest (although preferably by commuting his sentence along with those of other vulnerable nonviolent prisoners) is the right thing to do. It would temper justice with mercy.

Seek the advice of your counselor Ivanka Trump on the biggest decision of your life. Surely she will counsel mercy. Then send that lovable rascal Steve Stockman, together with other nonviolent offenders, home and out of harm’s way.

That is how to serve justice.

264,Benko,Ralph,newsmax,"President Donald Trump shows an instinctive, almost primal, grasp of how monetary policy — together, of course, with the pandemic — deserves much of the blame for our current economic woe.

If he does he holds the key to a possible sharp rebound as soon as we pass peak pandemic.

I have written about the dramatic lifting of the Great Depression from FDR’s revaluing gold to adjust for the post-World War I rise in commodity prices (if only temporarily due to later policy fumbles). And of the sizzling post-World War II recovery of a bombed-out Germany thanks to currency reform, so dramatic as to have been called an ""economic miracle."" I have alluded to many other shockingly powerful economic rebounds rooted in truly great monetary policy. Money is power.

In proclaiming the crucial importance of ""good money"" to equitable prosperity I know myself to be a voice in the wilderness. I am an outlier in believing that what worked so often in the past would work again now. (That said, special props to my mentor Lewis E. Lehrman, to Steve Forbes, and to esteemed monetary economist Scott Sumner for holding FDR advisor George Warren, chief architect of the revaluation of the dollar, as his role model.)

A few years ago Marc Levinson writing in The Wall Street Journal asked ""Why the Economy Doesn’t Roar Anymore: The long boom after World War II left Americans with unrealistic expectations, but there’s no going back to that unusual Golden Age.""

There he wrote that ""The French called this period les trente glorieuses, the 30 glorious years. Germans spoke of the Wirtschaftswunder, the economic miracle, while the Japanese, more modestly, referred to ""the era of high economic growth.""

In the English-speaking countries, it has more commonly been called the Golden Age. … Ever since the Golden Age vanished amid the gasoline lines of 1973, political leaders in every wealthy country have insisted that the right policies will bring back those heady days.""

So? What happened in 1973?

The year 1973 was when America definitively failed to reopen the gold window ""temporarily"" closed by President Nixon in 1971.

As Owen Humpage, of the Cleveland Fed, wrote in Federal Reserve History: ""On February 12, 1973 . . . the United States devalued the dollar by an additional 10 percent to $42 an ounce. When markets reopened, speculation against the dollar became rampant. Within a month nearly all major currencies were floating against the dollar. The Bretton Woods system was finished.""

Bretton Woods was the last vestige of the gold standard. The gold window remains tightly closed ever since and the economy has remained mostly sluggish or erratic. The closest we have come to gold-standard growth rates is Fed Chair Alan Greenspan’s ""Great Moderation"" and its attendant sizzling prosperity.

What was Greenspan’s secret?

In the February 2017 issue of The World Gold Council’s Gold Investor Greenspan declared, ""I view gold as the primary global currency. … Today, going back on to the gold standard would be perceived as an act of desperation. But if the gold standard were in place today we would not have reached the situation in which we now find ourselves. … When I was Chair of the Federal Reserve I used to testify before U.S. Congressman Ron Paul, who was a very strong advocate of gold. . . . I told him that U.S. monetary policy tried to follow signals that a gold standard would have created. That is sound monetary policy even with a fiat currency.""

The elites seem strangely unable to connect the dots between the end of the gold standard and the end of the golden age.

Donald Trump, fortunately, is immune to their ridicule.

As Timothy L. O’Brien wrote for Bloomberg in 2016, ""Donald Trump Loves Gold and Don’t You Forget It.""

Bloomberg’s Michelle Jamrisko reported, during the 2016 campaign, ""Make America Gold Again: Calls for Everyone’s Favorite Standard Are Back Again , "" about how Donald Trump and his runner-up Ted Cruz spoke positively about, or campaigned on, gold.

Shortly after Trump’s election Eliot Nelson and Jeffrey Young of HuffPost observed ""we give it a month until Trump calls for the gold standard to be reinstated because he likes the sound of it."" Years passed. Circumstances have changed dramatically.

Nelson and Young were just being snarky. But he who snarks last snarks best, especially if, per Greenspan, following signals that a gold standard would have created . . . would be sound monetary policy. Bingo.

Trump’s initiating a restoration of the classical gold standard would change the economic subject. It would satisfy what the Los Angeles Times headlined ""Economy in shambles Trump scrambles for a new economic message."" Done right this would lay the foundation for an economic rebound of historic proportion.

Mr. President? Money is power. Go for the gold!

265,Benko,Ralph,westernjournal,"A real-deal gold standard would end the coronavirus economic free fall and open the gates for an American economic miracle. The classical gold standard is anathema to academic economists. They are dead wrong.

Gold worked great to make America great in the first place and would work great again. Done right, “good money” — of which the gold standard is the gold standard — has unleashed prosperity many times, too often and too consistently to dismiss it as a fluke.

Most important at this critical moment? Trump gets this. America is blessed with both a president and a vice president who get gold.

Trump loves gold. Should the “gold standard option” for unleashing prosperity be brought to Trump’s attention, he is likely to get it and grab it. As Timothy L. O’Brien wrote for Bloomberg in 2016, “Donald Trump Loves Gold and Don’t You Forget It.”

O’Brien provided a long list of the many ways in which Trump has used gold to embellish both his life and his work.

TRENDING: Soccer Player Files Lawsuit Alleging She Was Forced Off Team for Refusing to Kneel

“Donald Trump had lots of gold on hand for his center-stage speech at the Republican Party’s nominating convention. … There were the huge gold towers flanking the jumbotron. There were cool gold stairs leading up to the stage, and a warm gold hue behind the power display of the TRUMP name. And the speaker’s podium itself was limned in gold,” O’Brien wrote.

“Gold surrounded Trump in Cleveland because Trump has always coveted gold. He’s not the first guy to love gold, of course, and in a nod to his predecessors, he titled one of his books ‘Midas Touch.’ But Trump loves gold in his own special way.”

O’Brien presented a dozen more striking examples of the gold motif in Trump’s life and goes on to reflect “What might be the policy implications of Trump’s obsession with gold?”

“He’s thought about returning the U.S. to the gold standard. ‘We used to have a very, very solid country because it was based on a gold standard,’ he told an audience in New Hampshire.

“‘It would be very, very hard to do at this point and one of the problems is we do not have the gold — other places have the gold.'”

Trump, back then, was misinformed by a popular misconception about how hard it would be to do. Truth is, America has far more gold than anyone. Problem solved!

Also, Mike Pence, speaking at the Detroit Economic Club in 2010, expressed respect for and interest in re-establishing the gold standard.

“My dear friend, the late Jack Kemp, probably would have urged me to adopt the gold standard, right here and now in Detroit,” Pence said. “Robert Zoellick, the president of the World Bank, encouraged that we rethink the international currency system including the role of gold, and I agree.”

“A pro-growth agenda begins with sound monetary policy.”

RELATED: F. Peter Brown: 5 Devastating Side Effects of Biden's Corporate Tax Hike

Pence was ridiculed by the left and left unfazed. As president of the 2012 Draft Pence for President independent Super PAC, I called Mr. Pence “the conservative champion” for good reason.

President Trump and Vice President Pence have strong allies and well-wishers who understand perfectly how to go about getting the gold standard right.

Several senior economic statesmen understand the premise and promise of gold. These include Reagan Gold Commissioner Lewis E. Lehrman, the dean of the classical gold standard; publishing executive Steve Forbes; futurist George Gilder; economic policy icon Dr. Arthur B. Laffer; Drs. Lawrence White and James Dorn; and belletrist James Grant.

The perfect gold standard legislation has already been written. This legislation was approved by the greatest political advocate of gold of our era, the late Rep. Jack Kemp. It was co-sponsored by none other than Trump confidante Newt Gingrich. Kemp’s Gold Standard Act of 1984 has all the right stuff.

The media is rightly fixated on the coronavirus, a threat to our lives. Meanwhile, barely noticed in its shadows lurks a menace to our livelihood: a despotic dollar. As Fortune recently put it, “King dollar is back, creating a big headache for the global economy at the worst possible time.”

As John Maynard Keynes wrote in his “General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money”: “Madmen in authority, who hear voices in the air, are distilling their frenzy from some academic scribbler of a few years back.”

Why should Trump let the madmen in authority channeling discredited neo-Keynesians continue to distill their deflationary frenzy, tanking the U.S. and world economies?

267,Benko,Ralph,newsmax,"New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has emerged in the 2020 presidential race, rising from the depths of the Media-Politico Complex like Godzilla from Tokyo Harbor. The betting odds still strongly favor Biden. However, having vanquished his declared rivals, Biden, suddenly, has turned strangely invisible. And Gov. Cuomo has thrust himself into the spotlight.

Coincidentally, both Cuomo and I were born in Queens and rose in Albany. Thus I have a long, albeit shallow, history with the Cuomo dynasty. A few scraps might be worth sharing. First, an overview. Here is how Cuomo could make a formidable rival to Trump.

The pandemic has changed the something of the 2020 election. It mostly had been a referendum on Donald Trump and the associated job creation and wage growth. Now the economy is a shut-in. The financial markets are in bear territory. The scope of the threat of the pandemic remains unclear.

This has turned the 2020 election into one about who is best fit to lead America out of the hot zone. How shall we both keep our most vulnerable safe and flatten the curve to minimize the casualties while avoiding a new Great Depression? That's it.

Now, the backstory. Almost 40 years ago I was a fledging lawyer based in Albany, N.Y.. Mario Cuomo, New York's lieutenant governor, was also based in Albany, the state capital. Meanwhile, businessman and philanthropist Lewis E. Lehrman reached out to me around our mutual passion for the gold standard. Just then I saw Lt. Gov. Cuomo, a minor but rising political star, on local public TV flagging Lehrman as a potential contender in the upcoming governor's race.

I became a high-level volunteer in the Lehrman gubernatorial campaign's upstate headquarters. As such I was privy to the gossip and gritty details of the campaign first watching Cuomo battle and defeat NYC mayor Ed Koch for the nomination. Then came the pitched battles with Lehrman,. who, shocking the political establishment, was on track to win.

Then, mysteriously, Lehrman's campaign TV commercial buys went dark throughout upstate for almost 10 days prior to the election. By the time Lehrman campaign HQ in NYC discovered that upstate had gone dark and got them running again there wasn't enough time to repair our vote deficit. Mario Cuomo won a close race, just maybe not fairly but certainly squarely.

Hey, as Mr. Dooley said, ""Politics ain't beanbag.” There's no crying in baseball.

Shortly thereafter I was able to plant the suggestion, through a mutual friend, that Gov. Cuomo name the Empire State Plaza tower building, the tallest skyscraper between NYC and Montreal, in honor of Albany's beloved, dying, mayor Erastus Corning, 2nd. Cuomo promptly did so. Soon thereafter I got tipped off that Gov. Cuomo was going to be making an appearance at the local PBS affiliate's telethon.

I volunteered to answer phones that night and, there, handed Mario Cuomo Jude Wanniski's The Way The World Works. This book had inspired me to enlist in the supply-side revolution. Cuomo took it and remarked, ""Hey, I know this book. It's Jack Kemp's bible. I'll read it with interest. Thanks!” At my prompt Jude contacted Cuomo but nothing came of it.

Mario Cuomo went on to serve honorably as governor for three terms even without adopting the supply-side agenda. He is mostly now remembered for an eloquent speech at the 1984 Democratic nominating convention. ""A Tale of Two Cities” was a soaring flight of political rhetoric, propelling him to party stardom, and for a long coy flirtation with a presidential run. The Democrats who adopted the supply-side agenda of equitable prosperity, Bill Bradley and Dick Gephardt, rose in national stature.

Now Gov. Andrew Cuomo is showing himself to be even more politically astute than his late father. He has lapped all other major Democrats, all obsessed with parochial issues like the Green New Deal, Medicare for All, gun control and whatnot. Cuomo, alone among the Donks, has his eye on the ball. It's the pandemic, stupid. Ending the pandemic's carnage to our health and financial security has become, per Red Sanders, not everything but the only thing.

The pandemic delivers an epic challenge. It demands a hero. Biden's inability to project himself as a warrior rather than a mere avuncular figure could cause his viability, and even candidacy, to falter.

Desperate times demand a leader of epic stature.

A champion.

A conqueror.

A lion-heart.

A hero.

Cuomo is nailing this.

Trump can run rings around Cuomo.

He cuts a leonine figure.

He mesmerizes the media.

His declarations are grandiose.

He controls vast political apparatus.

Trump can trump Cuomo. Unless, that is, Andrew Cuomo finds The Way The World Works, whose message of equitable prosperity proved irresistible to both left and right, in his late father's library and steals Trump's playbook.

As noted in my previous column, Donald Trump has the power, through gold, to turn the current economic debacle into an American Economic Miracle. Will he?

At the end of World War II, Germany was a bombed-out ruin. Germany was far worse off than we are today. David Henderson, a research fellow with the Hoover Institution and editor of Econlib, points out: ""20% of the housing stock had been destroyed; each person could expect half as much food as before the war; industrial output was just a third of its pre-war level ..."" Policymakers despaired of a German revival.

Then came the Soziale Marktwirtschaft (""socially conscious free market"") led by Ludwig Erhard, Wilhelm Röpke and a few others. Their prescription? Restore integrity to the German currency. Also, end price controls. Simple.

First, though, they had to fight off the Social Democratic Party, which, together with Big Labor, desired government control of the economy. Reminiscent of today's Democratic Party. Most Big Businesses agreed. Reminiscent of today's Republican Party governing class.

The experts opposed their plan.

Erhard, in charge, was unfazed.

After Erhard abolished rationing of food and ended price controls, Gen. Lucius Clay, administrator of American-occupied Germany, stated: ""Herr Erhard, my advisers tell me what you have done is a terrible mistake. What do you say to that?"" Erhard replied: ""Herr General, pay no attention to them! My advisers tell me the same thing.""

Erhard, unintimidated, wielded his power. Sizzling prosperity quickly followed.

This became celebrated as the ""German Economic Miracle,"" the Wirtschaftswunder. In the words of economist Henry Wallich, ""The spirit of the country changed overnight. The gray, hungry, dead-looking figures wandering about the streets in their everlasting search for food came to life.""

As the great French economist Jacques Rueff — the architect of France's own post-war economic miracle, the ""Trente Glorieuses"" — observed, ""Only an eye-witness can give an account of the sudden effect which currency reform had on the size of stocks and the wealth of goods on display. Shops filled up with goods from one day to the next; the factories began to work. On the eve of currency reform the Germans were aimlessly wandering about their towns in search of a few additional items of food. A day later they thought of nothing but producing them. One day apathy was mirrored on their faces while on the next a whole nation looked hopefully into the future.""

What has all this to do with our current economic crisis? As reported in Bloomberg, ""A Dollar Surge Upends Currency Market With Dislocations Mounting."" It would be ruinous if the inch or the ounce were to ""surge"" in ""strength."" As the astute Steve Forbes tirelessly points out the excellence, the very definition, of a unit of account is its stability.

The same clause in the Constitution that gives Congress the power to ""fix the standard of weights and measures"" (a power well delegated to the National Institute of Standards and Technology) gives it the power to ""regulate the value of"" money (currently less well delegated to the Federal Reserve.)

Even in an emerging pandemic America is in better shape than it was during the Great Depression. Even with a full-blown pandemic America would be in better shape than was post-WWII Germany. President Trump could turn the attendant economic crisis around on a quarter eagle.

There is a lot more history to commend this. The great polymath Copernicus, who recognized that the Earth revolves around the sun, wrote an essay, On The Minting of Money (of whose modern translation I served as lead co-editor) explaining how a flourishing economy needs high integrity money. Copernicus, analyzing the gold standard, listed the debasement of money as the most insidious of the causes of decline of nations.

The politicians ignored him. Their kingdoms declined. Those who consider the gold standard to be atavistic might remind themselves that even 500 years later the Earth continues to orbit the sun.

Fast forward 200 years to 1717. The classical gold standard itself was coined, so to speak, in a happy accident on the part of Master of the Royal Mint Sir Isaac Newton, the father of modern science. Later, the pioneering chemist Joseph Priestly, discoverer of oxygen, wrote at length about the virtues of the gold standard.

Gold is reviled by economists. Yet it has a distinguished scientific provenance and historically has contributed much to world prosperity. With gold Trump would find himself in proud company.

To be concluded.

Lost in the mists of history lie pointers to a simple, well-proven, powerful way for President Trump to reverse the current economic debacle and produce an American Economic Miracle. President Trump on the campaign trail showed that he has the right instincts to unleash prosperity. Spoiler alert: I prescribe the gold standard, praised by Trump on the stump, to achieve this.

Will Trump follow those instincts?

This is the first of a three part series presenting the case for why the gold standard is the compelling option to quickly restore American prosperity. It explains why and how the president can direct National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow to definitively set the American economy on a renewed path of sizzling job creation and equitable prosperity.

What is the alternative? Economist John Maynard Keynes once told a Saturday Evening Post reporter, who, in 1932, asked whether anything like the Great Depression had previously occurred: ""Yes. It was called the Dark Ages and it lasted 400 years."" If the political authorities will make the simple but correct policy response this downturn could prove a blip. The alternative is what I have elsewhere called a ""Little Dark Age.""

This column does not address the public health issues about which I lack expertise. To paraphrase James Carville: It's about the economy, sweetheart. There is only one person now with sufficient authority equipped to accomplish what needs to be done: Donald Trump. Trump, capably advised by Larry Kudlow, uniquely has both the power and the insight. Follow along.

Trump could outperform Franklin D. Roosevelt, who, facing the even greater catastrophe of the Great Depression, defied the conventional wisdom and, although only temporarily (see below), got the engines of commerce roaring again. Trump, like FDR who enjoyed pitting his advisors against one another, is not intimidated by experts. Trump has the disposition to do what the late, great, JFK's chief economist Walter Heller advised Congress in 1985: ""Rise above principle and do what is right.""

The power of good money — restoring integrity to the dollar, not government checks mailed to the teeming millions — typically is deeply underestimated by contemporary economists. A great pity. The evidence shows that the highest integrity money is the gold standard.

The experts don't get this. Trump does.

The restoration of health (not ""strength"") to the dollar produced amazing results in the dire context of 1932. Liaquat Ahamed's Pulitzer Prize-winning Lords of Finance says this about FDR's first hundred days. ""While much of the legislation was very laudable, aimed as it was at improving social justice and bringing a modicum of economic security to people who had none, it had little to do with boosting the economy. Tucked away, however, in this whole motley baggage, as a last-minute amendment to the Agricultural Adjustment Act, was one step that succeeded beyond anyone's wildest expectations in getting the economy moving again. This was the temporary abandonment of the gold standard and the devaluation of the dollar.""

While widely seen — even by FDR — as going ""off"" gold he did no such thing. It was a recalibration of the badly defective ""interwar gold standard."" An obscure but toxic monetary conference held in Genoa in 1922 knocked the pins out from under the pre-war classical gold standard while preserving the facade.

This flimflam (later called ""the Triffin Dilemma"") caused general commodity prices to float up by 50% while pinning the definition of the dollar in gold to its prewar level. That became a ticking time bomb.

That bomb went it went off on September 4, 1929, ""Black Thursday,"" the stock market crash that ushered in the Great Depression. Fast forward to 1933. Enter FDR, advised by the greatest authority on commodity prices of his era agricultural economist George Warren and eminent economist Irving Fisher.

Warren and Fisher understood that the primary cause of the Depression was deflation. Warren told FDR to revalue to the dollar by 50% to bring it in line with prevailing commodity prices. FDR duly, a few cents at a time, revalued the dollar from $20.67 to $35/ounce of gold. The Depression promptly lifted.

Ahamed: ""During the following three months, wholesale prices jumped by 45% and stock prices doubled. With prices rising, the real cost of borrowing money plummeted. New orders for heavy machinery soared by 100%, auto sales doubled, and overall industrial production shot up 50%.""

Alas, FDR didn't have a firm grasp on what he had done, and his administration embraced retrograde policies tipping the economy back into Depression. Bad policy drives out good. If this tragically aborted ""good money"" miracle had occurred but once it might be considered a fluke. Yet comparable events have occurred, repeatedly.

To be continued.

270,Benko,Ralph,newsmax,"As I previously wrote, Joe Biden is a formidable candidate. His superpower? He presents as sympathetic to the working class. Biden connects with workers who aspire to economic security and even affluence. No sin there.

This makes Biden far more appealing than Bernie Sanders, who, as a ""democratic"" socialist, is dogmatically committed to bullying the Enemy of the Proletariat, the middle class. That said, now Mr. Biden has to tackle a tougher adversary, President Trump.

And Biden has mis-stepped, thereby developing a potentially politically fatal Achilles heel. Democrats have an odd fixation on raising taxes. In falling for it, Biden has fallen into a political trap.

Raising taxes is unpopular with voters. Dems seem oblivious to that. At the 1984 Democratic Party national convention, nominee Walter Mondale, in his acceptance speech, declaimed: ""Mr. Reagan will raise taxes, and so will I. He won't tell you. I just did."" The crowd went wild.

Reporters Jeff Birnbaum and Alan Murray, in Showdown at Gucci Gulch, reported that then: ""Dan Rostenkowski, standing next to the candidate in front of the cameras and the cheering crowd at the convention after the fateful speech, whispered to Mondale, 'You've got a lot of b****s, pal.' According to Rostenkowski, Mondale whispered back, 'Look at 'em, we're going to tax their a** off.'""

Mondale lost 49 states. He was buried by Reagan in the biggest electoral landslide in history.

Per Politico, Joe Biden's plan to raise a hefty $4 trillion over 10 years would fall almost entirely on the affluent. So what's wrong, politically speaking, with that? Here's what. A majority — at least an electoral college majority — of voters are more interested in getting rich, or at least affluent (on whom most of Biden's taxes would fall), than they are in taxing the rich.

There's wisdom, as well as a majority, in the crowd. President William Jefferson Clinton focused not on soaking the rich but on curating a climate of equitable prosperity. He succeeded! His success generated a tsunami of extra revenue for Uncle Sam … a hefty budget surplus.

That was just a side-effect of the general prosperity he fostered for working stiffs like me. And he handily won re-election despite his foibles.

Also, let's note that the affluent already carry most of the federal income tax burden. Per Bloomberg (the news service, not the former mayor), as of 2018, the richest 1,409 taxpayers pay more income tax than the least affluent 70 million taxpayers.

And as summarized by Jason Pye at FreedomWorks.com, the top 1% of earners pay 37.1% of personal income taxes and the top 3% pay 51%. Not too shabby!

We voters are not as stupid as many presidential aspirants seem to think. We desire prosperity, not tax hikes. Nobody I've heard of (except, weirdly enough, HUD Secretary Ben Carson) is keen to ""soak the poor"" by raising their taxes. But no matter how many times it is decisively shown to be a losing issue it's Democratic Party that ""soaking the rich"" is a political winner.

Nope. No matter whom you soak, ""soaking"" citizens is bad politics. So why do the Dems so bitterly cling to this outworn dogma? Just guessing, but the Democratic ""intelligentsia"" (I use the word advisedly) seem still stuck, like a broken record, on class warfare … as declared in The Communist Manifesto.

This holds that the middle class, which the Communist Manifesto called the bourgeoise, oppress the working class, which it called the proletariat. This antique doctrine holds that the workers of the world must unite to crush the middle class and establish a ""dictatorship of the proletariat.""

The specter of the doctrine of class warfare — forgotten by most rank-and-file Democrats but lingering on spectrally — is haunting the Democratic Party. OK, admittedly Joe Biden is prescribing a ""kinder and gentler"" class warfare than the proudly self-proclaimed socialist Bernie Sanders does or the ferocious progressive Elizabeth Warren did.

Biden proposes merely to extract $4 trillion from the ""rich,"" rather than, as Sir Eric Geddes once so colorfully put it in another context, have them ""squeezed as a lemon is squeezed — until the pips squeak."" That said, soaking — or squeezing — people in proportion to their success runs against the grain of the American Dream of achieving affluence.

If Joe Biden continues to campaign on his promise of tax hikes he likely will end up buried under a similar landslide as that which buried Jimmy Carter (who ran for reelection ridiculing Reagan's proposed tax rate cut), Walter (""tax their a** off"") Mondale, Michael Dukakis, George H. W. Bush (who infamously broke his ""read my lips, no new taxes"" pledge) and others who rode to political oblivion on the promise to raise taxes. And it looks like he's stuck with that promise.

That said, eliminating human trafficking has proved elusive. We contend that 1 percent more of the right sort of effort, at no additional taxpayer expense, would do it.

President Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE spoke at a White House summit to mark the anniversary of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 200, highlighting the crusade by the administration against human trafficking. He spoke of his decision to authorize $430 million to fight sex and labor trafficking and to spend $123 million in grants to support state and local efforts, while candidly noting that despite these massive federal efforts to dismantle criminal organizations, they come back “very quickly” and in a “different form.”

Despite such heroic efforts, along with the noble effort of those who had preceded the administration, the number of trafficking victims has still not appreciably declined. However, there is great news. The United States can completely eradicate human trafficking quickly and at low cost. We have recognized expertise on the issue of rescuing human trafficking victims, and we can fortunately declare that there has been a recent significant development that can eradicate human trafficking across the country.

ADVERTISEMENT

We had noted last year the entrance of the Chamber of Commerce and the leadership of companies such as Delta Airlines in the battle against human trafficking. The development has supplied the missing ingredient. Business stands outside the human trafficking victim rescue system that now involves government, law enforcement, and nonprofit organizations. Business, therefore, is uniquely positioned, like Archimedes with his lever, to help align the current victim rescue effort for radically better success.

The cost to make rescues happen at scale, by making human trafficking unprofitable and driving the traffickers out of business, could amount to under 1 percent of what the federal government spends. At $5 million a year, the private sector can legitimately fund that as a business expense. Moreover, there would be no taxpayer dollars and billions in savings once trafficking is eradicated. A bulk of the needed resources are already there.

We can achieve the desired outcome by aligning the relevant agencies of government, law enforcement, and nonprofit organizations. The system is rather fragmented and works inefficiently. Metropolitan police, especially vice squads, are the most cognizant agency as to where these victims are likely to be found. That said, their mission is to catch crooks, not to rescue victims. Moreover, local law enforcement is rarely well aligned with federal and state law enforcement, making it too easy for traffickers to skip town.

There are the differing priorities among federal agencies. Main Justice, the United States Attorneys Offices, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Homeland Security Department, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and Border Patrol are not, on the ground, naturally aligned. Humanitarian agencies, both public and private, are constituted to house and nurture the rescued victims. However, they are neither equipped nor trained to effect rescues themselves. Police and social workers also rarely interact operationally. None of these agencies were designed to work together.

But when they do, they can work miracles, which are not magical. These miracles come from an alignment of all the relevant agencies. For public choice reasons, that alignment simply must be supplied from outside the current system. A high agency network of perhaps 100 victim rescue field agents choreographed by a small national team, paid for out of corporate public relations budgets, could effectively align the incumbent agencies. We know because we have done it repeatedly. So another word from the White House could be all it takes to galvanize that process to finally and definitively defeat the problem of human trafficking in the United States.

272,Benko,Ralph,westernjournal,"Most of the Democratic contenders, following Bernie Sanders’ lead, talk as if socialism is cool and capitalism is lame. This is a mere fantasy of the Twitterverse. And while even Mike Bloomberg talks the progressive talk, he giant-steps the capitalist walk. As well he should. Capitalism is great politics.

As William Saletan writing at the left-of-center Slate acknowledges:

“If you hang out with young progressives, you might be under the impression that socialism is popular. It is, but only on the left. In the latest Gallup poll, taken in September, liberals and Democrats viewed socialism favorably, but Americans as a whole rejected it, 57 percent to 39 percent. In the same poll, respondents viewed capitalism favorably, 60 percent to 35 percent. … Polls taken in May by the Pew Research Center, in March for the libertarian Cato Institute, and in December for Fox News yielded similar results. In every survey, socialism scores well among progressives but gets trounced, among voters as a whole, in a showdown with capitalism.”

Still, we capitalists are upping our style so that, in the immortal words of AOC, we, too, get used to slaying lewks. Well underway!

In the Nov. 4 issue of The New Yorker, reporter Carina Chocano delightfully inventories the makeover of capitalism now in process:

TRENDING: Soccer Player Files Lawsuit Alleging She Was Forced Off Team for Refusing to Kneel

“Recently, Alan Murray, the president of Fortune, wrote about a ‘fundamental and profound’ change in the way that American C.E.O.s speak about their roles. He first noticed the shift in 2008, when Bill Gates introduced the idea of ‘creative capitalism’ at Davos. During the next few years, Murray wrote, ‘Harvard Business School professor Michael Porter began pushing what he called “shared value” capitalism, and Whole Foods cofounder John Mackey propounded “conscious capitalism.” Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff wrote a book on “compassionate capitalism”; Lynn Forester de Rothschild, CEO of family investment company E.L. Rothschild, started organizing for “inclusive capitalism”; and the free-enterprise-championing Conference Board research group sounded a call for “sustaining capitalism.”‘ Lofton told me, ‘We’ve heard all sorts of new arguments for “compassionate capitalism” and “spiritual capitalism,” because we’re trying to explain how capitalism can still be a moral good.’

“Batiz’s guide to navigating contemporary capitalism is her mentor, Gay Hendricks, who is a psychologist, a writer, and a personal-growth guru. About two decades ago, Hendricks and his colleague Kate Ludeman published a book called ‘The Corporate Mystic,’ inspired by Hendricks’s observation that many tech luminaries draw on mystical principles. ‘Basically, the premise of the book is that you’ll find more actual spiritual principles being practiced in a corporation oftentimes than you will in a monastery,’ Hendricks told me.”

George Gilder, author of the million-selling bible of Reaganomics, Wealth and Poverty, and the most-quoted living author by President Reagan, identifies the essence of capitalism as that of discovery, not of incentive. Writing in his Daily Prophecy newsletter:

“I share my paradigm-shifting theory of capitalism in my book, Knowledge and Power.

“You see, ‘many free market advocates view capitalism as a system as dominated by incentives, with economic agents treated as inhabitants of a Skinner box driven by rewards and punishments.’

“But, in fact, capitalism is an information and learning system governed by information as entrepreneurial surprise.

“Wealth is knowledge; growth is learning; money is real and reflects the abiding scarcity of time.”

We celebrate this shift in business leaders’ ways to talk about capitalism up from what sounds like utilitarianism toward exaltation of human creativity.

Socialists vilify capitalism. But theirs is a false consciousness. As the UK’s The Spectator wrote toward the beginning of this decade:

RELATED: Op-Ed: Leftists Are Trying to Talk America Into Killing Herself - And It's Working

“In 1990, the UN announced Millennium Development Goals, the first of which was to halve the number of people in extreme poverty by 2015. It emerged this year that the target was met in 2008. Yet the achievement did not merit an official announcement, presumably because it was not achieved by any government scheme but by the pace of global capitalism. Buying cheap plastic toys made in China really is helping to make poverty history. And global inequality? This, too, is lower now than any point in modern times. Globalisation means the world’s not just getting richer, but fairer too.”

Working to eradicate poverty was “not achieved by any government scheme but by the pace of global capitalism.” And, where the principles of capitalism have been honored (in the USA from 2012 to 2017, not so much) it’s gotten even better since then.

Call us “Corporate Mystics.”

We’re OK with that.

That said, we at The Capitalist League (whose handbook is The Capitalist Manifesto, available from Amazon and by e-book at the League’s online shop) prefer, simply: “capitalist.”

And a word to our socialist adversaries?

Capitalism is hip. Socialism is lame.

Watch us slay lewks.

273,Benko,Ralph,newsmax,"Alarming news?

Reportedly, it was the millennials who put ""Democratic"" Socialist Bernie Sanders to a near dead-heat tie for first in Iowa. (I use scare quotes around ""Democratic"" because as legendary campaign manager James Carville helpfully pointed out to Sean Illing, writing at Vox recently, ""Look, Bernie Sanders isn’t a Democrat. He’s never been a Democrat. He’s an ideologue."")

Per John McCormack at National Review, ""In Iowa, Bernie’s Youth Movement Showed Up While Generation X Flaked Out"":

""According to Iowa entrance polls, voters under 30 comprised 24 percent of the caucus-going electorate — up six points from 2016 and one point better than 2008, when young voters carried Barack Obama to victory. Those voters preferred Sanders to Buttigieg by nearly 30 points, 48 percent to 19 percent, as did voters age 30-44 by ten points, 33 percent to 23 percent.""

Yikes! Are our kids turning into a pink tide? Or is their newfound infatuation with socialism just an overblown ""red scare?""

OK, boomers, capitalism has been defamed by its enemies, both ""foreign"" (socialism) and ""domestic"" (cronyism).

As for the latter capitalism has been somewhat traduced and subverted by rich people who game the system that made them rich into making them absurdly richer.

That said, true capitalism is adamant about liberty and justice for all. Capitalism, the real deal, is all about rewarding merit — rewarding those who contribute to the general welfare by making desirable goods and services affordable, and, with that, creating jobs — rather than rewarding status.

A system that rewards people based on their social status is called feudalism. Socialism and cultural Marxism are just lipstick on the pig of feudalism.

Cronyism is mere feudalism too.

As Adam Smith wrote in the original bible of free market capitalism, ""Wealth of Nations,"" Book I, Chapter I, ""It is the great multiplication of the productions of all the different arts, in consequence of the division of labour, which occasions, in a well-governed society, that universal opulence which extends itself to the lowest ranks of the people.""

These words serve as the epigram and leitmotif of a recently published book, ""The Capitalist Manifesto,"" of which I am co-author. True capitalism is all about uplifting the poor — as well as workers — as well as the affluent — through the ethical use of their God-given talents.

True Capitalism is, in a word to which the left gives lavish lip service, inclusive.

Bonus! Capitalism (unlike Socialism) has been shown repeatedly to actually work in practice. Imperfectly, to be sure, but better than everything else ever tried.

If the economy is not working to uplift the poor, making working people financially secure with dignity, and supporting the ecology of the planet, it’s not real Capitalism. It’s just some big business interest culturally appropriating our Capitalist brand. Adam Smith foresaw this too. He called it mercantilism. It was and is antithetical to free markets. Smith, in ""Wealth of Nations,"" Book IV, Chapter VIII:

""It cannot be very difficult to determine who have been the contrivers of this whole mercantile system; not the consumers, we may believe, whose interest has been entirely neglected; but the producers, whose interest has been so carefully attended to; and among this latter class our merchants and manufacturers have been by far the principal architects.""

So, go easy, millennials. Real capitalism, not socialism, would power your way out of student debt and your childhood bedroom in your parent's house. The cure for your, and our, current doldrums is to replace the current faux capitalism with the real deal.

Meanwhile, oh my friends and dear old anticommunist comrades-in-arms, please go easy on the millennials. This is an age-old phenomenon.

Witness, yet again, youthful idealism and sweet naïveté at play.

This is not the the decline and fall of western civilization.

Per Quote Investigator:

""An excited supporter burst into the private chambers of the old tiger Clemenceau one day and cried, 'Your son has just joined the Communist Party.' Clemenceau regarded his visitor calmly and remarked, 'Monsieur, my son is 22 years old. If he had not become a Communist at 22, I would have disowned him. If he is still a Communist at 30, I will do it then.'""

I am the vastly right-wing father of four wonderful children. My beloved daughters Jessica and Sarah are delightfully apolitical. My beloved 21-year-old son David is (last I heard) infatuated with Bernie. If he were not, I’d disown him. My beloved 32-year old son Michael is out canvassing for Mayor Pete, a social democrat not a ""Democratic"" Socialist.

No need to disown him, either. (A raised eyebrow will suffice.)

A youthful flirtation with socialism is endearing, not threatening, and is a tradition.

Socialism offers a wonderful, if inevitably heartbreaking, romantic fling.

For happily ever after? Bring on capitalism.

274,Benko,Ralph,newsmax,"Regardless of any stray voltage coming out of Iowa there’s a lesson for conservatives in Sen. Bernie Sanders’s extraordinary popularity. His prospects after the early contests seem less formidable. That said, there’s a political secret hidden in plain sight here.

What’s Sen. Sanders’s secret?

Scintillating socialists and communists have run rings around we boring capitalists in the ""vision thing""department.

No matter how many times the left fails to produce the promised goods — every single time — socialists still confidently declare how much better things will be for us worker bees in the ""Socialist Workers Paradise.""

That confidence draws some people to socialism.

Proof that Prohibition Party’s Judge Groo was right.

You can fool some of the people all of the time!

Friedrich Hayek, one of the great champions of liberal capitalism, nailed this secret sauce in a 1949 essay, ""The Intellectuals and Socialism,"" as in The University of Chicago Law Review, Vol 16, No. 3 (Spring, 1949):

""What we [(capitalists)] lack is a liberal utopia, a program which seems neither a mere defense of things as they are nor a diluted kind of Socialism, but a truly liberal radicalism … which is not too severely practical, and which does not confine itself to what appears today as politically possible. We need intellectual leaders who are willing to work for an ideal, however small may be the prospects of its early realization. They must be men who are willing to stick to principles and to fight for their full realization, however remote.

""The main lesson which the true liberal must learn from the success of the socialists is that it was their courage to be utopian which gained them the support of the intellectuals and therefore an influence on public opinion which is daily making possible what only recently seemed utterly remote.""

So what exactly is up with that?

Hayek, again, from: ""The Intellectuals and Socialism,""

""[S]o long as the people who over longer periods determine public opinion continue to be attracted by the ideals of Socialism, the trend will continue. If we are to avoid such a development, we must be able to offer a new liberal program which appeals to the imagination. We must make the building of a free society once more an intellectual adventure, a deed of courage.""

Capitalism has been a counsel of practicality, not dreams.

Capitalism has in practice proved, repeatedly, to bring us closer to the ideals of which Socialists can only dream. For instance, the ""Supply-Side"" flavor of capitalism, mocked by the Establishment right as ""Voodoo Economics"" and by the Establishment left as ""trickle-down,"" propelled The Dow Jones Industrial Average from 813 to 27,000 plus.

Truly liberal radicalism.

Our cardinal sin has been that we have been ""all action, no talk.""

Capitalists have been far too demure in articulating the dream that, in practice, rescued some billions of people from dire poverty. Socialism and Communism abjectly failed. The evidence indicates that capitalism, not socialism, holds the greater promise for restoring the Earth to ecological health.

What can we, intrepid capitalists, adversaries of socialism in all its guises, learn from Friedrich Hayek’s prophetic advice which anticipated Sen. Sanders’s amazing political success?

Many, especially the intelligentsia and the youth, need us to excite their imaginations, speak to their aspirations, appeal to their appetite for intellectual adventure and deeds of courage.

Instead we gave them counsels of prudence.

Napoleon Bonaparte summed it up best. Per R.M. Johnston in ""The Corsican: A Diary of Napoleon's Life in His Own Words,"" story of an encounter on June 17, 1800,

""Many began to shout, with apparent enthusiasm: 'Vive Bonaparte!' Napoleon observed:

""What a thing is imagination! Here are men who don't know me, who have never seen me, but who only knew of me, and they are moved by my presence, they would do anything for me! And this same incident arises in all centuries and in all countries! Such is fanaticism! Yes, imagination rules the world. The defect of our modern institutions is that they do not speak to the imagination. . . . ""

A writing by Napoleon also declares, ""Yes, imagination rules the world.""

In the words of the visionary capitalist Steve Forbes, commenting on a book which I recently co-authored, ""The Capitalist Manifesto"" not only devastatingly demolishes the false god of socialism but also makes the exciting and uplifting case for free markets. capitalism 'delivers the goods' precisely because it is a moral system that liberates the human spirit.""

So, bravo to you Bernie Sanders!

Bravo for your willingness to appeal to the imagination that rules the world.

Bravo to you for propounding a Utopian vision.

Capitalists! Rise to the occasion. Let’s recover from our timid reliance on counsels of prudence and do Bernie one better by proposing a truly radical liberalism to inspire our youth to intellectual adventure, to the deeds of courage that are capitalism.

275,Benko,Ralph,dailysignal,"What is capitalism?

To understand true capitalism you have to start with an understanding of capital. Capital is the secret sauce of capitalism. So, what is it?

The New Oxford American Dictionary defines capital as: wealth in the form of money or other assets owned by a person or organization or available or contributed for a particular purpose such as starting a company or investing.

the excess of a company’s assets over its liabilities.

people who possess wealth and use it to control a society’s economic activity, considered collectively…

[with modifier] a valuable resource of a particular kind: there is insufficient investment in human capital.

In plain words, capital means tools and know-how. There’s nothing sinister about it.

Skilled workers contribute more value and thus make more money than the semi-skilled. The semi-skilled contribute more and make more than the unskilled. Great tools make workers far more productive than crude tools. Crude tools make us more productive than no tools.

Capital is simply skills and tools.

Stocks and bonds are the classical instruments of capitalism. These are “claim checks.” They are the instruments proving that someone with savings has put those savings into a business, thereby owning a portion or being its lender.

The business then uses that money to build factories, warehouses, office space, or to buy equipment or other necessities for being productive.

That’s called “the cost of doing business.”

>>> Purchase Ralph Benko and William R. Collier Jr.’s book, “The Capitalist Manifesto: The End of Class Warfare, Toward Universal Affluence”

People with know-how—the “human capital”—invent, build, sell, and distribute goods and services. These enterprises contribute more to the general welfare than they cost. That’s “profit.”

Profit is not a dirty word. If a business doesn’t add more to the general welfare than its cost of doing business it doesn’t last long. Ecologists are not the only ones concerned with sustainability.

True capitalism rewards those who bring capital—skills and tools—to society. The more value they create for the rest of us the more profit they make. If profits get too high, competitors swoop in. Competition—not officious meddling—is what pushes prices down.

The first mortal enemy of capitalism is philosophical and obvious: Socialists, including those of its most virulent form, communists, are committed to capitalism’s destruction and are forthright in declaring that.

The second mortal enemy is practical and unexpected: Many successful capitalists disdain, sometimes with implacable hostility, the system by which they achieved wealth.

The great classical liberal prophet and free market champion Friedrich

Hayek wrote, in an essay titled “Intellectuals and Socialism” published in the Spring 1949 issue of The University of Chicago Law Review:

The difficulty of finding genuine and disinterested support for a systematic policy for freedom is not new. In a passage of which the reception of a recent book of mine has often reminded me, Lord Acton long ago described how “At all times sincere friends of freedom have been rare, and its triumphs have been due to minorities, that have prevailed by associating themselves with auxiliaries whose objects differed from their own; and this association, which is always dangerous, has been sometimes disastrous, by giving to opponents just grounds of opposition…” More recently, one of the most distinguished living American economists has complained in a similar vein that the main task of those who believe in the basic principles of the capitalist system must frequently be to defend this system against the capitalists—indeed the great liberal economists, from Adam Smith to the present, have always known this. … It may be that as a free society as we have known it carries in itself the forces of its own destruction, that once freedom has been achieved it is taken for granted and ceases to be valued, and that the free growth of ideas which is the essence of a free society will bring about the destruction of the foundations on which it depends. There can be little doubt that in countries like the United States the ideal of freedom today has less real appeal for the young than it has in countries where they have learned what its loss means.

Big business today is often in cahoots with big government. Together they preserve the facade while hollowing out the substance of true capitalism. Thus they enhance their privileges at our expense, traducing the soul of capitalism.

Thus do some capitalists seek to appropriate and devalue the capitalist brand. Fat cats are discrediting a fine philosophy.

They betray its essence to justify what are essentially feudalistic practices, economic success based on status rather than merit. By misappropriating and misrepresenting the capitalist brand they persuade a naïve public to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs.

True capitalism is an imperfect but, in practice, unrivaled mechanism to generate equitable prosperity. To reiterate the words of its original philosopher and prophet, Adam Smith, true capitalism will produce “universal opulence which extends itself to the lowest ranks of the people.”

276,Benko,Ralph,newsmax,"There were giants in the earth in those days… mighty men which were of old, men of renown.

Yesterday we celebrated the 90th birthday of Buzz Aldrin, one of the last living titans of an epic era. Half a century ago, Buzz, with Neil Armstrong, did something that had been synonymous with “the impossible.”

They landed their spaceship, the Eagle, on the moon.

This was rapidly followed by Armstrong and Aldrin’s doing the very first true “moonwalk.” Enthralled, I watched the landing and that walk on a black and white TV in the student center at Clarion State College. They planted the American flag. Not to claim the moon for America but with a declaration that they had come in peace for all mankind.

They collected lunar samples, took photos, accepted a congratulatory phone call from President Nixon. With a felt-tipped pen, Aldrin fixed the ascent engine’s broken circuit breaker that threatened doom.

To complete this picture let us now praise the third member of the Apollo XI trio, command module pilot Michael Collins, who, orbiting high above Tranquility Base, entered into possibly the loneliest situation ever experienced by modern man: intermittently alone and out of contact with everyone from Earth to moon, sailing alone, above, over the dark side of the moon.

Drama? The very survival of these astronauts was no sure thing. Presidential speechwriter William Safire had pre-written a eulogy should their lives be forfeited.

Then, Armstrong and Aldrin blasted off, rendezvoused with Collins, docked, and returned to Earth. These three had challenged the Heavens and returned in triumph. Much of Earth had its eyes turned Heavenward throughout.

What visual drama! Three brave souls launched skyward on a pillar of fire of Biblical proportions. They returned dangling from a cluster of parachutes resembling angels’ wings. All the astronauts (and with less fanfare, the cosmonauts) re-enacted this scene.

That said, Apollo XI enacted it having just done the impossible.

Heroic feats provide great spectacle. This one was a doozy. It was followed by a recovery by the aircraft carrier USS Hornet, tickertape parades, the Congressional Gold Medal, the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

Honors galore.

That said, spectacles come and go. A fickle public quickly forgets who did what. Players readily are relegated to an encyclopedia entry, a Jeopardy question, a book or books that make a ripple and disappear.

The human flight space program, however, especially Project Apollo and its apotheosis, Apollo XI, was more than a spectacle. It was the most glamorous element of an epic struggle between the United States of America and the Soviet Union. Epics appeal to the most powerful force of the human mind: the imagination.

Epics are for the ages.

History is one thing. Epics are another. Who doesn’t know the stories of love and war, of the heroic Achilles of the “Iliad” and the story of the “Odyssey” with Odysseus’s homecoming long thwarted by the wrath of a god, the exotic adventures, routing the suitors, the reclaiming of wife, son, home, and Ithaca’s throne?

Other epics? Virgil’s “Aeneid,” tale of the travels of the founder of Rome; the epic of “Gilgamesh” and the quest for immortality; the books of ""Exodus"" and ""Kings""; Malory’s “King Arthur”; the “Ramayana” and “Mahabharata.” Fictional epics such as “War and Peace” or “Gone With the Wind.” Indelible.

The 20th century was defined by three epic struggles: World War I and the collapse of Empire; World War II and the defeat of Nazism, Fascism, and Japanese Militarism; and the Cold War — really, World War III — and the triumph of liberal republican capitalism over totalitarian communism. America’s rival had shocked the world by launching the first artificial satellite, Sputnik, and again by putting the first man into space, Yuri Gagarin.

These landed a blow to the prestige of America. President Kennedy took up the gauntlet, and, on September 12, 1962 announced that America would send men to the moon and return them safely by the end of the decade. After a truly epic effort, embodying the work of many thousands, we did the impossible. America thereby recovered its prestige as a scientific and technological superpower.

The astronauts were the knights of our era, clad in the high-tech suits of armor. Our astronauts shared the credit widely and yet were seen as, and were, the tip of the spear. They put their lives on the line to win the crucial Cold War battle for the commanding heights. They won that battle with honor, vigor, and flair.

The future will remember our astronauts, especially Aldrin, Armstrong, and Collins whereby the human flight space program reached a crescendo, as paramount figures of our era’s defining epic. The names of the heroes of space will live forever in human memory.

Their story was not merely epic.

It was an epic.

Happy birthday, Buzz Aldrin.

278,Benko,Ralph,newsmax,"A year ago, after Google’s CEO Sundar Pichai testified before a painfully clueless Congress, I wrote at the techie site Hacker Noon: “ Innovate Don’t Regulate: The Message of George Gilder’s Life After Google

“Incongruously, some big league conservatives are calling for what used to be considered conservative heresy: using antitrust law to break up big companies — call it the Hammer. Or to, at least, regulate them hard — call it the Sickle.

“Even worse, there is truculent talk in some circles about changing the law governing online content to hold companies like Google, Facebook or Twitter liable for material posted there by users.

“Doing that would effectively ‘break’ the Internet.

“Unclear how many of our Senators and Congressmen grasp this key fact.”

Then things took a turn for the worse.

Freshman Republican U.S. Senator Josh Hawley, of Missouri, knows that his jihad against successful internet companies would, if enacted, break the internet. What’s worse? He revels in the prospect of breaking the internet.

Emily Stewart writing at the stylishly leftish Vox's Recode just before last Halloween observed:

“[Hawley’s] thinking on the tech sector feels almost punitive: He doesn’t just want to rein in Big Tech. He might prefer a world where it doesn’t exist at all.… In a way, Hawley was a pioneer — this September, state attorneys general from across the country launched antitrust investigations of their own into both companies…. Hawley has built his career with tech in the crosshairs....”

Emma Green, writing for the smart, center-left The Atlantic digs down quite approvingly into Hawley’s long term agenda to “end the GOP’s free market worship for good.”

“For good.” Or ill, if you prefer the prosperity free markets bring to the heavy hand of Big Government.

Even that curmudgeonly dissident George Will has gone to town on Hawley. Recently, in “Josh Hawley sounds like he has too much faith in government” Will steals a phrase from William F. Buckley to ridicule Sen. Hawley’s ridiculous anti-tech posturing. Will calls Hawley: “a pyromaniac in a field of straw men. Through the smoke of burning straw one can see in Hawley’s social diagnosis the belief, held by many progressives and an increasing number of conservatives, that individualism, as expressed in and enabled by capitalism, is making Americans neither better off nor better.”

Will then deftly wields facts to humiliate Hawley’s misguided arguments against liberty, individualism, and capitalism.

Will is not alone in his contempt for Josh Hawley. My friend and sometimes colleague George Gilder, author of “Wealth and Poverty,” the bible of Reaganomics, founder of the Discovery Institute, distinguished futurist, wrote of Hawley:

“Oh my, am I going to have to worry about my conservative friends joining the dims in a Luddite turn against technology?

…

“A communitarian desire to deny the claims and accomplishments of individuals easily glides into socialism, or worse. In his short career in the Senate, Hawley has not been able to resist the temptation.

…

“If telephone companies had been liable for any hate speakers or news fakers using their lines, we would still be communicating by some upgraded pony express. If providers of internet platforms had been required to ensure that no lies, frauds, hate speech or fake news passed through their facilities, they could not have functioned at all. There would be no internet.”

Trump’s trusted advisor and Heritage Foundation Distinguished Visiting Fellow Stephen Moore, with whom I served on the President’s Commission on Privatization under Reagan and with whom I recently spoke, told me: “One of the Reagan White House’s first actions directed the Justice Department to cease and desist bullying businesses with antitrust actions. It desisted. The new infatuation of a few Republican Senators and state attorneys general with antitrust is a brick through the plate glass window of the Reagan Library. Bullying Google – on spurious grounds no less! – spits in the face of the Reagan legacy.”

As for me, I’m an old school small government conservative. I was a Reagan White House junior official. I went on to become a Tea Party leader. I remain, as chairman of The Capitalist League, a passionate, full spectrum conservative.

As a small-government conservative I favor having the rhetorical torches and pitchforks in the hands of the people, not the politicians. The spectacle of powerful Republicans brandishing the hammer of antitrust and the sickle of regulation over the heads of some of America’s greatest companies is confounding. Companies such as Google and Facebook are part of what makes America great.

Sen. Hawley? You don’t have to be anti-free-enterprise to be pro-family. Stop crying victim and stop pushing Big Government. That’s the progressives’ game. It is conduct unbecoming for you to play it.

279,Benko,Ralph,newsmax,"Happy new year, and decade.

If war does not interrupt the trend, welcome the continued dawning of a golden age.

At the end of 2019 I wrote here that things aren’t nearly as bad as the ratings-or-vote-driven hysterical pronouncements say. A recent column by Matt Ridley in The UK Spectator pointed out that We’ve just had the best decade in human history. Seriously.

Others made a comparable point and yet the claim is so contrary to the dominant doom and gloom story that it begs for a closer look.

First, though, why are the vast majority of our celebrities crying doom?

One of the most candid political confessions ever was by then-U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich. At the apex of his career he confessed to journalist Gail Sheehy, writing for Vanity Fair, ""I think you can write a psychological profile of me that says I found a way to immerse my insecurities in a cause large enough to justify whatever I wanted it to.""

Postulating, ""a cause large enough to justify whatever I wanted it to"" provides enormous privilege: power, glory, and semi-impunity.

Newt’s big reveal was strategic. Not neurotic.

Daniel Kahneman won the Nobel Prize in Economics for his and the late Amos Tversky’s discoveries of how human nature reacts to uncertainty and risk. People work a lot harder to avoid a loss than for a comparable gain. More than twice as hard.

We’re risk averse. So if you wish to get elected to high or higher office, or boost your ratings, forecast an onrushing catastrophe. Then cast yourself as the hero who can, perhaps uniquely, save the world.

It was ever thus. Yet it has become a more regular thing. Michael Bloomberg justified his late entry into the 2020 presidential race by presenting President Trump as an ""existential threat.""

This is the way the world ends? Not with a bang but with a tweet?

Facepalm!

Panic is the driver of the politico-media complex’s game.

Now, let’s think about the unthinkable. The facts.

Could Ridley be right? Could a golden age be dawning?

The evidence is overwhelming that the state of this world of sin and woe is, on balance, getting better. And has been doing that for decades.

As The (UK) Spectator observed in, ""Glad Tidings"" published in 2012:

""It may not feel like it, but 2012 has been the greatest year in the history of the world. That sounds like an extravagant claim, but it is borne out by evidence. Never has there been less hunger, less disease or more prosperity. The West remains in the economic doldrums, but most developing countries are charging ahead, and people are being lifted out of poverty at the fastest rate ever recorded. The death toll inflicted by war and natural disasters is also mercifully low. We are living in a golden age.""

Steven Pinker and Andrew Mack provide a defining state of the world 2014 summation in Slate.com in ""The World Is Not Falling Apart"" revealed:

""Violence Against Women. … Rates of rape or sexual assault and of violence against intimate partners have been sinking for decades, and are now a quarter or less of their peaks in the past.""

…

""Violence Against Children. … “Of 50 trends in exposure examined, there were 27 significant declines and no significant increases between 2003 and 2011.""

…

""Democratization. … [T]he democracy craze has decelerated of late but shows no signs of going into reverse. … A majority of the world’s countries today are democratic. …""

…

""Genocide and Other Mass Killings of Civilians. … By any standard, the world is nowhere near as genocidal as it was during its peak in the 1940. . . . ""

...

""War. …In a historically unprecedented development, the number of interstate wars has plummeted since 1945, and the most destructive kind of war, in which great powers or developed states fight each other, has vanished altogether. …""

Tim Worstall, on Forbes.com, 2016: ""… all Americans are simply hugely, gargantuanly, richer than any but the fewest, most privileged, of our forefathers.""

David Harsanyi, a senior editor at The Federalist (2019), observed, in part:

""Nearly every quantifiable measure of human existence is improving. The retreat of socialism — exactly the kind of system environmentalists would like to bring back to fight global warming — has led to extraordinary gains in the most important aspects of human existence over the past 30-40 years.""

""Capitalism is eradicating extreme poverty.""

""It’s eliminating child mortality.""

""It’s increasing life expectancy.""

""It’s mitigated conflicts — both internal and external.""

""It’s keeping us safer.""

""It has made education more accessible.""

Peace permitting, a golden age of dignity, prosperity, ecology beckons. Conjured through mere capitalism? Lacks drama. Makes for boring journalism, and for dull politics.

Yet facts are stubborn things.

280,Benko,Ralph,newsmax,"Every so often I feel a need to point out that things are not nearly as bad as the talking heads of whatever persuasion declare. Really can’t blame them — hysteria is good for ratings. My bad.

My favorite quote about politics is from H.L. Mencken’s ""In Defense of Women"":

""Civilization, in fact, grows more and more maudlin and hysterical; especially under democracy it tends to degenerate into a mere combat of crazes; the whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed (and hence clamorous to be led to safety) by menacing it with an endless series of hobgoblins, most of them imaginary.""

Mencken was right. Most of the hobgoblins that our elected officials, celebrity scientists, and media elite proclaim really are imaginary.

I actually have observed this with my own lying eyes.

Back when I was a public advocate of sorts I would often open my presentation to Congressional staff with an apology. “Please forgive me for casting a ray of sunshine into the omnipresent gloom here on Capitol Hill.” They would laugh. Almost everyone coming in to them was a fountain of dire threats and warnings.

And off I’d go.

I would point out that there was a simple, well-tested, politically palatable way of creating an economic climate to foster economic growth in the 4% range, as under Reagan and Clinton. Not the paltry 2% range under Bush, Bush, and Obama. I’d do the math for them. It showed that an extra 2%/year growth would generate a gusher of federal revenues. Enough money to end the deficit, start paying down the national debt, cut some taxes, fix our infrastructure, and put Social Security into the black.

With enough revenue left over to buy a few more aircraft carriers so we wouldn’t have to listen to those neoconservatives whining about America’s doom, presumably from an imminent invasion by those ferocious Canadians they believe are massing at our northern border to impose universal health care on helpless little us.

Or whatever.

Without campaign contributions, moolah, and barely any staff support I played a major role in persuading two successive Congresses to pass my signature legislation. (For the curious, it had to do with monetary policy and setting up an objective official study of what monetary policies consistently fostered noninflationary, equitable, prosperity. A compass for the Fed!)

You cynics? Get off it. Congress is avid for good ideas. If you have one get your necktie out of mothballs and bring it to them rather than merely writing disgruntled letters to the editor.

True, my lonely efforts were insufficient to surmount the inertia of the U.S. Senate. That chamber was designed by the Founders to prevent the enactment of legislation. It performs its mission brilliantly. A story for another day.

And in passing, only one House Democrat voted for it. No need for concern that it will pass again so long as Speaker Pelosi is in charge. Portents of Doom are assured for the foreseeable future.

Rest easy!

That’s one reason I know that alarmists wildly overblow how bad things are. Now let’s turn to the Big Picture. Matt Ridley, writing in The UK Spectator, observes out that ""We’ve just had the best decade in human history. Seriously.""

I’ll wait until you get out the smelling salts. Ready?

Ridley:

“We are living through the greatest improvement in human living standards in history. Extreme poverty has fallen below 10 percent of the world’s population for the first time. It was 60 percent when I was born. Global inequality has been plunging as Africa and Asia experience faster economic growth than Europe and North America; child mortality has fallen to record low levels; famine virtually went extinct; malaria, polio and heart disease are all in decline.

“Little of this made the news, because good news is no news. But I’ve been watching it all closely. Ever since I wrote The Rational Optimist in 2010, I’ve been faced with ‘what about…’ questions: what about the great recession, the euro crisis, Syria, Ukraine, Donald Trump? How can I possibly say that things are getting better, given all that? The answer is: because bad things happen while the world still gets better. Yet get better it does, and it has done so over the course of this decade at a rate that has astonished even starry-eyed me.”

Hey! Starry-eyed me too!

Stark reality is anticlimactic. Peace and prosperity lack drama. No Michael Bay explosions. No John Williams’s orchestration.

To compound my felony in having ended this decade on a sobering note of good news my first column of the new decade, next week, presents the dawning of a golden age of peace and prosperity.

Deal with the grim reality of peace and prosperity.

Or skip me next week!

281,Benko,Ralph,newsmax,"The Millennials are dissing us Baby Boomers with a terse “OK Boomer.”

Vox — sort of the Newsmax for hipsters — sums it up:

“With all this repetitive back-and-forth — seriously, there are bingo cards — it’s no wonder the most polarizing meme of the year is a two-word dismissal of the whole debate. ‘OK boomer,’ which floated into the internet mainstream and rapidly gained traction this fall, is an attempt by millennials and Gen Z to both encapsulate this circular argument and reject it entirely.”

OK Millennials. Bring it on.

It’s in the nature of things for each generation to challenge its predecessor. With the Gen Xers having neglected to overthrow us Boomers I’ve been awaiting the Millennials’ uprising. But mere sarcasm doesn’t cut it.

We, the reigning Boomers, will not passively give up all the goodies that come from running the show. (You wouldn’t either.) We ourselves militantly tackled and whupped the “Greatest Generation” who heroically beat the Axis Powers. We had to supplant these noble souls to get our piece of the action.

You, too, will have to take it from us.

We Boomers marched in the streets against the draft and Vietnam, in favor of civil rights and women’s liberation. We took power. Now, it’s your turn to rip the power from our hands. Mere “OK Boomer” sarcasm is inadequate.

What I want to know is … what’s taking you so long?

We Boomers are the grandchildren of the soldiers of World War I who fought to make the world safe for representative democracy. That was an epoch that saw the collapse of 5,000 years of Imperial world order. Epic!

We Boomers are the children of the “Greatest Generation.” That’s those who heroically fought and conquered Fascism and National Socialism in World War II. Our parents moved Western Europe and Japan to classical liberal republicanism. While at it, they moved humanity from horses and wagons, oxcarts and clipper ships, to automobiles and airplanes. They moved the world from tallow candles and whale oil to electric light, movies, radio, and TV. And computers.

Then, we took over. They beat the Nazis but we beat them.

And then, we Boomers heroically fought and conquered Communism, moved the Communist superpowers from totalitarian to authoritarian, liberated the Soviet constituent republics and captive nations, tore down the Berlin Wall, and moved Eastern Europe and most of Central and South America closer to liberty and justice for all.

Not bad!

While at it, we Boomers moved humanity from mass starvation to abundance, put men on the moon, deployed the Internet and World Wide Web, and put a laptop and cell phone supercomputer into the hands of hundreds of millions. Maybe billions.

A great run!

Around the turn of the millennium — the cue for you Millennials to supplant us — America’s advancement of what Jefferson called “the empire of Liberty” stumbled. We Boomers ran out of steam.

Where you been, kids?

Not overindulging in avocado toast. You Millennials are just too… nice. We’re not just handing you our power. You have to take power. Just like we did.

Your ineptitude in grabbing power resulted in 20 years of economic stagnation in America and erosion of geopolitical liberalism. Had America continued to grow at the epic rate and equitability of those Boomer-era presidents, JFK, Reagan, and Clinton, we all would be half again as prosperous. Liberty would be spreading. But… you Millennials went AWOL.

This Boomer says Bummer!

Bismarck is reported to have said, “We must save some problems for our grandchildren to solve.” Your turn.

To go on to glory first you must seize power.

Some challenges we’ve generously left for you:

· Fight corruption, including opposing the curse of Crony Socialism and the unhealthy symbiosis of Big Government and Big Business. Get economic growth back up to 4%. Make yourselves epic.

· Unwind the web of obscene student loan debt woven by the axis of Washington in collusion with obscenely greedy Universities. Debt bondage is for wimps!

· Fight for Dr. King’s dream that people be judged based on the content of their character. In the words of George Washington, give to bigotry no sanction. Eradicate invidious discrimination based on race, sex, national origin, or creed. Fight religious intolerance both sectarian and secular.

· Invent new technologies to raise living standards all over the world …while eliminating pollution, nurturing a clean environment. Demand a vibrant, natural habitat for all species to flourish.

· While you are at it, bring forth Sarfattian post-quantum-mechanical low-power-warp-drive for interstellar travel (yes, it is a Thing) into being. Way cooler than the Star Wars franchise!

We Boomers ran out of steam about 20 years ago.

That said, we had an epic run.

Where you been, kids?

What you got?

282,Benko,Ralph,newsmax,"Contrary to many comments by many commentators, Boris Johnson’s Conservatives won a landslide victory in the UK. It echoed the victory of Donald Trump in 2016 that shocked the same commentators. This points to Trump’s likely 2020 reelection.

What’s up?

Why does the commentariat keep missing it?

Snobbery is what and why.

The social (and political and journalistic) elites are snobs. Snobbery is stupid politics, but hard to break. Think of politics as ""Gilligan’s Island."" Few viewers were enamored of Thurston Howell, III (the Republicans) or Lovey (the Democrats).

We love Gilligan. And Mary Ann.

Both political parties have, each in its own merry way, lost relevance. Their relevance to us came from standing up for working people. The GOP stood up by fighting to grow the pie. The Donks, by promising us bigger slices.

Most of us voters of every race, creed, and color are — and think of ourselves as — working people. We’re not so very ideological.

But we workers do not like being smugly patronized. My late colleague Jeff Bell nailed this, long ago, in a short book called ""Populism and Elitism."" Bell called snobbism “elitism.” Another word for snobbery.

Both establishment political parties (four, including the Brits’) are failing to be, and advertise themselves as, “one of us.” They give the impression of looking down on us.

The Democrats call us “deplorables,” bitterly clinging to our guns and Bibles. The Republicans see us as the help, not members of their posh country clubs.

We voters don’t appreciate their insulting attitude. Recall the opening line to Poe’s ""Cask of Amontillado"": “THE thousand injuries of Fortunato I had borne as I best could, but when he ventured upon insult I vowed revenge.”

It did not end well for the insulting Fortunato.

We workers have impatiently tolerated the thousand injuries visited upon us by Big Government, handmaiden of the Democratic Party, in cahoots with Big Business, handmaiden of the Republican Party.

Insult, though, is intolerable.

Thus did both party establishments fumble the ball.

The establishment, by its fumble, created an opening for non-establishment politicos. Let us call them the “Sly Rascals,” possessed of a devil-may-care attitude toward elite social acceptance.

The sly rascals value winning, not social approval. Roy Cohen, Trump’s mentor, once told a legal reporter, “My personal ethics is to win.”

Beneath all the pious cant politics is more about winning or losing than right and wrong. One recalls Rhett Butler bantering with Scarlett O’Hara:

'Blockading is a business with me and I’m making money out of it. When I stop making money out of it, I’ll quit. What do you think of that?' ‘I think you’re a mercenary rascal — just like the Yankees.’ ‘Exactly,’ he grinned.’

Rhett, with his anti-heroic chill, captured our imagination and hearts. Not Scarlett’s former husbands Charles Hamilton and Frank Kennedy. Not Melanie’s courtly Ashley Wilkes.

Rhett Butler.

I was raised by (and was, until Jimmy Carter alienated me) an FDR Democrat, someone in solidarity with workers. My dad was elected president of the largest chapter of the civil servants’ union in New York. The two who recruited me into the Republican Party were former union presidents: Jack Kemp and Ronald Reagan.

I'm the only known dues-paying union member (AFL-CIO) member of the conservative leadership’s College of Cardinals. My fellow red-hats find my solidarity with workers odd and annoying. Thanks to Kemp and Reagan it’s not quite heretical enough to get me burned at the stake.

The Democratic progressive elites have stopped championing workers as their marquee issue. Instead they favor a ""Green New Deal,"" discredited socialist nostrums conjoined with quadrupling gas prices and home energy bills, embracing 57-genders while shaming womyn who don’t fancy having biological males showering with their daughters in the high school gym.

Meanwhile, establishment Republicans just can't bring themselves to invite the hired help (us) to the Party. Hey. We’re déclassé! But duh! Gilligans and Mary Anns vote too.

Pachyderms? Truly, you can’t earn our regard with messaging that says: Gilligan, freshen Lovey’s and my cocktails, chop chop!

Sly rascals — Donald and Boris — happily recovered the regulars’ fumble.

As that prophet Billy Joel sang, “… I run with a dangerous crowd, we ain’t too pretty, we ain’t too proud, We might be laughing a bit too loud… Aw but that never hurt no one.”

Score so far: Gilligans, 2.

Snobs, 0.

The political fight of our era isn’t between left and right. That’s over. (The right won.) It’s snobbery vs. respect for working people.

Snobbery is stupid politics. Will the political establishment get it? Or will the regular Democrats and the establishment Republicans bitterly cling to their scorn of us workers?

Powerful signs, like Johnson’s landslide, say that “We, the people” are showing the snobs the door.

284,Benko,Ralph,newsmax,"""Democracy is the theory that the common people know what they want, and deserve to get it good and hard."" —H.L. Mencken

Ever wonder why Washington is stuck? It just can’t seem to get a grip on adopting practical policies for the common good. The Constitution directs Uncle Sam to “promote the general Welfare.” Instead he promotes a whole lot of Army generals and stokes a few welfare programs.

Welcome to the “warfare/welfare” state. But… why so?

Wonder no longer. Here comes John Tamny. He’s an old Washington hand, editor of Real Clear Markets and a long time Forbes.com contributor who recruited me into 8 years of writing columns there. (Now, I’m here.) Tamny has distilled what he has learned into a new book, ""They’re Both Wrong: A Policy Guide for America’s Frustrated Independent Thinkers.""

It’s my new secret decoder ring. Follow along.

Tamny nails both major political parties as engaged in scorched-earth hyperbole. Both parties are living inside of some kind of faith-based ideology. Or mania. Tamny, unsportsmanlike, introduces them to actual facts.

That politics has a lot of muggery is not exactly new news. Some of the wittiest, wisest, writers — Bastiat, Swift, Voltaire, Mencken, O’Rourke — made mincemeat of politicos. Tamny here joins this merry canon.

Actual score?

Politicos, 100.

Literary wits, 0.

Mencken’s still my favorite:

""Civilization, in fact, grows more and more maudlin and hysterical; especially under democracy it tends to degenerate into a mere combat of crazes; the whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed (and hence clamorous to be led to safety) by menacing it with an endless series of hobgoblins, most of them imaginary.""

Still, “Lost causes are the only ones worth fighting for.”

So, Tamny? Bring it on.

Tamny now joins in with the most enjoyable inventory of political folly in many years. Steve Forbes calls it a ""must-read masterpiece"" and O’Rourke says “Politics is the idea that all of society’s ills can be cured politically. … Tamny argues that you’re better off doing your own ideological home cooking.”

So what does Tamny, say?

Basically, “Don’t panic.”

Things are not nearly as dire as the political class, and their handmaidens — the liberal media — would have you believe. The endless series of hobgoblins are, indeed, mostly imaginary.

So what hobgoblins does Tamny slay? Tamny is a sure-enough conservative, a center-right libertarian. Notwithstanding his conscientious efforts to even-handedly proclaim “a pox on both your houses” his right hook leaves bruises but his left hook doesn’t leave enough of the left’s arguments to bury. As myself a man of the right perhaps I am biased. But Tamny slays a slew of silly leftist pieties.

If you are a conservative (or libertarian) who enjoys merry argument between us Neanderthals and them Snowflakes you will find abundant ammo here. Those who relish drinking the tears of progressive snowflakes will find themselves exceptionally well hydrated.

Tamny summons powerful evidence that the left is showing poorly grounded hysteria over climate change, corporate myopia, tax policy, the minimum wage, and “shovel-ready” infrastructure projects. And much more. Conservatives get mocked for worship of Big Oil, idolatry of school choice, and deranged opposition to free trade and immigration (the latter two populist, not conservative, shibboleths). And more.

The solution? Tamny proposes the panacea of decentralizing government from the Big Uncle to the cities and states.

This does not go quite far enough. I have elsewhere called for the wholesale repeal of the Constitution and restoration of the Articles of Confederation (whilst keeping the Bill of Rights). The Articles were replaced by the Constitution because the powers of taxation and regulation they gave the federal government thought were too weak.

Back then the tiny former colonies were threatened by Old World imperialism. We needed a stronger central government. Now conservatives find Uncle Sam too big, feral, and overbearing. Time to return to America’s original status as Swiss-style confederacy with a domesticated federal government. But yes, Tamny’s distributing powers to the states and cities would be a step in the right direction.

Will it happen? Unlikely.

Withal I take solace from Mencken:

""I enjoy democracy immensely. It is incomparably idiotic, and hence incomparably amusing. Does it exalt dunderheads, cowards, trimmers, frauds, cads? Then the pain of seeing them go up is balanced and obliterated by the joy of seeing them come down. Is it inordinately wasteful, extravagant, dishonest? Then so is every other form of government: all alike are enemies to laborious and virtuous men.""

John Tamny’s ""They’re Both Wrong: A Policy Guide for America’s Frustrated Independent Thinkers"" will delight you. Even better, give it as a wonderfully mischievous holiday gift for that crazy progressive (but I am being redundant) uncle in your attic.

285,Benko,Ralph,newsmax,"Thanks to capitalism — with a reasonably steady dollar, lower marginal tax rates, and more sensible regulation — we are now living in an epoch so prosperous, compared to yesteryear, that most take it for granted. Many presidential aspirants threaten to resurrect the leftist policies that delivered nothing but misery to workers. Weird.

It may not seem sporting to drag in facts but... let’s peek back and remember the misery from which unleashing the free market rescued us. On November 13, 1979 — 40 years, two generations, ago — the Dow Jones Industrial Average was at 814. This week it closed above 27,000.

Startling! What happened? Capitalism, once called Supply-Side economics and Reaganomics, continued by President Clinton, happened.

Turning the American stagflation around wasn’t pretty. But Reagan did it. Then, the U.S. economy took off like a rocket. A lot of other countries decided that they wanted to join the party and adopted his policies.

China’s Communist Party Chairman Deng Xiaoping famously said “Poverty is not socialism.” And “To be rich is glorious.” Almost a billion enterprising Chinese quickly took the cue. They used newly freed markets to pull themselves and their families out of abject poverty.

All in all, the world’s stock of wealth soared from $11T to $83T. This was, and is, huge. The left’s oft repeated promise of world starvation — that generation’s climate change — never materialized. Let's not go back to the brink of world famine.

George Gilder, whose 80th birthday we celebrated last month, wrote the “bible” of Reaganomics, ""Wealth and Poverty."" He became the most quoted living author by President Reagan. It sold over a million copies worldwide. Full disclosure, George was kind enough to furnish the foreword to a recently released book that I co-authored, ""The Capitalist Manifesto,"" writing, “Capitalism is not the tawdry thing that socialists label and libel it. Capitalism draws on the highest and best human qualities.”

Communists persistently claim that capitalism is great for generating wealth but lousy at equitably distributing it to us worker bees. The communists are just factually dead wrong. As public intellectual Tim Worstall observed at Forbes.com a few years ago, “The average American today is 90 Times Richer than the Average Historical Human Being.” Worstall wrote, “By any historical, and by standards of all too large a part of the world today, all Americans are simply hugely, gargantuanly, richer than any but the fewest, most privileged, of our forefathers.""

Contrast that stunning fact with the outcomes of socialism.

As economist Kristian Niemietz observed in Quilette, reviewing Aaron Bastini’s ""Fully Automated Luxury Communism,"" “Thus, the fact that socialism has already been tried more than two dozen times, and failed every time without exception, should be somewhat relevant to this book. But on that issue, Bastani has next to nothing to say.”

OK, Capitalism has imperfections (although, with hard work it could be nearly perfectible). Let us paraphrase Winston Churchill’s observation about democracy: Many economic systems have been tried, and will be tried in this world of sin and woe. No one pretends that capitalism is perfect or all-wise. Indeed it has been said that capitalism is the worst economic system except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.…

That said, for the worst?

Frighteningly good.

The principals of the Supply Side revolution had to endure massive ridicule. It was called “Voodoo Economics” from the Republican establishment, “Trickle Down” from left-leaning Democrats. It took guts to avert the descent into economic Hell.

To be fair, many Democrats of the day, Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, Sen. Bill Bradley, and Rep. Dick Gephardt among them, joined in. They were full participants in restoring capitalism and bringing about prosperity.

Today’s leading Democrats, by contrast, seem hell-bent on undoing our prosperity. The prosperity brought about by the Supply Side’s victory in the '80s is now much taken for granted. Big mistake.

In this season of gratitude some epic champions of capitalism, now senior statesmen, such as Robert Mundell, Arthur Laffer, Steve Forbes, Lewis Lehrman and, yes, George Gilder with the political quarterbacking of the late Jack Kemp, deserve our gratitude.

These intellectual samurai of the Supply Side paved the way for great progress toward a golden age of peace, prosperity, and human dignity. We’re not there yet. That said, the long march to the golden age, with the leadership now passing to the Millennials, is now within reach of its goal.

Gratitude is due to those who fought for our prosperity. Yet it is of greater importance that we heed the warning of Santayana, “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.”

A future of equitable prosperity lies with true free market capitalism. Not socialism. Just look at history.

287,Benko,Ralph,townhall,"The opinions expressed by columnists are their own and do not necessarily represent the views of Townhall.com.

Why does politics more and more resemble a rebel without a cause?

Ronald Reagan and Jack Kemp were among the last paladins of what could be called the Epic Era of politics. They were among the last of the major figures at the end of nearly a century of world war: World War I and the Fall of Empires, World War II and the fall of Fascism, the “Cold” War (which, with the advent of nuclear weapons, threatened to be the hottest of them all) and the fall of Communism.

Thomas Jefferson, in a letter, portrayed the United States as the active agent in spreading what he called the Empire of Liberty. The process was epic. The 20th century – which opened with 80 percent of the world being governed by an emperor – China, Russia, Ottoman, Austro-Hungarian and British – ended with the establishment of something approaching classical liberal republicanism throughout most of the world.

Conservative commentator, author of Mad Jones novels and political veteran Quin Hillyer writing at the Washington Examiner as the Kemp Foundation Tenth Anniversary Celebration approaches observed that Politics lack the virtues of Reagan and Kemp. Indeed world geopolitics has dwindled from the epic scale of the Iliad, the Aeneid and War and Peace.

With that descent of daily politics around the world from a century of epic war and grim privation we have entered an era more like farce or “Reality” TV.

Hillyer powerfully reminds us of our lost political horizons, recalling an era of an ""upbeat, aspirational, unifying message, free of anger and rancor?"" He calls to mind the messages of Jack Kemp and Ronald Reagan, whose ""sunny, buoyant attitudes were elemental to both Reagan and Kemp, parts of their very essence and souls. They could be tough and firm, but they always were more comfortable welcoming others in rather than casting them out, finding things to praise rather than demonize.""

True. And important. But wait. There’s more here than meets the eye.

The defining quality of Kemp and Reagan -- with both of whom I had the privilege of working (at the political equivalent of ‘second lieutenant’ level) -- was more than optimism. It was heroism. Other notable optimists have been reduced to a footnote in history. Kemp and Reagan's optimism was harnessed to grittily undertaking an “Impossible Dream” in the face of daunting odds.

Kemp rescued Capitalism from the dust bin of history. Jack Kemp undertook the vanquishing of stagflation's hideous, economy-and-morale-killing, Misery Index. He did so by challenging the then-conventional wisdom of easy money + high tax rates with a demand for good money + low tax rates.

For this he was, and all the Supply-Side guerrillas were, ridiculed by the Establishment -- of both parties! -- as “Voodoo Economists.” We still are. Jack's courage and intellect, as much as his optimism, brought about an epic transformation of the US and world economy.

The Dow rose from 814 to, eventually, 27,000+. Some Voodoo!

Meanwhile, Reagan undertook to confront, rather than contain, the Soviet Union. He had the unique objective of “We win, they lose.” Notwithstanding his dismissal by the mandarins as an “amiable dunce” Reagan succeeded in winning the Cold War. America’s victory – a victory finally achieved without American battlefield casualties – was the most important event of the lifetime of anyone born before Christmas 1991.

Now, at this decade’s end, Hillyer unflinchingly calls the question: “When the public square is as toxic as today, how can it be altered into something broadly aspirational? And must the toxicity be purged, or can it just be transcended?”

The narratives that Jack Kemp and Ronald Reagan embodied ... their world-transforming achievements ... earned them halos in history and in Heaven. Their defining characteristic was more than shining optimism.

It was epic heroism in the great twin causes of peace and prosperity.

Now it is up to the Millennials to resolve new existential threats. How? By, like Kemp and Reagan, challenging the conventional wisdom of our day, dreaming their own Impossible Dreams, and pushing onward to Golden Age of liberty and justice for all.

288,Benko,Ralph,townhall,"The opinions expressed by columnists are their own and do not necessarily represent the views of Townhall.com.

Could the price of gasoline go to $240 a gallon? Absolutely, if the United Nations’ bureaucrats get their way!

""I never gave anybody hell. I just told the truth and they think it's hell."" So said Harry Truman.

The same sentiment applies to economic policy maestro Dan Mitchell. Dan is one of the most eloquent canaries in Capitalism’s coal mine. He’s a very rigorous policy wonk.

So when I read his September 5th blog, “Democratic Candidates Endorse Huge Tax Hikes on Lower-Income and Middle-Class Taxpayers” I reached for my wallet. It was still there. >Phew!< But could be only a temporary reprieve. Beware!

More than half the Democratic presidential aspirants have endorsed a carbon tax.

Sounds fairly innocent. I don’t get paid in carbon.

Some candidates even propose a rebate. Forgive my incredulity but the core purpose of taxes is to collect money for the government to spend. Taxes were not invented to micromanage us. Why do I suspect that Uncle Sam would find a way to spend the tax revenue instead of mailing it back to me?

What would a carbon tax mean to us working people? Mitchell cites a column in The Hill by Vance Ginn and Elliott Raia parsing the impact of U.N. IPCC proposals. The UN wants a $200/ton of CO2 imposed by 2030 rising to “an astonishing $27,000 per ton by 2100.” When fully implemented that would put the cost of a gallon of gasoline at $240 per gallon. At the initial $200/ton it would also add an additional $37,000 to pour a slab foundation (no basement) for a simple 3000-square-foot home.

I’m not very good at math but my calculator says that if the IPCC got its wish as to the ultimate carbon tax it would cost an extra $5 million dollars to build a 3,000 square foot tract house. That’s up from around $300,000~$450,000 today. Meaning ... our grandkids would all get to live in 30’ x 10’ shacks!

Sen. Sanders has refrained from embracing the carbon tax. Bernie Sanders must recognize how burdensome a carbon tax would be on working people. Bernie’s economic doctrine reflects that of The Communist Manifesto whose second and third commandments call for “A heavy progressive or graduated income tax” and “The abolition of all rights of inheritance.”

The Senator’s math being even wobblier than mine, this implies a belief that he can fund his extravagant spending proposals by soaking the rich. There aren’t enough rich to sustain these spending levels. Also, he’s unclear on the fact that in America the working class is the middle class!

Mitchell stipulates that the presidential candidates, when they get specific, will propose a lower tax rate on carbon. But he also rightly observes that taxes have a propensity to turn onerous over time.

What’s really going on?

The majority of Democratic presidential aspirants' enthusiasm for a carbon tax reminds me of the fateful moment at the 1984 Democratic Party presidential nominating convention. Nominee Walter Mondale, in his acceptance speech, declaimed: “Mr. Reagan will raise taxes, and so will I. He won’t tell you. I just did.”

Wall Street Journal reporters Jeff Birnbaum and Alan Murray, in their book Showdown at Gucci Gulch, reported the immediately following private exchange: ""Dan Rostenkowski, standing next to the candidate in front of the cameras and the cheering crowd at the convention after the fateful speech, whispered to Mondale, 'You've got a lot of balls, pal.' According to Rostenkowski, Mondale whispered back, 'Look at 'em, we're going to tax their ass off.'”

The left is fanatically assured of the virtue of its desire to soak the Middle Class (called by Marx and Engels the “bourgeoisie” and considered the primary enemy of the workers, the proletariat, in The Communist Manifesto and by good Communists ever since).

Assured of their virtue, progressives lose sight of the fact that those of us outside the nominating convention hall do not relish the prospect of having our, well, to quote Vice President Mondale, ass taxed off. The left, in its zealotry, forgets that Mondale lost 49 states, winning only his home state of Minnesota, in the biggest landslide in presidential history.

Judge William J. Groo was right. You can fool some people all the time.

They're called Socialists!

Who, thank Heaven!, are very scarce among actual voters.

Nobody knows how many victims suffer as sex slaves in America. We know that the number is substantial. And that it’s intolerable. We know how to put an end to this shameful condition.

I, Dottie Laster, have been credited with triggering the largest human trafficking victim rescue in U.S. history. And I, Ralph Benko, was a field organizer there and in half a dozen other cities for President George W. Bush’s Operation Rescue and Restore. Unassumingly, we helped build an “underground railroad’ to rescue the victims of modern day slavery.

We know from direct experience.

Business, and business alone, can provide the missing ingredient to rescue all the human trafficking victims in America. It’s the right thing.

So welcome, business, to this great humanitarian crusade. However, it is as important to do the thing right as it is to do the right thing.

Businesses now are putting most of their effort into educating their employees (and customers) on how to spot a victim. Good beginning. Now something more, but not more expensive, is needed.

A famous story supposedly about FDR goes: “Civil rights leader A. Philip Randolph met with FDR before World War II to get the president to take action against discrimination, the president boomed back: ‘I agree with you, now go out and make me do it.’”

“Make me do it” is the missing ingredient. The resources needed to rescue human trafficking victims are already out there. The resources are fragmented among many agencies. We just need to align them.

The local police are quietly knowledgeable about where the traffickers and their victims may be found. But making the rescue is delicate and complex. And you need T and U visas from the federal Department of Homeland Security at the ready. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigrant Services (USCIS) website says “T visa nonimmigrant status is a temporary immigration benefit that enables certain victims of a severe form of human trafficking to remain in the United States for up to 4 years if they have assisted law enforcement in an investigation or prosecution of human trafficking.”

The USCIS says a “U nonimmigrant status (U visa) is set aside for victims of certain crimes who have suffered mental or physical abuse and are helpful to law enforcement or government officials in the investigation or prosecution of criminal activity.”

Also, many traffickers operate interstate. That can thwart local police and district attorneys. That requires the FBI and Justice Department.

Rescuers need a safe and secure place to shelter the rescued victims. Local nonprofits are usually the best bet for this and will go to great lengths to provide. Many victims need language and job training. Many require psychological counseling. Other agencies are available to provide these.

Rescuers need philanthropists, foundations and government agencies to provide humanitarian funding to rescue victims at scale. Otherwise, success would swamp the rescue infrastructure. It is a very rewarding cause. Success will win their enthusiastic support.

Rescuing the victims — all the victims — is not prohibitively expensive. Neither is it cost free. Freedom is never “free.”

So, the resources are there.

Why do we still have trafficking?

Let’s let you in on the secret key to ending human trafficking. Most agencies have little to zero routine operational interaction with one another.

Also, there are abundant rivalries and even mild animosities. Local police mostly look on the FBI with disdain. And vice versa. Nobody knows USCIS’s phone number. Humanitarian service providers tend to look on the police as borderline brutes. Cops look at social workers as namby-pamby bleeding hearts. (Until they get to know each other.)

The agencies that have to work together are not naturally aligned. Public pressure makes them do it. But public pressure is “as spontaneous as arson.” It will take a small squad of do-gooders to activate public pressure. Victim rescue at scale requires busybodies and nudniks. Socrates was such a one. He called himself a “gadfly.”

The government, or government-funded agencies, won’t fund their own busybodies. They can’t. Yet, when FDR said “I agree with you, now go out and make me do it,” he meant it. Here too! Virtually every elected official truly sympathizes with trafficking victims. They would be thrilled to be “made” to rescue them.

So what’s the solution? Two dozen or so well-organized busybodies, nationally. They’d pour on the sweet relentless pressure needed to force alignment among the responsible parties.

We know.

We’ve done it.

The cost of such a squad would be a rounding error on the weekly profit and loss report of any major corporation. That cost would be an excellent PR investment. It would protect their brands from the tarnish of charges — founded or not — of negligence toward human trafficking on their turf.

Plus, what CEO wouldn’t care to go down in history for more than just turning a profit? To be remembered for ridding America of modern-day slavery?

Being a great businessperson? Great.

Being a great humanitarian? Priceless.

Let’s end human trafficking in America, now.

Thank you, U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

294,Benko,Ralph,spectator,"The White House has announced that President Trump is awarding Dr. Arthur B. Laffer the Presidential Medal of Freedom on June 19th. That, along with the Congressional Gold Medal, is America’s highest civilian award. It is well deserved.

Robert Mundell and Arthur Laffer were Supply-Side Economics’ premier intellectual architects. Supply-Side was roundly mocked by establishment Republicans such as George H.W. Bush, Reagan’s then-rival. Bush memorably dismissed it as “Voodoo Economics.” Most, though not all, Democrats mocked it. Many still do.

Who were the Supply-Siders? Jack Kemp was the political principal and Jeff Bell the political pioneer. Jude Wanniski was our Minister of Propaganda, Robert Novak served as the reporter-of-record and Warren Brookes, the columnist-in-chief. Bob Bartley turned “The Page” of the Wall Street Journal into a morally courageous beacon of sanity in stagflation’s darkness.

Bob Mundell later collected a Nobel Prize in Economics “for his analysis of monetary and fiscal policy under different exchange rate regimes and his analysis of optimum currency areas.”Businessman/philanthropist Lewis E. Lehrman and Kemp aide John Mueller, the American apostles of Jacques Rueff, prevailed with Kemp in their advocacy of the classical gold standard. And let us recall Supply-Side veterans Charles Kadlec, Alan Reynolds, Paul Craig Roberts, and Steve Entin. And Bruce Bartlett, who later apostatized.

Among its titans count publisher and presidential candidate Steve Forbes, George Gilder, author of Wealth and Poverty, “the Bible of Reaganomics,” and Larry Kudlow, now Director of Trump’s National Economic Council. Stephen Moore (with whom I have from time to time been professionally associated) flies the Supply-Side flag high.

I was the most junior member of the Supply-Side in its misty origins. What happened? Call me Ishmael, for I only am escaped alone to tell thee.

On November 13, 1979 Ronald Reagan officially declared for the presidency. On the day of Reagan’s announcement the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 814. As of this writing the Dow closed at 26,014. That’s not adjusted for inflation or population growth. Still, you get the gist.

Reagan campaigned on — while being ridiculed for — Supply-Side Economics. Elected, he put it to good effect. He backed Fed Chairman Paul Volcker’s actions to slay inflation. Reagan crusaded for the Kemp-Roth 30% across-the-board marginal tax rate cut. With full bipartisan support, Reagan also cut the top rate from 70% to 28%. And what followed?

There are not enough fingers among the thought leadership in Washington to count the 25,200 points the Dow then gained. Moreover, in 1979 world GDP was $11T. Now it’s $83T. A billion people or so arose from abject poverty. Much of this prosperity is due to the worldwide embrace of much of Supply-Side Economics.

So what is this much ridiculed, highly successful, thing, Supply-Side Economics? To oversimplify (but not by much), Supply-Side Economics calls for a stable currency. Most of its proponents favored the gold standard to seal the deal.

And tax rates are to be kept low. That will maximize economic growth and optimize federal revenue. Tax rates above a certain level — “Point E” on the Laffer Curve — reduce federal revenue much as overcharging for goods reduces an enterprise’s sales and, thus, revenue. Common sense, really.

The 1975 issue of Irving Kristol’s National Affairs presented its manifesto, by Wanniski: The Mundell-Laffer Hypothesis. Noting that excessive marginal tax rates reduce revenue is a footnote. Most of this essay called for monetary stability to quell the virulent inflation and the sky-high “Misery Index” and restore vibrant economic growth. Wanniski concludes:

“Theirs may or may not be the ‘Copernican revolution’ in economics that is needed. But at the very least, one suspects, it can legitimately claim a proto-Copernican status.”

Forbes.com columnist Nathan Lewis calls stable money (preferably gold) and moderate tax rates in his columns and his most recent book the “Magic Formula.” He marvels at why such a simple thing as gold-defined money and low marginal tax rates were, and are, anathema to the policy elites.

My guess? It affronts their vanity. Mundell, in his 1999 Nobel Prize in Economics acceptance speech, observes that it “did not require a great theoretical genius to run gold standards.… It was automatic.” There is little glory in maintaining a system on autopilot, however successful.

A few years ago I estimated the capitalized value of the additional world income created by Mundell and Laffer and their political team to be $100 trillion. It’s even higher now. Thus, Donald Trump’s awarding Arthur Laffer the Presidential Medal of Freedom is profound. Next… to make America fully great again… on to the gold standard as prescribed in the Mundell-Laffer hypothesis and commended by Candidate Trump!

Ralph Benko founded The Prosperity Caucus in 1985, served as a deputy general counsel in the Reagan White House and is the editor-in-chief of the Supply-Side Blog currently hosted by the Committee to Unleash Prosperity of which Arthur Laffer, Steve Forbes, and Stephen Moore are principals and which Lawrence Kudlow co-founded.",2,https://spectator.org/president-trump-awards-arthur-laffer-the-presidential-medal-of-freedom/

Controversy swirls around the nomination of Stephen Moore to the Fed. Full disclosure, in the tiny word of Supply-Side economics Moore’s an old friend, a friendly rival, and occasional professional collaborator of mine.

President Trump’s announced desire to nominate Moore raises questions of greater importance than merely of Moore’s fate or even the fate of the Fed. Moore’s nomination is, by far, the most important to date of the Trump administration. Let me reveal why.

The Mandarin-class’s mass hysteria over President Trump’s nomination of Moore resembles the recoil of a vampire from a crucifix more than it does a mere policy dispute. That makes this moment -- conservatives should insist on it -- a defining moment in 21st century politics.

The Federal Reserve Board and its opulent staff is housed in a grand Art Deco palace on Constitution Avenue. The Fed is the most powerful central bank in the world. As such it is as much a throwback as is the architecture of its headquarters.

The Fed remains one of the last holdouts of central planning. Central planning is an intellectual artifact that has been thoroughly discredited wherever tried. Yet the idea of central planning remains bitterly clung-to if only in Pyongyang and within the progressive ramparts of America’s democratic socialists. Therein hangs a tale.

As those who are out to smear Moore’s good name well know he has overshot his quota of venial sins. However, the president’s nomination of him to the Fed is not about a candidacy for sainthood. It’s about something much more important.

The hysteria Moore’s nomination has evoked represents a clash between the elitism exemplified by the Fed and the populism exemplified by Stephen Moore. The fight between populism and elitism is, arguably, the central political fight of our era.

Public intellectual John Ralston Saul introduces his searing examination of the tragedy of modernity, Voltaire’s Bastards, with this observation:

“Elites quite naturally define as the most important and admired qualities for a citizen those on which they themselves have concentrated. … The weakness of rationally based power can be seen in the way it views criticism as an even more negative force than a medieval king might have done. … What is it which so frightens these elites? Language – not money or force – provides legitimacy.

“So long as military, political, religious or financial systems do not control language, the public’s imagination can move about freely with its own ideas. Uncontrolled words are consistently more dangerous to established authority than armed forces...

“There is nothing particularly original about breaking down the intellectual, political, social and emotional walls behind which language has been imprisoned, freeing it, than watching while the poor thing is recaptured and locked up again. That process has been repeated endlessly throughout history.

“The wordsmiths who serve our imagination are always devoted to communication. Clarity is always their method. Universality is their aim. The wordsmiths who serve established power, on the other hand, are always devoted to obscurity. They castrate the public imagination by subjecting language to a complexity which renders it private. Elitism is always their aim.”

Moore is one of “the wordsmiths who serve our imagination.” He is not one of “the wordsmiths who serve established power.” What are the implications?

In 1992, Jeffrey Bell’s cult classic Populism and Elitism: politics in the age of equality nearly prophesied the coming of President Trump. Bell also anticipated the microcosmic political apocalypse embodied in Trump’s nomination of Moore and the opposition it evoked.

The iconic political journalist Fred Barnes called Populism and Elitism the most important political book of its year. I would argue that it subsequently has proved the most important political book of our era (except for Voltaire’s Bastards).

Matt Continetti, a non-elitist member of the political elite, writing in the National Reviewafter Bell’s last year’s climbing the stairway to Heaven, ably sums up Bell’s core insight:

For most of human history, elites competed among themselves for power. With the coming of American democracy, the struggle occurred not only between elites but also between elites and the populace. Jeff identified a tradition of public resistance to the encroaching control of elites that runs from Thomas Jefferson through Andrew Jackson and Ronald Reagan and beyond. (We’ll get to you-know-who in a second.) ‘Populism,’ Jeff wrote, ‘is optimism about people’s ability to make decisions about their lives. Elitism is optimism about the decision-making ability of one or more elites, acting on behalf of other people.’”

Continetti then thoughtfully analyzed the populism of “you-know-who,” Donald Trump. The Trump White House’s decision whether to pull out all the stops -- and pour out its political capital in the cause of Moore’s confirmation – may be decisive as to how history treats this presidency.

This is a defining moment.

If Trump chooses to withhold or withdraw Moore’s name from nomination Trump is more likely to prove a mere interregnum. A balk could cause the Trump presidency to become a mere footnote to history, a moment in which populism flickered and was gone.

If Trump, rather, uses his formidable political muscle to insist on the confirmation of Stephen Moore such determination could be the defining moment in the beginning of a new, secular, populist era. How so?

Stephen Moore, even considering his (well-publicized by his elitist enemies) propensity to flit between the lines of genius and madness, is a great populist. Moore’s populism is the real trigger of the horror of the elitists who dominate our politics.

Donald Trump’s historical stature as a populist and as a president may hang from the thread of Moore’s confirmation battle. That said, the confirmation of Stephen Moore is a hill worth dying upon. Soon we shall discover whether this White House rises to the occasion and to the call of history.",2,https://townhall.com/columnists/ralphbenko/2019/04/29/stephen-moore-populist-is-trumps-most-consequential-nominee-n2545514

299,Benko,Ralph,insidesources,"President Trump’s Fed nominees Stephen Moore and Herman Cain, friends and occasional professional colleagues of mine, are being pilloried by the Neo-Keynesians for being “gold bugs.” That’s doubly wrong.

Moore considers the gold standard superior to the fiduciary paper standard we now have. That said, he’s no proponent. He is an advocate of commodity-price targeting. This regime was advocated by former Fed governor Wayne Angell. While debatable, it’s respectable.

Cain’s history of championing the gold standard appears in his 2012 op-ed in the Wall Street Journal: We Need A Dollar As Good As Gold. Of Cain’s campaign tome, “9-9-9: An Army of Davids,” I wrote in Forbes at the time, Jack Kemp’s “mantle has fallen, at least provisionally, upon Herman Cain’s shoulders. … Kemp, for example, was the last modern political champion of the gold standard. In ‘9–9–9’ … Cain devotes over a quarter of the book to passionate advocacy of the gold standard.”

One op-ed and a quarter of a campaign book spread over a lifetime does not rise to the level of a “gold bug.” Cain’s professional history shows him a pragmatist, not a dogmatist. “Gold bugs” — like President William McKinley and me (I was one of the 23 official witnesses before the Reagan Gold Commission and one of very few proponents) — tend to be more emphatic.

That said, the gold standard just isn’t buggy. No less than Tyler Cowen recently wrote at Bloomberg: “Whatever the imperfections of a gold standard might be, monetary authorities make a lot of mistakes, too. Furthermore, in the broader historical context, including the more distant past, the gold standard doesn’t look so bad.”

The Bank of England issued Financial Stability Paper No. 13 in 2011. Charles Kadlec summarized some of that report’s findings at forbes.com:

“Ever since President Richard Nixon in 1971 killed the Bretton Woods international monetary system by breaking the link between the dollar and gold, the U.S. economy has experienced slower growth, higher average inflation, higher unemployment rates, more bank failures and a series of financial crises that, in total, have reduced our income by about a third.

“Now, a Bank of England study with the ambitious title, ‘Reform of the International Monetary and Financial System,’ shows that the entire world economy has suffered a similar fate.”

Among Moore’s most enthusiastic critics is the dignified George Selgin, a meticulous scholar (and a friend). Selgin seems piqued by Moore’s lack of scholarly rigor. Just so! Rigorous scholarship is just not Moore’s forte.

But Selgin and Moore have some common ground. As lead co-author of Cato Institute Working Paper No. 2, Has the Fed Been A Failure, Selgin, with William D. Lastrapes and Lawrence H. White, writes:

“(1) The Fed’s full history (1914 to present) has been characterized by more rather than fewer symptoms of monetary and macroeconomic instability than the decades leading to the Fed’s establishment. (2) While the Fed’s performance has undoubtedly improved since World War II, even its postwar performance has not clearly surpassed that of its undoubtedly flawed predecessor, the National Banking system, before World War I. (3) Some proposed alternative arrangements might plausibly do better than the Fed as presently constituted.”

Selgin believes — laudably — that the Fed could use some powerful reform. This distinguished economist advocates a nominal gross domestic product targeting rule. Selgin’s gentility ought not to obscure the substantive point that the Fed is overdue to examine its protocols.

And let’s consider the larger context. President Trump is a, perhaps together with Lewis Lehrman, George Gilder and Steve Forbes the, leading gold sympathizer. As I wrote at Forbes.com about Trump on the stump:

“… Trump shows a strong affinity for gold. He has also shown a keen intuitive grasp of how the gold standard was crucial to having made America great:

“Donald Trump: “We used to have a very, very solid country because it was based on a gold standard,” he told WMUR television in New Hampshire in March last year. But he said it would be tough to bring it back because “we don’t have the gold. Other places have the gold.”

“Trump’s comment to GQ: “Bringing back the gold standard would be very hard to do, but boy, would it be wonderful. We’d have a standard on which to base our money.”

“Trump has been misled to believe that ‘we don’t have the gold. Other places have the gold.’ In fact, the United States, Germany and the IMF together have about as much gold as the rest of the world combined and America has well more than Germany and the IMF combined.”

Attacks on Moore and Cain for their sympathy toward the golden rule are proxy attacks on Trump. The attacks are ill-considered. America would be well served by sending Moore and Cain to be governors of the Fed.

America would benefit from a Fed that lived by “the golden rule” or another well-considered rule. Moore and Cain are well qualified to challenge the economic status quo that has flunked inspection and at least correlates with a Little Dark Age of economic stagnation. By promoting a rule-based economic policy Moore and Cain could be instrumental in helping to unleash an era of equitable prosperity.",2,https://www.insidesources.com/why-fed-nominees-moore-and-cain-arent-gold-bugs/
300,Benko,Ralph,spectator,"President Trump’s nomination of Stephen Moore and Herman Cain (full disclosure, both are friends and Moore an occasional professional colleague) to the board of governors of the Federal Reserve has become something of a cause célèbre in Washington.

Moore’s and Cain’s attackers outnumber their defenders. But their defenders have the better argument.

The Cain/Moore mutiny of the Establishment is a perfect microcosm of the existential crisis of modernity. Canadian public intellectual John Raltson Saul called this persistent existential crisis, in his eponymous book, Voltaire’s Bastards. (Penguin Books, 1992.)

That’s shorthand for a misplaced veneration of reason. Venerated reason has not performed nearly as well in practice as in theory. Better call Saul:

The official Left would put most of our problems down to uncontrolled self-interest, as if they still had a clear idea of how to harness self-interest for the general good. The official Right would shrug its shoulders manfully, that is to say cynically, as if to imply that reality is tough. But manful cynicism is probably a disguised form of confused helplessness. And none of these contradictions have anything to do with reality. … We are now more than four and a half centuries into an era which our obsession with progress and our servility to structure have caused us to name and rename a dozen times, as if this flashing of theoretically fundamental concepts indicated real movement. The reality is that we have not moved beyond the base ideas of the sixteenth century which, for want of any better description, should be called the concepts of reason. This Age of Reason will soon have been with us for 500 years. With each passing day more ideas, structure and beliefs are hung upon the fragile back of these few concepts. And yet, even in their early days, they were not ideas of great breadth. What’s more, from birth they were based upon an essential misunderstanding — that reason constituted a moral weapon, when in fact it was nothing more than a disinterested administrative method. That fundamental error may explain reason’s continuing force, because centuries of Western elites have been obliged to invent a moral direction where none existed. Knowledge, of course, was to be the guarantee of reason’s moral force — knowledge, an invincible weapon which would ensure that society was built upon considered and sensible actions. But in a world turned upon power through structure, the disinterested consideration of knowledge simply couldn’t hold and was rapidly transformed into our obsession with expertise. The old civilization of class was replaced by one of castes — a highly sophisticated version of corporatism. Knowledge became the currency of power and as such as retained. This civilization of secretive experts was quite naturally obsessed not by the encouragement of understanding but by the providing of answers.

This obsession with the providing of answers calls to mind an infamous anecdote about Montagu Norman, the first celebrity central banker, as recalled in Jim Grant’s review of Till Time’s Last Sand, a history of the Bank of England, from its founding in 1694 to the financially turbulent present:

“We have appointed you as our economics adviser,” Montagu Norman, the longest-serving governor of the Bank of England, said to a brainy new hire in the early 1930s. “Let me tell you that you are not here to tell us what to do, but to explain to us why we have done it.”

Here within the microcosm of Trump’s announcement of Moore and Cain the Voltaire’s Bastards syndrome manifests in two main criticisms. The first horrified indictment is that these candidates would undermine the independence of the Fed. The second is that they lack sufficient academic qualifications for the job.

Neither criticism holds up under scrutiny.

The independence of the Fed is one of the most durable tropes in Washington. It is also almost pure pretense. As Steven Solomon wrote in The Confidence Game: How Unelected Central Bankers Are Governing the Changed World Economy (Simon & Schuster, 1995):

Although they strained to portray themselves as nonthreatening, nonpartisan technician-managers of the status quo, central bankers, like proverbial Supreme Court justices reading election returns, used their acute political antennae to intuit how far they could lean against the popular democratic winds. “Chairmen of the Federal Reserve,” observes ex-Citibank Chairman Walter Wriston, “have traditionally been the best politicians in Washington. The Fed serves a wonderful function. They get beat up on by the Congress and the administration. Everyone knows the game and everyone plays it. But no one wants their responsibility.”

This claim of Fed independence has, to cite Saul, nothing to do with reality. It’s just a shibboleth of a misplaced veneration of what passes for rationality, a rationality that has failed for a generation to contribute to sustained robust equitable prosperity.

When not in the grip of partisan frenzy, the left, the right, and the center (Wriston) actually agree on this point. As a center-left commentator for the Washington Post, Matt O’Brien, trenchantly wrote in “Yes, the Federal Reserve has enormous power over who is president”:

The arc of the political universe is long, but it bends towards monetary policy. That’s the boring truth that nobody wants to hear. Forget about the gaffes, the horserace, and even the personalities. Elections are about the economy, stupid, and the economy is mostly controlled by monetary policy. That’s why every big ideological turning point — 1896, 1920, 1932, 1980, and maybe 2008 — has come after a big monetary shock. Think about it this way: Bad monetary policy means a bad economy, which gives power back to the party that didn’t have it before. And so long as the monetary problem gets fixed, the economy will too, and the new government’s policies will, whatever their merits, get the credit. That’s how ideology changes.

Center-right John Tamny, editor of Real Clear Markets, argues that “Presidents get the dollar they want. Always.” At RCM:

The Carter and Bush presidencies weren’t certain failures as much as the dollar policies from both administrations ensured economic malaise. What’s crucial is that all this could have been avoided. Presidents get the dollar they want. Always. Will President Trump realize this before it’s too late?

A second knock on Moore and Cain is that they lack the professionalism requisite to serve. To provide some context let’s take a good look at the Fed’s own track record.

Ylan Q. Mui, then writing for the Washington Post, wrote in “Why nobody believes the Federal Reserve’s forecasts”: “Even the government’s official budget forecasters are dubious of the Fed’s own forecast.”

This was a reprise of a note she had previously sounded,“Is the Fed’s crystal ball rose-colored?” “The big question is whether Fed officials can get it right after years in which they have regularly predicted a stronger economy than the one that materialized.”

The Fed’s economic predictions are consistently wrong. Thus, what can one really expect of policy based on those predictions? It is not wrong of the president to express concern that monetary policy is too tight and strangling economic growth.

Mui was not merely exercising journalistic cheek. In the New York Fed’s own flagship blog, Liberty Street Economics, we find — speaking for themselves and not the Fed — an admirably candid observation by an assistant vice president in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Research and Statistics Group, Marco Del Negro, Wharton Ph.D. student Raiden Hasegawa, and University of Pennsylvania professor of economics Frank Schorfheide, “Choosing the Right Policy in Real Time (Why That’s Not Easy)”:

Model uncertainty is pervasive. Economists, bloggers, policymakers all have different views of how the world works and what economic policies would make it better. These views are, like it or not, models. Some people spell them out in their entirety, equations and all. Others refuse to use the word altogether, possibly out of fear of being falsified. No model is “right,” of course, but some models are worse than others, and we can have an idea of which is which by comparing their predictions with what actually happened.… … In the end, we have shown that policy analysis in the very oversimplified world of DSGE models is a pretty difficult business. Contrary to what it may sometimes appear from listening to talking heads, deciding which policy is best is very rarely a slam dunk.

This can only be interpreted as an admission of the fundamental unreliability of the Fed’s core analytic. Bravo for the dose of honest candor!

Prof. Reuven Brenner has called our current system to account:

[M]acro-economics is now [astrology’s] modern incarnation: Only instead of stars, macro-economists look at “aggregates” gathered religiously by governments’ statistical agencies — never mind if the country has a dictatorial regime, be it left, right or anything in between, or has large black markets, as Italy and Greece do, where tax evasion has long been the main national sport. So let us first forget about this “macro” stuff, whose beginnings are almost a century old, and offer a simple alternative for shedding light on the situation today and on possible solutions, hopefully demolish this modern pseudo-“science” once and for all.”

No less than Hayek, in his Nobel Prize acceptance speech titled The Pretence of Knowledge, acidly criticized the economics profession for something he called “scientism,” meaning emulating the style but not the substance of the natural sciences. The Fed, with its many hundreds of PhD economists on staff is operating a pseudoscientific model.

This is the sine qua non of the Voltaire’s Bastards syndrome.

Is there a problem with this pretense? Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO of JP Morgan Chase, recently went on record as proclaiming that the U.S. economy should have grown 40% in the last decade, not 20%. The policies emanating from the Fed, with all of its impressive expertise, have not gotten the growth job done. We’re stuck in a “Little Dark Age” of economic stagnation.

This upsets President Trump. As well it should.

Whether or not one accepts Moore’s commodities-index target (I do not) or Cain’s belief in the gold standard (I do), their appointment and confirmation would be consistent with President Trump’s reported desire for better equitable prosperity.

Moore calls himself a “growth hawk.” Herman Cain is a sure-enough pro-prosperity supply-sider. Bring it on.

Confirming Stephen Moore and Herman Cain would not undermine the Fed’s independence. There’s nothing innately partisan about equitable prosperity. Some of prosperity’s greatest champions, such as the late President John F. Kennedy and the former U.S. Senator Bill Bradley, have been Democrats. President Reagan was a Democrat until his party left him.

So was I.

Confirmation of Moore and Cain would position two vital voices to challenge the Fed to up its game by adopting a monetary rule better calculated to restore equitable prosperity than its current, beleaguered “Voltaire’s Bastards” louche practices. The United States Senate should not flinch from confirming Stephen Moore and Herman Cain to the Federal Reserve Board.

Blockchain technology has been the talk of the tech world for the last several years. That said, it is also something of a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma. There are plenty of great books that effectively promote it, such as Don and Alex Tapscott’s nearly canonical Blockchain Revolution , published in 2016.

Fast forward the revolution by two years. There’s more to say.

George Gilder, in the most important recent book on blockchain, is here to say it. He not only dazzles but demystifies the blockchain, making vivid exactly how it is going to transform the internet and our lives.

Gilder is one of the most consequential public intellectuals of our era. He wrote Wealth and Poverty, the million-selling “bible” of the Reagan Revolution (which laid out the policy architecture that propelled the Dow Jones Industrial Average from around 800 in 1979 to 25,000+ today.

Gilder, a self-described “Cornucopian,” then went on to write four of the most influential books that predicted the technology of the modern era: Microcosm, about the computer chip; Telecosm and Life After Television, about the practical implications of fiber optics; and The Silicon Eye, about how cameras would become ubiquitous (as they are… on every mobile phone, laptop, and desktop computer, among many other devices).

George Gilder has unequivocally established his bona fides as an economic and technology guru. He now extends his hitting streak with a book about what he calls the Cryptocosm: Life After Google: The Fall of Big Data and the Rise of the Blockchain Economy .

Yes, Gilder explains “why” blockchain technology will transform the world. Non-techies may find these explanations a bit daunting, although dazzling. But what really makes Life After Google invaluable is how Gilder, clearly and definitively, shows “how” blockchain is transforming the world.

Gilder, gives us The Big Reveal: real uses – not “use cases” – where the blockchain is now being applied. He shows us, in a way that even your grandmother will immediately grasp, how this will change both the user experience and our lives.

One of these is digital identity. Right now, big data companies have figured out how to appropriate hyperlinks on the web and exploit them to become some of the most valuable companies in the world. According to Gilder, Blockstack, a blockchain startup, makes it possible for users to have control over our fundamental digital rights: identity, data-ownership, privacy, and security. Gilder:

“The Internet stack had become a porous and perforated scheme in which most of the money and power could be sucked up by the big apps at the top run by companies such as Google. What was needed was a blockstack that could keep the crucial IDs and personal data and pointers to storage addresses in a secure and immutable database on the blockchain.”

Google makes billions of dollars in profits a year by advertising to you (and me!). But what if Google had to – by the power of competition, not regulation -- share a big chunk of that revenue with us?

Gilder introduces us to Brendon Eich (former Master of Mozilla) who created the Brave Browser. This keeps your web searches from being tracked by browsers such as Chrome, Safari, or Firefox. And Eich has created a blockchain called Basic Attention Tokens (BATs), which will allow you to be paid for your attention, meaning for seeing ads. Don’t quit your day job yet but… BATs will make users a partner rather a product of companies such as Google.

Coming soon: Otoy, providing blockchain “Render Tokens,” essential to Virtual Reality. To oversimplify just a bit, thanks to the blockchain you soon will be going to (and creating!) websites rendered in 3D.

That will be as radical a shift in user experience as the shift from silent films to talkies, or black and white to Technicolor. How will Facebook, another beneficiary of Big Data, compete with a rival social network where you post 3D movies and interact in virtual 3D in real time with your friends? Thanks to the blockchain it is only a matter of time before VR will be the standard user experience on the web.

Treat yourself to a dazzling vision of the future: the fall of big data and the rise of the blockchain economy: Life After Google: The Fall of Big Data and the Rise of the Blockchain Economy . You will never be the same.

And welcome to the Cryptocosm.",2,https://townhall.com/columnists/ralphbenko/2018/11/02/welcome-to-the-cryptocosm-george-gilders-life-after-google-shows-how-blockchain-will-transform-your-world-n2534072
305,Benko,Ralph,spectator,"How important is the distinction between nationalism and patriotism? Could it be that this distinction might be all that stands between Steve Bannon and political power?

It may seem too slender a distinction, too thin a thread, to matter so much. Yet as G.K. Chesterton’s wrote on Fairy Tales (reprinted at All Things Considered, 1956, p.188-9):

If you really read the fairy-tales, you will observe that one idea runs from one end of them to the other — the idea that peace and happiness can only exist on some condition. This idea, which is the core of ethics, is the core of the nursery-tales. The whole happiness of fairyland hangs upon a thread, upon one thread. Cinderella may have a dress woven on supernatural looms and blazing with unearthly brilliance; but she must be back when the clock strikes twelve. The king may invite fairies to the christening, but he must invite all the fairies or frightful results will follow.… This great idea, then, is the backbone of all folk-lore — the idea that all happiness hangs on one thin veto; all positive joy depends on one negative. Now it is obvious that there are many philosophical and religious ideas akin to or symbolized by this; but it is not with them I wish to deal here. It is surely obvious that all ethics ought to be taught to this fairy-tale tune; that if one does the thing forbidden, one imperils all the things provided.

Patriotism vs. nationalism?

Bannon is currently a, perhaps the, leading imaginary hobgoblin of progressives, elites, and globalists. Bannon is surpassed in hobgoblinish notoriety only by the Big Billy Goat Gruff himself, Donald Trump.

The fascination with Bannon by the reigning intelligentsia brings to mind Joseph Conrad’s observation from The Heart of Darkness:

He has to live in the midst of the incomprehensible, which is also detestable. And it has a fascination, too, that goes to work upon him. The fascination of the abomination — you know, imagine the growing regrets, the longing to escape, the powerless disgust, the surrender, the hate.

As Ivan Krastev recently reminded us in the New York Times, “‘If there’s an explosion or fire somewhere, Steve is probably nearby with some matches,’ one of Steve Bannon’s former Breitbart News employees once said (admiringly).’” That said, it would be a vulgar mistake indeed to mistake Bannon for a mere hooligan.

The persistence and intensity of interest Bannon evokes suggests that there is more here than a Loki-like provocateur. A recent feature in the elite media highlights Bannon’s efforts to unite the European right-wing nationalist factions into a coherent movement. (The inherent paradox rather puts me in mind of a trope by an old progressive-libertarian friend, the late Rep. Ned Pattison: “We anarchists need to get organized.” How does one unite rival nationalists?)

Excited publicity about what Bannon calls “The Movement” was promptly followed by Bannon’s forthcoming cinematic billet doux to the president, “Trump @ War.” This was followed by eager sneak previews of Erroll Morris’s forthcoming Bannon documentary, American Dharma, slated to premier September 4th at the Venice Film Festival.

Bannon continues to fascinate even his enemies.

It has taken Adam Gopnik, an unusually discerning globalist (raised in Montreal in Habitat ’67 no less), to propose a really compelling resolution to the paradox that is Steve Bannon. Gopnik, while a card-carrying member of the cosmopolitan elite — an award-winning writer for the New Yorker — is refreshingly free of the strong priors that blind many of his contemporaries.

In a recent, brilliantly understated essay entitled “The General Will” — superficially a review of the new biography by Julian Jackson of Charles de Gaulle — Gopnik offers a revelation about the currently confounded state of world politics in general and (without naming names) about Bannon. Gopnik puts his finger squarely on the source of the cognitive dissonance that compels attention to Bannon. He then offers a profound resolution, one with potentially transformational political implications.

Bannon is harnessing the chthonic forces of nationalism — tribalism on steroids — as a source of political power. Spoiler Alert! There is a force that has even greater power than, one without the sinister undercurrents of, nationalism. It is called patriotism.

While out of favor, patriotism is angelic, not demonic. Follow along.

Gopnik puts his readers at risk of missing his politically essential cultural haymaker by burying his lede and identifying his true quarry obliquely, by description rather than by name. In reviewing Jackson’s laudable but somewhat obscure new biography De Gaulle (Harvard), Gopnik assesses, with mordant near-reverence and near-Canadian sangfroid, De Gaulle, as

the biggest pain in the ass in the history of the liberal order. By alphabetical accident, the heading “De Gaulle: Personal Characteristics” in Jackson’s index gives us, in sequence: arrogance, austerity, authoritarianism, cigarette smoking, coldness, contempt for human nature. It’s quite a list. Yet, as this classically composed and authoritative (if culturally somewhat shallow) book makes clear, he remains an amazing figure. De Gaulle had three rendezvous with history, in the old-fashioned sense he loved: in 1940, in 1958, and in 1968. On all three occasions, he saved the French state by sheer theatricality and élan. First, by embodying the French republic in retreat from the Germans; then by seizing power, in a republican mode, to end the Algerian crisis; and, finally, when he ended the potential chaos of the May revolt by massing almost a million people on the Champs-Élysées in a counter-demonstration. It was not all theatrical élan. As Jackson, a British history professor, shows, it also involved political savvy and the quiet weighing of odds among competing factions. But he depended more on theatrical élan than did pretty much any other public man of his century. Churchill in 1940 was far from powerless. He had radar and Ultra, an intact R.A.F. and a large empire. De Gaulle had nothing except his uniform and his voice. No one has ever played a weaker hand more compellingly. His life was one long brilliant bluff, and the things that make him exasperating — his vanity and closed-mindedness; his unearned sense of superiority and egocentric blindness — were also why the bluffs worked. He convinced others, sitting at the card table with all the aces in their hands, that he might have somehow manufactured an extra ace by pure force of will.

Enough, however, about the indispensable De Gaulle (to whom is attributed the trope “The graveyards are full of indispensable men”). How are Gopnik’s observations about this dead French president relevant — even essential — to our current political situation?

[Jackson’s] account misses the central lesson that de Gaulle intuited: myths matter. Without a sense of shared symbols, it is impossible for any modern state to go on. France is a frustrating state, but it has never been a failed one. It works. National dignity is hugely important to any program of national renewal. (Had American policy toward Russia post-1989 been shaped with an eye not just to that country’s political system but to its pride — to making sure that the Russians had a myth of their own self-liberation, instead of being so obviously plundered and defeated — the ensuing disaster would, conceivably, have been less disastrous.) De Gaulle crafted a symbolic history for the French in place of a real one, because symbols were among the most real things they knew. The distinction that’s sometimes made between patriotism and nationalism is at the essence of his existence. The patriot loves his place and its cheeses and its people and its idiosyncrasies; the nationalist has no particular sense of affection for the actual place he advocates for (he is often an outsider to it) but channels his obsessive grievances into acts of ethnic vengeance. De Gaulle is a nearly perfect example of the right-wing patriot in power — of the constitutional conservative who accepts the modern order. With his love of honor and pageantry, de Gaulle might seem to offer a very dated model of politics. And yet in an odd way there’s an urgent, living lesson for the twenty-first century in what de Gaulle accomplished, one that can’t be overlooked — indeed, President Macron spends every day trying not to overlook it. What de Gaulle’s example reminds us is how valuable an insistence on the shared symbols of a common fate can be if carried out with integrity and a residual deposit of democratic values. The politics of grandeur, he shows, need not be the exclusive province of bullies and gangsters and crooks and clowns. It’s a fine French lesson.

Gopnik hereby nails the two things that Bannon (as well as Trump) gets importantly right. And he nails the crucial distinction which Bannon subtly, potentially tragically, gets wrong. The collapsed distinction is a crucial nuance, something that Chesterton called “the one thread” upon which all else depends.

The two big things that Bannon and Trump surely get right are the importance of myth — our narrative, both personal and national — and of our pride (in the sense of dignity, not the deadly sin of superbia). These factors, so far, elude the left. Grasping them represents a major source of Bannon’s power.

So long as the left remains clueless about myth and dignity, it will remain politically underpowered.

Myth speaks for itself. As for dignity, Poe’s The Cask of Amontillado opens with words that now seem a prophecy of the blue-collar working class’s repudiation of the condescending elites and their paladin, Hillary Clinton: “The thousand injuries of Fortunato I had borne as I best could; but when he ventured upon insult, I vowed revenge.”

Until the elites develop a decent respect for the virtues and values of the blue collars they will be politically immured alive: “For the love of God, Montresor!” The left also would do well to contemplate the crest of the formerly great and numerous Montresor family: “A huge human foot d’or, in a field azure; the foot crushes a serpent rampant whose fangs are impeded in the heel.”

And the motto: “Nemo me impune lacessit.”

“No one attacks me with impunity.”

The crucial nuance that eludes Bannon (and Trump) is the critical distinction between patriotism and nationalism:

The distinction that’s sometimes made between patriotism and nationalism is at the essence of [De Gaulle’s] existence. The patriot loves his place and its cheeses and its people and its idiosyncrasies; the nationalist has no particular sense of affection for the actual place he advocates for (he is often an outsider to it) but channels his obsessive grievances into acts of ethnic vengeance. De Gaulle is a nearly perfect example of the right-wing patriot in power — of the constitutional conservative who accepts the modern order.

This distinction may hold within its DNA the blueprint for a road to political power and glory while avoiding ignominy. If Bannon were to tilt the world away from nationalism, with its ugly chauvinist undercurrent, toward patriotism, with its beautifully idealistic subtext, he could own the secret recipe for creating a modern, multinational Gaullism: the “right-wing patriot in power, the constitutional conservative.”

Without grasping and activating the distinction between nationalism and patriotism, durable power — Bannon’s stated desire to have his vision dominate for generations — is likely to merely tantalize him. And if Bannon does not seize as his tentpole patriotism instead of nationalism, a challenger could eat Bannon’s lunch.

Implausibly, but not impossibly, this challenge could arise from within the GOP. More likely it could arise from within a chaotic and confused Democratic Party. Alternatively, we may just remain in the realm of chaos. Loose ball!

As Aristotle teaches, the strongest persuasive force (rhetoric) is pathos, not logos, feelings, not logic. Whoever uses patriotism to trump the nationalism now besetting politics, hither and yon, could quickly find herself within striking distance of seizing the throne. Bannon’s vulnerability right now is to his power being wrested from him by a better-quality insurgent populism — patriotic rather than nationalistic — than Bannon and those he is mentoring are now projecting.

Yes, as Gopnik reminds us, “myths matter. Without a sense of shared symbols, it is impossible for any modern state to go on.” Napoleon shared a similar sentiment (and used it to propel himself, albeit briefly, to glory).

What a thing is imagination! Here are men who don’t know me, who have never seen me, but who only knew of me, and they are moved by my presence, they would do anything for me! And this same incident arises in all centuries and in all countries! Such is fanaticism! Yes, imagination rules the world. The defect of our modern institutions is that they do not speak to the imagination. By that alone can man be governed; without it he is but a brute.

The mythos of patriotism resoundingly trumps the shopworn myth of nationalism. Steve Bannon might even, thereby, surpass De Gaulle as “the biggest pain in the ass in the history of the liberal order.” That’s a status that surely would appeal to him.

307,Benko,Ralph,spectator,"Google and social media have been in the headlines. So has Bitcoin. Tech guru and conservative economist George Gilder now brings the two together in a fascinating and pertinent way.

According to a very recent WellsFargo/Gallup poll, about 2% of American investors — defined as people with more than $10,000 in stocks, bonds or mutual funds — own some bitcoin. Less than 1% are planning to buy any soon.

Yet about one in four investors are intrigued. You may be one of them.

I am the senior counselor to the Chamber of Digital Commerce, the world’s largest trade association which represents the blockchain industry. George Gilder serves on the advisory board of the Chamber of Digital Commerce and we’ve been professional colleagues, on and off, for decades.

As such, I was privileged to read his new book, Life After Google: The Fall of Big Data and The Rise of the Blockchain Economy, thrice: twice in manuscript and again in hardcover. I rarely read a book once, much less three times, and reread twice it out of pleasure not duty.

The blockchain — the virtual “stuff” of which bitcoin was the pioneering (and remains the preeminent) version — is one of the hottest technologies in the world right now. It’s also one of the most controversial.

Marc Andreessen, the inventor of the Web browser and one of the most powerful venture capitalists in Silicon Valley, said to the Washington Post (the Post’s comments are in bold below) a few years ago:

“This is the big breakthrough. This is the thing we’ve been waiting for. He solved all the problems. Whoever he is should get the Nobel prize — he’s a genius. This is the thing! This is the distributed trust network that the Internet always needed and never had.” … So the business opportunity posed by this “distributed trust network” — as an investor, what do you see that you could potentially — “Hundreds or thousands of applications and companies that could get built on top. Is this, like, a billions-of-dollars kind of industry? “Yeah.” Trillions…? “Yeah!”

That high valuation is not mere rhetoric. As Bloomberg reported on August 2, “This year’s selloff in virtual currencies has done little to dent investor enthusiasm for initial coin offerings, which attracted a record $12 billion in the first half. That’s up from $7 billion for the whole of 2017 and a more than 50-fold jump from 2016….”

Meanwhile, legendary old school investor Warren Buffett recently called bitcoin “probably rat poison squared.” (This clearly was not meant as a compliment). Buffett’s long-time consigliere Charlie Munger called trading crypto “just dementia.” (Also not meant as a complement.)

So, who’s right?

Baffled?

Gilder to the rescue!

Gilder, for those space travelers recently returned from the long trip to Proxima Centauri, is one of the leading public intellectuals of our era. He wrote what Dr. Arthur Laffer, co-architect of Supply-Side economics, called “the bible of the Reagan Revolution,” the million-selling book Wealth and Poverty. Gilder was the living author most quoted in his speeches by President Reagan.

Since Reagan was the president who, in following the Kemp/Mundell/Laffer/Gilder recipe, set the course for multiplying world’s wealth by something like a (nominal) factor of seven, bringing over a billion people worldwide out of dire poverty in the process, Gilder is obviously a consequential public intellectual.

Nor was George Gilder a one-hit wonder. He went on to write a series of books on technology that propelled him to nearly legendary status. He flew high and moved markets with the Gilder Technology Report… until the Fed busted the dotcom boom. That implosion did not, however, undermine his prophetic qualities.

Ari Emanuel — arguably the most powerful man in Hollywood — attributes his success to George Gilder. As Emanuel wrote at Medium:

In 1990, I picked up a book by George Gilder called “Life After Television.” It changed my life. It caused me to imagine technology that could move so fast that our industry might be gone in a decade or two. Most of the people where I worked couldn’t see that. They bet on the past. Because of George’s book, I bet on the future and left to start my own business. It was one of the hardest decisions of my life, but I’ve never looked back. George predicted a world where traditional network television programming ended because of computers, digital video and fiber optics. You can still call that box in your house a TV, but the TV business as we knew it in those days is gone. We didn’t have the words to describe all the inventions George talked about back then like “teleputers” and “channels of information.” But today we know them as iPhones and the web. The internet, mobile and streaming revolutions happened just as George predicted. Watching George’s predictions happen, living through them and building my business around them, I learned that the cycle of innovation doesn’t stop after TV. Surviving the next revolution means connecting the dots early and trusting your instincts when things are about to change.

Never one to rest on his laurels Gilder now moves us from Life After Television to Life After Google to make an even bolder prophecy. (Spoiler alert: imagine the Web in 3D virtual reality. Now… read on.) Gilder, an old pro at this, also authored Microcosm (a defining book about the semiconductor industry), Telecosm (a cult classic about fiber optics), and The Silicon Eye, among others.

Gilder has seen the future, and it works. Forget the dotcoms. They are yesterday’s news. So what are the dots to now connect, early, to survive the next revolution? Gilder steps forth to unravel the enigma of the blockchain, which he compellingly baptizes the “Cryptocosm.”

It’s a saga.

Computer chips and flat panel displays revolutionized our lives (as the stuff of the MacBook Pro on which I compose this review and, likely, the screen on which you read it). Fiber optics also revolutionized our lives (as the Web, on which I researched and submitted it, and infinite cable bandwidth — think Game of Thrones and so much more).

Then mobile transformed our lives. Now we are about to move from the Microcosm to the Telecosm to the Cryptocosm.

I am by no means alone in thinking Gilder prophetic. The Financial Times recently picked Life After Google as one of their three “business books of summer 2018.” Thus, far from being rat poison, blockchain promises to prove to be the next Big Thing.

Whether you are a veteran of or a newcomer to the blockchain space, Life After Google is likely to prove a revelation and a delight. (Also, you just might order an extra copy for Aunt Gladys who keeps asking you to explain bitcoin to her. Just don’t blame me if she becomes a crypto billionaire.)

In 23 chapters plus an epilogue, Gilder plays Virgil to your Dante in exploring the many circles of the Cryptocosm. If you are part of the 1% interested in investing in the Next Big Thing, or just would like to know what’s going to be upending your day-to-day life in the next few years — and how — you’ve come to the right place.

Bonus: Gilder keeps it fun, intuitive, and exciting. Life After Google begins with a breathtaking romp through the prototype Back to the Future ride through Hill Valley/a volcano/chased by a T-Rex in a virtual DeLorean.

This ride, which Gilder invested in and experienced in prototype, was designed by 2001: A Space Odyssey/Close Encounters/Blade Runner special effects wizard Douglas Trumble. It become a dominant theme park experience. Gilder gives you a private tour.

Gilder then takes us on as breathtaking a ride through what he calls Google’s “system of the world.” Google’s is a system based on “free.” But, as he demonstrates, it’s an odd kind of free — free, as in, literally, priceless.

Gilder finds this antithetical to true freedom. And to capitalism.

By not charging its users — you and me — for its services, Google places itself in a position to harvest immense amounts of data about us. It then uses that data to sell advertising. While this is not quite sinister in the way Senate interrogators like to portray it, this architecture holds within itself the seeds of its own destruction.

And Gilder holds that it violates Google’s initial prime directive, “Don’t be evil,” originally a sly dig at Microsoft. The original sin, and inescapable evil, of Google’s “system of the world” is that the data it thus collects are intrinsically, inevitably, insecure.

That system demands the hassle of passwords and two-factor authentication and so forth. And yet… the data are warehoused in ways that are intrinsically vulnerable to hackers and phishers and breachers and other nefarious sorts right out of The Inferno’s central casting.

Gilder meticulously documents how the lack of security is intrinsic to Google’s priceless “system of the world.” “Pricelessness” may sound pretty wonderful, à la Mastercard’s early 21st century ad campaign.

But it has an Achilles’ heel. The New Yorker’s February 7, 2000 article entitled “The Price Prophet” by its estimable economics bigfoot John Cassidy stated, “It is hardly an exaggeration to refer to the twentieth century as the Hayek Century.”

Why? Because of Hayek’s discovery of the power of price as an essential element to free markets and the equitable prosperity that liberty creates.

Capitalist pricing, not Marxist pricelessness, turned out to hold the key to obliterating poverty and improving the lot of workers — much to the astonishment of the naive Lincoln Steffanses of this world.

Gilder, in a personal email, instructs me, “One of the key flaws of ‘free’ is it obviates security. No one needs to steal free stuff.” Cue Kris Kristofferson’s and Fred Foster’s Bobbie McGee: “Freedom’s just another word for nothin’ left to lose.… Nothin’ ain’t worth nothin’ but it’s free….”

Then Gilder shows how the blockchain — the Cryptocosm — will cure the problem of insecurity baked into Google’s System of the World. Crypto promises to make our identities and our valuable digital property secure and to secure their value… for us, rather than for Google.

The company store was not a great advance of capitalism during the era of the so-called “robber-barons,” and it is no better today when it is dispersed through the cloud, funded through advertising, and combined with a spurious sharing of free goods. Marxism was historically hyperbolic the first time round, and the next Marxism is delusional today. It is time for a new information architecture for a globally distributed economy. Fortunately, it is on its way.

One of the marvels of a George Gilder tech book is how he unfailingly takes us behind the interface on a tour of the workings of the system and the people who created these. He unfailingly shows us the fascinatingly intricate clockwork behind the hands and face of the watch. In Life After Google, Gilder takes us on a whirlwind tour of the World’s Fair of much of what’s actually inside the Internet… and the blockchain.

Gilder displays all this as a Cabinet of Wonders. Never a dull moment. Another fascinating element of “The Joy of Gilder” is his taking us to meet the Grand Architects of the Digital Universe, past, present and future.

Early on he escorts us into the very moment of the key conference — in 1930 — where a young super-geek named Kurt Gödel — empowered by the intellectual courage of the great von Neumann — quietly but definitively tipped over the first domino that destroyed the prevailing deterministic scientific model of the world.

Gödel, empowered by von Neumann, opened the door to a cornucopian cyber age. The blockchain now promises to restore its decentralized glory.

That moment led the world out of the desert of determinism and into the age of information theory. (It’s Claude Shannon’s world. We just live in it.) And if you dare to think of the greatness, rareness, muchness, fewness of this precious only endless world in which you say you live I have encountered no better guide to it than Life After Google.

Gilder’s excursion to 1930, however, is merely his genuflection to the Logos, the Original Word. He quickly moves us from “In the beginning” to a close encounter with the technological marvels of the world in which we live as obliviously as fish are to water.

The Greeks had four words for history: Logos (the Origin, as “In the beginning was the Word”); Mythos (our mythic antecedents); Epos (our Epic ancestry); and Rheimos (contemporary history). Gilder duly begins with the Prime Movers, the utterers of the Logos: von Neumann, Gödel, Turing, Shannon.

He then quickly takes us on a magical mystery tour of the Internet’s Mythic era. Meet Google’s founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page, the paladins of “Big Data.” Travel with them to Burning Man!

Gilder portrays the founders of Google as Titanic in two senses. They are the Titans in the pre-Olympus sense, primitive, barbaric, early gods such as Cronos, destined to be vanquished by the Olympian deities and banished to Tartarus. Titanic is also an allusion to a certain ill-fated ocean liner, in its brief day the grandest passenger ship ever yet built.

Gilder then moves us smartly along to confront the brewing epic battle for supremacy between the insurgent Olympians — featuring the paladins of the blockchain — and the currently reigning Titans. He introduces us to the powerful implications of the parallel processing chips made by Nvidia and of the implications of advanced materials such as the one molecule thick, 60X as strong as steel and 200X as conductive as copper, graphene.

Nvidia chips originally were just meant for gaming. Now they are being repurposed as crucial for innovations such as self-driving vehicles. And graphene promises to make “nano-machines, vehicles, and engines possible.” Gilder shows how hardware appears to be regaining technological supremacy over the software that has been “eating the world.”

This portends a tectonic shift in the world economy. Follow along!

Gilder is so steeped in high tech culture that he can readily expose the pretensions of the current reigning Masters of the Universe with their artificial hysteria over Artificial Intelligence. He reveals how their Asilomar conference of 2017 — convened to place an anathema on AI — was mis-founded on a materialist superstition. And he shares how this feckless conclave was held in the same venue as a 1975 conference predicting an apocalypse — apparently by 1985 — from genetic engineering. That never materialized. Neither, declares Gilder, will Elon Musk’s AI apocalypse.

After exposing some of the key fallacies and spurious assumptions of the currently reigning Titans of Tech, Gilder moves us from Mythos to Epos, from the mythic age to the epic age we are now entering.

Here come the insurgent Olympians, prominently among whom are the wielders of the blockchain. Gilder provides us with a revelatory imaginary encounter with the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, the inventor of bitcoin, and then introduces us to the ferociously brilliant Vitalik Buterin, “a child prodigy on a Mozartian scale,” the inventor of Bitcoin’s main rival (or complement), Ethereum.

Gilder then escorts his readers to meet several enfants terrible of tech who you likely have not — not yet — heard of. Prominent among them is Austin Russell, who is successfully incubating the key laser-radar technology to make self-driving cars safe and affordable. This is “orders of magnitude better than the competition from Google and others,” reports Gilder.

Russell is a Thiel Fellow. His company, Luminar, is partly funded by Peter Thiel. Thiel, a founder of PayPal, the first major investor in Facebook, the money behind Palantir, is known for many things. One of these is his trope, “We wanted flying cars. Instead we got 140 characters.”

Thiel, who Gilder calls “the master investor-philosopher,” blurbs Life After Google thusly: “George Gilder shows how deep this assumption ‘that the world’s future is nothing more than the next moment in a random process’ goes… and why it’s wrong….”

Call what is happening “Thiel’s Revenge.” The Olympians overthrowing the Titans is a drama wherein Thiel might be cast as Zeus. The fall of Big Data will occur at the hands of the “flying car” pioneers.

Moving along from Logos to Mythos to Epos, Gilder escorts us into an up-close-and-personal look at contemporary history, Rheimos. Enter the blockchain.

Gilder conjures a phantasmagoric imaginary encounter with Satoshi and pursues a delightful parlor game as to who Satoshi might (or might not) be. This, in turn, gives way to his recounting of a dramatic “Battle of the Blockchains” — between bitcoin maximalist Craig Steven Wright, who claimed to be, perhaps as a pretender, Satoshi himself.

Wright, and bitcoin, are pitched against Vitalik Buterin — another Thiel Fellow — and Ethereum.

In its effect on our business, technology, and economic life, Buterin’s contribution is paralleled only by Satoshi’s blockchain itself.… In the history of enterprise there has never been anything like the launch of Ethereum.

Which blockchain will prevail?

Andreas Antonopoulos … compares bitcoin and Ethereum to “a lion and a shark.” Each will dominate in its own domain. Each will suffer from limitations and tradeoffs.

Drilling down further, Gilder takes us out of the abstract to the concrete: Blockstack, a company designed to go “out into the electronic night… to light it up with an architecture for a transformed Internet — a metaworld of trust beyond the seven layers of communications technology.”

Gilder introduces this world-transforming startup with a meditation on the “Metaverse” as invented by Neal Stephenson in his 1992 novel Snow Crash. He then moves on to the human story of Blockstack’s founder, Muneeb Ali, born in a village in Pakistan. By dint of genius and persistence and, although Gilder does not say so, Insh’Allah Ali escapes from his deeply humble origins to become a potential savior of the Worldwide Web. (Advocates for generous immigration policy: take note!)

As 70 percent of all links came to be handled through Google and Facebook, [the Web’s inventor, Sir Tim] Berners-Lee feared that his Web was dying. He would become a Blockstack enthusiast. “When he heard what we were doing he did a little dance,” said Blockstack’s software chief, Jude Nelson. The Internet stack had become a porous and perforated scheme in which most of the money and power could be sucked up by the big apps at the top run by companies such as Google. What was needed was a blockstack that could keep the crucial IDs and personal data and pointers to storage addresses in a secure and immutable database on the blockchain. … [S]ecurity is not an app or a video game. It is an architecture.

Where is Gilder, and the world, going with this?

Ali described [the blockchain] as “the most sophisticated and complex and yet elegant and beautiful program I ever came across. And the main thing it does is it gives power back to the people.”

This is about finally making the Internet really secure instead of perilous. This is about causing the inventor of the Web to do “a little dance.” This is about giving power back to the people.

And, not so incidentally, this is about making self-driving, possibly even flying, cars, real thereby ameliorating or even ending America’s road-bridge-and-tunnel infrastructure crisis through innovation instead of a trillion dollar government spending spree.

Dazzled yet?

Buckle up. Gilder gets even more dazzling.

Gilder brings us to the current doings of another Olympian figure of the online world, Brendan Eich, author of JavaScript, the most widely used computer language in the world. Eich is former CEO of Mozilla Foundation.

He is now inventor of the Brave Browser designed to remedy “the bad effects of cookies and turns the tables on every top-down Internet empire.”

Eich is doing this though something called BATS:

“Basic Attention Tokens” to bring down Google. Or at least send Page and Brin back to the drawing board for a new strategy. The mild-mannered Eich will hit them with a billion BATS.

Gilder met Eich through mutual service on the advisory board of OTOY, a leading enterprise in the field of virtual reality, one using the blockchain to create:

virtual worlds… almost indistinguishable for many purposes from the topology of the real world.… With OTOY’s ORBX rendering protocol translated into Eich’s JavaScript, any browser can blossom into a three-dimensional space. Users can escape confinement to a screen and occupy a space. No longer limited to typing on a screen, you can inscribe writing on the walls of the world—an advance that portends the end of the segmented top-down, walled garden, cookie-crumbling Internet.

’Scuse me while I kiss the sky.

Gilder takes us into a grand finale worthy of July 4th fireworks on the national mall in a chapter titled “The Rise of Sky Computing,” quoting OTOY co-founder Jules Urbach as using the blockchain to offer “A decentralized and open global rendering system… foundational for disruptive services and platforms to evolve from the post-mobile world of immersive computing….”

Life After Google thereafter glides into a graceful denouement, declaring that,

Governments and investors everywhere should welcome the explosion of creativity in crypto, preparing a new financial system of the world for the moment when the fiat currency piñata bursts at last.

Gilder strikes a prophetic note in his penultimate chapter.

The revolution in cryptography has caused a great unbundling of the roles of money, promising to reverse the doldrums of the Google Age, which has been an epoch of bundling together, aggregating, all the digital assets of the world.… By reestablishing the connections between computation, finance, and AI on the inexorable metrics of time and space, the great unbundling of the blockchain movement can restore economic reality. Crucial will be the emergence from the crypto-welter of metrics tied to the scarcity of unfolding time. Satoshi was correct in mimicking gold, but because he did not fully grasp the sources of gold’s success, he erred in his parameters for the bitcoin. Satoshi’s error provides opportunities for others only to the extent that they grasp the nature of money and time.

Then concluding:

A computer industry for a world of information should be oriented to the creative dimension of virtual reality rather than the flat universe of the materialistic superstition. A successful system of the world should be devoted to rendering the full complexity of the human mind.

Shades of Edwin Abbott Abbott’s Flatland! Gilder here seems to be promising us that the blockchain will move us from a two-dimensional digital universe as now defined and dominated by Google to a three-dimensional digital universe, both metaphorically and metaphysically, where our dignity and liberty are restored.

For us civilians, this portends a more dramatic leap than the one from silent films to talkies, from black-and-white to color. Our world is about to transform, in large measure through the blockchain. Toto, I’ve a feeling we’re not in Kansas anymore.

Recently, Vint Cerf, who, with Bob Kahn, was the Internet’s rightly beatified co-inventor and is now Google’s chief Internet evangelist, put out a teasingly derogatory tweet about the blockchain. Therein he embedded “a simple flow chart,” a box with the question “Do I need a Blockchain?” with an arrow pointing to a box that says “No.”

If Cerf reads Life After Google he just might toggle that “No” to “Yes.” Cerf is, after all, a world-historical genius. In any case, it would be riveting to watch a debate between the author of Life After Google and Google’s chief Internet evangelist to, well, hash it out.

Also, maybe, just maybe, after reading Gilder, Google will upgrade its System of the World. Sergey and Larry might be a couple of Burning Man hippies. If they are, they are also among the smartest hippies who ever lived. Bring it on.

In writing Life After Google, George Gilder has outdone himself. The author of the bible of the Reagan Revolution has now written the bible of the Cryptocosm. The Cryptocosm is a technological breakthrough that promises to transform every aspect of our lives.

Gilder is its essential guide.

Whether you are reading as an investor, as a voter, or simply to indulge a healthy citizen’s curiosity about the way the world soon will work Life After Google: The Fall of Big Data and The Rise of the Blockchain Economy will endow you with the genesis block of an invaluable roadmap to the future.

309,Benko,Ralph,spectator,"Hello, Tim Draper. Break California up into three States? High time!

What might be the larger implications of tugging on a loose thread of the sweater that is the Megastates that dominate the world? They weave a garment that has for centuries engulfed the world in war and which lingers on, making the world gratuitously sweat.

So, let us place Draper’s scheme to divide California in three into the Grand Scheme of Things: the decline and fall of the Megastate. Where to begin?

Back in High School civics, I — you, too, probably — was taught that the first president of the United States of America was George Washington. Not quite true. The first president of the United States of America was John Hanson, of Port Tobacco Parish, Maryland.

Once upon a time Hanson was recognized as one of America’s greatest statesman. There is still a highway named for him. But there’s a catch. He was president under the original charter for the United States of America, called the Articles of Confederation and perpetual Union.

I was, and probably you were, also taught that the Articles were defective. How so? They provided insufficient power to the federal government. The States thus supplanted the Articles, in 1789, by ratification of the Constitution of the United States.

The Constitution, which, as amended, still endures created USA 2.0 as it were. General Washington became the first president, not of the United States of America but under the U.S. Constitution, and the leader of the executive branch of government.

The Articles promised:

The said States hereby severally enter into a firm league of friendship with each other, for their common defense, the security of their liberties, and their mutual and general welfare, binding themselves to assist each other, against all force offered to, or attacks made upon them, or any of them, on account of religion, sovereignty, trade, or any other pretense whatever. The better to secure and perpetuate mutual friendship and intercourse among the people of the different States in this Union, the free inhabitants of each of these States, paupers, vagabonds, and fugitives from justice excepted, shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of free citizens in the several States; and the people of each State shall free ingress and regress to and from any other State, and shall enjoy therein all the privileges of trade and commerce, subject to the same duties, impositions, and restrictions as the inhabitants thereof respectively, provided that such restrictions shall not extend so far as to prevent the removal of property imported into any State, to any other State, of which the owner is an inhabitant; provided also that no imposition, duties or restriction shall be laid by any State, on the property of the United States, or either of them.

Even though I myself am somewhat of a pauper and a vagabond, I like the sound of this. Still, the consensus of historians about the Articles is summarized succinctly by History.com:

Stemming from wartime urgency, its progress was slowed by fears of central authority and extensive land claims by states before was it was ratified on March 1, 1781. Under these articles, the states remained sovereign and independent, with Congress serving as the last resort on appeal of disputes. Congress was also given the authority to make treaties and alliances, maintain armed forces and coin money. However, the central government lacked the ability to levy taxes and regulate commerce, issues that led to the Constitutional Convention in 1787 for the creation of new federal laws.”

Hmm. A limited central government without the power to tax or to regulate?

These lacunae sound to this card-carrying archconservative and minor leader of the Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy more like a feature than a bug. Yes, back in the Days of Yore the 13 colonies and their successor states — and their first attempted union — were weak.

Small, and vulnerable, America was at risk of being a plaything of foreign Emperors.

The Canadians could have swooped in and burned down the Capitol! The British, in fact, did. Every few blocks in the grand avenues of our capital city one encounters a traffic circle. Apocryphal lore has it that these were originally designed as gun emplacements to keep the Redcoats from sweeping in too easily and doing it again. Although this is mere lore, it reflects the sense of young America’s vulnerability.

How times change! In return for our beating Nazi Germany in World War II America dismantled the British empire, the last of the “Big Five” Empires that persisted into the 20th century. Now the USA is the world’s only hyperpower.

As a hyperpower, the power to tax, notoriously involving the power to destroy, and the power to regulate commerce have devolved from blessings into curses against which most conservatives volubly complain.

But, wait a moment! Is it true that America is the world’s only hyperpower? Well, yes, in point of fact, it is true both economically and militarily.

The economy of our currently greatest imaginary hobgoblin, the Russian Federation, is less than one-tenth the size of the USA’s. Russia’s economy is only a little more than half the size of California’s. Russia’s economy is smaller than that of Canada or South Korea, neither of which are perceived as existential threats.

America has 14,612 military aircraft to the Russian Federation’s 4,827. America has ten aircraft supercarriers (and two on order). Russia has one balky antique carrier, accompanied by an oceangoing tugboat to tow it back to port when it breaks down.

Russia has nine (rather small) foreign military bases, ten if one disputes Crimea as under Russian sovereignty. Most of these are in former constituent republics.

Notwithstanding nostalgia for the USSR, Russia is no hyperpower.

Nuclear, yes. Hyper, no. Nor can it afford to become one.

Meanwhile, the United States has 800 foreign bases.

I realize that Angela Merkel was born in communist East Germany. Still, do we really need to keep 34,805 troops stationed in Germany? Germany, while formidable, is no longer a frightening nihilistic state. Annoyingly officious, yes. Scary, no.

One could go on. The United States military budget dwarfs that of any other nation. Ours is, by some accounts, as big as that of the next 14 counties, 12 of whom are allies, combined. Our two putative rivals among those 14 — Russia and China — have ethnically complicated continental-sized territories of their own to defend. Their militaries are stretched perilously thin.

China’s economy, while notionally approaching that of the United States, is something of a Fata Morgana when looked at on a per capita basis. The average income in the People’s Republic of China is around $8,100 a year. That’s about one-seventh that of an average American’s at $57,000. Yes, a citizen of China’s income is higher when calculated in purchasing power parity. But it nowhere near rivals that of the average American.

Notwithstanding its magnificent growth thanks to the policies put in place by the greatest supply-side leader in modern history, Chairman Deng “To Get Rich Is Glorious” Xiaoping, and nobly advanced by its current President Xi Jinping, it will be a long, long time, if ever, before the Middle Kingdom catches up with America, Meiguo, the “Beautiful Land.” China cannot afford to rival us militarily.

Militarily, China has demonstrated 6,000 years of keen disinterest in projecting military force outside its borders, other than the occasional punitive strike against an insubordinate neighbor. And as Peter Drucker once observed, “culture eats strategy for breakfast.”

Sustained force projection runs directly counter to China’s settled military doctrine. China prevails by assimilation, not confrontation. Consult Sun Tzu’s The Art of War. China, notwithstanding its ambitions, is no hyperpower. She might, with good governance and good fortune, become an economic one in the 22nd century. Let’s wish her well. The comparison between the U.S. and China is one between apples and mandarin oranges.

So, yes, America is the world’s sole hyperpower. And so no, an America without a strong central government would not be particularly vulnerable. The prevailing condition — American vulnerability — that in the 18th and 19th centuries argued for a strong national government now, as we are the 21st century’s hyperpower, argues for a modest national government.

How best to accomplish that?

Human beings, of which Americans are an admirable version, are natively “localitarian.” Consider what I presented elsewhere as “the kind of common sense wisdom shown by Alexander Hamilton, who during the debates of the Convention of the State of New York on the adoption of the federal Constitution, said:

‘There are certain social principles in human nature, from which we may draw the most solid conclusion with respect to the conduct of individuals and of communities. We love our families more than our neighbors; we love our neighbors more than our countrymen in general. The human affections, like the solar heat, lose their intensity as they depart from the centre, and become languid in proportion to the expansion of the circle in which they act.’”

So, the fascinating larger implications of Tim Draper’s proposal to break up California begin to come into view.

President William Jefferson Clinton famously said in his 1996 State of the Union address, “the era of big government is over.” This was prophetic.

And yet…

The conservative movement has long been thwarted in its noble efforts to seriously downsize the federal government. Why? I contend that this failure was because conservatives failed to think Big — meaning Small — enough.

Over the years I’ve watched many of my friends launch astute yet ineffectual efforts to cut the government of the United States down to size.

I thank my libertarian friends at Cato, who share my passion for smaller government, for helping to shrink federal spending from a disgusting $400 billion a year, at Cato’s founding, to a mere $4 trillion/year today.

I am a staunch, enthusiastic, supporter of my friend Grover Norquist’s pledge to keep officials from raising tax rates or eliminating deductions except to reduce rates. I’d turn it into a Constitutional Amendment if I could. That said, it seems to have shifted Uncle Sam’s funding mechanism rather than shrinking him down to bathtub size.

My dear friend Steve Moore founded, and my dear friend David McIntosh capably leads, the Club for Growth in an effort to elect small-government conservatives to Congress. It worked! However, there is some evidence that once small-government conservatives get elected, most, in practice, stop being small-government conservatives.

I was on the Tea Party barricades when Mark Meckler and Jennie Beth Martin were choreographing the torches and pitchforks of the Tea Party Patriots. We created a Red Wave in the 2010 election, which, however, was followed by a wave of red ink.

More recently I’ve watched Mark Meckler’s revving up a beau geste of convening an “Article V” gathering to make a litany of rather shopworn changes to the U.S. Constitution. I observe my progressive populist friend Larry Lessig attempting to get Big Money out of Big Politics. Plus ça change, plus c’est la même chose. In short:

I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked,

dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix….

I suggest that this futility shows that we have failed to think Small enough. That may be changing.

Over the past few years we have seen movements of states pushing against the structure of Megastate authority. Britain voted to exit the European Union. There is a well-grounded fear that other nations might.

Now we observe the spectacle of the thwarted Catalan independence movement. (Count me among the Catalonia Libre crowd. Long live the Crown of Aragon!)

And now, Cal3!

Let’s take a look in the rear-view mirror to see where we are coming from in an effort to know where we ought to be going to.

In the 16thcentury Ivan the Formidable (formerly, and still by the Novgorodians, known as the Terrible), in successful resistance to the Mongol occupation, united the many Russian-speaking principalities into Russia, elevating himself from the Grand Prince of Moscow to the Tsar (the title itself derived from Caesar) of all the Rus.

In the last couple of centuries, the twenty-five German Kingdoms, Grand Duchies, Duchies, Principalities, and Cities were unified into one nation-state. This occurred after the Franco-Prussian War in 1871 and, fittingly enough, was accomplished in the Hall of Mirrors in the Palace of Versailles.

Accuse me of Prussian collusion but I say: Time to exit the Hall of Mirrors. Thanks, but no thanks, Otto von Bismarck. Give us back Prussia and the lost 24 principalities!

Seventeen sister republics of the Apennine Peninsula during Napoleonic times make up what is now Italy. The irredentist among us — like me — might take a stand for restoring the yet earlier thirty-one States, Kingdoms, Grand Duchy, Duchies, Prince-Bishoprics, Principalities, Marquisates, and Republics. Giuseppe Garibaldi, the world is poorer by the extinction of Marquisates. Give them back!

With the rising populist tide, one can more easily imagine the European Union dissolving itself, à la the USSR (and Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia), returning to its constituent republics, than one can imagine the EU hanging together.

Adieu Brussels.

Hail Fredonia?

All this time, Switzerland has been pointing the way to the future. Yes, Switzerland, chocolate-and-watch-making, secret-numbered-bank-account-holding, army-knife-wielding, gun-toting, crossbow-apple-from-head shooting Switzerland.

Switzerland is a loose federation of 26 cantons. Per Wikipedia:

Spanning the intersection of Germanic and Romance Europe, Switzerland comprises four main linguistic and cultural regions: German, French, Italian and Romansh. Although the majority of the population are German speaking, Swiss national identity is rooted in a common historical background, shared values such as federalism and direct democracy and Alpine symbolism. Due to its linguistic diversity, Switzerland is known by a variety of native names: Schweiz [ˈʃvaɪts] (German); Suisse [sɥis(ə)] (French); Svizzera [ˈzvittsera] (Italian); vand Svizra [ˈʒviːtsrɐ] or [ˈʒviːtsʁːɐ] (Romansh). On coins and stamps, Latin (frequently shortened to “Helvetia“) is used instead of the four living languages. Switzerland is one of the most developed countries in the world, with the highest nominal wealth per adult and the eighth-highest per capita gross domestic product according to the IMF. Switzerland ranks at or near the top globally in several metrics of national performance, including government transparency, civil liberties, quality of life, economic competitiveness, and human development. Zürich and Geneva have each been ranked among the top cities in the world in terms of quality of life….

Why? I contend that the economic and social blessings enjoyed by the Swiss derive in part from its status as a loose confederation of cantons, i.e. microstates. How is Switzerland governed? Wikipedia teaches:

The President of the Confederation, colloquially known as the President of Switzerland or Federal President, is the head of Switzerland‘s seven-member Federal Council, the country’s executive branch. Elected by the Federal Assembly for one year, the president chairs the meetings of the Federal Council and undertakes special representational duties. First among equals, the president has no powers over and above the other six councillors and continues to head her/his department. Traditionally the duty rotates among the members in order of seniority and the previous year’s vice-president becomes president. The president is not the Swiss head of state; the entire Federal Council is the collective head of state. … When traveling abroad, the president does so only in their capacity as head of their department. Visiting heads of state are received by the seven members of the Federal Council together, rather than by the President of the Confederation. Treaties are signed on behalf of the full Council, with all Federal Council members signing letters of credence and other documents of the kind.

And let it be noted that the president of Switzerland typically takes public transit to work. Now, that’s my kind of president.

As Emma Lazarus wrote (about the Statue of Liberty):

“Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!” cries she

With silent lips.

Storied pomp? Forget Air Force One. Let the president fly coach.

Enough with the Imperial presidency. Switzerland points the way.

I’m an old-line archconservative who was a virulent anticommunist back when there were communists outside of academe, who disdained fluoridated water long before bottled water became a thing, served as a Tea Party leader (Co-Emcee of the Boston Tea Party rally on July 4 2009), is a friend of the House Freedom Caucus, and remains a True Believer in Smaller Government.

So, now?

Time to think Big by thinking Small.

Really, really Small.

Time to disaggregate the Megastates assembled during the latter half of the Second Millennium, a consolidation which gained critical mass over the past couple of centuries leading to epic 20th century world wars. Replace them with confederations.

Mikhail Gorbachev, a true visionary, set a marvelous precedent in dissolving the USSR into its constituent republics. I have seen the future, and it works!

Let the USA now up the ante by emulating the noble example of Gorbachev and dissolve our union, reconstituting ourselves as a confederation. Reassemble the United States into its 50 constituent Republics (56 including the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands) loosely affiliated under the revived Articles of Confederation.

I recommend that we append the Bill of Rights to the Articles. This may be redundant. Better safe than sorry. Perhaps, add some measures inspired by the constitution of the high-functioning Switzerland.

Then, let Steve Bannon encourage Europe, Germany and Italy to follow suit. The Russian Federation most likely will quickly realize how much better life will be as the Russian Confederation when the Kievan Rus no longer live under the hegemony of the Grand Duchy of Moscow (and its successors). Let the new United States of America — strictly by the power of example conjoined with liberal amounts of vodka — encourage a return to the loose Slavic federation of yore.

If not, no worries. Russia has been the perpetual subject, not the source, of invasions. Were Moscow, weirdly, to invade us, surely the Texas Air Force and Texas Rangers can handle it. Contrariwise, California (as currently constituted at least) likely would welcome liberation by invading Russian troops with cries of Comrade! If so, so be it. Let L.A. and San Francisco become Moscow’s headache, not ours.

Really, no grounds for geopolitical anxiety about the Bear. Russia is the Grand Opera of nations. She can be overbearing but overall trends affectionate.

China surely will prove nonbelligerent and might be quick to emulate America’s, Europe’s, Germany’s, Italy’s, and Russia’s splendid example. The wisdom of Lao Tzu is embedded in the DNA of the Chinese. As Old Long Ears observed in that great spiritual, political and social classic, the Tao Te Ching, in Chapter 80:

A small country has fewer people.

Though there are machines that can work ten to a hundred times faster

than man, they are not needed.

The people take death seriously and do not travel far.

Though they have boats and carriages, no on uses them.

Though they have armor and weapons, no one displays them.

Men return to the knotting of rope in place of writing.

Their food is plain and good, their clothes fine but simple,

their homes secure;

They are happy in their ways.

Though they live within sight of their neighbors,

And crowing cocks and barking dogs are heard across the way,

Yet they leave each other in peace while they grow old and die.

“Leave each other in peace….”

Time to Think Big.

How?

Think Small.

Make America (and the world) Great Again by restoring nations to loose but loyal confederations of small states.

Let’s think small so that the natural power of affection for our families and our neighbors will work as a force to keep our governments good.",2,https://spectator.org/a-modest-proposal-for-making-america-and-the-world-great-again/

Editor's Note: This piece was co-written by Ralph Benko and William Collier.

There are two stories about Facebook data mining - one is covered extensively by the press, and the other barely gets a mention. But both stories are about data mining of Facebook to sway voters and win elections. In one story, Facebook knowingly allows one party to data mine at will and in the other story the data mined was used, commercially, without Facebook's knowledge or consent.

Enter the two tales of the 2012 and 2016 elections.

In 2012, as former Obama campaign director Carol Davidsen noted in a tweet, “Facebook was surprised we were able to suck out the whole social graph, but they didn't stop is once they realized that was what we were doing.” What this means is the Obama campaign was able to pull data from all the friends of all the people on their own campaign app, as many as 190 million profiles culled through the Obama campaign’s over 1 million users.

Prior to the use of similar methods by Cambridge Analytica to cull such data in 2014, which they deployed during the latter stage of the Republican primary to help Donald Trump, such use of data was seen as innovative in some digital media circles.

In 2014, Cambridge Analytica paid a Cambridge University professor to create a ‘personality quiz' app that some 270,000 users accessed. The app also culled data from the user's friends, the social graph, although in this case Facebook was not made aware of what was happening. What is more, the study in which the users participated in did not disclose that their data could be used for purposes other than the study.

The Trump campaign was sold on the data by Cambridge Analytica. The data’s source reportedly was not disclosed to the campaign. The data did not prove useful and during the general election it was not used at all.

Another distinction is useful. In the case of Cambridge Analytica, the data were used to target users with ads. In the case of the Obama campaign, ads were made to look like they were shared by a user's friends and not clearly presented as ads.

The selective outrage in the hype is telling. From the user perspective, the Obama campaign not only culled private data and used it to target users, they actually spoofed users and shared content through their accounts to make it seem as if your friends were posting this content. Most of the users whose data was used did not give their consent or even realize their data was mined. But the cries of outrage are strangely muted.

The real hype, however, comes from the digital media industry itself, which sells data mining and micro-targeting at a high price, presented as the holy grail of electoral persuasion. After 2012, there were many stories extolling the value of Big Data and how the Obama campaign had won the race by superior use of such data. Facebook was freely allowing this data to be pulled by the Obama campaign. Seems as if a double standard may be at work.

In the Cambridge Analytica case, this data was not used in the general election because the RNC had better data. We can attest that the voter universes available through the RNC are superior.

In the aggregate, data about sentiments and the ability to target segments of people can be useful. But the extra effort and cost of drilling down to the individual level suffers from the law of diminishing returns. Neither Trump nor Obama won through data mining prowess.

They won because both men tapped into public need and sentiment in a way that connected to voters. Their campaigns succeeded in getting their message to the voters repeatedly and at multiple touch points, from digital and other forms of paid media, to earned media and events. Digital smigital. The fundamental things apply as time goes by.

Digital firms are proficient at hyping their ability to cull and use data with almost magical prowess. Yes, some aggregate use of data to target population segments can be a useful tool That said, repeated messages speaking powerfully to a felt need in the language of the audience is what wins.

Those who invent apps to cull data from your friends may be looking for shortcuts through the heavy lifting of solid, consistent, and repetitive messaging. Ultimately, to win you need a great message, well and frequently delivered. Period.

The genie of “data mining” is already out of the bottle. Facebook is no more an offender than the many other entities, including government. The ability to predict what will inspire, repulse, or motivate people by demographic and location has always been part of marketing a message. But there is a law of diminishing returns at play here.

In campaigns and elections data mining and micro-targeting take a back seat to good old-fashioned repetitive messaging. The hysteria with which the Old Media is as overdone as the hype of the New Media mountebanks selling data as if it were snake oil, good for what ails you, in a bottles from the back of their wagons.

Ralph Benko, a Washington consultant, is the author of the international award-winning book, The Websters’ Dictionary: how to use the Web to transform the world. William Collier is a principal at Intellz, an opposition research and political strategy firm.",2,https://townhall.com/columnists/ralphbenko/2018/04/03/the-hype-over-facebook-data-mining-is-overblown-n2467155
311,Benko,Ralph,realclearmarkets,"Mass hysteria breaks out periodically – even in Congress! – over pulp media, of which Facebook is now the poster child. But what’s the fun of being a U.S. Senator or Member of Congress if you can’t grandstand a little now and then?

Hollywood came under the hammer for scandal both as to risqué content and lascivious lifestyle, bringing on the Hays Code, in 1930. That was a set of moral guidelines adopted and enforced by the industry to pre-empt the many censorship bills percolating in 37 state legislatures.

And who can forget Fred Wertham’s 1954 book, Seduction of the Innocent, accusing the comic book industry of being a cause of juvenile delinquency, undergoing the scrutiny of a Congressional inquiry. This led to the Comics Code Authority by which comic book publishers self-censored their publications for many years.

These seem rather quaint, in retrospect.

So will the Facebook hysteria.

But for now…

Last time we looked (yesterday, several times), Facebook was just another form of mass entertainment, kind of an aggregation of millions (OK, billions) of amateur “Reality Shows.” Like “Reality TV,” Facebook makes most of its money from advertising. We the viewers (online, also the producers) get to play, for free, in return for Facebook’s privilege of lobbing ads at us. Fair deal.

What is called by sinister-sounding words like “data mining” is no different in kind – may be slightly different in sophistication, in a good way – from the audience demographic measures that the networks (and cable franchises) present to their advertisers. Or that newspapers or radio stations provide on “rate cards.”

Advertisers hate to waste money pushing snow shovels in Miami or ice cream to the Inuit. Viewers would rather view ads that were more, or more likely to be, tailored to their interests and needs. Win-win.

There’s nothing sinister about this. People who are going into a tizzy about Facebook are collapsing a fundamental distinction. Facebook and Google do not have “our” data.

They have “data about us.” Good.

That, by the way, is what the federal government of the United States collects every ten years, and -- like Facebook -- generously makes available. It’s called the U.S. Census. Yes, there are a few high decibel, high vigilance, people, like former Rep. Ron Paul, who find the Census outrageous and possibly unconstitutional. Takes all kinds!

We have no – and can think of no reasonable grounds for – objection that companies who wish to advertise their products – or campaigns who wish to advertise their candidates – do as much research as they wish to get as much information about us as they can. Call it “data mining” if that makes you sound hip. It’s just market research.

Bill Collier, co-author of this article, likes to collect vintage Prussian military helmets. (Yes. It certainly takes all kinds!) He doesn’t see why the purveyors of such artifacts should be expected to advertise them to the billion, nine hundred ninety-nine million, seven hundred thousand people who have no interest in Prussia, helmets, or Prussian helmets. If the data about him at Facebook suggests that his Facebook Friends are more likely than most to like Prussian helmets – or might get him one as a gift – blessings on advertising to them! That is not a crime. It’s not even a sin.

Facebook has been, and should be, generous with giving prospective advertisers – commercial and political, Republican and Democratic – information about us. Facebook is in the business of selling advertising. The more valuable they can make that advertising – or even get prospective advertisers to believe it will be – the more money Facebook will make. Bravo! When did we criminalize capitalism?

How many Congress(wo)men are torqued because L'Oréal doesn’t advertise lipstick during NFL football games? Well, guess what, ESPN has “data mined” its audience and discovered – surprise! – that the vast majority of the viewers are men, not an inviting market for lipstick.

Conversely, we’d be surprised to see Bud Light commercials around the Kardashians. No cries of outrage emerging from the Rayburn Building, from either side of the aisle, on this.

What’s problematic here -- though it is none of Congress’s business, and a self-limiting problem if that – is that the PR agencies – such as Cambridge Analytica – and the advertisers – like the Trump Campaign (and, btw, Obama for America) are almost certainly indulging in one of the oldest fallacies in the advertising business.

The advertising agencies are dangling the bright shiny object of “microtargeting” and other high-tech features. Such jargon helps to attract and pacify clients. But it offers severely diminishing returns in terms of real world results.

There are some broad relevant parameters. No, don’t waste your political ad dollar advertising on Nickelodeon or Nick.com. Most SpongeBob SquarePants viewers are too young to vote. Roger.

Presumably we do not need this spelled out in the Code of Federal Regulations. Beyond such common sense guidelines there is little evidence that the high-buzzword features such as microtargeting produces cost-effective outcomes at scale.

Our favorite advertising guru, Roy H. Williams, describes what works in his cult classic book Magical Worlds of the Wizard of Ads. Assuming you are selling something (or somebody) that people want, of good quality and competitively priced, and offer a good “personal experience factor,” success -- sales, or a plurality of votes on election day – is determined by a “high impact quotient” ad (vivid, specific, credible and based on truth, not deception) with your message repeated frequently enough (relative to your competition) to work. Period.

People don’t like to hear that. They’d rather believe in magic. But that’s it.

All of that is properly between the advertiser, the advertising agency and the digital media consultant. The media company – Facebook – is no guiltier of bad practices by being generous with access to its audience data than is NBC for providing as much information as it can get, say from Nielson, on who is watching its shows. Facebook is no guiltier than the US Census Bureau for providing information as to the demographics, ethnicity, and median income of a given region.

It’s not “our” data. It’s data “about us.”

Congressional grandstanding? Inevitable. Expect, at the end of all the sound and fury signifying nothing, something like the Hays or Comics Code. And remember what neoclassical celebrity economist Karl Marx said: “all the events … of great importance in world history occur, as it were, twice. … the first time as tragedy, the second as farce.” Marx stopped short of telling us what comes third, after farce.

317,Benko,Ralph,spectator,"Two progressive icons in the Capitol have recently announced their resignations. Sen. Al Franken, under pressure from the Senate Democratic conference, announces his resignation in the wake of the resignation of Rep. John Conyers under pressure from House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. The consequences of sexual misconduct are taking a big toll beyond the progressive bastions of entertainment and media.

Scandalous revelations about sexual harassment (and worse) proliferate. What might this mean, both for society and politics? As Elizabeth Drew recently wrote in the New Republic, in an extraordinarily trenchant essay entitled “Sex and Power in Washington ” :

It doesn’t look as if the current upheaval about sexual predation will wind down anytime soon. More targets are being examined by reporters, and Capitol Hill is like a volcano about to explode. The problem has been rife there as long as anyone can remember (and probably before then, as well). Congress clearly has to change its rules for dealing with charges of sexual aggression, which make it nearly impossible for a female plaintiff to win and which pays some of them off secretly with taxpayers’ money. Media and other corporations have to reconsider their guidelines. And the punishment should fit the crime—which in the current frenzy may not always be the case. But anyone who thinks that the matter of sexual aggression, in the arena of politics and the press that cover it, will go away doesn’t understand the male libido and the temptations provided in these particular professions. One possible positive sign is that, for the younger generations in the workplace, the presence of females isn’t novel, which leads to more respect for them. Latter-day Savonarolas pronouncing “zero tolerance” in Washington aren’t living in the real world.

It used to be that two of the three items one simply did not discuss in polite company were sex and politics. (The third was religion. It’s the only remaining taboo.) Sex and politics — often conjoined — now dominate the conversations, both national and personal. What’s up with that?

Slightly over a quarter century ago, Prof. Elaine Showalter, then chairperson of the Princeton English department, wrote a prophetic, in fact what may be the defining, book pertinent to this very topic: Sexual Anarchy: Gender and Culture at the Fin de Siècle. Showalter is a rara avis, an academic populist. Showalter: “I’ve always really loved popular culture, but it wasn’t something serious intellectuals were supposed to be concerned about.… I would like to be able to bring my background and my skills to subjects that do reach a wide audience.”

As it happens, Showalter, with Sexual Anarchy, was well ahead of her time. She wrote well before the crescendo of the sexual anarchy now besetting us. She remains to this day a vital and unique voice in the culture. But for my money, her magnum opus is Sexual Anarchy. It is essential to understanding, and perhaps even resolving, our current predicament. Follow along.

Sexual Anarchy is a study of the changing of the mores and the culture at the end of the 19th century. It is not, however, a backward-looking work. It delves into the roots of what I have here previously called a Cultural Revolution that is not just ongoing but intensifying. It does so more discerningly than any other work I have encountered. I hold it as a prophetic work, one that is urgent to consult at this historical, and possibly historic, juncture. Showalter:

The 1880s and 1890s, in the words of the novelist George Gissing, were decades of “sexual anarchy,” when all the laws that governed sexual identity and behavior seemed to be breaking down. As Karl Miller notes, “Men became women. Women became men. Gender and country were put in doubt. The single life was found to harbor two sexes and two nations.” During this period both the words “feminism” and “homosexuality” first came into use, as New Women and male aesthetes redefined the meanings of femininity and masculinity. There were fears that emancipated women would bear children outside of marriage in the free union, or worse, that they would not have children at all. In the wake of Ibsen, women’s oppression became the theme of successful plays by Arthur Pinero, Oscar Wilde, Harley Granville-Barker, and George Bernard Shaw, and novels by Thomas Hardy, George Meredith, and George Moore.

With the rise of matters surrounding “T” — “Transgender” — to the top of the charts, what could be more relevant than reflecting on the era where “Men became women. Women became men. Gender and country were put in doubt” first arose?

The fin de siècle was also a period of sexual scandals. In England, they ranged from the trial and acquittal of the notorious brothel-keeper Jeffries in 1884, and the sensational journalistic series on child prostitution of W.T. Stead, “The Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon,” in 1885, to the exposé of the Cleveland Street male brothel in 1889. All of these scandals changed the level of public awareness about sexuality and engendered a fierce response in social purity campaigns, a renewed sense of public moral concern, and demands, often successful, for restrictive legislation and censorship. They were occasions when gender roles were “publicly, even spectacularly, encoded and enforced.” Especially there was a call to reaffirm the importance of the family as the bulwark against sexual decadence.

2017 has become — and almost certainly 2018 will be — “a period of sexual scandals.” Will there be a comparable reaction? Or will we see something along the counsel of William Butler Yeats, in The Second Coming,

Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;

Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,

The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere

The ceremony of innocence is drowned.…

Is there a chthonic psychic driver?

As the political historian Carole Pateman has observed, women have traditionally been perceived as figures of disorder, “potential disrupters of masculine boundary systems of all sorts.” Women’s social or cultural marginality seems to place them on the borderlines of the symbolic order, both the “frontiers between men and chaos,” and dangerously part of chaos itself, inhabitants of a mysterious and frightening wild zone outside of patriarchal culture.”

What is the social impact?

[M]any men found their part of the equation as difficult to sustain as women did theirs, and the source of much anxiety. Opportunities to succeed at home and in the Empire were not always abundant; the stresses of maintaining an external mask of confidence and strength led to nervous disorders, such as neurasthenia; suppressing “feminine” feelings of nurturance and affection created problems for many men as well. What was most alarming to the fin de siècle was that sexuality and sex roles might no longer be contained within the neat and permanent borderlines of gender categories.

What was the social order that gave rise to the sexual anarchy of the late 19th century, and what elements of it echo down to the 21st century?

Clubland operated as a lifetime training ground for men wishing to exclude women. Aggressively and urbanely heterosexual, even rakish, in their discourse, the clubs were the stronghold and headquarters of opposition to women’s suffrage and practiced an “intermittent and localized misogyny.” A boy accustomed to intense male friendships and anti-feminist assumptions in the atmosphere of public schools was “fully equipped to play his part in keeping women out” when he reached the university; and “the Oxford college was itself a small club” where the social and intellectual habits of public school could be continued. The London gentlemen could spend his entire life moving through “a maze of clubs,” athletic, political, and social; and professions from medicine and the law to “the best club of all — the House of Commons,” also imitated the structure of Clubland. Finally, the exclusion of women was not restricted to the upper and middle classes. Women were generally not permitted in public houses, and in 1897 only one of the 512 groups in the Working Men’s Clubs and Institute Union admitted women as members.

How men there were “even rakish, in their discourse” foreshadows the Access Hollywood tape which, as it happens, recounts an unsuccessful attempted seduction. Yet “rakish” indeed was that discourse.

Did the mainstream reaction of the late 19th century serve to defuse the challenge to conventional mores? Or to intensify it?

Following the pioneering work of Michael Foucalt, many historians of sexuality now argue that male homosexuality and the male homosexual role are “inventions” of the late nineteenth century. … [F]in-de-siècle efforts to define and control homosexuality, and to bound it off from masculinity in general, were not successful, and may have had the effect of strengthening homosexual bonds. As Jeffrey Weeks explained, “it seems likely that new forms of legal regulation, whatever the vagaries in application, had the effect of bringing home to many the fact of their difference and thus creating a new community of knowledge, if not of life and feeling, among many men with homosexual leanings. Foucalt maintained that this paradoxical effect is inevitable because the official definition, marginalization, and control of a particular group such as homosexuals always creates a “reverse discourse.”

Santayana: “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.” These extracts give the gist of Showalter’s analysis, and offers the possibility of a transformational grammar with which to discuss — and even think about — the situation and the scandals that now beset us.

What might this all this mean for the political future? Two of my friends and sometime colleagues, Frank Cannon and Maggie Gallagher, recently published a magisterial essay in First Things headlined “Culture Is Downstream of Politics ” :

Walk into any room full of Christian conservative donors, and someone will say, “Politics is downstream of culture.” Every head in the room will nod. Nothing is more entrenched as conventional wisdom among Christian conservatives. Like most truisms, this one is only partly true. As people change their beliefs about what is true and good, politics changes as well. But putting culture above politics as a distinct sphere is profoundly mistaken, for politics is part of culture. Politics allows the American people to give public form to what they believe to be true, good, and important; it is also the main way Americans decide which views are “within the pale” and which are beyond it. Elites of the left dominate most other domains: the mainstream media, the academy, the arts, Hollywood, Madison Avenue, and increasingly the Chamber of Commerce and corporate suites. When an idea or issue drops out of politics, therefore, progressives can easily stigmatize it as outside the mainstream, extremist, and intolerable, effectively ending conversation. But election results feed back into culture.

What comes next? The authors observe:

Our research shows that between 2007 and 2014, conservative organizations dedicated to changing public policy on life, marriage, and religious liberty spent just under $75 million in direct political spending. By contrast, the leading gay-rights political organization, Human Rights Campaign, recently pledged to spend $26 million in 2018 on direct political action. Emily’s List, one of the largest pro-abortion PACs, spent $36 million in 2016 and is likely to spend as much or more in the upcoming electoral cycle. In other words, only two organizations on the left will spend in one year almost as much on direct political action as all socially conservative organizations combined spent between 2007 and 2014. Comprehensive data for 2015 and 2016 are not yet available. But the preliminary data suggest political spending by social conservatives is falling, not rising.

The authors demand that “This must change.” It is not at all clear those who have the power to change it are listening to them. That said, Foucalt’s observation about “reverse discourse” and Showalter’s about “paradoxical effect” may come to their rescue. Indeed, the electorate’s conjuring of Donald Trump might be a manifestation of just these phenomena.

Confrontation with sexual harassment (and worse) is awkward and, often, painful. That said, culture, as Gallagher and Cannon point out, being downstream from politics such confrontation is both inevitable and necessary.

By that confrontation, we may develop the vocabulary to address directly, rather than obliquely, by proxy, or by the Jabberwocky that too often passes for political discourse, the core issues too long ignored or finessed. By just such a confrontation we yet may emerge from anarchy into an organic and humane — which is to say, conservative — social and political order.

Ignoring the warning of the prophet Hosea, the elite culture has sown the wind. It is now reaping the whirlwind. Franken and Conyers are leaving. They have been, to steal a phrase from Rhiannon, by Fleetwood Mac (perhaps not immaterially, Bill Clinton’s signature band), taken by the wind.

Eugène Delacroix, Liberty Leading the People

The Rasmussen polling company recently issued a bulletin headlined ""A lot of Americans have hard feelings after last November's presidential election."" This is not a surprise but it is good to have it quantified:

""A new Rasmussen Reports national telephone and online survey finds that 40% of Likely U.S. Voters think the election has negatively affected their personal relationship with a friend or family member.

...

""Fifty-four percent (54%) of voters who Strongly Disapprove of the job President Trump is doing say the election has hurt a personal relationship. Just 35% of those who Strongly Approve of Trump's job performance agree. ""Seventy-seven percent (77%) of all voters now think Americans today are less tolerant of each other's political opinions than they were in the past. That's up from 70% in November. Voters were last this pessimistic just weeks before the 2012 presidential election. Only 11% think Americans are more tolerant of each other's views than in the past, while 10% think the level of tolerance is about the same.""

...

Women and younger voters are more likely than men and those 40 and over to say a personal relationship has suffered because of the election. But older voters agree with women that there is less political tolerance in America today.



One of the most famous declarations from ""second-wave feminism"" is that ""the personal is political,"" popularized in a 1969 essay of that title by feminist Carol Hanisch. There, as summarized by Wikipedia, ""she urged women to overcome self-blame, discuss their situations amongst each other, and organize collectively against male domination of society.""

It quotes this from that influential essay:

""One of the first things we discover in these groups is that personal problems are political problems. There are no personal solutions at this time. There is only collective action for a collective solution.""

Amen. That said, we are now, more intensely than before, confronting a situation that that could be stated as the converse of this axiom: ""the political is personal.""

The New Oxford American Dictionary defines ""political"" as ""relating to the government or the public affairs of a country: a period of political and economic stability; relating to the ideas or strategies of a particular party or group in politics: a decision taken for purely political reasons. It defines ""personal"" as ""of, affecting, or belonging to a particular person rather than to anyone else....""

Had the Rasmussen organization included me in its poll it would have found me in neither ""Strongly Disapprove"" or ""Strongly Approve."" I score ""Cautiously Optimistic"" based in part on my interpretation of information that has been only spottily been reported in the elite media, in part on my good opinion, some derived from first-hand knowledge, of many of those that Trump has surrounded himself with, and in part on my latitudinarian -- ""not insisting on strict conformity to a particular doctrine or standard"" -- natural disposition.

It would not be quite true to say that the election, or, to be more precise, Trump (and my hopeful take on him) has ""hurt"" a personal relationship. Yet it certainly has put a real strain on several, some very personal. Many dear friends of a left-wing, or refined cosmopolitan, orientation are genuinely appalled that I do not share their passionate indictment of Trump. I am grateful for their generosity in not letting a political view damage the personal love between us.

Others, however, have experienced personal repudiation. A column in the Daily Beast, Steve Bannon's Long Love Affair With War (whose indictment of Bannon as a warmonger I find shallow and unconvincing), notes that his former close friend and colleague ""... Julia Jones--who identifies as a 'Bernie Sanders liberal'--had a falling out with Bannon due to his work on the Trump presidential campaign, a role that she said absolutely 'disgusted' her.""

Ouch! What to do?

What we are observing, politically, is a revolution. Bannon emphatically characterized it as such, well before the election, in a Skyped-in speech at the Vatican to the Human Dignity Institute. The full text was transcribed by Buzzfeed. (By ""revolution"" Bannon did not, in my view, mean what his detractors infer. He meant something more interesting. Read the speech and decide for yourself.)

That ""revolution"" has evoked a ""counter-revolution."" The most notable event so far was the Women's Marches. Their stand was most wittily summed up by a placard reportedly characterizing Donald Trump as ""Super-Callous-Fascist-Racist-Extra-Braggadocious.""

If that's what Trump is then those who support him are either knaves or fools. Trump's supporters, however, consider that view of him as ""Super-Callow-Fragile-Ballistic-Extraordinarily-Ferocious.""

Is a clash in which the political becomes personal inevitable? Is injury to personal relationships regrettable, but necessary, collateral damage?

Maybe.

Or maybe not.

There is a quiet ""counter-counter-revolution"" afoot. It is exemplified by LivingRoomConversations.org, AllSides.com and HiFromTheOtherSide.com among others. Its premise may be even more radical than that of the revolutionaries and counter-revolutionaries: ""The social is political.""

Listening to, not reviling, those of opposing viewpoints may not -- probably will not and should not -- change many views on issues. But it transforms our understanding of many of those who hold opposing views, recognizing that those who hold opposing views are not necessarily fools or knaves. Transformed mine.

We counter-counter-revolutionaries are seizing power to transform the political climate into one of construction, not destruction. Diversity of views is a treasure of classical liberal political culture.

We can disagree passionately without acrimony. That's powerful.

It's part of what made America great. It's part of what can make America great again.

Even if the political is personal let's use that to strengthen, not strain, relationships with those who we cherish. This declaration does not pass judgment on either the revolutionaries or the counter-revolutionaries. Celebrate, don't betray, your passion!

The rise of naked partisanship, increasing economic and regional stratification, the splintering of our media into a channel for every taste - all this makes this great sorting seem natural, even inevitable.

We weaken those ties when we allow our political dialogue to become so corrosive that people of good character are turned off from public service; so coarse with rancor that Americans with whom we disagree are not just misguided, but somehow malevolent. We weaken those ties when we define some of us as more American than others; when we write off the whole system as inevitably corrupt, and blame the leaders we elect without examining our own role in electing them.

This election cycle has provided much demonizing of the major party candidates. Much anxiety stalked the land, or at least the mainstream media. Some of this anxiety fixated on fragility of the perceived legitimacy of the victor in the presidential election. Bosh.

The Declaration of Independence succinctly and perfectly states: “Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed….” And electoral victory, in the electoral college, remains the least imperfect mechanism yet tried to discern the consent of the governed. (Electoral victory plus the division of power between the Congress and the presidency is pretty darned good.)

Our current perceived predicament is neither new nor news. H.L. Mencken, the proto-libertarian “Sage of Baltimore,” summed it up to perfection 98 years ago in In Defense of Women:

Civilization, in fact, grows more and more maudlin and hysterical; especially under democracy it tends to degenerate into a mere combat of crazes; the whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed (and hence clamorous to be led to safety) by an endless series of hobgoblins, most of them imaginary.

The fundamental things don’t change as time goes by.

Every election since the dawn of the Republic has been, in some respect, “rigged.” As Jill Lepore wrote in The New Yorker last summer, How To Steal An Election :

Early American Presidential elections were not popular elections, not only because the vote was mainly restricted to white male property owners but also because delegates to the Electoral College were elected by state legislatures. The legislative caucus worked only as long as voters didn’t mind that they had virtually no role in electing the President, a situation that lasted for a while since, after all, most people living in the United States at the time were used to having a king. But a new generation of Americans objected to this arrangement, dubbing it “King Caucus.” “Under what authority did these men pretend to dictate their nominations?” one citizen asked in 1803. “Do we send members of Congress to cabal once every four years for president?” New states entering the union held conventions to draft state constitutions, in which they adopted more democratic arrangements. This put pressure on old states to revise their own constitutions. By 1824, eighteen out of twenty-four states were holding popular elections for delegates to the Electoral College. Between 1824 and 1828, the electorate grew from fewer than four hundred thousand people to 1.1 million. Men who had attended the constitutional convention in 1787 shook their gray-haired heads and warned that Americans had crowned a new monarch: “King Numbers.” That king still sits on his throne.



The rise of the primary was a triumph for Progressive reformers, who believed that primaries would make elections more accountable to the will of the people. That didn’t quite come to pass. Instead, primaries became part of the Jim Crow-era disenfranchisement of newer members of the electorate. …

The end of Reconstruction saw the rise of the secret ballot, which, by effectively introducing a literacy requirement, disenfranchised black men. If the Emancipation Proclamation ended the electoral advantage granted to Southern whites by the three-fifths clause, the secret ballot restored it. In Louisiana, black-voter registration dropped from 130,000 in 1898 to 5,300 in 1908 to 730 in 1910.

Lepore goes on:

The secret ballot is an institution that has acquired such an aura of sanctity that it is illegal in 17 or 18 states to take (or transmit) a photo of your own ballot taken with your own cellphone camera. Who knew it was inaugurated not out of idealistic motives but as a highly effective means of voter suppression?

Hint: if you paid more than occasional attention to what politics really is made up of, tactical finagling under the claim of idealism, this would come as not much of a surprise.

Tactical finagling over election practices to gain advantage is much more the rule rather than the exception. It’s rarely, if ever, really about “fairness.” “Fairness” is the lipstick applied to the pig. Politics is (mostly) about winning.

Progressives are voluble about “voter suppression.” I, too, detest voter suppression. Mencken, again: “Democracy is the theory that the common people know what they want, and deserve to get it good and hard.”

Progressives, meanwhile, are nearly mute on voter fraud. I had the great privilege of growing up near the fringes of one of the great small city Democratic machines of the last century. I thus was made privy to inner workings, which were (and presumably still are) an open secret.

Political machines, at least then, rather routinely stipulate that their District Attorney (an elected official) would be left secure in his job and allowed to prosecute real criminals… so long as he turned a blind eye to voter fraud. Instances of voter fraud, which were rather routine, typically were not investigated and rarely, if ever, prosecuted. I recall a story told me by one of the party Insiders about a conversation had with a Republican gubernatorial nominee who genially put the machine on notice that if elected he’d overlook a few hundred, but not a few thousand, phantom votes for his Democratic rival from the city’s river wards.

To which party does fraud mostly inure? Ballotpedia reports that nine of America’s 10 largest cities have Democratic mayors. Democratic mayors preside over 37 of our 50 largest cities. Surprise!

Memo to vote fraud Deniers: Get real. It’s not quite cricket but in the interest of speaking Truth to Power let’s pierce the miasma of sanctimony in which progressives enshroud themselves. Every one of the electoral “reforms” they are pushing and even enacting mainly benefits Democrats and left-of-center Democrats especially.

Felons voting? Check. Noncitizens voting? Check. Manipulating the decennial re-drawing of Congressional District boundaries? Check. Campaign finance law restrictions? Check. Open primaries? Check. Abolishing the electoral college? Check. Ranked voting? Check. Lowering the voting age? Check. All lean left.

Quelle coïncidence!

It takes a great deal more naïveté than I can muster to expect otherwise. Don’t look so shocked, shocked!, to find gambling going on in here. (Your winnings, sir.)

A progressive bumper sticker says “I’ll believe corporations are persons as soon as Texas executes one.” As for me, I’ll believe that progressives are operating in good faith as soon as they seriously put forth electoral “reform” proposals neutral in their effect. That said, the magnitude both of voter suppression and voter fraud is almost certainly far more modest than the overheated claims by their partisans.

Meanwhile, back here in the Real World, the anticipated crisis of legitimacy for the candidate elected is an imaginary hobgoblin. Elections always, to an extent, have been ""rigged."" Politics always, to an extent, will be rigged. There is simply no way of unrigging it. What a protest will signify is that the other team proved more adept at rigging it.

Democrats continue to attempt to delegitimize Trump's victory in part by ridiculously magnifying the influence of a minuscule racist faction and by featuring his louche statements while suppressing reference to their own team's louche conduct. As they have been doing right along.

The winner will claim a ""Mandate."" Of the 320 million in the United States around 219 million are eligible to vote, 146 million are registered to vote and 126 million voted in 2012. Obama received about 66 million of those votes. ""Mandate"" is a pretty strong word for the agenda of someone who received the vote of 20% of the population.

Much of the elite will play along with the claim of ""mandate"" for fear of spoiling the grand illusion that allows them to feast. The losing party will do everything in its power to thwart the agenda of the winner.

And the band plays on.

Take heart! Have confidence in one thing. Our politicians and officials will “keep the populace alarmed (and hence clamorous to be led to safety) by an endless series of hobgoblins, most of them imaginary.”

340,Benko,Ralph,modernghana,"I recently observed how the 2016 race reflects American conditions in the late 1970s — also stagnant — and how the political elites are echoing President Jimmy Carter’s feckless reaction in his notorious July 15, 1979 address to the nation in which he said, in part:

The threat is nearly invisible in ordinary ways. It is a crisis of confidence. It is a crisis that strikes at the very heart and soul and spirit of our national will. We can see this crisis in the growing doubt about the meaning of our own lives and in the loss of a unity of purpose for our nation. The erosion of our confidence in the future is threatening to destroy the social and the political fabric of America.

What’s really going on? The destruction of our social and political fabric derives from stagnation, not vice versa.

My Letter to the Left: the Gold Standard Will Restore Upward Mobility was an analysis of an important piece by Stan Sorscher inThe Huffington Post, itself headlined “ Inequality — “X” Marks the Spot — Dig Here .” Sorscher perceptively wrote:

The second message is the very abrupt transition from the post-war historic period to the current one. Something happened in the mid-70’s to de-couple wages from productivity gains. The third message is that workers’ wages – accounting for inflation and all the lower prices from cheap imported goods – would be double what they are now, if workers still took their share of gains in productivity.

Carter, confronting this, floundered.

Reagan, in an ad hoc way, fixed it.

That fix has unwound.

Malaise, “threatening to destroy the social and political fabric of America,” returns.

Our new president can confront the source of the stagnation: Bad Money.

One can well imagine how much better the political climate would be if workers’ wages — including yours and mine — were double what they are now. The Pursuit of Happiness would be going much better. We'd be a cheerful, not surly, nation.

Sorscher attributes the onset of stagnation to how our “moral, social, political and economic values changed in the mid-70’s.” This claim recalls the Japanese Imperial Navy submarine captain’s declaration that “the floggings will continue until the morale improves.”

The “values change” hypothesis is strangely reminiscent of, and just as wrong as, Jimmy Carter’s great “moral equivalent of war” MEOW. Let’s peek at the data.

The flat-lining of median family income and ensuing collapse in national morale closely correlates with the collapse of the Bretton Woods gold-exchange standard. Morale collapses from lack of opportunity rather than collapsing morale contracting opportunity. Jimmy Carter got it exactly backwards. Most of our contemporary elites get it backwards as well..

Trump would do well to call on Lewis Lehrman (whose eponymous Institute I once served professionally) and Steve Forbes for some great additional policy guidance to restore the American Dream, and call upon his advisory board member Judy Shelton ! Restoring equitable prosperity will make our political culture sweet again.

Tim Worstall recently observed here at Forbes.com:

Employment is determined by the combination of monetary and fiscal policy. … Thus it is the actions of the Federal Reserve combined with those of Congress which determines how many jobs there are in America. And nothing else.”

“And nothing else.”

Reagan — with a good (and strongly bipartisan) fiscal policy and a monetary policy much better than that of his predecessors fixed America’s stagnation. The ensuing job creation restored America’s morale, led to “morning in America,” and, not incidentally, led to a 49-state landslide re-election.

President Carter eerily alluded to the occult nature of the problem besetting America: “The threat is nearly invisible in ordinary ways.” It is as occult, which is to say invisible, today as it was in 1979.

Yes, invisible. Good monetary policy is as invisible as oxygen … and as crucial to the fires of industry.

Keynes presaged this view in 1919 when he wrote “There is no subtler, no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency. The process engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction, and does it in a manner which not one man in a million is able to diagnose.”

Keynes may have been paraphrasing Copernicus who wrote :

ALTHOUGH THERE ARE COUNTLESS MALADIES that are forever causing the decline of kingdoms, princedoms, and republics, the following four (in my judgment) are the most serious: civil discord, a high death rate, sterility of the soil, and the debasement of coinage. The first three are so obvious that everybody recognizes the damage they cause; but the fourth one, which has to do with money, is noticed by only a few very thoughtful people, since it does not operate all at once and at a single blow, but gradually overthrows governments, and in a hidden, insidious way.

If the new president does not grab this opportunity there yet remains a remaining source of hope. What I wrote here bears repeating:

Lucky for America, we have, in the Congress that “one man in a million” riding to our rescue with a proposed monetary commission. Actually, greatly against the odds, we have several: Rep. Kevin Brady (the monetary commission’s prime sponsor), Rep. Jeb Hensarling (Chair of the committee of jurisdiction, House Financial Services Committee), and Rep. Paul Ryan (Speaker). Together almost unheralded, they got this antidote to what is stifling American job creation passed last November. The Congressional Research Service summarizes it:

“This bill establishes the Centennial Monetary Commission to: examine how U.S. monetary policy since the creation of the Federal Reserve Board in 1913 has affected the performance of the U.S. economy in terms of output, employment, prices, and financial stability over time… and recommend a course for U.S. monetary policy going forward.” This excellent piece of legislation could finally smoke the snake out from the wood pile. It now sits in the World’s Greatest Deliberative Body, the United States Senate. It portends as crucial to restoring the American Dream. Its prime Senate sponsor, another “man in a million,” is no less than the Honorable John Cornyn, the #2 leader of the Senate and Senate Whip. Bonus: it is in the jurisdiction of the excellent Senate Banking Committee Chairman Richard Shelby. It emerged into plain view last month. So, thereby, did the pathway out of the no-jobs box canyon into which Washington has ridden America.

Every poll I have seen puts jobs and the economy at the top of the voters’ concerns. Smart voters!

Yes, it would be nice if the candidates had kept it classier. That said, we were ready to forgive President Clinton his scandalous private conduct because he delivered the goods: jobs, with financial security and reasonable affluence.

Our new president would do well to take up the invisible, crucial, and vote rich matter of Good Money. If he does not do so the action shifts to Capitol Hill, which, according to the US Constitution, is exactly where it belongs.

The poet William Blake wrote, in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell , ""Expect poison from the standing water."" To restore the goodness of America, to make America great again, end the stagnation by restoring good monetary policy, of which the classical gold standard repeatedly has proven itself the best.

As the ""second most conservative man in the world,"" according to a Washington Post Magazine humor columnist, I much prefer reading, and get most of my news from, publications of the left. Like The Huffington Post, Mother Jones, Rolling Stone, The New Yorker, and The Atlantic Monthly.



Why?

I already know what I think. Variety is the spice of life.

Reading writings from members of my own Tribe doesn't usually challenge my thinking. There are plenty of smart people on the left as well as on the right. I like to have my opinions challenged. Exposing myself to thoughtful counternarratives and counterarguments helps me gain a more complete perspective. It helps me compensate for my own blind spots.

Everyone has blind spots. I do. You do.

It is fascinating to discover what's inside them.

For the same reason I relish being part of livingroomconversations.org constituted by the wonderful MoveOn co-founder Joan Blades to bring people of differing viewpoints together to hear one another and celebrate varied creeds. I try to listen not to identify the blind spots of others but to help myself confront my own.

I prefer encountering opposing perspectives of a spirited rather than vicious nature. (I make an exception for the vitriolic but brilliant Matt Taibbi from The Rolling Stone. His wit is so keen and his insults so over-the-top that he regularly offers a tour de force.)

That said, the opportunities to learn have grown fewer and harder since the left entered Tizzyworld with the election of Donald Trump. The declarations mostly have descended into tedious, apocalyptic, dogma.

The examples are ubiquitous but consider, as exemplary, The Rolling Stone's recent Meet President Trump's Cabinet of Horrors. This, of course, is hyperbole. Most unhelpful.

The ambience of apocalyptic declarations brings to my mind an admonition from the great classical liberal Saul Alinsky, whose Center I am honored to serve as president. Alinsky wrote in Rules for Radicals:

""I detest and fear dogma. I know that all revolutions must have ideologies to spur them on. That in the heat of conflict these ideologies tend to be smelted into rigid dogmas claiming exclusive possession of the truth, and the keys to paradise, is tragic. Dogma is the enemy of human freedom. Dogma must be watched for and apprehended at every turn and twist of the revolutionary movement. The human spirit glows from that small inner light of doubt whether we are right, while those who believe with complete certainty that they possess the right are dark inside and darken the world outside with cruelty, pain, and injustice. Those who enshrine the poor or Have-Nots are as guilty as other dogmatists and just as dangerous. To diminish the danger that ideology will deteriorate into dogma, and to protect the free, open, questing, and creative mind of man, as well as to allow for change, no ideology should be more specific than that of America's founding fathers: 'For the general welfare.'""

Would I prefer less stray voltage from the president-elect's Twitter account? Mostly, yes.

That said, tweets are trivial (except when amplified by the media). And while Hillary Clinton won the popularity contest America elected Donald Trump president. Continued efforts to delegitimize that status by attacks on his character and that of his appointees and on the integrity of the voting process only serve to paralyze the national conversation.

Spirited opposition to policies is legitimate. A ""loyal opposition"" is a vital part of the warp-and-woof of a republic.

Delegitimizing the electoral process and the man? Not so much.

Republican victories at the federal level are not, as generally portrayed by the left, an anomaly. As I have elsewhere written, in addition to the winning the presidency and keeping House and Senate majorities:

At the state level, there now will be 33 Republican state governors, the most since 1922. Republicans control ""more than twice as many legislative chambers at 68 than Democrats, who hold 30, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures."" In other words, where actual elections are involved the left is getting itself creamed.

The voters' demonstrated massive, across-the-board, preference for Republicans over Democrats. This might give those who extol democracy cause to ponder. It's deeply unfair to scapegoat Hillary Clinton or blame it on the Russians.

If one extols democracy -- something loudly declared by the left -- how can one casually condemn the wholesale, across-the-board, verdict of the voters at every level of government? To do so is simply anti-democratic.

Could be a teachable moment.

I seek to and intend to continue to learn from the left. It's more difficult for me -- and others -- to do so when the left's insights, such as the importance of social justice, are wrapped in sugar-coated Satan sandwiches of invective (mercifully absent from Living Room Conversations).

I, and probably you, have taken a Pledge: the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America. It concludes with a commitment to ""liberty and justice for all."" I take to heart my commitment to do a better job of delivering ""justice for all."" Others might find that a reminder of their own commitment to ""liberty for all"" -- even from figures they may find baffling, like Donald Trump -- might provide unexpectedly delightful rewards.

Alinsky: ""The human spirit glows from that small inner light of doubt whether we are right, while those who believe with complete certainty that they possess the right are dark inside and darken the world outside with cruelty, pain, and injustice.""

Let us not darken the world outside with cruelty, pain, and injustice. Let us let the human spirit glow from that small inner light of doubt. It's a light best found by recognizing, and confronting, our own blind spots.",2,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/living-room-conversations/harder-since-the-left-ent_b_13882582.html

The 2016 presidential campaign confirms what Marx wrote : “all the events and personalities of great importance in world history occur, as it were, twice… the first time as tragedy, the second as farce.” Karl, not Groucho, Marx.

We enter the realm of farce. It’s the economy, Stupid!

We are experiencing a reprise of the political paralysis of the 1970s, stagnation replacing stagflation. Jimmy Carter tackled the malaise in widely noted speech on July 15, 1979. This was later derided as his great MEOW (“Moral Equivalent Of War”):

The threat is nearly invisible in ordinary ways. It is a crisis of confidence. It is a crisis that strikes at the very heart and soul and spirit of our national will. We can see this crisis in the growing doubt about the meaning of our own lives and in the loss of a unity of purpose for our nation.

The erosion of our confidence in the future is threatening to destroy the social and the political fabric of America.

The confidence that we have always had as a people is not simply some romantic dream or a proverb in a dusty book that we read just on the Fourth of July.

…

The symptoms of this crisis of the American spirit are all around us. For the first time in the history of our country a majority of our people believe that the next five years will be worse than the past five years. Two-thirds of our people do not even vote. The productivity of American workers is actually dropping, and the willingness of Americans to save for the future has fallen below that of all other people in the Western world.

As you know, there is a growing disrespect for government and for churches and for schools, the news media, and other institutions. This is not a message of happiness or reassurance, but it is the truth and it is a warning.

Carter then discredited himself with a series of utterly feckless measures. None worked.

The farce is not funny. It’s cringeworthy how the national elites can be so oblivious to the obvious. The political and economic elites are just not grasping that economic stagnation, painfully obvious to the voters, is at the root of our political woes.

David Leonhardt, in The New York Times, gets it. He does an extraordinary great job of recognizing and framing the “central challenge of our time” in his debut column A Great Fight For Our Times :

When progress is the norm, it feeds on itself. People can trust that their own sacrifices will usually pay off. They can endure hard times without becoming cynical and can be generous toward others.

Now, imagine a different reality: one in which your family — or whole community — had known scant progress for decades.

You couldn’t tell stories of upward mobility, because they wouldn’t be true. Instead, you would be frustrated, about hard work gone unrewarded, and anxious, for your future and your children.

Such stagnation is the reality for much of the country’s population — roughly one third by many measures, closer to half by others. Some of the statistics are familiar. But as a group, they’re chilling.

The typical household, amazingly, has a net worth 14 percent lower than the typical one did in 1984, according to a forthcoming Russell Sage Foundation publication. The life-expectancy gap between the affluent and everyone else is growing . The number of children living with only one parent or none has doubled since the 1970s (to 30 percent). The obesity rate has nearly tripled (to 38 percent). About eight million people have spent time behind bars at some point in their life, up from 1.5 million 40 years ago. While college enrollment has grown, the norm for middle-class and poor students is to leave without a four-year degree.

This column is my first for the Op-Ed page, which is why I’m devoting it to the great American stagnation. That stagnation is a central challenge of our time.

And we don’t feel nearly enough urgency about it.

Of course I disagree with Leonhardt’s call for raising taxes — by which presumably he means tax rates — on the upper middle class and the wealthy as part of the remedy for stagnation. History — from JFK to Reagan to Bill Clinton -- shows how cutting tax rates is a key, although not only, piece of the recipe for resolving stagnation. The other key is good monetary policy.

David? Read Kudlow and Domitrovic’s new best seller, JFK and the Reagan Revolution: A Secret History of American Prosperity , on just that matter. Nevertheless Leonhardt is exceptional in getting the issue, its ramifications, and its key importance exactly right:

Yet even for [those with a rising standard of living], the stagnation looms over life. It breeds political dysfunction, and it helps explain why so many Americans aren’t swayed by facts. When you have been struggling for decades, you tend to lose faith in society’s institutions and their sober-minded experts.

I have some confidence that if the politicos just get the question right eventually — with a spirited argument conducted in good faith — the right answer will emerge. President Reagan’s 1986 tax reform cutting the top rate to 28% carried the Senate 97-3. Just now, however, both presidential nominees have taken their eye off the ball.

Hillary Clinton, something of a social justice warrior, broke left. She proposed whopping tax increases. She took a daft position on monetary policy, “The Fed Can Do No Wrong"" and is above criticism other than her demand for more socioeconomic and ethnic diversity on the governing boards of the regional Federal Reserve banks. Neither stand would help the economy get back to its historically higher growth levels, the kind facilitated by President Clinton 1.0. That made him popular. Easy to love a politician who gives us twice as much prosperity than has either party for the past 16 years.

Donald Trump showed promise with a reformulated tax rate cut along the lines of the new Ryan-Brady tax plan . Trump allowed his original sketch of a tax plan to be refined by Supply-Side stalwarts Arthur Laffer, Larry Kudlow and Steve Moore. Trump also showed he might put monetary policy into play by the proxy of criticizing the Fed and even hinted, twice, at favoring the best monetary policy of them all, the gold standard. Then Trump pivoted to promoting his economically most problematic planks: walls — whether physical or tariff — deportations, and punitive treatment of companies exporting jobs. Corporations are expatriating because Uncle Sam is ruining America’s business climate. Fix that and jobs will flood back into the United States.

Meanwhile it’s puzzling. Both candidates promoted, with different emphases, the American Dream of prosperity and economic justice for all. Yet neither are really owning it.

The real enemy is neither the left nor the right. It’s not Democrats or Republicans. It's stagnation. Too many political leaders, of both parties, have a blind spot as to a credible cure.

How to resolve the stagnation and restore the American Dream?

Stay tuned.

To paraphrase the opening line of Atlas Shrugged, the mainstream media remains on a manic quest to define the incoming president. It once again goes off the rails.

The Washington Post recently featured a long article by James Hohmann trying and failing to make the case that Ayn Rand-acolyte Donald Trump stacks his cabinet with fellow objectivists. The usually incisive Jonathan Chait, at New York Magazine, tells us How Ayn Rand's Theories Destroyed 'Never Trump' Conservatism.",2,http://www1.realclearmarkets.com/2016/12/19/ayn_rand039s_ghost_doesn039t_haunt_trump_administration_200437.html
345,Benko,Ralph,modernghana,"In my previous column I observed here how the 2016 race reflects American conditions in the late 1970s — also stagnant — and how the political elites are echoing President Jimmy Carter’s feckless reaction in his notorious July 15, 1979 address to the nation in which he said, in part:

The threat is nearly invisible in ordinary ways. It is a crisis of confidence. It is a crisis that strikes at the very heart and soul and spirit of our national will. We can see this crisis in the growing doubt about the meaning of our own lives and in the loss of a unity of purpose for our nation.

The erosion of our confidence in the future is threatening to destroy the social and the political fabric of America.

What’s really going on? The destruction of our social and political fabric derives from stagnation, not vice versa.

My Letter to the Left: the Gold Standard Will Restore Upward Mobility was an analysis of an important piece by Stan Sorscher in The Huffington Post, itself headlined “Inequality — “X” Marks the Spot — Dig Here.” Sorscher perceptively wrote:

The second message is the very abrupt transition from the post-war historic period to the current one. Something happened in the mid-70’s to de-couple wages from productivity gains. The third message is that workers’ wages – accounting for inflation and all the lower prices from cheap imported goods – would be double what they are now, if workers still took their share of gains in productivity.

Carter, confronting this, floundered.

Reagan, in an ad hoc way, fixed it.

That fix has unwound.

Malaise, “threatening to destroy the social and political fabric of America,” returns.

The president-elect can confront the source of the stagnation: Bad Money. One can well imagine how much better the political climate would be if workers’ wages — including yours and mine — were double what they are now. The Pursuit of Happiness would be going much better. We'd be a cheerful, not surly, nation.

Sorscher attributes the onset of stagnation to how our “moral, social, political and economic values changed in the mid-70’s.” This claim recalls the Japanese Imperial Navy submarine captain’s declaration that “the floggings will continue until the morale improves.”

The “values change” hypothesis is strangely reminiscent of, and just as wrong as, Jimmy Carter’s great “moral equivalent of war” MEOW. Let’s peek at the data.

The flat-lining of median family income and ensuing collapse in national morale closely correlates with the collapse of the Bretton Woods gold-exchange standard. Morale collapses from lack of opportunity rather than collapsing morale contracting opportunity. Jimmy Carter got it exactly backwards. Most of our contemporary elites get it backwards as well.

Mr. Trump would do well to call on Lewis Lehrman (whose eponymous Institute I once served professionally) and Steve Forbes for some great additional policy guidance to restore the American Dream. Mr. Trump, call upon your advisory board member Judy Shelton! Restoring equitable prosperity will make our political culture sweet again.

Tim Worstall recently observed here at Forbes.com:

Employment is determined by the combination of monetary and fiscal policy. … Thus it is the actions of the Federal Reserve combined with those of Congress which determines how many jobs there are in America. And nothing else.”

“And nothing else.”

Reagan — with a good (and strongly bipartisan) fiscal policy and a monetary policy much better than that of his predecessors fixed America’s stagnation. The ensuing job creation restored America’s morale, led to “morning in America,” and, not incidentally, led to a 49-state landslide re-election.

President Carter eerily alluded to the occult nature of the problem besetting America: “The threat is nearly invisible in ordinary ways.” It is as occult, which is to say invisible, today as it was in 1979.

Yes, invisible. Good monetary policy is as invisible as oxygen … and as crucial to the fires of industry.

Keynes presaged this view in 1919 when he wrote “There is no subtler, no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency. The process engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction, and does it in a manner which not one man in a million is able to diagnose.”

Keynes may have been paraphrasing Copernicus who wrote:

ALTHOUGH THERE ARE COUNTLESS MALADIES that are forever causing the decline of kingdoms, princedoms, and republics, the following four (in my judgment) are the most serious: civil discord, a high death rate, sterility of the soil, and the debasement of coinage. The first three are so obvious that everybody recognizes the damage they cause; but the fourth one, which has to do with money, is noticed by only a few very thoughtful people, since it does not operate all at once and at a single blow, but gradually overthrows governments, and in a hidden, insidious way.

What I wrote here a little while ago bears repeating:

Lucky for America, we have, in the Congress that “one man in a million” riding to our rescue with a proposed monetary commission. Actually, greatly against the odds, we have several: Rep. Kevin Brady (the monetary commission’s prime sponsor), Rep. Jeb Hensarling (Chair of the committee of jurisdiction, House Financial Services Committee), and Rep. Paul Ryan (Speaker). Together almost unheralded, they got this antidote to what is stifling American job creation passed last November. The Congressional Research Service summarizes it:

“This bill establishes the Centennial Monetary Commission to: examine how U.S. monetary policy since the creation of the Federal Reserve Board in 1913 has affected the performance of the U.S. economy in terms of output, employment, prices, and financial stability over time… and recommend a course for U.S. monetary policy going forward.” This excellent piece of legislation could finally smoke the snake out from the wood pile. It now sits in the World’s Greatest Deliberative Body, the United States Senate. It portends as crucial to restoring the American Dream. Its prime Senate sponsor, another “man in a million,” is no less than the Honorable John Cornyn, the #2 leader of the Senate and Senate Whip. Bonus: it is in the jurisdiction of the excellent Senate Banking Committee Chairman Richard Shelby. It emerged into plain view last month. So, thereby, did the pathway out of the no-jobs box canyon into which Washington has ridden America.

Every poll I have seen puts jobs and the economy at the top of the voters’ concerns. Smart voters! Yes, it would be nice if the candidates kept it classy. That said, we were ready to forgive President Clinton his scandalous private conduct because he delivered the goods: jobs, with financial security and reasonable affluence.

What we voters really wanted to know is: Who has the better grasp on exactly how to restore the American Dream of Prosperity and Justice For All? Our presidential nominees would do well to take up the invisible, crucial, and vote rich matter of Good Money. If they do not do so the action shifts to Capitol Hill, which, according to the US Constitution, is exactly where it belongs.

The poet William Blake wrote, in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, ""Expect poison from the standing water."" To restore the goodness of America and to make America great again, end the stagnation by restoring good monetary policy, of which the classical gold standard repeatedly has proven itself the best.",2,https://www.modernghana.com/news/742315/mr-trump-heed-the-lesson-jimmy-carter-never-learned.html

Marx wrote : “all the events and personalities of great importance in world history occur, as it were, twice… the first time as tragedy, the second as farce.” Karl, not Groucho, Marx.

We entered the realm of farce.

The voters rejected that.

We are experiencing a reprise of the political paralysis of the 1970s, stagnation replacing stagflation. Jimmy Carter tackled the malaise in widely noted speech on July 15, 1979. This was later derided as his great MEOW (“Moral Equivalent Of War”):

The threat is nearly invisible in ordinary ways. It is a crisis of confidence. It is a crisis that strikes at the very heart and soul and spirit of our national will. We can see this crisis in the growing doubt about the meaning of our own lives and in the loss of a unity of purpose for our nation. The erosion of our confidence in the future is threatening to destroy the social and the political fabric of America. The confidence that we have always had as a people is not simply some romantic dream or a proverb in a dusty book that we read just on the Fourth of July. …

The symptoms of this crisis of the American spirit are all around us. For the first time in the history of our country a majority of our people believe that the next five years will be worse than the past five years. Two-thirds of our people do not even vote. The productivity of American workers is actually dropping, and the willingness of Americans to save for the future has fallen below that of all other people in the Western world. As you know, there is a growing disrespect for government and for churches and for schools, the news media, and other institutions. This is not a message of happiness or reassurance, but it is the truth and it is a warning.

Carter then discredited himself with a series of utterly feckless measures. None worked.

The farce is not funny. It’s cringeworthy how the national elites can be so oblivious to the obvious. The political and economic elites are just not grasping that economic stagnation, painfully obvious to the voters, is at the root of our political woes.

David Leonhardt, in The New York Times, gets it. He does an extraordinary great job of recognizing and framing the “central challenge of our time” in his debut column A Great Fight For Our Times :

When progress is the norm, it feeds on itself. People can trust that their own sacrifices will usually pay off. They can endure hard times without becoming cynical and can be generous toward others. Now, imagine a different reality: one in which your family — or whole community — had known scant progress for decades. You couldn’t tell stories of upward mobility, because they wouldn’t be true. Instead, you would be frustrated, about hard work gone unrewarded, and anxious, for your future and your children. Such stagnation is the reality for much of the country’s population — roughly one third by many measures, closer to half by others. Some of the statistics are familiar. But as a group, they’re chilling. The typical household, amazingly, has a net worth 14 percent lower than the typical one did in 1984, according to a forthcoming Russell Sage Foundation publication. The life-expectancy gap between the affluent and everyone else is growing . The number of children living with only one parent or none has doubled since the 1970s (to 30 percent). The obesity rate has nearly tripled (to 38 percent). About eight million people have spent time behind bars at some point in their life, up from 1.5 million 40 years ago. While college enrollment has grown, the norm for middle-class and poor students is to leave without a four-year degree. This column is my first for the Op-Ed page, which is why I’m devoting it to the great American stagnation. That stagnation is a central challenge of our time. And we don’t feel nearly enough urgency about it.

Of course I disagree with Leonhardt’s call for raising taxes — by which presumably he means tax rates — on the upper middle class and the wealthy as part of the remedy for stagnation. History — from JFK to Reagan to Bill Clinton -- shows how cutting tax rates is a key, although not only, piece of the recipe for resolving stagnation. The other key is good monetary policy.

Read Kudlow and Domitrovic’s new best seller, JFK and the Reagan Revolution: A Secret History of American Prosperity , on just that matter. Nevertheless Leonhardt is exceptional in getting the issue, its ramifications, and its key importance exactly right:

Yet even for [those with a rising standard of living], the stagnation looms over life. It breeds political dysfunction, and it helps explain why so many Americans aren’t swayed by facts. When you have been struggling for decades, you tend to lose faith in society’s institutions and their sober-minded experts.

I have some confidence that if the politicos just get the question right eventually — with a spirited argument conducted in good faith — the right answer will emerge. President Reagan’s 1986 tax reform cutting the top rate to 28% carried the Senate 97-3.

Hillary Clinton, something of a social justice warrior, is breaking left. She is proposing whopping tax increases. She has taken a daft position on monetary policy, “The Fed Can Do No Wrong"" and is above criticism other than her demand for more socioeconomic and ethnic diversity on the governing boards of the regional Federal Reserve banks.

Neither stand would help the economy get back to its historically higher growth levels, the kind facilitated by President Clinton 1.0. That made him popular. Easy to love a politician who gives us twice as much prosperity than has either party for the past 16 years.

Donald Trump shows better promise with a reformulated tax rate cut along the lines of the new Ryan-Brady tax plan . Trump allowed his original sketch of a tax plan to be refined by Supply-Side stalwarts Arthur Laffer, Larry Kudlow and Steve Moore. Trump also showed he might put monetary policy into play by the proxy of criticizing the Fed and even hinted, twice, at favoring the best monetary policy of them all, the gold standard. He won.

The real enemy is neither the left nor the right.

It’s not Democrats or Republicans.

It's stagnation.

The Millennial Vote was treated like a Magical Unicorn in the 2016 election. It is seen as something valuable and mysterious. As Dan Schwabel, at Quartz, in a piece modestly entitled The complete guide to winning the millennial vote this election recently noted:

As we head into November’s US elections, all candidates are vying for the millennial vote—and for good reason. Millennials are ... a critical bloc for any campaign. 69.2 million are now eligible to vote, which is more than double compared to the past decade. When added together with Gen-X voters, 2016 represents the first time young people have displaced the Baby Boomer vote. At the same time, millennials are historically less likely to vote than their older peers, with only around half having voted in the last presidential election. Knowing this, there’s no question that all political parties will be pushing hard to get them to the voting booths this fall.

I, too, covet the kids’ allegiance. Yet I – an aging Boomer – confess to finding the Millennials mystifying. I am the father and co-owner of three of them (plus one Gen Xer). I know more than a few others. They’re Everywhere, and deeply enigmatic.

Yet I have a theory that could provide the key to resolving their riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma. They have not yet found, but absolutely must conceive and declare, their own Narrative.

Take note. Making this strong demand of them would be an act of tough love. It could pay huge dividends.

A quick glance at the new generation gap. Betraying just how old a fogey I am, let me recount a bit of conversation from a few years ago with a lovely Young Fogey Millennial, discussing a column of mine in the long lost ParcBench.com. It was about how the Beatles, the Who, and the Rolling Stones (through, respectively, Revolution , Won’t Get Fooled Again , and Sympathy for the Devil ) stopped an impending communist takeover of America and the West. Let's add Buffalo Springfield’s For What It’s Worth .

The Young Fogey’s response stopped me cold: “That’s really interesting. I’ve heard of the Beatles.” So who am I to judge? And yet….

The sociologists and pollsters obsessively study these magical unicorns with something like the ardor of an anthropologist encountering a newly discovered tribe in the Amazon basin. Their earnest scholasticism is interesting but does not resolve the enigma. Schwabel summarizes some of the pollsters’ observations:

The World Economic Forum’s annual Global Shapers survey found the top five most concerning world issues for young people are climate change, large-scale conflicts, religious conflicts, poverty, and government accountability. … Socioeconomic wellbeing is also important, as 20% of millennials are living in poverty , many whom are unemployed, underemployed, or have even given up on finding a job. These young voters want politicians to close the poverty gap and regulate student loans so that they aren’t poor and in debt. The same Harvard poll found that millennials feel the division between rich and poor is worse than before they were born. Finally, they want the government to be more transparent and less corrupt. …

After the recession and the following bailouts, they became more suspicious of politicians, and they have to work harder to earn their trust back. A mere one in every four millennials says they can trust the government always or most of the time.

Sounds true. Yet as Winston Churchill purportedly once demanded of a waiter , “Take away this pudding, it has no theme.” The poll results, similarly do not reveal a theme.

Every generation needs to write its own story. We Boomers were great at generating drama, manufacturing meaning for our lives, and achieving glory. Time for the Millennials to step up and top us.

A few years ago, a group of collegiate Millennials came to interview me. They had the usual surly attitude toward us Boomers. We had, they seemed to believe, Ruined Everything. I told them point blank, to their astonishment, that they were dead wrong about us. We Boomers have a great track record and are weary and waiting for them to step up, wrest power from us, and use it for Good. They were astounded.

The Boomers inaugurated an imperfect but amazingly successful worldwide epoch of world peace, human dignity and equitable prosperity. Bringing this about took many pitched battles with “The Establishment.” Our victories, many hard fought, fulfilled our human hunger for drama and for glory. Now it's the job of the Millennials to bring it home.

Peace: Our generation won the Cold War. One of the outcomes? The number of nuclear weapons in the world has dropped from something like 60,000 in 1985 to about 3,000, deployed, today . That’s a really big deal.

There is, of course, more to be done. Former Secretary of Defense William Perry now heroically and shrewdly calls upon America to scrap the most dangerous element of the nuclear weapons triad, ICBMs. Taking the threat of nuclear war down another big notch would be a great Cause for the Millennials to take up.

Come on kids, time to step up to the plate. The Pentagon still needs some exorcising.

Despair is not a strategy. Step up!

Dignity: In winning the Cold War we took down communist totalitarianism over most of the world, replacing it, imperfectly but impressively, with classical liberal republican governance. Elsewhere, we softened totalitarianism to authoritarianism. That’s an amazing triumph for human dignity.

There is, of course, more to be done. The eradication of racial discrimination is a moral imperative. And ending racial bigotry, while justifiably the cause célèbre, is not the only bigotry to fight. One of the polls cited by Schwabel identifies religious liberty as a big Millennial value. Add in opposition religious bigotry.

Come on kids, time to step up to the plate. How about making George Washington’s declaration “to bigotry no sanction” a rallying cry?

Despair is not a strategy. Step up!

Prosperity: The Boomers placed the world on course to nearly end abject poverty . We achieved this, startlingly, not through government aid but through policies of market-driven economic growth.

There is, of course, more to be done. Environmental degradation as a side effect is a serious problem. Solve it. How? Worried about Climate Change? Think it’s induced by CO2? We Boomers used market-driven innovation to drive down the cost of emission-free energy -- solar, wind, and the attendant storage devices needed for intermittent power -- by, in some cases, 99%.

Emission-free energy will soon be cheaper than fossil fuels. Bonus: No CO2!

Come on kids, step up to the plate. Cleaning up the land, air and oceans, and accelerating the development and adoption of cheap, emission-free energy, are great Causes.

Despair is not a strategy. Step up!

Given the epic, almost mythic, successes of us Boomers, how can the Millennials hope to compete? What Story will they ride to Glory?

Millennials could undo the wreckage of the classical liberal republican order wrought by well-meaning progressives. This path has been meticulously charted by public intellectual Jonathan Rauch. Our crumbling national physical infrastructure is just a shadow on the cave wall cast by our degraded political infrastructure. Great Cause.

Millennials of a more militant stripe can lead the fight against the Cultural Revolution that is attempting to create an undifferentiated, dangerously romantic utopian, cultural hegemony. Great Cause. Those of a more nurturing stripe can undertake to commence a secular project to reweave the social fabric . Great Cause.

The most obvious and compelling Cause might be to inaugurate a true golden age of equitable prosperity. Call it “Restoring the American Dream of Prosperity and Justice For All.” The parties have become ridiculously polarized, Republicans for Prosperity and Democrats for Justice. These are not mutually exclusive. We need both and actually know how to get both ... once we stop using the American Dream as a political football.

The System has blindly stumbled into a Little Dark Age, 16 years of economic stagnation. This is almost certainly due to bad monetary policy, which since about the turn of the millennium has caused GDP to grow at only half its historical trend. Compounded, that has cut our wages and wealth, and the national GDP, by about a third from where it should be. This tsunami of poverty has hit Millennials especially hard.

The American Dream — prosperity conjoined with economic justice — has slipped into a long coma. Restore good job growth and equitable prosperity by restoring the classical gold standard. Millennials can double the rate of real GDP growth, generating great jobs, gaining the means to pay off those onerous student loans, and get on with prospering. Great cause.

There are many potential Great Causes beckoning. We Boomers, however, are worn out.

So far, though: Crickets. Step up!

Demanding that the Millennials step up looks like the solution of the enigma and the means to earn their allegiance and votes. A presidential candidate who publicly applies this tough love lesson to the Millennials will inspire a massive constituency and earn many votes.

Berkeley Professor Emerita Arlie Russell Hochschild ’s newly published Strangers In Their Own Land: Anger And Mourning On The American Right is an important book and a delight. It’s a sociological – almost anthropological – foray into the minds, hearts, and lives of the Tea Party — my own Tribe. Prof. Hochschild’s jacket biography describes her as “one of the most influential sociologists of her generation.” I’m probably the first right winger to review it.

A long time ago – 2010, a past epoch – the Washington Post invited me to represent the Tea Party in an online Q&A. I had been the co-emcee of the July 4, 2009 Boston Tea Party rally in Boston Common. The Tea Party was, then, a rising force – about to wrest control of the Congress from the progressive Democrats. The online Q&A made me feel like an alien who had just landed in a flying saucer on the national mall to be confronted by curious, hostile Earthlings.

At the start of the Q&A I revealed how the City of Boston had slow walked the 2009 permits. I told the Washington Post‘s Q&A how I reached out to Sen. Ted Kennedy’s office for help. The permits appeared, miraculously, within hours. Sen. Kennedy was a true liberal, cherishing freedom of assembly and speech even by those with whom he disagreed.

My praise for Sen. Kennedy notwithstanding most of the Washington Post‘s readers still treated me as an alien belligerent.

The Tea Party, now, is but a shadow of its former self. Perhaps it has in part morphed, as suggested by Prof. Hochschild, into the Trump Campaign. I give Prof. Hochschild, a progressive Berkeley academic, enormous credit for going over what she aptly calls the “empathy wall” to investigate what she calls “The Great Paradox.” The Great Paradox has been fairly paraphrased by at least two prominent reviewers as “Why is hatred of government most intense among people who need government services most?”

Spoiler alert: most Tea Partiers feel that we need good jobs, not government services, most. And it is our view that the federal government has spent 16 years ineptly stifling job growth and betraying our trust in many other ways. More on this later.

Prof. Hochschild lit out for Louisiana to encounter some of us up close and personal. What she calls her “keyhole issue” into the paradox is that the people of Louisiana, very devoted to the land, are hostile to federal intervention against pollution and industrial practices destroying their land and water and way of life. I am as appalled as she at the record of the former government’s big tax giveaways to Big Petro, throttling of essential government services, and ignoring the environmental degradation.

Thanks, in part, to the environmental degradation caused by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers -- a federal agency -- Louisiana reportedly has lost an area of its landmass the size of Delaware. That's yet another source of our sometimes inchoate mistrust of government.

There are no paradoxes in nature. A paradox always means that there is some deficiency in our perspective. As Niels Bohr once said “How wonderful that we have met with a paradox. Now we have some hope of making progress.” So I give Professor Hochschild enormous credit for tackling her paradox. Now we have some hope of making progress.

Prof. Hochschild yields many fascinating insights. I especially enjoyed her deep dive into what she calls our “Deep Story.” That said, one senses that she herself is not quite satisfied that she has resolved the paradox even to her own satisfaction. It is my pleasure here to point out the several keys which she inventoried but did not turn in the lock. Time to resolve the Great Paradox.

It’s really difficult, even undertaking meticulous field and abundant scholarly research, to appreciate someone else’s narrative. It’s even difficult for insiders to see and convey it. I have spent many years pondering our Deep Story from the inside.

Three keys to resolving the Great Paradox:

The Great Paradox is slightly misstated. We don’t need government assistance. We need jobs. Good jobs provide both prosperity and dignity. For technical reasons good jobs cannot be provided in mass by the government civil service. Poor economic growth over the past 16 years has caused a sense of near desperation among the rank-and-file. It is the dwindling of such job growth, and with it the possibility of playing by the rules and getting a piece of the American Dream, that fuels resentment of others such as immigrants. Such resentment is inevitable in a zero sum game. Tea Partiers sense, as supply-siders like me have repeatedly declaimed, that a bad government policy mix is the perp behind job stagnation. No wonder we are somewhere between skeptical of and hostile to our pretentious government. Poor, sometimes catastrophic, performance by the government, especially regulators at all levels, municipal, state, and federal, has forfeited our trust in the government’s competence and even good faith. The plenary extent of the failure signals that while the diagnosis is right the remedy is defective. The vast regulatory state has failed. The prescription of More Regulatory State leaves us, at best, incredulous. There are legitimate other ways to make business — the only possible source of great jobs — keep the environment pristine. The first line of Edgar Allen Poe’s Cask of Amontillodostates our mood to perfection: “THE thousand injuries of Fortunato I had borne as I best could, but when he ventured upon insult I vowed revenge.” We have been remarkably patient with the injuries Big Government in Cahoots with Big Business inflicted on us. Insult, however, is intolerable.

Prof. Hochschild picks up and displays each key but she does not turn them in the lock.

As to the first key, as she observes, skilled workers employed in the oil industry and chemical plants can make $80,000/year. That is, as she points out, more than twice or three times as much as can be made in the agricultural, fishing, and tourist economy. That’s a huge differential.

I recall a column I once wrote some time ago for Global Times, the English language edition of the Beijing’s People’s Daily. One of the commentators, commenting on another comment, crisply observed, “Sounds like this was written by someone with a full belly.” If a person’s only real chance at economic security, and even modest affluence, derives from working for a petrochemical company it is unrealistic not to recognize that workers will develop a strong partisanship, even to the point of turning a blind eye to corporate misdeeds. It’s human nature.

As to the second key, Prof. Hochschild shares the left’s Deep Story as to the benevolence of government regulation. That belief remains unshaken notwithstanding her dramatic reports of repeated regulatory negligence, failure, and capture by the regulated industry. She reports, credibly, heartrending devastation of the environment and of health of workers and neighbors and of corporate abuse of the legal system to avoid paying meaningful damages for the damage from their emission of toxic chemicals into the environment. She documents repeated government failure at every level – local, state and federal – repeated government betrayal of innocent citizens. Such betrayals are by no means limited to Louisiana.

Her response? More regulation.

As Hemingway concludes The Sun Also Rises, “Isn’t it pretty to think so?”

Government benevolence is a dubious proposition. Environmental degradation was even worse in the Soviet Union. It is even worse in the People’s Republic of China. Having worked inside and close to the federal government for 30 years I know up close and personal that while policy sometimes correlates with good outcomes more often it represents symbolic gestures or represents good intentions that build a road to Hell. As Prof. Harold James, of Princeton, concluded in an important recent article in The American Interest , “Before offering up yet more technocratic fixes for what at base is not a technical problem, these folks need to get out more.”

This observation does not represent a counsel of despair. Nor does it countenance shilling for Big Business. Just, let’s get real. A corporation making a million dollars a day can afford lobbyists and lawyers and PR agencies with which to subvert the government. The rank-and-file have no such resources. It was ever thus.

Government officials, whether elected, appointed, or career civil service, are people just like us. Government is neither staffed nor inhabited by angelic creatures. Concentrating more power in the hands of officials and civil servants by no means promises benevolence. Benevolent dictatorships are only slightly less rare than unicorns.

What, then, to do? Robert Townsend, then president of Avis Rent-a-Car, wrote an iconic best seller, Up The Organization. In it he addressed the problem of runaway corporate policy and human resources manuals. These are cognate to government regulations, now running to the millions of words. Townsend: “If you have to have a policy manual, publish the Ten Commandments.”

Poisoning the habitat and imperiling the health of people is criminal and actionable to lawsuits. The rage of Tea Partiers may be inchoate but it is justified. My libertarian friends would be horrified by the failure to prosecute, both criminally and civilly, acts of force, fraud and coercion. Conservatives believe that more affluence will bring about political dynamics that will bring about cleaner air and cleaner water. This is part of our Deep Story and has a lot of historical evidence grounding it.

Regulations are almost inevitably spottily enforced due to the attendant expense and political blowback. Rather than imposing stifling regulations, better to impose prison time and stiff damages on malefactors. The law, rather than regulation, has a marvelous deterrent effect.

Corporate executives do not like to wear orange jumpsuits. Shareholders detest billion dollar damage judgments. The free market, you see, actually works if applied. That’s my Deep Story and I’m sticking to it.

There is another benefit of ending crimes against humanity and habitat by “publishing the Ten Commandments” – and enforcing by law, not regulation, those prohibiting murder, theft, and dishonesty. Doing it that way would speak directly into the Deep Story of most Tea Partiers whether religious or secular. These Commandments represent deep-seated norms of social justice cherished by conservatives as well as progressives.

As for the third key, it is not easy for progressives, who trend sanctimonious, to grasp how insulting we find what Prof. Harold James, in the same article above referenced , calls “massive condescension from the elite.” In this the elites are out of integrity with their own principles. One of the signature claims of progressives is to celebrate diversity, to oppose invidious discrimination of “out groups.”

President John F. Kennedy pioneered the federal government’s entry into championing equality with an Executive Order , signed on March 6, 1961, establishing The President’s Committee On Equal Employment Opportunity. He declared it to be the “plain and positive obligation of the United States Government to promote and ensure equal opportunity for all qualified persons, without regard to race, creed, color, or national origin….”

Bravo! But hold on a moment! Somewhere respect for “creed” seems to have dropped out of progressives’ Deep Story pantheon. Creed, according to the New Oxford American Dictionary, is defined as: “a set of beliefs or aims that guide someone’s actions….” That is its third definition. The first two are: “a system of Christian or other religious belief; a faith: people of many creeds and cultures, and … a formal statement of Christian beliefs, especially the Apostles’ Creed or the Nicene Creed.”

I know for a fact – I’ve done it – that a red meat Tea Partier like me can get along beautifully with members of the progressive elite no matter how puzzling they find me. My own creed holds “Capitalize with the capitalists but socialize with the socialists. They throw much better parties."" But now it has become an article of faith in the Progressive Creed that it is a virtue to discriminate against those with whose creeds they disagree. That’s really very ugly.

We Tea Partiers do not actually represent a threat. We want great jobs. We want effective rather than oppressive enforcement of environmental and worker safety laws. And we demand respect.

Strangers In Their Own Land: Anger And Mourning On The American Right is by far the best book by an outsider to the Tea Party I have ever encountered. It lays out in plain sight, although does not quite turn in the lock, the three keys to resolve the Great Paradox. Still, it makes a wonderful contribution to the national discourse. We Tea Partiers really are (mostly) as delightful as Prof. Hochschild reports. That said, our Deep Story — that of restoring America as the “Land of Opportunity” — is deeper than the one Prof. Hochschild has reported.

Do not fear us. And if there comes a day where the Earth stands still know that we come in peace. Back to my Washington Post2010 online Q&A as a member of the Tea Party to Washington, DC. It made me feel like Klaatu, the Michael Rennie, character emerging, surrounded by the U.S. Army, from his flying saucer on the national mall between the Washington monument and the Lincoln Memorial in the 1951 movie The Day The Earth Stood Still.

The Washington Post’s readers treated me as an alien. A stranger in my own land.

America is a land that used to be called The Land of Opportunity.

More than a few of my left-of-center friends have expressed anxiety to me about the possibility of street violence should Hillary Clinton win the 2016 election. If that happens Donald Trump certainly will then deride it as ""rigged."" That's a far cry from insurrection. Others have expressed fear of a perception of illegitimacy. That's not a well-founded fear either. Exhale.



My left-leaning friends are not afraid of the ordinary kind of street violence that has the Democratic- controlled Chicago with a body count this year, of, as of this writing, 630. They express worry about the possibility of politically motivated street violence ... like the bombings perpetrated, back in the 1960s by the (leftist) Weather Underground, the bank robberies, murders, and kidnapping perpetrated in the 1970s by the (leftist) Symbionese Liberation Army, or the shows of force by the (leftist) Black Panthers.

Exhale. Do not waste perfectly good anxiety on the wildly remote possibility of street violence being perpetrated by disappointed Trump Supporters. Trump's supporters have behaved, consistently, in civilized ways (except for a few who got carried away so as to ungallantly chant ""Lock Her Up"" at rallies now and then). Trump's supporters are overwhelmingly law-abiding. ""Law abiding"" is a big part of their narrative.

Populist is different from conservative. Many of the most influential conservative figures, both commentators and political leaders, have rejected or marginalized Trump. Collapsing the distinction just breeds confusion.

Progressives have a hard enough time understanding conservatives. They find it even more daunting to grasp the populist current being adeptly surfed by Donald Trump. Have a couple of Trump supporters over, open up a cold one, and have a living room conversation with them. They don't bite.

As to violence, provocative filmmaker James O'Keefe -- the right's Michael Moore -- has confessions on tape that lefties have been infiltrating Trump rallies to project or provoke violence. These videos caused a Democratic Operative to ""step back"" from Hillary's campaign. This sounds like a near-confession of guilt. That violence was not home grown.

The one firebombing of the campaign season has been the Molotov cocktail thrown through the window of a Republican local GOP field office with ""A swastika and 'Nazi Republicans get out of town or else' ... spray painted on the side of an adjacent building."" This didn't come from the GOP.

The imaginary hobgoblin of a violent uprising if Clinton is elected is part of the left's prevailing Narrative. There's no evidence supporting it. Exhale.

The number of virulently populist nativists (""racists, homophobic, misogynists"" etc. etc.) out there is teensy-tiny. So far this faction has proved all bark and no bite. It does not even have a particularly loud bark. Thank a myopic, drama-driven, and borderline hysterical media for amplifying them to spook you and keep your clicks coming!

The hatemonger flagship website, a one man show, according to Google Analytics has only about 30,000 regular visitors. That makes it, very roughly speaking, about 300X smaller than Moveon (and much less well organized). Life being short I've never gone there but one gets the impression that it's basically a space for a clique of malcontents to share bilious comments. Considerate of them to do so where the FBI easily can, and surely does, keep tabs!

Just for the record, no, Virginia, there is no ""alt-right."" The evidence shows this imaginary snipe mostly is Breitbart. Breitbart reportedly got an estimated 12.5 million monthly unique visitors by most recent count. Impressive, but to put it in proportion the Huffington Post reportedly got an estimated 110 million for the same period. Exhale.

Dear progressives, don't play into the hands of the virulent nativists. Around the year 2000 a community organizer named Ilana Dubester, then head of Hispanic Liaison of Siler City, North Carolina, destroyed David Duke ... by ignoring a rally he staged there. A city official later told me the story about how his mole in the Duke camp relayed how Duke, at the after-party, was fulminating against Ilana's having called all civil rights and ethnic groups to ignore his rally -- thereby taking the drama out of it.

Thereafter civil rights leaders basically ignored Duke and he collapsed. Duke's money came from his notoriety and his notoriety came from media coverage and media coverage came from the dramatic visuals of the controversy that he stoked. Ignoring him took the wind out of his sails. Duke is slightly back but he was a goner for a long time and now is a much diminished force. Let's keep it that way.

If you disapprove of the nativists don't feed them with drama. Saul Alinsky's first rule for radicals? Power is not only what you have, but what the enemy thinks you have. Imagining that your enemy has more power than he has gives your enemy more power than he has. Don't do it.

Some people are worried about a less virulent version of the same problem. If Clinton wins Trump is certain to denounce the election as ""rigged."" Would that withdraw legitimacy from the new president? Not really.

Progressives have been denouncing the electoral rules as ""rigged"" for some time. A recent edition of the New York Review of Books features an essay by David Cole entitled How Voting Rights Are Being Rigged, reviewing two books. Crying ""rigged!"" is not an outlier stance among progressives. If you are one of these do consult the real supreme law of the land -- the law of karma, or, in nice Judeo-Christian terms, ""as ye sow, so shall ye reap"" -- and dial it back.

More broadly, as I recently wrote at Forbes.com, ""Of the 320 million in the United States around 219 million are eligible to vote, 146 million are registered to vote and 126 million voted in 2012. Obama received about 66 million of those votes."" That's about 20% of the US population. That does not undermine legitimacy. Nor should it.

The 2016 loser presumably will receive less than 20%. That's a pretty small base. But wait, there's ... less! Most voters, by far, are casual, not ""until the last dog dies,"" voters. Should Clinton win there might be a single digit percentage of Americans who will go to their graves thinking that the election was rigged. Maybe two or three percent. Since politics consumes a relatively few Americans most of even these irredentists will, well, Censure Clinton and move on.

Having a few sore losers hardly threatens legitimacy. So exhale.

If you wish to find the spiritual lesson embedded in the mass hysteria currently besetting progressives take to heart Nietzsche's epigram 146 from Beyond Good and Evil: ""He who fights with monsters should be careful lest he thereby become a monster.""

Now exhale.",2,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/living-room-conversations/time-to-stop-worrying-abo_b_12786744.html

Last August, Washington Post Bigfoot Columnist David Ignatius published a deeply insightful column on how people either develop, or hold onto, their beliefs:

""Basically, the studies show that attempts to refute false information often backfire and lead people to hold on to their misperceptions even more strongly.

""This literature about misperception was lucidly summarized by Christopher Graves, the global chairman of Ogilvy Public Relations, in a February 2015 article in the Harvard Business Review, months before Trump surfaced as a candidate. Graves is now writing a book about his research at the Rockefeller Foundation's Bellagio Center in Italy.

""Graves's article examined the puzzle of why nearly one-third of U.S. parents believe that childhood vaccines cause autism, despite overwhelming medical evidence that there's no such link. In such cases, he noted, ""arguing the facts doesn't help -- in fact, it makes the situation worse."" The reason is that people tend to accept arguments that confirm their views and discount facts that challenge what they believe.

...

'Trying to correct misperceptions can actually reinforce them, according to a 2006 paper by Brendan Nyhan and Jason Reifler, also cited by Graves. They documented what they called a ""backfire effect"" by showing the persistence of the belief that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction in 2005 and 2006, after the United States had publicly admitted that they didn't exist. ""The results show that direct factual contradictions can actually strengthen ideologically grounded factual belief,"" they wrote.

""'Bottom line: Vilifying Trump voters ... won't convince them they're wrong. Probably it will have the opposite effect.""

This insight applies equally to the vilification of Hillary Clinton and her voters. An abundance of research shows that vilification is not just bad manners. It is also bad politics.

Back in its heyday MoveOn.org was the gold standard of Righteous Indignation, taking a courageous stand to ""censure Clinton and move on."" Then, after Clinton survived impeachment, MoveOn moved on to oppose the war on Iraq.

MoveOn stuck to the issues, always keeping it classy. Righteous Indignation is very different from, and far more powerful than, vilification. Eventually MoveOn prevailed.

There is abundant vitriol on both sides. Clinton recently called half of Trump's supporters a ""basket of deplorables"" - for which she later expressed half-hearted regret. Team Trump chronically calls Clinton ""crooked.""

This is simply bad politics. Ignatius: ""People are more likely to accept information if it's presented unemotionally, in graphs...."" The research Ignatius reports is consistent with the experience at the website AllSides.com, devoted to providing ""just the facts, ma'am"" and all sides of every issue.



This insight goes to the core of LivingRoomConversations.org which is founded on respectful mutual listening. If you could wish to change someone's mind one must start by listening to those with whom you disagree. (Trigger Warning: doing so might also change yours.)

Underneath all the name calling and so forth the 2016 presidential election is being fought out on real issues, vividly (and relatively clearly) presented on one primary and one secondary issue. As I wrote in Forbes.com recently,

""voters care about prosperity, peace, and who seems better able to protect their interests and their values.

""Above all, now, the voters care about the American Dream, composed of two elements: Prosperity and Economic Justice.

""Both are legitimate and essential.""

The candidates' respective positions are, outside the melodrama, well reported in the news and the voters are choosing accordingly. Nevertheless, the melodrama makes the headlines and according to FiveThirtyEight ""Clinton and Trump are both more strongly disliked than any nominee at this point in the past 10 presidential cycles.""

I am the only person I know who publicly proclaims that both Clinton and Trump are, despite their flaws, admirable. This, of course, annoys all my friends both left and right. With due apologies for annoying my friends ... I stand by my position.

The overwrought emotion that condemns both Clinton and Trump to Hell (by their various opposing factions) is nothing new. It has been part of the American Political Carnival going back to very early days. Partisans of two of our (now) most revered statesmen, John Adams and Thomas Jefferson did just this.

Mental Floss reminds us:

""Jefferson's camp accused President Adams of having a 'hideous hermaphroditical character, which has neither the force and firmness of a man, nor the gentleness and sensibility of a woman.' In return, Adams' men called Vice President Jefferson 'a mean-spirited, low-lived fellow, the son of a half-breed Indian squaw, sired by a Virginia mulatto father.' As the slurs piled on, Adams was labeled a fool, a hypocrite, a criminal, and a tyrant, while Jefferson was branded a weakling, an atheist, a libertine, and a coward.""

Badmouthing a political adversary is the rule, not the exception, in politics. It has never caused the system to break down. It won't cause a breakdown now. It's just politics.

But bottom line: badmouthing's just bad politics. Not because it is rude (which it is, but that's social not political). It is bad because ""Vilifying (your adversary's) voters ... won't convince them they're wrong. Probably it will have the opposite effect.""

Memo to those who yearn to defeat Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton.

(Yes, you.)

The threat is nearly invisible in ordinary ways. It is a crisis of confidence. It is a crisis that strikes at the very heart and soul and spirit of our national will. We can see this crisis in the growing doubt about the meaning of our own lives and in the loss of a unity of purpose for our nation.

361,Benko,Ralph,modernghana,"Too little noted, Protestant America has managed to nominate two Protestant candidates for president. As Clausewitz famously observed , “war is simply a continuation of political intercourse, with the addition of other means.” My corollary, from which most Americans might prefer to avert their eyes: “Politics is simply a continuation of religious intercourse, with the addition of other means.”

While almost ignored it is a telling and, perhaps, a defining aspect of the 2016 election. In his imperfect but authentic way, Donald Trump is reflecting certain of the Calvinist values underlying his beautiful Presbyterian faith. Hillary Clinton is reflecting, in her own imperfect but authentic way, the values of her beautiful Methodist faith.

Not being a Christian I have a slightly different perspective on the social and political forest, a view of the forest that is perhaps not so obscured by the trees. America has nominated two presidential candidates from a mainline, rather than nondenominational, Protestant faith tradition. One way to interpret this is that America is attempting to decide whether it wishes to define itself, culturally if not theologically, as more in line with Presbyterian or Methodist world views.

It is of some interest that America chose representatives of two of the smaller mainline Protestant denominations. Presbyterians claim 5,844,000 members, Methodists 5,473,000. By comparison, Baptists represent 38,662,000, Pentecostalists 13,673,000, and Lutherans 7,860,000 souls. That said per Wikipedia , “Theologically conservative critics accuse the mainline churches of ‘the substitution of leftist social action for Christian evangelizing, and the disappearance of biblical theology,’ and maintain that 'All the Mainline churches have become essentially the same church: their histories, their theologies, and even much of their practice lost to a uniform vision of social progress.’”

Tom Gjelten, of NPR, recently noted the sectarian factor in two important companion pieces: How Positive Thinking, Prosperity Gospel Define Donald Trump’s Faith Outlook and Clinton, Kaine Driven By Their Faith In The ‘Social Gospel’.

Gjelton gets Clinton somewhat better than Trump. On Clinton:

With that perspective, Clinton identified squarely with the “social gospel” of the Methodist tradition. It is an outlook encapsulated in the Methodist credo, widely attributed to the church founder, John Wesley: “Do all the good you can, by all the means you can, in all the ways you can, in all the places you can, at all the times you can, to all the people you can, as long as ever you can.”

His encapsulation of Trump, while on point, appears somewhat wobblier:

[Rev. Norman Vincent] Peale, who died in 1993, rarely talked about salvation. His message was more practical than theological. It echoes today in what’s known as the Prosperity Gospel, practiced by megachurch televangelists who favor spectacle and say God chooses to reward some people with material wealth.

This is not quite right. The “ Prosperity Gospel ” is more of a deviation from, than a representation of, Presbyterianism. As noted in, again, Wikipedia, “ Prominent evangelical leaders, such as Rick Warren, Ben Witherington III, and Jerry Falwell, have harshly criticized the movement, sometimes denouncing it as heretical.” Trump presents as more orthodox than suggested by Gjelton.

The Presbyterian world view is, in part, stated by René Fülöp-Miller in Leaders, Dreamers and Rebels :

Thanks to the Calvinist doctrine of predestination, it came to pass that more especially in puritan hands wealth was regarded as a sign of ‘election,’ whereas poverty and afflictions were marks of ‘reprobation.’ Though Calvin himself had declared it to be an insoluble enigma, which persons God had predestined for damnation and which were to be numbered among the elect, true believers in the Gospel according to Geneva soon began to feel an irresistible desire for ‘certidudo salutis.’ Now, what other mark of God’s grace could be plainer than the blessings showered on the elect here below?

Trump personifies in a cultural, more than theological, way “the blessings showered on the elect.” Achievement of success is a fundamental American core value. That said, Calvinism is not Hobbesian. While Trump lacks introspection and orthodox Calvinist humility he clearly embodies some of its native compassion. This is clearly reflected in his stand for the little guy and his protectiveness of the social safety net. In his own words, as reported by the Christian Broadcasting Network:

First Presbyterian Church in Jamaica Queens is where I went to church. I'm a protestant, I'm a Presbyterian. And you know I've had a good relationship with the church over the years. I think religion is a wonderful thing. I think my religion is a wonderful religion.

Trump is a species of fundamentalist American (although not fundamentalist Christian). Whether one supports him or opposes him, he really is, in many respects, admirable.

Clinton, far more introspective than Trump, spoke of her Methodist world view in a rare (and striking) public confession of Faith recently reported by the New York Times:

I am a Methodist. … My study of the Bible, my many conversations with people of faith, has led me to believe the most important commandment is to love the Lord with all your might and to love your neighbor as yourself, and that is what I think we are commanded by Christ to do, and there is so much more in the Bible about taking care of the poor, visiting the prisoners, taking in the stranger, creating opportunities for others to be lifted up, to find faith themselves that I think there are many different ways of exercising your faith.

This is entirely consistent with Hillary Clinton’s persona and public record. Religious News Service scores her as “Social Gospel Methodist to the core.” She predominantly offers a counsel of compassion yet her commitment to also create more opportunities for success for the have-nots surely is to be considered authentic. Whether one supports or, like me, opposes her, Hillary Clinton is in many respects admirable.

While appreciating her laudable compassion my opposition to Hillary Clinton derives from my belief that a certain road to a certain notorious destination really is paved with good intentions. I ran her inspiring nomination acceptance speech through my Secret Political Decoder Ring.

It interpreted what Clinton said as “I shall tax the American lemon until the pips squeak.” This is a recipe for continued economic stagnation and protracted misery. I myself believe that leaning toward growth, at this moment, is the better path to national and world happiness.

But I’m just one vote.

In 2016 America has chosen two distinguished paladins from two competing, legitimate, admirable aspects of Protestant culture. Old school Presbyterianism emphasizes success. Methodism emphasizes social justice. Both perspectives are legitimate. Furthermore, they are complementary.

We soon shall find out which of the two perspectives the majority of American voters wish to emphasize in the next phase of our maturation as a nation. The American Dream requires both the achievement of success and social justice. Both Trump and Clinton bring important values to the fore of the national discourse.

Let's give thanks that they both stood for office.

Let's take pride that we nominated them.

God bless America.

Much has been written and uttered recently bemoaning incivility in our civic discourse. Yet there often is more than a hint of inauthenticity to these utterances. While stated neutrally such moans almost always are directed at the behavior or speech of our adversaries not ourselves.

That's a sly trick. I call it weaponizing civility. Both left and right do it.

The left has been merrily demonizing Donald Trump for incivility. It often does so with words at least as virulent as those it condemns.

Michael Tomasky, a center-left columnist who I greater admire, referred to Trump in the headline of a recent New York Review of Books column as ""The Monster."" (Maybe his editor selected the headline but the writer is complicit.)

Matt Taibbi may be the greatest maestro of the poison pen since Mencken. I affectionately recall his article in Rolling Stone about the Tea Party. (I was co-emcee of the Boston Tea Party July 4th rally in 2009.)

'... Republicans managed to get back in the game anyway by plucking an assortment of nativist freaks, village idiots and Internet Hitlers out of thin air and training them into a giant ball of incoherent resentment.'

Not myself being a nativist (freak or otherwise) I was left to wonder whether he counted me among the village idiots or the Internet Hitlers. (Matt? Hmu!)

That article was by no means a departure for Taibbi. He recently wrote, with typical flair, about the Republican Convention (with an attendant illustration of Trump as Moloch):

'We thought Donald Trump's version of the Republican National Convention would be a brilliantly bawdy exercise in Nazistic excess.

We expected thousand-foot light columns, a 400-piece horn section where the delegates usually sit (they would be in cages out back with guns to their heads). Onstage, a chorus line of pageant girls in gold bikinis would be twerking furiously to a techno version of ""New York, New York"" while an army of Broadway dancers spent all four days building a Big Beautiful Wall that read winning, the ceremonial last brick timed to the start of Donald's acceptance speech...

But nah. What happened instead was just sad and weird, very weird. The lineup for the 2016 Republican National Convention to nominate Trump felt like a fallback list of speakers for some ancient UHF telethon, on behalf of a cause like plantar-wart research.'

I myself thoroughly enjoy such hyperbole even, maybe especially, when directed at me and my team. It would make me sad if he (or, for that matter, MoveOn) dialed it back. Yet, OK, not everyone enjoys the pyrotechnics of vile insult.

Conservatives are by no means innocent of incivility. Consider Josh Hammer at The Resurgent:

'I continue to believe that taking cyanide is preferable to affirmatively voting for Hillary Clinton. As I recently explained, she is

...a decades-long brutally corrupted socialist who has expressly used the levers of government to enrich herself and her God-forsaken cronies, pathologically lied to the American people over her chicanery on the email scandal, almost certainly belongs in jail for having clearly broken federal criminal law and repeatedly undermining U.S. national security interests, capitulated to the world's worst actors as Secretary of State and directly abetted Putin revanchism in Eastern Europe, increased Chinese militancy in the South China Sea, the slaughter fields of Syria, the rise of Islamic State, and the second-Holocaust aspiring genocidal would-be nuclear sharia theocrats in Tehran alike, and who literally lied to the the families of slain Benghazi victims whilst those victims' dead bodies still laid in rest in American flag-draped coffins...'

I cannot recall a progressive taking Taibbi or a conservative taking Hammer to task for incivility. A call for civility only achieves authenticity, and, from authenticity, credibility, if directed first at putting one's own house in order. Otherwise, let's not kid ourselves, we are merely weaponizing civility.

Incivility is not exactly a new New Thing. As I recently wrote in my Forbes.com column:

As Mental Floss usefully reminds us of both John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, two of our most revered Founders:

'Jefferson's camp accused President Adams of having a 'hideous hermaphroditical character, which has neither the force and firmness of a man, nor the gentleness and sensibility of a woman.' In return, Adams' men called Vice President Jefferson 'a mean-spirited, low-lived fellow, the son of a half-breed Indian squaw, sired by a Virginia mulatto father.' As the slurs piled on, Adams was labeled a fool, a hypocrite, a criminal, and a tyrant, while Jefferson was branded a weakling, an atheist, a libertine, and a coward.'""

Rather puts one in mind of Harry Truman's famous observation that ""A statesman is a politician who's been dead 10 or 15 years.""'

One also recalls that Adams and Jefferson were lifelong friends as well as well as political rivals.

Possible lessons?

Incivility really is rather less than alarming, more regrettable (if that) than deplorable.

Passion befits politics. Our dearest values may be on the line. History is made from passionate, not polite, declarations. The American Revolution was precipitated by Common Sense, written by Thomas Paine. It was not a politely couched protest.

""Society in every state is a blessing, but Government, even in its best state, is but a necessary evil; in its worst state an intolerable one: for when we suffer, or are exposed to the same miseries BY A GOVERNMENT, which we might expect in a country WITHOUT GOVERNMENT, our calamity is heightened by reflecting that we furnish the means by which we suffer.""

Let those who wish to demand civility first put their own houses in order. T.S. Eliot, in The Waste Land: ""You! hypocrite lecteur!--mon semblable,--mon frère!"" Toward its conclusion:

""I sat upon the shore

Fishing, with the arid plain behind me

Shall I at least set my lands in order?""

Upset by incivility? Begin by first putting our own houses in order.

Let's not kid ourselves. Anything less is just weaponizing civility.",2,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/living-room-conversations/dont-weaponize-civility_b_11796790.html

We called Pence “The Conservative Champion” and for good reason. Then, in 2012, Pence made the right decision: to run for governor of Indiana. That was an opportunity for distinguished public service. As it happened it was a perfect boot camp for the vice presidency.

The Honorable David McIntosh, now president of the powerful Club For Growth, was the one who encouraged Pence to come back into electoral politics. McIntosh later served as the guru of the Draft Pence For President Super PAC. In my recent exclusive interview, McIntosh recalled:

When I was vacating my Congressional seat to pursue an ultimately unsuccessful gubernatorial run, in 2000, I wanted my seat to be occupied by a true conservative and someone of high integrity and commitment to public service. I turned to Mike Pence. He had run unsuccessfully in 1988 and 1990 and by 2000 had achieved considerable success, and affluence, as a syndicated talk radio host.

Mike replied that he no longer aspired to public office but would, together with his wife Karen, pray on my request and determine whether they sensed a calling. Several months later I encountered Mike at the Indiana State Fair. I asked him about whether he had reached a conclusion.

He replied that he and Karen recognized that he could not shirk the duty. Pence went on to run, and win, and serve America with distinction in the Congress and then to serve splendidly as governor of Indiana. If elected to the vice presidency he will again serve America magnificently.

One of the reasons that Pence showed himself extraordinary may have faded from general memory. It has not faded from mine. Nor has it been forgotten, or forgiven, by the left, who are now highlighting this, much to my delight. In 2010 Pence gave a major speech at the Detroit Economic Club. As the center-left ThinkProgress.org then reported.

The first item of Pence’s five-point for the economy is a “sound monetary policy.” Pence elaborated that he believes a return to the gold standard could create such a policy:

PENCE: Before I move on, I’d like to note, in the midst of all that’s happened recently — massive borrowing and spending, QE2 — a debate has started anew over an anchor to our global monetary system. My dear friend, the late Jack Kemp, probably would have urged me to adopt the gold standard, right here and now in Detroit. Robert Zoellick, the president of the World Bank, encouraged that we rethink the international currency system including the role of gold, and I agree. I think the time has come to have a debate over gold, and the proper role it should play in our nations monetary affairs. A pro-growth agenda begins with sound monetary policy. (Emphasis supplied by ThinkProgress.)

The elitist left is misguidedly neurotic about the gold standard. Properly designed the gold standard favors labor and debtors slightly over capital and creditors and hence carries majority rank and file support among the labor and ethnic left. Timothy B. Lee wrote at the elite left Vox on July 15th, Trump should ignore his running mate’s bad ideas about monetary policy , with reference to the same speech:

Pence also flirted with returning to the gold standard. ‘The time has come to have a debate over gold and the proper role it should play in our nation’s monetary affairs,’ he said. Many economists — including free market thinkers like Milton Friedman — believe the gold standard played a central role in worsening the Great Depression.

It is perverse how the left has reviled Friedman when he was, as he most often was, right, while being deferential to him when he was demonstrably wrong. The international gold standard had ceased operations in 1914. In 1922, it was replaced, in the immortal words of the great French economist Jacques Rueff, by a “ grotesque caricature. ”

The Economist described that system , quite correctly, as “a mess.” It called itself a gold standard without playing by the rules of the gold standard. The Interwar so-called “gold standard” was a hybrid between Jabberwocky and Calvinball . The true gold standard was but a dim memory by the onset of the Great Depression for which it was framed. The misguided fixation of “many economists” – deluded by the Eichengreen Fallacy — on the role of “the” gold standard in worsening the Great Depression is utterly contradicted by history.

Conservative apostate David Frum, writing in The Wall Street Journal , also stubbornly continues to misunderstand the gold standard. Frum does however astutely observe some similarities between William Jennings Bryan and Donald Trump:

Both men championed constituencies that formerly occupied a position of cultural and political dominance: small farmers in Bryan’s case, the white working class in Trump’s. Both of those constituencies had been economically ravaged for years beforehand: by 20 years of price deflation for the small farmers, by a generation of declining wages for the white working class.

This is a similarity previously noted by David Klinghard in US News and World Report and by Tim Reuter at Forbes.com . It is apt in some ways but not in others. Bryan, by prescribing depreciation through “free coinage of silver,” lost three presidential races. Trump provides a counsel of general prosperity and has thus far gone from victory to victory and is on track to astound the Frums of this world in the general election.

It is disappointing that the erudite but curiously tone-deaf Frum fails to note that the ravaging of small farmers was caused by the post-Civil War restoration of the gold standard at pre-war parity. This forced a painful secular deflation. We are back in the jaws of deflation, this time Fed-induced. Trump twice has stated his appreciation for the gold standard, the very platform on which McKinley soundly beat Bryan. And the gold standard, properly done, is not an instrument of deflation.

Paul Krugman and his “ plovers ” will rave on against the gold standard. Let them. To adapt a tweet by Neo-Keynesian economist Austan Goolsbee: Roses are red. Violets are pink. Don’t listen to aurophobes. No one cares what they think. To wit :

People suffering from aurophobia usually develop panic attacks when uncovered to gold, or when they see gold. Different folks suffer from totally different symptoms of the panic assault like irregular heartbeat, nausea, sweating, fast breathing, and shortness of breath and a feeling of dread on seeing gold. Being a victim of aurophobia proves to be very uncomfortable because the victim cannot do things normal people do.

Pity the left’s rampant aurophobia. The right’s thought leaders, such as Steve Forbes, have solid evidence for the beneficence of the gold standard properly done. And the New York Sun astutely noted in a recent unsigned editorial, Mike Pence’s Prescience :

Donald Trump’s choice of Mike Pence for vice president would … be a promising pick for those of us who see a restoration of sound money as the essential precondition for returning America’s economy to a trajectory of jobs and growth. No doubt he has lots of other virtues, in that he has experience and success as both a congressman and governor. Were he ever called to the presidency, he would be prepared. But the feature of his political agenda that we have been watching for years is that in respect of monetary reform.

… “What are the building blocks of an incentive-based, growth agenda?” he asked [in his Detroit speech]. The first of his five building blocks was “sound monetary policy.

That, to us, was significant. Mr. Pence’s other four building blocks were terrific, too, including, as they did, “tax relief and reform, access to American energy, regulatory reform, and trade.” It was particularly newsworthy, we felt, that he had marked monetary first and that he was at the van of the leading Republicans on this head. He quoted Lawrence Kudlow’s line about how “the Fed can print money, but it can’t print jobs.” We’d like to think that it’s no coincidence that Mr. Kudlow is advising Mr. Trump (as he did President Reagan).

Mr. Trump himself has already stated that, in principle, he favors sound money. “Bringing back the gold standard would be very hard to do, but, boy, would it be wonderful,” he’s said. “We’d have a standard on which to base our money.”

Donald Trump’s signature promise is to “make America great again.” Trump knows that “it would be wonderful” to restore the gold standard. He has a firm intuitive grasp of why: “We’d have a standard on which to base our money.”

America is struggling through 16 years of economic sluggishness at only maybe half the growth rate of our gold standard eras. Since President Nixon “closed the gold window” on August 15, 1971 – a window cynically smashed by President Johnson -- median family incomes have stagnated. The rich have disproportionately prospered.

The American Dream requires prosperity and justice for all. The loss of one or two (or, to hark back to Kennedy, three) percent of annual economic growth may not seem like much. But thanks to the power of compounding (which Albert Einstein famously never called the strongest force in the universe) the American economy now is only two thirds as big it would have been if it had remained on trend line.

This is a big deal. The American Dream lies buried in these ruins. Let's resurrect it.

Had gold standard equitable growth rates continued we’d all, on average, be making 50% more and be worth 50% more. America’s GDP would be $26+T rather than $18.5T/year.

The Congressional Budget Office once estimated that every one tenth of one percent of GDP adds $314B to federal revenues over 10 years … without raising taxes. True gold standard growth rates would have transformed our hundreds of billions of dollars in annual federal deficits into hundreds of billions in surpluses. That money would rebuild a lot of roads and bridges and a whole lot more.

Trump laudably has committed himself to defending Social Security and Medicare. Good for him! At gold standard growth rates, our social insurance programs can be made solvent for the indefinite future without cutting benefits or raising taxes.

Restoring gold standard rates of job creation, upward economic mobility, and equitable prosperity is the most plausible, easiest, and requisite means of making America great again. More easily done than said. How? Why, by restoring the gold standard, of course!

Let Donald Trump consult Donald Trump: “Bringing back the gold standard would … be wonderful. We’d have a standard on which to base our money.” Spot on.

Then, if Trump -- or one of his trusted associates such as Mike Pence, Newt Gingrich, Chris Christie, Larry Kudlow, or Sam Clovis -- wishes to know just how to make this happen just pick up the phone and invite one Lewis E. Lehrman (whose eponymous institute I once professionally served) in for a chat. Lehrman was Jack Kemp’s éminence grise of his Gold Standard Act of 1984, the ideal vehicle. Lehrman was called by public intellectual James Grant our ""modern Alexander Hamilton."" Invite Steve Forbes -- a heroic champion of the gold standard during its long dark age and eminent Treasury Secretary candidate – to participate in that gold standard caucus. While at it, invite Mike Pence, who got it long before most others did.

Time to bring back the gold standard for its equitable prosperity inducing properties. Mike Pence will make a great partner in making America great again. Grand slam.

367,Benko,Ralph,csmonitor,"America’s polarity is achieving remarkable intensity, noted in many news stories, now vividly being reported at the current national political party conventions. That said, overlooked by the media, there are not one but two kinds of polarization: constructive and destructive.

The media are fixated on the destructive.

They overlook the positive power of polarization.

Don’t fall for it.

Political parties emerged immediately after the retirement of President Washington. It was an organic and healthy development. As MoveOn co-founder Joan Blades and I wrote last year in The Huffington Post, President Washington, in his farewell statement, warned of negative polarization:

The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by the spirit of revenge, natural to party dissension, which in different ages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is itself a frightful despotism.

“Horrid enormities,” reportedly, are what is happening today. As reported by Shane Goldmacher and Annie Karni in Politico in Trump, Clinton run on opposite sides of a fractured America:

In so many ways, you feel that there’s nobody that represents the whole,” said Peter Hart, who has been a Democratic pollster for 50 years. “That Donald Trump has his constituency. That Hillary Clinton has her constituency. And they are talking to their part of the world, and neither is really talking about how you knit a country back together.” … But even as they pledge healing and unity in a moment of national mourning, the presumptive Democratic and Republican nominees are assembling competing political coalitions with so little overlap that it will be hard for either to emerge as a unifying figure.

Peering more deeply there is George Saunders, in an astonishingly great article in The New Yorker, Who Are All These Trump Supporters:

Intellectually and emotionally weakened by years of steadily degraded public discourse, we are now two separate ideological countries, LeftLand and RightLand, speaking different languages, the lines between us down. Not only do our two subcountries reason differently; they draw upon non-intersecting data sets and access entirely different mythological systems. You and I approach a castle. One of us has watched only “Monty Python and the Holy Grail,” the other only “Game of Thrones.” What is the meaning, to the collective “we,” of yon castle? We have no common basis from which to discuss it. You, the other knight, strike me as bafflingly ignorant, a little unmoored. In the old days, a liberal and a conservative (a “dove” and a “hawk,” say) got their data from one of three nightly news programs, a local paper, and a handful of national magazines, and were thus starting with the same basic facts (even if those facts were questionable, limited, or erroneous). Now each of us constructs a custom informational universe, wittingly (we choose to go to the sources that uphold our existing beliefs and thus flatter us) or unwittingly (our app algorithms do the driving for us). The data we get this way, pre-imprinted with spin and mythos, are intensely one-dimensional.

Saunders conducted some in depth conversations with many rank-and-file Trump supporters.

In the face of specificity, my interviewees began trying, really trying, to think of what would be fairest and most humane for this real person we had imaginatively conjured up. It wasn’t that we suddenly agreed, but the tone changed. We popped briefly out of zinger mode and began to have some faith in one another, a shared confidence that if we talked long enough, respectfully enough, a solution could be found that might satisfy our respective best notions of who we were. Well, let’s not get too dreamy about it. We’d stay in that mode for a minute or two, then be off again to some new topic, rewrapped in our respective Left and Right national flags.

Too dreamy? Let us peer more deeply still.

Polarization can be sublime. Constructive polarization means that the political parties (and conservative vs. progressives) must seek to compete – hard – over who can provide the best plan to improve the general welfare.

I am scored as far right as their meter reads by the fascinating website AllSides.com, dedicated to featuring, well, all sides. I was called by a Washington Post Magazine columnist earlier this year as “the second most conservative man in the world.”

And I love my left wing adversaries. Spitting in each another’s faces is not polarization. It’s a personal foul. The positive power of polarization is honest competition with true respect for our adversaries.

The iconic radical Saul Alinsky – who fundamentally reshaped politics, a transformation that is still a work in progress – wrote in Rules for Radicals:

One man's positive is another man's negative. The description of any procedure as ‘positive’ or 'negative' is the mark of a political illiterate. … Each element with its positive and converse sides is fused to other related elements in an endless series of everything, so that the converse of revolution on one side is counterrevolution and on the other side, reformation, and so on in an endless chain of connected converses.

Alinsky’s eleventh, perhaps most subtle and profound, Rule:

If you push a negative hard and deep enough it will break through into its counterside; this is based on the principle that every positive has its negative.

So, where’s the breakthrough going to come from?

There are leaders, groups and organizations across the nation that have sprung up against the destructive kind of polarization. The best ones understand the opportunity that constructive polarization provides.

Joan Blades (yes, that progressive icon, co-founder of MoveOn.org and MomsRising.org) then co-founded and I (yes, that archconservative columnist) am fully in league with Living Rooms Conversations. Rather than rally groups in tribal warfare against each other, Living Room Conversations brings people together from opposing sides of an issue for a civil, enlightening conversation that values differences.

AllSides.com, whose founder John Gable provides this column series for The Christian Science Monitor, puts opposing views side-by-side to help readers gain a deeper and broader understanding of the issues and each other. It doesn’t pretend that a single solution or perspective is needed, or that the center provides – abracadabra! – the magic formula. That said, AllSides.com is designed to help the blind men – meaning, all of us – discern the real shape of the elephant (or donkey, as the case may be) in the room.

The Village Square, Voice of the People, The Bridge Alliance – just some of the many good organizations who appreciate positive differences. Deborah Devedjian, founder and chief citizens’ officer of The Chisel – another great organization where, fo shizzle!, her team is “Creating a More Perfect Union” – likes to sign off: E pluribus unum. “From many, one.”

Could polarization be a prelude to a renewal of “From many, one?” You bet it could.

Are good Middle Class jobs an endangered species? If so is the solution to that for the taxpayers to send almost everyone $10,000/year tax free?

As described in my accompanying column Andy Stern’s new Raising The Floor is the best of books, it is the worst of books, it is a book of wisdom, it is a book of foolishness, it contains epic belief, it contains epic incredulity…. He also hints at a 2020 presidential run.

My accompanying column described Stern at his best. And then the best of books turns into the worst of books.

Stern presents his Big Reveal: a Universal Basic Income – $10,000/year, tax free, to everyone between the age of 18 and 64. This sounded good to me even though I’m within months of aging out of eligibility. It had sounded even better when propounded by Forbes.com’s Tim Worstall , channeling conservative public intellectual Charles Murray, as an idea with solid conservative cred.

Big mistake. It turns out that the numbers don’t come even close to adding up. Yes, there’s a trillion dollars a year of welfare programs, federal and state, that could be traded in as a down payment for a straight cash transfer. But it turns out that this trillion dollars only gets Stern considerably less than half way to $10,000/year.

Murray and other conservative and libertarian champions of a Universal Basic Income also propose … wait for it … to cash out our social insurance programs: Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid to pay for it. This won’t do.

Ending our prime social insurance programs is unacceptable both to Stern and to me. It is unacceptable based on social justice and legitimate political considerations. When you knock these sources of funding out, the proposed Universal Basic Income scales down to less than $5,000/year per person. That entirely knocks the props out of cashing out welfare by not providing, in return, enough to sustain the poor and afflicted.

Attention libertarians! There is nothing in the least wrong with the State’s sustaining the poor and the afflicted. As Hayek wrote, in the very fountainhead of libertarian canon, The Road To Serfdom :

Nor is there any reason why the state should not assist the individuals in providing for those common hazards of life against which, because of their uncertainty, few individuals can make adequate provision. Where, as in the case of sickness and accident, neither the desire to avoid such calamities nor efforts to overcome their consequences are as a rule weakened by the provision of assistance—where, in short, we deal with genuinely insurable risks—the case the for the state’s helping to organize a comprehensive system of social insurance is very strong. … [T]here is no incompatibility in principle between the state’s providing greater security in this way and the preservation of individual freedom.

There's a legitimate difference between social insurance and welfare. So Stern's unique value proposition, as a Man of the Left, seems to be that he would be willing to transform $1T in subsidies to the poor into $1T in cash if the rich (and, as it devolves, Middle Class) are willing to pony up an additional $1T+ in new taxes to match it.

Stern extols, at length, the benefits of Universal Basic Income, something I entered Stage Left hoping to support. So far, so good. He then turns to a series of catastrophic propositions to finance it. This transforms Raising The Floor into the worst of books.

Stern, in a sweet-natured desire to create a Kumbaya Coalition, proclaims: “Note to my progressive colleagues: if you want to get anywhere in the fight for UBI, keep your ‘soak the rich’ rhetoric to a minimum. Better yet, nix it.” He then quickly proposes a series of “soak the rich” measures such Piketty’s 1.5% wealth tax, which he calculates would raise $600b/year (far short of funding his UBI), and a so-called Robin Hood, more properly Sheriff of Nottingham, Tax of 0.25 percent on each side of a stock trade which “could produce over $150 billion a year.” Also far short.

That money comes from somebody and mostly, one infers, not janitors. Featuring low rates proves, after all, a semi-covert effort to soak the rich. But this is deceptive.

""Piketty's Charge"" is on capital. The stock transfer tax is on a flow of funds that do not constitute income, just moving capital from here to there. Neither tax is good for job creation.

“The Rich” often are a lot of annoying things. Yet they’re never stupid enough to miss a proposed $750 billion (or more) tax increase, however modestly covered by the disingenuous fig leaves of low rates.

Stern also proposes a tax on natural resources which, as things stand today, simply would be an elegant rationalization for a heavy new corporate tax. The concept reaches back to an obscure idea from my favorite Founding Father, Thomas Paine. It just possibly might have been a good idea in 1795. Even if it had been good then this passed its sell-by date a couple of hundred years ago.

“The Rich” do not have enough wealth to fund this UBI for very long. You could confiscate all the wealth of the Koch brothers plus George Soros and Tom Steyer and use it to fund Universal Basic Income for, maybe, a month. Confiscate all the money of the Forbes 400 — $2.34T at last count — and you’ll have enough money to provide Universal Basic Income for about a year.

After which you will have killed the goose that lays the golden eggs. There just aren’t enough of “The Rich” to fund this (or other massive goodie bags now proposed by the left). Get thee to a séance, Andy, and ask the shade of Hugo Chavez. Or just look it up.

Maybe you’ve heard about the food riots breaking out in Venezuela? Immiseration of the poor and Middle Class is an inevitable outcome of the confiscation of capital. It’s been shown too many times to doubt.

Thus one would have to soak the Middle Class to pay for this program designed to appeal to the Middle Class. This is antithetical. And indeed, after dallying with sly approaches to soaking the rich Stern proposes to soak the Middle Class too.

One of these proposals is to eliminate “all or some” of the deductions in the Internal Revenue Code. Really want to eliminate the charitable deduction? How about taxing municipal bond interest, or imposing taxes on money paid to pay state taxes? Such measures are antithetical to rebuilding infrastructure, something which Stern heartily advocates.

Moreover the remaining tax deductions are heavily defended. You really don’t know Congressional trench warfare until you pick on the mortgage interest deduction. The Realtors’ lobby makes the NRA look like Code Pink. Moreover millions of middle class families innocently relied on that deduction when they purchased a home.

Pension contributions? Health insurance premiums?

Congresspeople would lose elections in droves by taking these hardly egregious deductions away without providing a more compelling countervailing benefit such as dramatically reduced, across-the-board, tax rates.

Stern also suggests a VAT as a funding source. That would take back at the cash register some or much of the funds delivered by mail to the Middle Class which the UBI is sold to support. Uncle Sam’s left hand would thus take back much of what was given with the right.

A VAT might be a wily way to transfer funds from the Middle Class to the poor (while largely exempting “The Rich”). As for buttressing the Middle Class it is a form of Three Card Monte.

Then Stern proposes trimming the $600B/year military budget. I, as a paleoconservative, find this conceptually appealing. Paleoconservatives don’t like standing armies. James Madison didn’t either . Yet it is dubious that many Americans would be enthused to eliminate our Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines and Coast Guard just to send everyone between $2,000 – $3,000 a year.

Stern then attacks farm subsidies and “subsidies” to oil and gas (a dubious progressive shibboleth). Both together, at best, would fund a couple of weeks of his proposed Universal Basic Income. There isn’t enough discretionary spending to cut to quarry meaningful funding to make the pay-fors.

To get to $10,000/yr without cashing out our intensely popular social insurance programs you really do have to soak the Middle Class. This is antithetical to UBI’s stated premise.

The argument is further undermined by ill-founded propositions such as “it might be necessary in the initial bill to specify that Congress needs a super majority of 75 to 90 percent to change the UBI disbursement level.” Stern’s fact checker apparently here went AWOL. One Congress cannot bind a future Congress. Period.

UBI doesn't have to go off the rails. Andy Stern, in his personal odyssey, apparently failed to take a walk on the Supply Side – policies empirically determined to support robust job creation and equitable prosperity. Jude Wanniski, a key advisor to Rep. Jack Kemp, was an avowed Marxist. Kemp himself had been a labor union president. Memo to Andy Stern: seek out your #LostFamily, the Supply Siders, and get back on track.

Taking a walk on the Supply Side Stern might find John “The Grumpy Economist” Cochrane. Cochrane has done a terrific brief analysis of how to make something along the lines of Universal Basic Income work by limiting its ubiquity while not injuring its universality, and pivots to the real opportunity:

We want to give more help to people who need more help. That lets us be more generous to those who do need help, and contains moral hazard that people who don’t really need help should be working and paying taxes to supply help.…

So set this apart, recognize that adapting to automation will require getting people skills not sending them checks. And that is going to mean keeping the price system alive. It has to be crystal clear that computer programming pays more than goof off majors.

Meanwhile, Supply Side icon Charles Kadlec, a few years ago, noted at Forbes.com a Congressional Budget Office report: “in Appendix B of The Budget and Economic Outlook : Fiscal Years 2012 to 2022: every one-tenth of one percent increase in the growth rate will reduce the federal budget deficit over the next 10 years by $314 billion.”

I’ve called this phenomenon “the Kadlec Curve.” If we adopt policies that raise the rate of GDP growth from its current anemic <2%/year to close to 4% a year we will bring $6 trillion in new federal revenue over ten years. From under 2% to over 4% … maybe over $9 trillion….

Even that would not get Stern's UBI all the way there. And there are no shortage of of claimants on that new money. But it’s a more credible step toward a pay-for than shutting down America’s armed forces.

That kind of sizzling growth also would generate the kind of massive new job creation and upward mobility that is precisely what Andy Stern most deeply yearns for. Win-win.

Prices, including wages, are set by supply and demand, period. The only real way of ""raising the floor"" is by stoking the demand for labor through sizzling economic growth.

How to get the economy growing again?

We actually know a lot about how to make it happen.

Reagan and Clinton did it. We can too. Let us count the ways.

And since Andy Stern, channeling Peter Barnes, turned to Tom Paine let us begin by turning to Paine waxing prophetic rather than elegiac. From a tract Paine wrote in 1786 collected as Dissertations on government, the affairs of the bank, and paper money :

It was horrid to see, and hurtful to recollect, how loose the principles of justice were left, by means of the paper (money) emissions during the (Revolutionary) war. The experience then had should be a warning to any assembly how they venture to open such a dangerous door again. …

But the evils of paper money have no end. Its uncertain and fluctuating value is continually awakening or creating new schemes of deceit. Every principle of justice is put to the rack, and the bond of society dissolved.

…

As to the assumed authority of any assembly in making paper money, or paper of any kind, a legal tender, or in other language, a compulsive payment, it is a most presumptuous attempt at arbitrary power. There can be no such power in a republican government: the people have no freedom — and property no security — where this practice can be acted: and the committee who shall bring in a report for this purpose, or the member who moves for it, and he who seconds it merits impeachment, and sooner or later may expect it.

As set forth in my recent Letter to the Left the flat-lining of median family income and the explosion of inequality began right after President Nixon “closed the gold window” in 1971. Nixon thereafter was forced to resign in the face, a là Paine, of certain impeachment. Want to raise the floor? Let’s begin by making the dollar as good as gold again.

In Raising The Floor Andy Stern also coyly dips his toe into the presidential waters of 2020. Run Andy run! But first take a walk on the Supply Side to discover ways of really raising the floor -- by stoking job creation -- plus seeking sustainable means of funding that won't soak the Middle Class.

Are good Middle Class jobs an endangered species? If so is the solution to send almost everyone $10,000/year tax free?

The formerly most powerful union leader in our lifetime, Andy Stern, in Raising The Floor: How A Universal Basic Income Can Renew Our Economy and Rebuild The American Dream , has written (to paraphrase Dickens) the best of books, the worst of books, a book of wisdom, a book of foolishness, containing epic belief, containing epic incredulity….

Herein Stern tackles the intriguing topic of a Universal Basic Income. This is a policy proposal with theoretical support both from the left and the right. What could possibly go wrong?

Andy Stern, during his career, was the most interesting, creative, and, arguably, effective labor union leader in an epoch of the decline and fall of private sector labor unions. A master strategist, he helped build the SEIU (“Justice For Janitors!”) to over 2 million members, seceding from the AFL-CIO to create CHANGE TO WIN … which did not prove a great success.

He was beloved by millions of rank-and-file workers. He was hated by many union boss rivals, corporate managers and anti-unionists. Stern is never boring.

Stern, who I met personally twice, did not seem to mind that I myself am a card-carrying AFL-CIO member. He and SEIU's secretary-treasurer Eliseo Medina arguably are the greatest labor leaders since John L. Lewis, head of the United Mine Workers, creator of the CIO, left the scene.

Stern is an iconoclast. He may be the most endlessly inquisitive character since the Kipling’s Elephant’s Child and he is a seeker of unconventional wisdom. So it was with keen interest that I read, and with a mixture of marvel and incredulity reread, his and Lee Kravitz’s Raising The Floor.

Among the marvels herein Stern directly addresses a paradoxical phenomenon. We as a society get richer through productivity. In practice this means automation and fewer jobs, fewer ways to participate in those riches. Think robots.

Technology allows one person to produce what it used to take two, ten, or even hundreds, to do. Think software. This unequivocally makes us, collectively, much richer.

It is free-market doctrine that this will create new, better, jobs. And I am nothing if not doctrinaire. That said, it is not obvious that the economy is creating new, better jobs. To further confuse matters productivity growth has badly declined in the past five to ten years .

America’s greatest philosopher, Yogi Berra, once observed: “In theory there is no difference between theory and practice but in practice there is.” So, what gives?

The empirical data aren’t reassuring. Job creation has been terrible for the past 16 years through two terms of a Republican and two terms of a Democratic administration (neither Supply Siders). My own belief is that this stagnation has been caused, above all, by bad monetary policy compounded by bad regulatory policy. The Fed, in part, inadvertently torpedoed two presidents.

If we transform monetary and regulatory policies we are likely to reignite the kind of sizzling job growth we saw under Reagan and Clinton. Increased demand for workers is the only organic, sustainable, way to raise the floor. Anything else is, at best, a patch and likely to make matters worse.

My theory is as far from trickle down as it gets. Yet it’s insufficient to be theoretically right when people’s livelihoods, and lives, are on the line. Work has to work. When will the better jobs arise for those such as the “Marias?”

The ""Marias"" are what Stern in another context affectionately called the hotel chambermaids. They in due course likely will be replaced by SuperRoombas. Handing them a copy of John Tamny’s excellent Who Needs The Fed? with their pink slips represents cold comfort indeed.

Where are the new, better, jobs? Where will they come from in the future? These are legitimate questions and Andy Stern raises them unflinchingly. This is where Raising the Floor represents the best of books. And Stern, in his hallmark style, makes his quest for the answers personal, vivid, and moving.

Stern shocked the world by resigning the SEIU presidency at the height of his power. He, in concert with SEIU’s then executive vice president Eliseo Medina, had devoted his life to building SEIU from a tiny entity into the dominant labor union in America. Why did he so unexpectedly and abruptly hit the ejection button?

In 2010, I seemed to be at the top of my game…. Despite this, I stepped down that year as president of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU). … From the mainstream Washington Post to the conservative Wall Street Journal, the media speculated as to why I had decided to leave SEIU at the height of my power and influence.Redstate, a conservative journal, claimed that I was resigning because I was bored with having to spend time on the day-to-day contract battles that are a union’s bread and butter. ‘You’d probably be bored, too, if you had taken a relatively obscure union of janitors and doormen and turned it into the largest and most powerful private-sector union in America…put a president of the United States into the oval office…and fulfilled one of the union movement’s main objectives: nationalized healthcare. …

Redstate couldn’t have been more wrong. Those janitors and window cleaners, those doormen and security guards, and those nurses aides and home- and child-care workers were the people I care about most: nothing motivates them more than the American Dream – the promise, to anyone who works hard and plays by the rules, of a good and secure livelihood and a better future for their children. …I didn’t resign from SEIU because I was bored. Rather, after nearly fifteen years at the helm of SEIU, I had lost my ability to predict labor’s future. …y 2010, the economy was changing and fragmenting at such warp speed that I couldn’t see where it—or labor—was headed. Without a clearer vision of the future—of the world in 2025 or 2040—I couldn’t develop the inner compass needed by a leader who seeks to bring about major social change, and I was out of good ideas.

Stern then takes us along with him on a multi-year odyssey in quest of a better understanding of what is going on, how and why, and “good ideas.” Stern, insatiably curious, shares with us his interactions with Intel co-founder Andy Grove; seminars with celebrity left wing economists such as Thomas Picketty, Joseph Stiglitz, Paul Krugman; a virtual tour of some of the thinking of futurist Ray Kurzweil; to MIT to explore the implications for job creation of Big (960,000 petabytes; noting that 200 petabytes would store all the printed information in the world) Data.

Stern’s most consistently incisive character — playing Cheshire Cat to his Alice — is investment banker Steven Berkenfeld. Berkenfeld helps Stern -- and us -- grasp the inexorably dwindling importance of, and value attributed to, workers in the grand scheme of business. In addition, Stern has an ear for the telling detail. Consider his quote from Terry Gou, the founder of Foxconn Technology Group: “Hon Hai has a workforce of over one million worldwide and as human beings are also animals, to manage one million animals gives me a headache.”

Stern proves himself no Luddite. ""In 1972,"" he writes,

when I graduated from college, the price of the fastest supercomputers on earth was between $5 and $8.8 million (the equivalent of almost $30 and $43 million today). Forty years later, I could buy an iPhone 4 with equal performance for less than $400. What a thrill to be alive in the wonder-filled world of Moore’s Law…. And yet, there is a dark side to all this change that will improve our lives: the loss of millions of middle-class jobs, perhaps forever, but definitely for the foreseeable future.

He takes us into his conversation with Carl Camden, the CEO of Kelly Services, $6 billion/year – 550,000 temps in 80 countries –- “the voice of disorganized labor.” He shows us the realities of contract employees. Stern takes us into Upwork, which he himself uses for transcription services, far more affordable than American labor.

He vicariously walks us through the Dantesque aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, where Uncle Sam was paying $2980 to $3500 to tarp a roof that ordinarily would have cost $300. The Big Government money got absorbed by about six layers of contractors, not the workers who actually tarped the roof. Most of the actual workers got the shaft.

Stern also gives us a glimpse of Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, people doing “cognitive piecework on demand” for peanuts.

It’s a fascinating, eclectic, odyssey with visits to some authentic Big Thinkers. Most heartrending of all of these conversations may be those he had with Geoff Canada. Canada, the man immortalized in Waiting For Superman, turned the performance of Harlem’s schools around, one block at a time, through 97 blocks: “Not one of my kids is in jail. We have 881 kids in college and not single kid in jail.”

The Divine Tragedy of this? College no longer is the reliable ticket to a good job. It is, too often, a ticket to penury.

Stern's Raising The Floor gives us a thoughtful, multi-perspective, look at The Big Problem: no jobs. He does so in a vivid and compelling way. Therein he has written the best of books.

Then Stern presents his Big Reveal, a universal basic income: $10,000/year, tax free, to everyone between the age of 18 and 64. Thereafter, without seeming to recognize it, he inadvertently makes an airtight case for why the Universal Basic Income, at least as here configured, is a recipe for disaster.

This is a real heart breaker. An agonizing disconnect turns Raising The Floor into the worst of books while moreover overlooking what could be the real solution hiding in plain sight.

About three months ago a world geopolitical conflict tracing back to days after the death of King Solomon was ceremoniously resolved. It didn’t make the news. Now, Extra!, read all about it!

I have argued, many times, that an imperfect but impressive world peace has dawned. As Harvard's Steven Pinker, author ofBetter Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined, and Andrew Mack, director of the Human Security Report Project at Simon Fraser University wrote, in 2012, The World Is Not Falling Apart published at Slate.com:

In a historically unprecedented development, the number of interstate wars has plummeted since 1945, and the most destructive kind of war, in which great powers or developed states fight each other, has vanished altogether. … Though the recent increase in civil wars and battle deaths is real and worrisome, it must be kept in perspective. It has undone the progress of the last dozen years, but the rates of violence are still well below those of the 1990s, and nowhere near the levels of the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, or 1980s.

Yet peace, lacking drama, is little heralded. Recently there was a small event that presents in microcosm the dawning peace. It may even contain the seed of a new narrative that could facilitate peace in the Middle East, currently the hottest spot in the world. Tiny things can have disproportionate effects.

The end of the longest political estrangement in the world was celebrated this April. The celebration went almost unnoticed but could be consequential. The world’s oldest persisting conflict began almost 3,000 years ago as a tax revolt. The consequences of this conflict have mistily haunted world lore, echoing through millennia.

When King Solomon died, around 930 BC, his son Rehoboam ceremoniously ascended to the throne in the city of Shechem. As meticulously recorded in the Book of Kings, the people of the northern tribes of Israel petitioned him for a tax cut. This was, in some ways, the first recorded Tea Party rally.

Solomon’s advisors, good Supply Siders, advised him to cut the people’s taxes. Yet “The young men who had grown up with him and were serving him” – early Big Government types — prescribed a big tax increase.

King Rehoboam went with the tax hike. Big mistake.

The northern tribes promptly seceded and founded their own nation, Israel, becoming known as the Israelites. This left Rehoboam to reign, in Jerusalem, over the tribes of Judah (from which the name Jews much later derived) and Benjamin.

Thereafter hostility prevailed between the Judaeans and the Israelites. The Israelite kingdom was destroyed by the Neo-Assyrians about 200 years later. The Israelites eventually became known as the Samaritans, based on their residence in Samaria.

The subtext of the iconic parable of ""the Good Samaritan” was that the compassionate man who Jesus (a Jew) exalted over the Jewish elite was from a community greatly despised by the Jews. In the first century A.D., when this parable was told, there were over a million Israelite-Samaritans. Their numbers then dwindled. Hence the legend of “The Lost Tribes of Israel.”

Yet here the Israelite-Samaritans still are. Their population has risen from fewer than 200 people a century ago to about 800 today and continues to rise. They live by most ancient Biblical traditions and are a cultural treasure of Biblical proportions.

The Israelite-Samaritans have achieved something that has proved elusive to others: they live and thrive in peace with the Israelis and the Palestinians both. And they offer themselves as a “Bridge of Peace” in the Middle East.

The Israelite-Samaritans reside in a village outside Nablus – the modern name of the very Shechem in which Rehoboam was crowned – and in Holon, a suburb of Tel Aviv. I have the privilege of serving as the honorary envoy of the Israelite-Samaritans to Washington and of having co-founded, together with Samaritan elder and civic leader Benyamim Tsedaka, the Samaritan Medal Foundation . Under Chairman Tsedaka’s leadership, the Foundation awarded its Peace Medal to Palestinian Prime Minister Dr. Rami Hamdalla last August.

This past April the Foundation awarded its Peace Medal to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Thereby an ancient rift was ceremoniously resolved. As Foundation co-founder and honorary consul, I was abruptly summoned by the Israelite-Samaritan leaders to Jerusalem and Nablus. I met, at the Knesset, with the Honorable Zeev Alin, the Minister of Jerusalem and Heritage. In Nablus I met with another distinguished Peace Medal recipient, former Nablus mayor the Honorable Ghassan El Shakha’a , now executive committee member and Head of the Department of International Relations of the Palestinian Liberation Organization. I also there met with public activist ‘Abd El Aillah El Attireh, and with the good Samaritans Ovadia Cohen and Yitzhaq Altif, the latter the secretary of the Mount Gerizim Samaritan Committee.

And I spent a night on Mount Gerizim, the Mountain of Blessings, outside Nablus, there receiving the blessing of Abedel b. Asher, the High Priest of Israel, himself a recipient of the Samaritan Peace Medal in 2015. This eminent dignitary is the many-generations-descendant of the first High Priest, Aaron, by blood a grand-nephew of Moses.

An impromptu visit to Jerusalem by Vice President Biden caused the postponement the presentation of the Samaritan Peace Medal to Prime Minister Netanyahu until shortly after my departure. It was a privilege to have been invited to Jerusalem and Nablus, where the rift originated, to participate in an historic peacemaking process.

Nestled within the event may lie the seed of a new narrative, one of rapprochement and peace in the Middle East. Consider, if you will, a new concept: pro-Semitism.

Most people know of anti-Semitism. Most mistake a Semite to mean a Jew but it is more inclusive. The Oxford New American Dictionary defines Semite as “a member of any of the peoples who speak or spoke a Semitic language, including in particular the Jews and Arabs.” Add to the Jews and Arabs the formidable Israelite-Samaritans.

Championing pro-Semitism just might be another way of defusing antagonisms and of building solidarity between many of the factions in the Middle East. The formal end of a 3,000-year-old rift may seem arcane. Yet it is undeniably historic, and perhaps not inconsequential.

Chaos Theory argues that small events can have profound impact. As Wikipedia sums it up:

In 1963 [Edward] Lorenz published a theoretical study of this effect in a highly cited, seminal paper calledDeterministic Nonperiodic Flow. Elsewhere he stated:

One meteorologist remarked that if the theory were correct, one flap of a sea gull’s wings would be enough to alter the course of the weather forever. The controversy has not yet been settled, but the most recent evidence seems to favor the sea gulls.

Following suggestions from colleagues, in later speeches and papers Lorenz used the more poetic butterfly.

May the flap of the Israelite-Samaritan butterfly wing alter the course of world history forever by unleashing peace.

Politicos and activists are appropriating the ghastly Orlando Massacre for political and policy purposes. It would be better if we could pause and mourn the victims before engaging in a policy debate. But if we are to have a policy debate, the debate we need to have is about how to drastically reduce gun violence without disarming law-abiding people.

There are ways to make us all safer without eroding the Bill of Rights. To do so we simply must end the “Mexican standoff” between gun control and gun rights advocates.

Ending the deadlock between gun control and gun rights holds the way to vastly reduce gun violence without infringing upon the rights of law abiding gun owners. Full disclosure: while a gun owner I am not a gun nut.

I’m a Constitution nut. A solution lies hidden in plain sight right in the Second Amendment: “A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.”

The militias now, by and large, are subsumed into the National Guard. The Guard is a very well-regulated militia indeed.

Without doing any violence to the letter or spirit of the Constitution, it is entirely possible to make gun ownership contingent upon membership in the Guard or other legally recognized state militia. If done in full good faith — with NRA officials given seats at the table — this will appeal to the right (which has high respect for our military and for service) and will be at least palatable to the fair-minded left.

Consider the creation of an Auxiliary within the Guard, one with lighter duties — mainly training in responsible handling of weapons, regular but non-onerous drilling, and standard regulation of its membership. Not conceptually hard to do. By thereby heightening gun responsibility an even higher level of respect for gun rights, and a healthier gun culture, can be achieved.

Gun violence would plummet. Robust gun rights, now hanging by a slender one vote majority thread in US Supreme Court precedent and unlikely to survive a Democratic presidency, would be far more secure.

As reported in Time Magazine in a 2012 article, The Swiss Difference: A Gun Culture That Works :

Even as the gun-control debate rises again in the U.S. in the aftermath of the horrific school shooting in Newtown, Conn. , the gun-loving Swiss are not about to lay down their arms. Guns are ubiquitous in this neutral nation, with sharpshooting considered a fun and wholesome recreational activity for people of all ages.

Even though Switzerland has not been involved in an armed conflict since a standoff between Catholics and Protestants in 1847, the Swiss are very serious not only about their right to own weapons but also to carry them around in public. Because of this general acceptance and even pride in gun ownership, nobody bats an eye at the sight of a civilian riding a bus, bike or motorcycle to the shooting range, with a rifle slung across the shoulder.

…

Switzerland trails behind only the U.S, Yemen and Serbia in the number of guns per capita; between 2.3 million and 4.5 million military and private firearms are estimated to be in circulation in a country of only 8 million people. Yet, despite the prevalence of guns, the violent-crime rate is low: government figures show about 0.5 gun homicides per 100,000 inhabitants in 2010. By comparison, the U.S rate in the same year was about 5 firearm killings per 100,000 people, according to a 2011 U.N. report.

It is, of course, impossible completely to eliminate gun deaths ( about 32,000 a year , 60% of which reportedly are suicides) as it is to eliminate deaths by auto accidents ( 32,675 in 2014 ). Yet by taking the full Second Amendment seriously we can dramatically reduce gun violence.

The secret lies right in the first four words of the Second Amendment: “A well regulated Militia.” As confessed above I’m a Constitution nut.

The Framers had great wisdom. Rather than politicizing tragedy, let’s rely on that wisdom with a well-regulated Militia to get on with reducing gun violence.

To paraphrase Melville, ""Call me Orlando. ... ’And I only am escaped alone to tell thee.’ – Job”

Apollo 11's Buzz Aldrin, presentation at Sixth & I Synagogue, Washington, DC. Photo by Ralph Benko

By Ralph Benko

I vividly remember watching the awesome drama of the first moonwalk on July 20, 1969. I was in a National Science Foundation summer archaeology project. The most modern and the most ancient thus commingled in front of the black and white TV in the Student Union of Clarion State College in the company of our teaching aide, Carol. Magical.

We later learned that there was another drama taking place at Tranquility Base, in secret. It was a drama that anticipated a culture clash reaching virulence today.

Huffington Post Religion, in 2014, presented that drama in The Moon Communion of Buzz Aldrin That NASA Did Not Want To Broadcast:

""As Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin prepared to take 'one small step for man,' Aldrin wanted to commemorate the moment in a way he found most personally meaningful -- by taking communion.

Aldrin, a church elder at Webster Presbyterian Church in Webster, Texas, at the time, spoke to his pastor Dean Woodruff to try to find a way to symbolize the wonder and awe of the moon landing a few weeks before lift-off. Aldrin said, ""We wanted to express our feeling that what man was doing in this mission transcended electronics and computers and rockets.""

...

""Aldrin wrote about the experience a year later....

'In the radio blackout I opened the little plastic packages which contained bread and wine.

'I poured the wine into the chalice our church had given me. In the one-sixth gravity of the moon the wine curled slowly and gracefully up the side of the cup. It was interesting to think that the very first liquid ever poured on the moon, and the first food eaten there, were communion elements.'""

That Holy Communion wine, curling slowly and gracefully up the side of the cup, was the idyll. The secret drama?

""[Aldrin] originally wanted for the experience to be broadcast with the rest of his comments, but wasdiscouraged by NASA, which was at the time fighting a lawsuit brought by atheist activist Madalyn Murray O'Hair. She sued them over the public reading of Genesis by the crew of Apollo 8, citing the status of astronauts as government employees and the separation of church and state to support her case.""

""Separation of church and state?"" Nowhere in the First Amendment, nor anywhere in the U.S. Constitution, does the phrase ""a wall of separation between church and state"" exist. That was from a letter from President Jefferson to a Baptist congregation, in Danbury, Connecticut, in 1802.

""I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people [meaning, the First Amendment to the Constitution] which declared that their legislature should ""make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,"" thus building a wall of separation between Church & State. Adhering to this expression of the supreme will of the nation in behalf of the rights of conscience, I shall see with sincere satisfaction the progress of those sentiments which tend to restore to man all his natural rights, convinced he has no natural right in opposition to his social duties.""

The interpretation of this letter has been badly warped. As historian Thomas S. Kidd, Senior Fellow at the Institute for Studies of Religion at Baylor University wrote for the History News Network:

""Jefferson represents a kind of political animal we would never see today: a person skeptical about Jesus's divinity and resurrection, yet backed by evangelical supporters who loved his deep commitment to religious liberty. He wanted to end sectarian religious preferences in law, but he generously honored a public role for religion. Despite his own doubts about Christianity, Jefferson realized that America was a place of both religious diversity and religious strength. His vision of church-state separation would protect these conditions under the expansive canopy of religious liberty. Maybe activists on both extremes of the debate over church-state relations today could learn something from his example.""

President John F. Kennedy's Executive Order against discrimination in federal employment begins ""discrimination because of race, creed, color, or national origin is contrary to the Constitutional principles and policies of the United States....""

The New Oxford American Dictionary gives the primary meaning of ""creed"" as ""a system of Christian or other religious belief; a faith."" To discriminate against people on the basis of their religious belief is itself well known as a form of bigotry. Arbiters of our new cultural hegemony have managed to stigmatize those of faith and conflate some of its elements, such as religiously orthodox codes of sexual morality, with bigotry.

The informal censorship by NASA of Buzz Aldrin's perfectly lovely, perfectly legitimate, celebration of Communion on the Moon was an ominous precursor of something now slouching to be born.

Apollo 11 deposited the first Bible verse on the Moon. The Vatican supplied Psalm 8, ""Jahweh our Lord, how great your name through the earth, above the heavens is your majesty chanted,"" as part of the contents of a disc containing messages from 73 countries. On the flight home Aldrin broadcast a recitation of the second and third verse of the same Psalm:

""I've been reflecting the events of the past several days and a verse from the Psalms comes to mind to me. 'When I consider the heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars which thou hast ordained, what is man that thou art mindful of him?'""

These inspiring words, like celebrating Communion on the Moon, in no way denigrate other, or even non, believers. Diversity applies to creed as well as to color.

There is room to honor diverse creeds and those who hold them. Progressives celebrate diversity. Whether secular or religious those of us engaged in Living Room Conversations celebrate difference.

When I consider the heavens,

the work of thy fingers,

the moon and the stars....",2,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/living-room-conversations/the-secret-communion-of-t_b_10494774.html

Sick of Hate Politics? We are too.

Call our current epoch The Political Night of the Living Dead. Zombie Politics.

There is a way to transform it. That way is rooted in a metaphorical Polynesian-style kiss.

Call it a conspiracy. You are invited to join.

The word ""conspire"" comes from the Latin con -- ""together with"" -- and spirarare -- to breathe. ""Conspire,"" at its root, means ""to breathe together."" The needed conspiracy is a ""conspiracy to conspire.""

To breathe together.

The Polynesian people -- such as the Hawai'ians -- had (some still have) a custom of greeting by ""honi."" Honi means ""touching nose-to-nose and inhaling or essentially sharing each other's breaths.""

This is akin to the better known ""Eskimo kiss"" of the Inuit, rubbing noses. This is high civilization. It points the way out of our Political Night of the Living Dead.

Westerners settling in Hawai'i greeted people with the handshakes customary to European culture. The Polynesians considered this strange custom, well, strange. They called the Westerners ""haoli.""

Haoli means breathless. ""The implication is not only that foreigners are aloof and ignorant of local ways, but also have 'no spirit or life within....'""

Breathless. Like... Zombies. Today we confront a kind of Zombified, breathless, politics. We can change that.

Many of us passionately hold to progressive or conservative doctrine. Our respective leaders have been locking antlers like two bucks for a very long time.

Breathtaking spectacle!

Yet it has drawbacks.

Progressives keep winning policy fights. Conservatives keep winning bigger political majorities. It's something of a Mexican Standoff.

The breathless spectacle of Zombified politics -- the handshake, or, as is much more prevalent at the moment, the punch-in-the-nose -- has fundamental deficiencies. We diminish ourselves if we do not make the space to appreciate the grains of truth held by those with whom we disagree.

We lose something ineffably precious. We lose our ""spirit or life within.""

It is to something very like this loss that T.S. Eliot may have been alluding in The Hollow Men.

Waking alone

At the hour when we are

Trembling with tenderness

Lips that would kiss

Form prayers to broken stone.

The broken stone, of course, sounds like the dogma to which we all are prey.

Now Radical Vast Left Wing Conspiracy Warrior Woman Joan Blades, co-founder of MoveOn.org and MomsRising.org, sets out, quietly, to transform the rules of the political game. (Again.)

Joan Blades is co-creating perhaps her most subversive group yet: LivingRoomConversations.org. Its process resembles, metaphorically, the Polynesian custom of ""touching nose-to-nose and inhaling or essentially sharing each other's breaths.""

Why call this ""subversive?"" ""Subvert"" derives from sub -- ""below"" -- and vertere -- ""to turn."" Subversion is not inherently sinister. It has dignity. Subversive, from its root, means working from the base to steer the system.

Steering from the base was exactly what MoveOn, under the leadership of its founders Joan Blades and Wes Boyd, did in helping defend Bill Clinton from impeachment and in opposing the invasion of Iraq. It mobilized millions of progressives to steer our elected officials.

This proved, patiently, potent. Transformational, even.

Joan Blade's new vision, shared by the tiny team of activists animating LivingRoomConversations.org, is of ""a world in which people who have fundamental differences of opinion and backgrounds work together with respect - and even joy - to realize the vibrant future we all desire.""

Living Room Conversational Conspirators only metaphorically, not literally, rub noses. We share each other's insights with respect. The process is different from the domineering conspiracies now dominating.

It's different from everything else out there. It's not argumentative. It offers richer, more nuanced, outcomes without asking either progressives or conservatives to abandon even an iota of principle.

Not always but often our ideological adversaries have some legitimate points. To require our adversaries' ""unconditional surrender"" often wreaks an injustice. The demand for unconditional surrender also deprives us of the benefits of learning from valuable insights residing in our adversary's counter-narrative.

For this New Conspiracy to succeed it needs only people like you to support the Living over the Living Dead. It honors the great, proto-existentialist, Nietzsche's trenchant commandment: ""Whoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster.""

There is a way to bring the Political Night of the Living Dead to an end. Simply breathe together.

Come. Join this New Conspiracy, the Conspiracy to Conspire.

Breathe together.

End Zombie politics.

In the previous installment I describe the beginnings of my long search for Them -- The Bad Guys -- and the disconcerting recognition that there may be no Them. Just Us.

Progressive master strategist Patrick Reinsborough (See Part One!) introduced me to Ilyse Hogue, recently departed from the Rainforest Action Network to become the political director of the dreaded MoveOn.org. I promptly joined MoveOn -- hey, no dues! -- as its one dissident member out of, then, two (now eight) million. I became fascinated by MoveOn. While certainly progressive and activist MoveOn proved to have real decency both as to its own community and even as to the policies it advocated.

I became so fascinated by MoveOn that I wrote an internationally award-winning cult classic book, The Websters' Dictionary: how to use the Web to transform the world about it and how it did what it did. Ilyse proved an admirable and deeply likable person. She invited me to a MoveOn party in Pittsburgh some years later where I was attending the Right Online counter-conference. The MoveOn party was DJ'd by Shep ""Manufacturing Quality Dissent Since 1989"" Fairey (the artist of the iconic Obama HOPE poster). Shep, in a delightful conversation, also proved yet another ... Us.

Note to readers: Capitalize with the capitalists but socialize with the socialists. They throw much better parties.

On Election Day 2008, with Obama crushing McCain, I visited Ilyse in her Secret MoveOn lair. I there presented her with a small model Fokker Tri-plane (keeping for myself a model Sopwith Camel), uttering: Curse you, Red Baroness! You crushed us! We shall meet in the skies yet again, next time to crush you. Curiously, on Election Day 2010, when the Tea Party fueled GOP swept to a House majority Ilyse informed me that her model Fokker spontaneously fell off its shelf and splintered.

Ilyse, now head of NARAL, and I could hardly be more ideologically polarized or militant. Yet what a wonderful person and arch-nemesis, Moriarty to my Holmes! (Unless, of course I am Moriarty and she Holmes. Depends on one's point of view.) Another Us.

Soon I made a trip to the Bay Area where I was received by MoveOn's co-founders and then senior leaders, Wes Boyd and Joan Blades. Joan had been ferrying her then High School daughter to cello lessons. A nice, unpretentious, middle class home from which the original MoveOn website had been designed and published and from which this civic behemoth was coordinated (via a laptop) and a most cordial reception. They said that The Websters' Dictionary was the best thing ever written on how MoveOn achieved and wielded influence.

To paraphrase Gertrude Stein (about Oakland, not the adjacent Berkeley): No Them there. Just Us folks. Joan and I began what developed into a warm friendship that evolved into my active participation with her most recent passion, LivingRoomConversations.org -- which, subversively, is arranging that ""people who have fundamental differences of opinion and backgrounds work together with respect - and even joy - to realize the vibrant future we all desire.""

Over the course of time I also had the pleasure of meeting then SEIU leaders Andy Stern and Eliseo Medina, who appeared very, very Us. Lawrence Lessig, who recently ran a brief presidential campaign as part of his ongoing efforts to bring about public financing of Congressional elections? Another Us.

Imagine my surprise when I learned that the overdemonized George Soros (who I have not met), a loyal disciple of the classical liberal (i.e. conservative) Karl Popper and friend of Hayek, turned up to speak at the Cato Institute on ""Why I Agree With (some of) Friedrich Hayek."" Us, anyone?

More recently, through LivingRoomConversations.org, this Tea Party Patriot developed a friendship with the president of the Coffee Party USA, Debilyn Molineaux. Another Us!

Dash it all! My quest to find a Them was foiled at every turn. We have profound and meaningful differences and I do not blur or minimize these. Yet it began to dawn on me that ... maybe ... there's no Them. Just Us.

This concept represents a rapidly emerging theme, just beneath the activist surface. It is seen at Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Jose Antonio Vargas's #EmergingUS. It may be found in thirty self-styled transpartisan groups collectively calling themselves the ""Bridge Alliance."" Let me note that I myself am a cispartisan, and proud. But ... live and let live. It is the essence of the increasingly influential LivingRoomConversations.org.

Disappointed? I sure was. Nothing like having a really sinister enemy to rally troops to the Cause! And yet...

Saul Alinsky (who, Surprise!, detested Big Government and loudly denounced LBJ's war on poverty as ""political pornography"") trenchantly wrote in Rules for Radicals, ""the standards of judgment must be rooted in the whys and wherefores of life as it is lived, the world as it is, not our wished-for fantasy of the world as it should be."" Sobering thought.

Not having a Them lacks drama. Yet it appears to be ""the world as it is,"" To be effective one must learn to cope with the possibility that left and right may actually be spirited adversaries rather than enemies.

Nobody here by Us.

If you, dear Reader, are one of Them do contact me. Although I'm resigned to there not being any Them it would be great to be proved wrong and to see a Them with my own eyes. (Bring a crucifix. I'll wear a garland of garlic.)

If, however, there really is nobody here but Us it opens up new possibilities. Like the possibility of people who have fundamental differences of opinion and backgrounds will work together with respect - and even joy - to realize the vibrant future we all desire.

Us versus Them. It's common parlance. They, of course, being The Bad Guys.

Among the politically impassioned (such as myself) it is a frequent trope to say that ""They"" -- meaning the Other Side -- are responsible for the many woes that plague Us (the Good Guys and the general welfare). As a (then) young conservative activist this sure made sense to me. It was, after all, a clear case of ""Us"" versus ""Them.""

But ... who were They?

Being a curious cat I decided to set out to find the nefarious Them. I wished to see Them in person, to gaze with my own eyes -- rather than through the lens of media reports -- into the malevolent eyes of ... Them.

Spoiler Alert. Over the course of this quest I met many prominent leaders of the ideological adversaries of my Tribe. Aha! I would think to myself. At long last I will meet one of Them and gaze with my own eyes with horror (insert ominous organ spike here) into the Heart of Darkness.

Imagine my consternation, followed by growing resignation, when each time it turned out that none of them was a ... Them.

By jingo! Every man jack and woman jill of them just turned out to be just another Us: someone passionately engaged in attempting, by their own narrative and best lights, to better the condition of humanity, ecology, and the world. Another ... Us. (Yawn.)

That doesn't mean I was persuaded by, or to, their agendas. Rather the opposite. I was not looking to defect. Perish the Thought. Nor does it imply that I was so rude, or naïve, as to attempt to challenge their narrative and show them the Error of Their Ways. I was not looking to make converts. I just wanted to know. And learn.

My quest began in earnest in mid-April 2000. There was a really big protest staged against the World Bank and IMF, architected by the same minds -- an anarchist collective if memory serves -- who had engineered the notorious 1999 Battle in Seattle to protest the World Trade Organization's Ministerial Meeting there. It spun out of control and ended in riots and vandalism. Yet in some ways it was prescient.

As it happens the IMF and World Bank long have been bête noirs of the right. I asked myself why should the left have all the fun? I was only able to recruit one other member of the Vast Right Wing Conspiracy to participate. (So far as I could see we were the only two there in suit and tie, having come directly from work, in a sea of thousands of blue-jean wearing protestors.) My fellow right-winger soon grew uncomfortable and left. Thus I only am escaped alone to tell thee.

It's kind of difficult to ascertain who is in a position of authority at an anarchist street action. But in the crowd there stood out -- literally, at 6'8"" -- a reed thin fellow wearing a blazer and khakis and holding a walkie-talkie. I went up to him and said, ""Pardon me, I don't know who is in charge here but I covet one of those batik flags lashed to the lamp posts. I intend to appropriate one for my collection.""

To which he replied, ""Oh, sir, please don't do that. They're private property. And they've been promised to the Smithsonian. You can buy one on our website."" Wow. An anarchist with etiquette, who respects private property, culture and commerce. Not exactly Bakunin.

I pestered him into agreeing to have coffee with me, later, once the action had settled down, and he did. Patrick Reinsborough, now of the Center for Story-based Strategy (then SmartMeme) currently described at http://beautifultrouble.org as a ""strategist, organizer and creative provocateur with over twenty years of experience campaigning for peace, justice, indigenous rights"" notwithstanding his militancy turned out to be a beautiful soul.

Just as an aside, I'm for peace, justice and indigenous rights too (although our interpretation of precisely what these mean probably differs somewhat and our views as to the best means to such ends certainly differ). Darn it. Patrick turned out not a Them. Just another Us. We commenced a warm, long distance, acquaintanceship.

Four years later I escorted him to a front row seat at a side meeting of Supply-Siders at the Republican National Convention so he could see what his Thems looked like in person. He departed with eyes as big as saucers, saying, ""It's just like we imagined! They all do sit in a room and plot our destiny!"" To which I replied, ""Oh Patrick, if it were only true! But the Party isn't listening to any of the people in that room."" (Nor was it.)

Recently I invited a friend to participate in a Living Room Conversation. He declined, saying he wasn't smart enough. He wrote back: ""I would be privileged to join you in your 'living room conversations' but, as I have reflected on it... I would love to think I am among the Listeners ... but, unfortunately, I am not that intelligent.""

This dude's plenty smart. (Just humble.)

""Not that smart,"" though, is not a disqualifier. Living Room Conversations is not a debating society set up to promote verbal jousting. It's something much more interesting (and fun). It's really about three things.

There are three, and only three, core elements to healthy politics, including healthy, rather than ugly, political arguments.

Common sense.

Common decency.

Common courtesy.

All three have become badly eroded. Ugh.

But IQ is irrelevant.

LivingRoomConversations.org is designed to restore all three to our society and then to our politics. Are you a Red State Conservative? A Blue State Progressive? A lonely Progressive in a Red State? A lonely Conservative in a Blue State (like me)? Anti-gun? Pro-gun? Global warming believer? Global warming skeptic? Friend or foe of those pesky Millennials?

Doesn't matter.

Shockingly, the ""Three Commons"" are all that's needed to transform the argument between people of radically different opinions into a fun, rather than horrid, conversation. (If only we can import the principle of the ""Three Commons"" into America's Thanksgiving family dinners imagine the miseries that will be averted. Bonus!)



We believe that the ""Three Commons"" can rescue politics from its status as a blood sport and transform it into something fun, vibrant, and productive.

Living Room Conversations isn't designed for rocket scientists. This is a good thing. Rocket scientists trend toward ""Once the rockets are up who cares where they come down, that's not my department, says Werner von Braun."" (Which violates the principle of ""Common Decency."")

And hello Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena! This doesn't mean we exclude rocket scientists either. Come join the Conversation. You'll have fun!

The tiny team behind Living Room Conversations just got into a merry discussion about what should go into a promotional postcard describing what this is all about. The proposed copy was a wall of text earnestly describing what this is and how to do it.

To which, nervously putting aside my fear of being Mr. Buzzkill, I suggested we honor classical postcard design principles and just go with Having a wonderful conversation. Wish you were here! -- LivingRoomConversations.org.

If the current presidential election is any indication -- and I suggest that it is -- politics has descended far from the Three Commons, Sense, Decency, and Courtesy. We have discovered, in practice, that these three simple, common, things are all that it takes to transform the social dynamic from animosity to enjoyable mutual discovery.

It's shockingly easy. And fun.

When I replied, along these lines, to my friend who expressed reluctance to join the party he answered: ""I am delighted to realize that I might have the opportunity to not only observe the Living Room Conversations, but, potentially, even participate. which would be a large step for me. I will look at the site.""

Are you, like him, shy?

Humble?

How great!



Those qualities are beginning to look like key assets for changing the tenor of the social conversation. The political conversation lags, rather than leads, the culture. Shyness and humility look key to resurrecting the three qualities that are all that, apparently, are needed to really Make America Great Again.

Common sense.

Common decency.

Common courtesy.

All three have become badly eroded.

But hey -- this just in! -- there's good news.

There is a startlingly easy, unexpectedly fun, way for you -- yeah, I'm talkin' to you! -- to make a meaningful impact in putting society, and even politics, back to rights. (The sooner the better. Just say'n.)

And, in the process, have fun.

This column is for those curious cats who like to listen and learn from their opposites. Trigger Warning! If that's not you, stop reading now.

Have you found the Truth? Most of us believe we have.

I certainly have! Happy to Proclaim it to you!

Just, not here. Let's pause for a moment to reflect.

Imagine a scientist running naked down the street shouting ""Eureka!"" (""I've found it!"") It's an anecdote about the ancient Greek scientist Archimedes's excitement upon discovering how to determine whether the tyrant's crown was solid gold or debased. (It's a good story, if not necessarily strictly factual.)

It holds a lesson for us. Most of our political and civic leaders -- and maybe even you and me -- enthusiastically are doing the equivalent of running naked down the street proclaiming the Truth. Naked does not necessarily offer the Naked Truth.

Trigger Warning! If you're a Proclaimer stop reading now.

The vast majority of our national conversation is not a ... conversation. It's dueling Proclamations. Both (or many) sides are so busy Speaking -- in an effort to persuade others, or at least, proclaim -- The Truth, that we just aren't Listening.

This column is for the tiny minority who find at least as much value in listening as in proclaiming. Trigger Warning! If you're not one of these, stop reading now.

Ardent Progressives believe that the benevolent government can make greedy business people be fairer and more generous (even, or maybe even especially, by increasing taxes on their money to use for social welfare and social justice and by directing them how much to pay their employees and what benefits to hand out, and so forth).

This is called social democracy. It works very well in some places. The top, year after year, happiest countries in the world are socialist, either Social Democrats or Christian Democrats, a variant of socialism. Unless one really hates on happiness, this deserves to be taken into account.

Ardent conservatives are convinced that the free market -- competition among the enterprising (even if they are deplorably greedy) -- will produce better outcomes for working people and even the poor. As I -- myself a running dog capitalist lackey (yet one devoted to the Pursuit of Happiness) -- elsewhere pointed out, ""American progressives keep promising Denmark, a true socialist workers paradise and the happiest country in the world, and delivering Detroit: now entering the Ninth Circle of Hell.""

Conservative is another word for ""liberal republican"" (small l, small r). It too works very well in some places. Even the poor, counting benefits, in America tend materially to be almost as well off as the upper middle classes around most of the world.

So, what to do? Proclaiming at, and even defaming, one another has real benefits. First of all, it has drama, which is entertaining. Nobody really watches the highly rated ""reality"" TV Kardashians for their Kumbaya moments.

Melodrama -- whether in entertainment or politics -- draws an audience that's, oh, a good 100X bigger than Snugglefests. Snugglefests have been pretty much unknown since the Teletubbies went off the air. (Love you, Noo Noo! Big Hug! Of course, Teletubbies was for a different demographic.) And as Alcuin famously wrote to Charlemagne in 798, ""Vox populi, vox Dei!"" [the voice of the people is the voice of God].

This is not at all meant to demean those who thrive on drama.

And there is an authentic heroism to those Progressives who are, very proficiently one may add, idealistically engaged in what the early Green activist, and martyr to the Cause, Rudi Dutschke called the ""'long march through the institutions of power' to create radical change from within government and society.""

Equally there is authentic heroism to those Conservatives who are engaged in a noble, if rather desperate, crusade to maintain the classical liberal republican order. We see ourselves as devoted to peace, prosperity, and human dignity. (Microaggression Threat Alert: I am one of Those!)

Between Them (possibly including you) and Us (me and a heroic handful of others) there's a great, world historical, drama under way. Much is at stake.

It's all around us. Perhaps 99% of the populace, even self-styled Independents, is busy Proclaiming Truth.

And yet what about the ""Other 1%""? These are the Listeners. The Listeners tend to find something rather unsettling, if not outright absurd, about watching the rest of us running buck naked down the street shouting Eureka! And proclaiming the Truth! Might we not at least consider ... covering our tushies?

Here's a quiet revelation for you. The Listeners, by and large, are not saps. They are not sentimental creatures who merely crave a Big Hug. They are a tiny yet discerning minority who intuit the wisdom of quantum physicist Niels Bohr (who incorporated the tai chi ball at the center his self-designed coat-of-arms). Bohr once observed ""How wonderful that we have met with a paradox. Now we have some hope of making progress.""

The Listeners will never be anything other than a tiny minority. That said if the Listeners come out of the closet they have the potency, and power, to become the yeast in the loaf of society, leavening our culture. ""Leaven,"" in addition to its meaning of, typically, yeast, has, says the New Oxford American Dictionary, a secondary meaning: ""a pervasive influence that modifies something or transforms it for the better."" Leaven is small but transformative.

So, how to unleash the Power of the Listeners? LivingRoomConversations.org was formed to help the Listeners out of the closet. It was co-founded by bodacious Progressive warrior Joan Blades. And yet it has managed to attract archconservatives such as me, a closeted Listener.

Its vision is one of ""a world in which people who have fundamental differences of opinion and backgrounds work together with respect - and even joy - to realize the vibrant future we all desire."" It's not meant in any way to demean or undermine Progressive or Conservative culture warriors.

Nothing, really, could, or should, do that. Still....

If you've read through three Trigger Warnings and a Microaggression Alert perhaps you, too, are a Listener. If this describes you, hey, come out of the closet. (It's safe now.) Unleash your power as part of a pervasive influence that has the power to transform our society, our culture, and our future for the better.

You might find having a living room conversation even more enjoyable than passing the popcorn while watching us run around naked Proclaiming the Truth! If so, let us know.

Donald Trump continues to sound a lot like Saul Alinsky.

Also comes Dilbert creator Scott Adams plausibly claiming that Trump literally is a ""Master Wizard"" using hypnosis on us. As one of ""us"" I considered this theory worth examining. The evidence shows that Donald Trump is, in fact, using technique indistinguishable from hypnosis.

First: Trump as Alinsky. Byron York recently presented A brief theory of Trump’s outrageousness:

Then Trump got to the heart of the matter. ""The word compromise is absolutely fine. But if you are going to compromise, ask for about three times more than you want. You understand? So when you compromise, you get what you want.""

The identical sentiment was shared in Rules for Radicals wherein Saul Alinksy wrote:

But to the organizer, compromise is a key and beautiful word. It is always present in the pragmatics of operation. It is making the deal, getting that vital breather, usually the victory. If you start with nothing, demand 100 percent, then compromise for 30 per cent, you're 30 per cent ahead.

I recently pointed out here that Trump actively employs 12 of Alinsky’s 13 tactical rules. This almost surely is a matter of “great minds working alike” rather than Trump being directly influenced by Alinsky's teachings (as indeed were the young Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton).

Now something even more interesting than Trump emulating Alinsky has come to light. In a recent interview with Reason TV, Scott Adams, “prolific author, blogger, and creator of the massively popular comic strip Dilbert:

[T]he media are being trolled by a skilled manipulator, or in Adams's parlance, a Master Wizard. … ""What I [see] in Trump,"" says Adams, is ""someone who was highly trained. A lot of the things that the media were reporting as sort of random insults and bluster and just Trump being Trump, looked to me like a lot of deep technique that I recognized from the fields of hypnosis and persuasion."" One such technique is what Adams describes as a ""linguistic kill shot,"" in which Trump uses an engineered set of words that changes or ends an argument decisively. According to Adams, when Trump describes Jeb Bush as low energy, Carly Fiorina as robotic, or Ben Carson as nice, he's imprinting a label you already feel about these people. They're not random insults, but linguistic kill shots that you can never get out of your mind. Similarly, where the media see random insults, Adams sees Trump creating a significant polling gap between those who attack him and those who compliment him, resulting in chilled aggression from his opponents. Trump, says Adams, uses ""anchors,"" which are big, visual thoughts that drown out any other argument.

Trump may not be alone in employing political hypnosis. The Journal Sentinel Online reports that a New ad portrays Feingold as hypnotist:

A group targeting former U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold has a new ad out portraying him as hypnotist trying to make the public forget his past votes. … The ad by the anti-Feingold Wisconsin Alliance for Reform shows him dangling a stopwatch as if he were hypnotizing viewers to forget his votes for tax hikes, immigration reform and … Obamacare.

There is no hard evidence that Donald Trump (or Russ Feingold) received training in hypnosis. Pace Adams, it is far more likely that Trump, especially, has a natural gift, developed by his work in reality television. As the Washington Post’s Frances Stead Sellers recorded in What Trump Learned On The Apprentice:

“I’ve never had lessons,” Trump said. “I’ve always felt comfortable in front of a camera. Either you’re good at it or you’re not good at it.” The show’s climatic boardroom meetings, he said, in characteristically boastful form, were a reflection of his natural talents. “It was 100 percent ad lib,” he said. “Directly from me.” Some who got to know Trump through the show say they have not been surprised in recent months to watch him perform in similar fashion on different stages. Trump, for instance, regularly holds forth before packed auditoriums with seemingly stream-of-consciousness speeches that captivate his audiences.

Just how does Trump ""captivate his audiences""? Hypnosis would explain it to perfection.

Hypnosis has absolutely nothing to do with a swinging pocket watch. The swinging watch is an obsolete device — and cultural cliché — for inducing a hypnotic state. Hypnosis simply involves gently inducing a reverie, a state like a daydream: deep relaxation coupled with heightened alertness, while engaging the faculty of the imagination and softened analytic faculty, coupled with the power of suggestion. First rate politicians routinely employ this technique.

Hypnosis is a lot like yoga and meditation. In fact it historically is related to these, the word itself having been coined by 19th century Scottish surgeon James Braid, the father of modern hypnosis, whose work clearly demonstrates his close study of both. Like yoga and meditation hypnosis is moving through the “Rogers production adoption curve.”

Hypnosis, like sushi, is moving out of “fringe” or “risky” into “new” and even “hot.” Hypnotism was placed under a dark cloud in popular imagination by George du Maurier, in his 1894 novel Trilby. This book now is long forgotten but was an international sensation, a Harry Potter of its era.

You may never have heard of Trilby. You have heard of its anti-hero, the sinister hypnotist Svengali, a fictional character devised by du Maurier. ""Svengali"" entered, and still haunts, the popular imagination.

Hypnosis’s sinister characterization was perpetuated by Hollywood as a fantastic trope. Consider such classic films as The Manchurian Candidate. (Happy 100th, Ol’ Blue Eyes!)

Believing in Hollywood myths of hypnotism is akin to believing in Dracula, werewolves, and zombies. These make for a great pulp entertainment. As often is the case with Hollywood (as in Washington) dramatic license trumps facts.

So? Are Trump (and Feingold) really using hypnosis?

What is hypnosis? What’s its relevance to politics?

Short answers: Trump is using something indistinguishable from hypnosis. Feingold, perhaps, too. Understanding hypnosis is relevant if it is being used, in this political campaign, on us.

What is hypnosis? Dilbert creator Scott Adams blogged about hypnosis, in which he was thoroughly trained, a decade ago in his Dilbert Blog:

I describe the state of hypnosis as acquiring a power. The subject has all of his regular faculties operating plus he gains some more, if he has no objection to those new powers. For example, a subject under hypnosis would get a little extra power in one or more of these areas: 1. Extra relaxation 2. Extra imagination 3. Extra focus Those extra powers don’t sound like much, but they are. … About one person in five can experience what hypnotists call “the phenomena.” For those people, their powers of imagination become so strong it is almost indistinguishable from reality.

Key word: Imagination.

Ben Franklin, long ago, was made a royal commissioner in France. He, among other leading savants, was appointed by King Louis XVI to a royal commission to investigate a precursor to hypnosis, Mesmerism. The Commission’s report disposed of the claim that it was based in an invisible force called “animal magnetism.”

The Commission concluded that “the chief causes of the affects are contact, imagination, and imitation.”

Key word: Imagination.

We need not go back to the 18th century. One of the most esteemed psychologists of the 20th century was Stanford professor Ernest Hilgard.

Hilgard and his wife founded, and directed for over 20 years, the Laboratory of Hypnosis Research at Stanford. The American Psychological Association named its Lifetime Achievement Award for Hilgard. This rather neatly offsets hypnosis’s sinister reputation. Hilgard once succinctly defined hypnosis as “believed-in imagination” (personal communication to Michael Yapko, PhD).

Key word: Imagination.

When a political figure appeals to our imagination that is indistinguishable from hypnosis.

Consider Napoleon. He observed:

What a thing is imagination! Here are men who don't know me, who have never seen me, but who only knew of me, and they are moved by my presence, they would do anything for me! And this same incident arises in all centuries and in all countries! Such is fanaticism! Yes, imagination rules the world. The defect of our modern institutions is that they do not speak to the imagination. By that alone can man be governed; without it he is but a brute.

Donald Trump, in his presidential (and perhaps Russ Feingold in his senatorial) race, speaks directly to the voters’ imagination. This is nothing more, or less, than political hypnosis. The ""hypnosis hypothesis,"" even better than Byron York’s “brief theory of Trump’s outrageousness,” may explain Trump’s persistence as the Republican front runner.

Imagination is powerful. That said hypnosis may not be sufficient to carry Donald Trump all the way to nomination or election.

""Believed-in-imagination"" — hypnosis — can be used to great political effect. Still, political hypnosis has limits with which Napoleon ultimately failed, and with which Donald Trump may yet have, to reckon. Yet hypnosis is a force very much to be reckoned with.

As Napoleon said, more than once, ""Imagination rules the world.""

Consider the ""hypnosis hypothesis.""",2,http://www.forbes.com/sites/ralphbenko/2015/11/28/donald-trump-political-mass-hypnotist/
399,Benko,Ralph,huffingtonpost,"As a fairly notorious archconservative I like to tease (in a friendly way) my very dear Progressive friends. One tease is by telling them that I get most of my information from Rolling Stone, Mother Jones, The New York Review of Books, The New Yorker, The Atlantic Monthly, The New York Times, and NPR ... just as do most Tea Partiers.



This actually is true for me. The tease resides in the assertion that most Tea Partiers do too. Most people -- from the left and the right -- go to publications that reflect their own biases. (We all are biased.) Conservatives are more likely to read National Review, progressives to read MoJo. So what's up with my eccentric reading (and, hello NPR, listening) habits?



Confession: I find very little benefit in reading the thoughts of those with whom I already, usually, agree. There's very little to learn from that. What is really interesting, to me, is to seek out the ideas of the best minds with whom I disagree. Paying respectful attention to thoughts from a counternarrative challenges my thinking.



Paying attention to the perspectives of others helps me keep myself out of (or at least minimize) my own blind spots. (We all have blind spots.) It helps me address the soggy bits in my own worldview. It also has generated in me huge respect for my ideological adversaries, even when, as usual, I am not persuaded by their arguments.



Nassim Nicholas Taleb's provocative 2007 mega best seller, The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable, introduces an important thought. Talib, as an aside, notes



""One highlight of the year 2006 was to find in my mailbox a draft manuscript of a book called Cognitive Diversity: How Our Individual Differences Produce Collective Benefits, by Scott Page. Page examines the effects of cognitive diversity on problem solving and shows how variability in views and methods acts like an engine for tinkering. It works like evolution. By subverting the big structures we get rid of the Platonified one way of doing things--in the end, the bottom-up theory-free empiricist should prevail.""



""Cognitive diversity"" means we see things and process information differently and thereby together are more able to spot opportunities that more likely would elude any one of us. This is an old insight splendidly dressed up in a fancy new name.



There is a famous Eastern parable. Wikipedia relays its use by the Buddha:

Some of us are sick of the vilification of political adversaries, whether right-wingers insinuating scandalous conduct by Hillary Clinton or left-wing agitprop against the Koch brothers. We can disagree with our adversaries, even passionately, without attributing sinister motives or magical powers to them.



Having ""I'm right and you're wrong"" factions is hardly a new thing. Remember Buffalo Springfield's great 1967 anthem, For What It's Worth (by the great Steven Stills)? ""There's battle lines being drawn/ Nobody's right if everybody's wrong ... Singing songs and carrying signs/ Mostly say, hooray for our side.""



Almost 50 years later our signs still ""Mostly say hooray for our side."" Yet there are two sides to most everyone's two cents. (OK, not Donald Trump. Just in general.) As Stills suggested polarization really doesn't work out so well.



There is another, starker, description of polarization: Paranoid Style. In 1964 Richard Hofstadter wrote a now-classic article in Harper's Magazine entitled The Paranoid Style in American Politics. Hofstadter begins this essay:



American politics has often been an arena for angry minds. In recent years we have seen angry minds at work mainly among extreme right-wingers, who have now demonstrated in the Goldwater movement how much political leverage can be got out of the animosities and passions of a small minority. But behind this I believe there is a style of mind that is far from new and that is not necessarily right-wing.

He goes on:



I call it the paranoid style simply because no other word adequately evokes the sense of heated exaggeration, suspiciousness, and conspiratorial fantasy that I have in mind.

Hofstadter inventories many instances, from Joseph McCarthy's rabid anti-communism, to an 1895 Populist Party manifesto against the gold standard, to an 1855 anti-Catholic movement, followed by a litany of other examples:



In the anti-Masonic movement, the nativist and anti-Catholic movement, in certain spokesmen of abolitionism who regarded the United States as being in the grip of a slaveholders' conspiracy, in many alarmists about the Mormons, in some Greenback and Populist writers who constructed a great conspiracy of international bankers, in the exposure of a munitions makers' conspiracy of World War I, in the popular left-wing press, in the contemporary American right wing....

The Paranoid Style leads to many problems in our ability to seize opportunities, many of which are only available if most of us participate ... together. (The Paranoid Style, humorless, also is just a drag.)



Looking for an Exit Ramp?

Exit here to Post-Paranoid Politics.



There are a number of great people and groups seeking an end to the Paranoid Style in Politics. I myself -- a certified member of the Vast Right Wing Conspiracy, nobody to the right of me! -- am intimately involved with arch-progressive Joan Blades's LivingRoomConversations.org.

Another member of its leadership, Debilyn Molineaux, also is national head of the Coffee Party that propounds a civility pledge ""to conduct myself in a way that is civil, honest, and respectful toward people with whom I disagree. I value people from different cultures, I value people with different ideas, and I value and cherish the democratic process.""



There are other groups, some calling themselves ""transpartisan,"" many constituting themselves into a ""Bridge Alliance"" committed to ""come together in civility, respect, and goodwill to solve problems together. Together, we can become a powerful and positive voice in the American political landscape advocating 'Country Before Party.'""



Is this news to you? It should be! The News Business thrives on reporting conflict. Joan Blades calls LivingRoomConversations.org a ""domestic peace initiative."" Peace is really bad for newspaper circulation so ... don't be shocked if this is the first you have heard of this.



Might not be the last. Thanks to the Huffington Post we've chipped a tiny hole in the Big Media Blackout.

Yes, peace makes for boring blogs ... like this very one. Yet Peace is Healthy For Children And Other Living Things. We're unrepentant.



If you love being in an ""arena of angry minds,"" if ""animosities and passions"" are your idea of a good time, congratulations! Look around. The media is glutted with animosities. Feast on!



If, rather, you're curious about the rumored secret Exit Ramp from the Pain Lane of Paranoid Style Politics Freeway ...you just found it. Now you are in on the secret of this Very Underground Movement for Post-Paranoid Style Politics.

This spirit, unfortunately, is inseparable from our nature, having its root in the strongest passions of the human mind. It exists under different shapes in all governments, more or less stifled, controlled, or repressed; but, in those of the popular form, it is seen in its greatest rankness, and is truly their worst enemy.

The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by the spirit of revenge, natural to party dissension, which in different ages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is itself a frightful despotism. ...

[T]he common and continual mischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it the interest and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain it.

It serves always to distract the public councils and enfeeble the public administration. It agitates the community with ill-founded jealousies and false alarms, kindles the animosity of one part against another, foments occasionally riot and insurrection. ...

And there being constant danger of excess, the effort ought to be by force of public opinion, to mitigate and assuage it. A fire not to be quenched, it demands a uniform vigilance to prevent its bursting into a flame, lest, instead of warming, it should consume.",2,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/living-room-conversations/washington-prevent-its-bu_b_8155808.html

405,Benko,Ralph,forbes,"The Denver Post, on February 15th, ran an Associated Press article entitled Homeland Security aims to buy 1.6b rounds of ammo, so far to little notice. It confirmed that the Department of Homeland Security has issued an open purchase order for 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition. As reported elsewhere, some of this purchase order is for hollow-point rounds, forbidden by international law for use in war, along with a frightening amount specialized for snipers. Also reported elsewhere, at the height of the Iraq War the Army was expending less than 6 million rounds a month. Therefore 1.6 billion rounds would be enough to sustain a hot war for 20+ years. In America.

Add to this perplexing outré purchase of ammo, DHS now is showing off its acquisition of heavily armored personnel carriers, repatriated from the Iraqi and Afghani theaters of operation. As observed by “paramilblogger” Ken Jorgustin last September:

[T]he Department of Homeland Security is apparently taking delivery (apparently through the Marine Corps Systems Command, Quantico VA, via the manufacturer – Navistar Defense LLC) of an undetermined number of the recently retrofitted 2,717 ‘Mine Resistant Protected’ MaxxPro MRAP vehicles for service on the streets of the United States.” These MRAP’s ARE BEING SEEN ON U.S. STREETS all across America by verified observers with photos, videos, and descriptions."" Regardless of the exact number of MRAP’s being delivered to DHS (and evidently some to POLICE via DHS, as has been observed), why would they need such over-the-top vehicles on U.S. streets to withstand IEDs, mine blasts, and 50 caliber hits to bullet-proof glass? In a war zone… yes, definitely. Let’s protect our men and women. On the streets of America… ?"" … “They all have gun ports… Gun Ports? In the theater of war, yes. On the streets of America…? Seriously, why would DHS need such a vehicle on our streets?”

Why indeed? It is utterly inconceivable that Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano is planning a coup d’etat against President Obama, and the Congress, to install herself as Supreme Ruler of the United States of America. There, however, are real signs that the Department bureaucrats are running amok. About 20 years ago this columnist worked, for two years, in the U.S. Department of Energy’s general counsel’s office in its procurement and finance division. And is wise to the ways. The answer to “why would DHS need such a vehicle?” almost certainly is this: it’s a cool toy and these (reportedly) million dollar toys are being recycled, without much of a impact on the DHS budget. So… why not?

Why, indeed, should the federal government not be deploying armored personnel carriers and stockpiling enough ammo for a 20-year war in the homeland? Because it’s wrong in every way. President Obama has an opportunity, now, to live up to some of his rhetoric by helping the federal government set a noble example in a matter very close to his heart (and that of his Progressive base), one not inimical to the Bill of Rights: gun control. The federal government can (for a nice change) begin practicing what it preaches by controlling itself.

Remember the Sequester? The president is claiming its budget cuts will inconvenience travelers by squeezing essential services provided by the (opulently armed and stylishly uniformed) DHS. Quality ammunition is not cheap. (Of course, news reports that DHS is about to spend $50 million on new uniforms suggests a certain cavalier attitude toward government frugality.)

Spending money this way is beyond absurd well into perverse. According to the AP story a DHS spokesperson justifies this acquisition to “help the government get a low price for a big purchase.” Peggy Dixon, spokeswoman for the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center: “The training center and others like it run by the Homeland Security Department use as many as 15 million rounds every year, mostly on shooting ranges and in training exercises.”

At 15 million rounds (which, in itself, is pretty extraordinary and sounds more like fun target-shooting-at-taxpayer-expense than a sensible training exercise) … that’s a stockpile that would last DHS over a century. To claim that it’s to “get a low price” for a ridiculously wasteful amount is an argument that could only fool a career civil servant.

Meanwhile, Senator Diane Feinstein, with the support of President Obama, is attempting to ban 100 capacity magazine clips. Doing a little apples-to-oranges comparison, here, 1.6 billion rounds is … 16 million times more objectionable.

Mr. Obama has a long history of disdain toward gun ownership. According to Prof. John Lott, in Debacle, a book he co-authored with iconic conservative strategist Grover Norquist,

“When I was first introduced to Obama (when both worked at the University of Chicago Law School, where Lott was famous for his analysis of firearms possession), he said, ‘Oh, you’re the gun guy.’ I responded: ‘Yes, I guess so.’ ’I don’t believe that people should own guns,’ Obama replied. I then replied that it might be fun to have lunch and talk about that statement some time. He simply grimaced and turned away. … Unlike other liberal academics who usually enjoyed discussing opposing ideas, Obama showed disdain.”

Mr. Obama? Where’s the disdain now? Cancelling, or at minimum, drastically scaling back — by 90% or even 99%, the DHS order for ammo, and its receipt and deployment of armored personnel carriers, would be a “fourfer.”

The federal government would set an example of restraint in the matter of weaponry.

It would reduce the deficit without squeezing essential services.

It would do both in a way that was palatable to liberals and conservatives, slightly depolarizing America.

It would somewhat defuse, by the government making itself less armed-to-the-teeth, the anxiety of those who mistrust the benevolence of the federales.

If Obama doesn’t show any leadership on this matter it’s an opportunity for Rep. Darrell Issa, chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, and Rep. Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, to summon Secretary Napolitano over for a little national conversation. Madame Secretary? Buying 1.6 billion rounds of ammo and deploying armored personnel carriers runs contrary, in every way, to what “homeland security” really means. Discuss.

406,Paul,Rand,foxbusiness,"Americans have suffered too long from this pandemic. But we can see a new day dawning on the horizon. Coronavirus infections are on the decline, and with three different vaccines now on the market, an end to the pandemic is within reach.

Our economy is beginning to recover as people return to work. The unemployment rate plummeted from nearly 15 percent last April to just over 6 percent this February. State lockdowns are finally being lifted and our economy is getting back on its feet.

Unfortunately, some lawmakers intend to exploit this critical time in order to pass a partisan goody bag — the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, or the PRO Act — that solely benefits labor unions while ignoring the rights of millions of American workers.

BIDEN'S $2.5T INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN INCLUDES PRO-UNION LEGISLATION

The PRO Act would, among other things, likely reclassify countless independent contractors as employees under the National Labor Relations Act. This reclassification would rob millions of workers of the right to set their own terms and schedule their own work hours. The bill would also strike down right-to-work laws in 27 states, including Kentucky’s, which guarantee every worker has the “free and fair choice to join a union,” as our president put it.

It would also force employers to hand over their employees' private information — including cellphone numbers and home addresses — to union organizers, exposing them to harassment and intimidation. This bill not only erodes the privacy rights of workers but strips them of their ability to vote both on a union contract and through a secret ballot over whether to unionize.

This harmful legislation could not come at a worse time. Lawmakers should know this. The PRO Act represents a massive upheaval in our labor market and erases more than 70 years of established labor law. It would undermine the livelihoods of tens of millions of independent contractors at a time when they can least afford it.

SEN. LEE WANTS TO STRIP NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD OF POWER

If you want to see how this legislation would work in practice, look no further than California’s Assembly Bill 5, a law passed in late 2019 intended to reclassify most of the state’s independent contractors. AB 5 employs what is called an ABC test that regulators use to determine which independent contractors would be pushed into traditional employment — the same test the PRO Act would implement.

The law’s supporters never seemed to wonder whether these workers might prefer their flexible arrangements — or if businesses could afford this costly mandate.

The law further worsened California's lackluster job numbers, forcing thousands of freelancers out of work entirely. It subjected photographers to onerous and frankly bizarre mandates limiting the number of pictures they could send to clients.

The law also made it nearly impossible for optometrists, yoga instructors, pharmacists, writers, speech therapists, and wedding planners — among countless other professions — to take on more clients as independent contractors.

It didn't matter how hard lawmakers hoped clients would place them on the payroll as their own employees. Vox Media, for example, was forced to lay off hundreds of its California-based freelance writers, hiring only a tiny fraction of them back for full and part-time work. Now, some in Congress want to recreate this on a national scale with the PRO Act.

WHAT ARE RIGHT TO WORK LAWS?

Supporters of the bill claim companies are exploiting independent contractors. But there's simply no evidence for that claim. In fact, nearly 80 percent of independent contractors say they prefer their flexible work arrangements.

Why should we assume members of Congress understand the interests of these workers better than they do?

What’s more, this bill gets the facts of right-to-work laws dead wrong. Right-to-work states typically experience faster manufacturing and overall job growth, greater growth in household consumption, and higher disposable and overall cost of living adjusted incomes. That's why 74 members of the House of Representatives have signed onto the National Right to Work Act — with 16 senators supporting the Senate version — which would ensure that union membership is purely voluntary and will protect workers from being fired if they opt-out of joining a union.

Unfortunately, the PRO Act would represent a step backward in the progress we've made since the pandemic hit our shores and make it more difficult for Americans to earn a living for themselves and their families. The American people oppose its provisions. Lawmakers should, too.

(SEATTLE) Construction workers and restaurant workers working in group settings will be eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine starting March 31, Gov. Jay Inslee announced Thursday.

In a Thursday press conference Inslee said the state's vaccine supply had reached a level where eligibility could be expanded, KOMO reported. Along with construction workers and restaurant workers, the expansion will make eligible anyone over age 60, anyone working in congregate settings and anyone living in group settings such as correctional facilities and group homes.

The expansion covers what many had called a gap in most recent eligibility guidelines, which allow grocery workers to receive a dose but not restaurant workers. Restaurant workers and others made the point that restaurant employees have to deal with unmasked people in closer quarters for longer than do employees at most groceries.

Anyone with two comorbidities will also be eligible starting March 31. KOMO reported that comorbidities include chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), being immunocompromised from an organ transplant, serious heart conditions, sickle cell disease, diabetes, cancer, cerebrovascular disease, obesity and asthma, as well as high blood pressure, liver disease and smoking.",1,https://www.newsbreak.com/washington/seattle/news/2185927297561/construction-restaurant-workers-vaccine-eligible-starting-march-31

(BOISE, Idaho) The Idaho Legislature voted Friday to shut down for multiple weeks after five lawmakers tested positive for COVID-19, according to ABC News.

At least five of the 70 House members tested positive for COVID in the last week, prompting the unprecedented vote to end the legislative session with unfinished business, including votes on budgets and an income tax cut.

One member who tested positive is a Democrat and the other four are Republicans, and three who tested positive had been participating in floor debates.

According to ABC, the Legislature, which has Republican supermajorities in both the House and Senate, has sought to curb the emergency powers of the governor and limit the ability of localities to require people to wear masks. In the Legislature itself, Democrat lawmakers typically wear masks while the majority of Republicans reportedly do not.

Around 175,000 Idahoans have been infected with COVID-19, resulting in over 1,900 deaths in a population of around 1.8 million. Around 200,000 people have received two-shot vaccines and around 125,000 have received a single shot, according to ABC.",1,https://www.newsbreak.com/idaho/boise/news/2185950827399/idaho-legislature-ends-session-early-due-to-covid-19-outbreak

A New York Republican member of Congress, considering a potential run against Gov. Andrew Cuomo, has been accused of sexually harassing a U.S. Army lieutenant in 2017.

Nicolette Davis told The Washington Post, per Politico, Rep. Tom Reed “drunkenly came onto her” in an Irish pub and she alleged he placed his hand on her thigh and unhooked her bra.

A person seated near Davis allegedly helped escort Reed out of the bar in Minneapolis bar after she tried to separate herself from the congressman.

Reed and Davis were in the city to benefit former Rep. Erik Paulsen’s campaign.

The Republican congressmen, who declined to be interviewed by the Post, denied the allegation.

“This account of my actions is not accurate,” Reed said in a statement to The Post.

Davis told the paper she was inspired to come forward as she takes on a leadership role in the army and prior to Reed announcing his consideration of running for governor.

""I need to always act in good conscience and set the right example for the soldiers I will lead, including younger females,” she told the Post. “I hope it will allow people who have endured similar experiences to feel confident enough to say something.”

Reed has been critical of Cuomo, who has been accused of sexually harassing at least six women.

“These incidents of sexual harassment and pattern of abuse are abhorrent and have absolutely no place in our society, let alone the highest rungs of government,"" Reed said in February. ""Such behavior is disturbing and unacceptable.”

The congressman, who has also called for Cuomo to be impeached, supported efforts to combat sexual harassment and other misconduct, including drafting a resolution to enforce sexual harassment training.",1,https://www.newsbreak.com/news/2185905215089/new-york-gop-congressman-mulling-run-against-cuomo-accused-of-sexual-misconduct

Five people are no longer employed with the White House, while other members are being asked to work from home.

A White House official said those who are no longer employed had additional security concerns, including hard drug use.

Staffers are required to file for clearances, including answering detailed background check questions involving past use of marijuana and other drugs.

(NEW FAIRFIELD, Conn.) A hate crime charge has been filed against a white woman from New Fairfield after she spat on a Black woman during a Black Lives Matter protest in January, the Hartford Courant reported.

The incident happened at a protest at the state Capitol, as lawmakers were being sworn in to start the 2021 legislative session on Jan. 6.

Hartford State’s Attorney Sharmese Walcott on Thursday announced that charges against 44-year-old Yuliya Gilshteyn were ""upgraded"" to include four charges.

Gilshteyn was intitially only charged with breach of peace, but now she is charged with ""deprivation of rights (a hate crime statute), third-degree criminal attempt to commit assault, first-degree reckless endangerment and risk of injury to a child charges,"" according to the Hartford Courant.

New charges were added after a follow-up investigation that included witness interviews and review of video of the incident that showed Gilshteyn spitting on Keren Prescott of Manchester, founder of activist group Power Up Manchester.

“An assault launched against a person on account of their race as they are exercising their First Amendment right and freedom cannot be tolerated,” Walcott said.

After the incident, Prescott organized a protest calling for Gilshteyn to face a stiffer penalty. On Thursday, she said she was glad Gilshteyn’s charges were upgraded but expressed frustration with the entire process.

“I think the process they had to go through to obtain evidence and upgrade the charges was cumbersome and frustrating,” she said. “It was frustrating having to prove what she did. The video shouldn’t have to come out for them to [charge her]. I’m glad that Capitol Police cooperated and worked with us to do that, but I was telling them what happened, multiple witnesses told them what happened, and I still wasn’t believed.”

Gilshteyn’s attorney, Ioannis Kaloids, said she denies “in any way” that the incident at the state capitol was a hate crime.

“It was a very unfortunate situation. My client regrets her actions deeply, but this was not motivated by race,” Kaloids said. “We hope to have a dialogue with Ms. Prescott through her attorney and with the state, and we’ll hopefully put everything in perspective and reach a resolution here.”

The incident happened around 10:30 a.m. on Jan. 6, as a large group of protestors was walking to the south side of the Capitol. Numerous groups were present to protest various issues. Prescott was with other Black Lives Matter supporters and Gilshteyn was among those protesting legislation to tighten vaccine requirements for public school students.

(ATLANTA) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced new guidelines for schools on Friday, saying students need only maintain 3 feet of distance among each other, according to The Washington Post.

The updated guidance comes on the heels of new research that found limited coronavirus transmission in schools that require masks but not 6 feet of distance and sets the stage for further expansion of in-person learning.

CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said Friday, ""CDC is committed to leading with science and updating our guidance as new evidence emerges. She added, “These updated recommendations provide the evidence-based roadmap to help schools reopen safely, and remain open, for in-person instruction.”

The move will better align the CDC with the White House, which has been pushing for schools to fully reopen, after its previous guidance of 6 feet caused many school districts to pursue hybrid models of learning, according to The Post.

But two large teachers' unions have come out against the move, saying there isn't enough research across different schools and populations to justify the new guidance.

Becky Pringle, president of the National Education Association, said, ""We need to make sure that before we do any changing or easing up of the mitigation strategies that we are making sure we have evidence from those diverse populations.""

Because most infections in schools occur between adults or between students and staff, the CDC said, it still recommends 6 feet for those interactions even if students can be closer than 6 feet to each other.",1,https://www.newsbreak.com/news/2185771364898/cdc-recommends-3-feet-of-social-distance-for-students-in-new-guidelines

Nelson will also be tasked with working with the agency's commercial partners, Boeing and SpaceX, to send astronauts to the International Space Station.

(ATLANTA) Georgia state Republicans are retreating from a decision to eliminate no-excuse absentee voting and early voting on Sundays after increased scrutiny from voting rights groups and large corporations, according to The Hill.

GOP state lawmakers said in a hearing Thursday that their election law reform package would drop these provisions, even providing more early voting opportunities.

Republican State Rep. Barry Fleming, who heads the Special Committee on Election Integrity, said the new version of the bill would allow up to four weekend days of early voting, more than what is currently provided.

Fleming and GOP state Senate Majority Leader Mike Dugan said they do not expect their final bill will also eliminate no-excuse absentee voting, as originally proposed.

However, the legislation would limit the ability of voting rights groups to send absentee ballot form requests and also limit a voter's ability to cast a provisional ballot outside their home precinct.

Other new restrictions include:

Mandating voters who cast absentee ballots submit their driver's license number or other documentation

Limiting drop boxes for absentee ballots to the inside of early voting locations

Giving voters at least 11 days before an election to request an absentee ballot

Voting rights groups were angered by the original no-excuse absentee voting provision and the elimination of Sunday early voting when Black churches run “souls to the polls” programs to grant Black voters the opportunity to vote.

Coca-Cola and Home Depot, both based in Georgia, also publically opposed the new proposals as well.",1,https://www.newsbreak.com/news/2185745226131/georgia-republicans-remove-some-increased-voting-restrictions-after-facing-backlash

(ARLINGTON, Texas) On what would’ve been country music star Charley Pride’s 87th birthday, the Texas Rangers announced on Thursday the creation of a fellowship program in his honor, NBC 5 reports .

The Charley Pride Fellowship Program aims to create a more inclusive front office by extending paid internships to college juniors and seniors of diverse backgrounds. Accepted fellows will spend 10 weeks in the program and rotate through working in three different departments.

Pride played in minor leagues and the Negro American League before transitioning to country music. Pride worked on the fellowship program with the Texas Rangers Baseball Foundation before he died in December. He was also a share owner of the Texas Rangers.

""This program is something that I feel that the Texas Rangers need and I'm so glad to see them do it and name it for Charley. He loved the Texas Rangers,"" Charley Pride’s wife, Rozene Pride said. ""The young men and women who will benefit from the program I'm sure will gain a lot of knowledge and experience from it. It's something that we can all say is wonderful for the community, because we need diversity in all organizations.""

The fellowship program has the support of country music singers Garth Brooks, Neal McCoy and Larry Gatlin, who were friends with Pride.

The Texas Rangers have also named a field at the spring training complex in Arizona after Pride.

""Charley embodied love, kindness, inclusion. One of my favorite quotes Charley would always say is, there's enough room for everybody in country music. If he was with us today, he would say there's enough room for everybody in Major League Baseball,"" Director of Community Impact for the Rangers Ray Casas said per Fox 4 . ""Today we continue to listen, continue to get better, and thanks to this program, Mr. Pride’s legacy will live on impacting young people, opportunities that will help this community, MLB and this country.""

(PHILADELPHIA) The Philadelphia City Planning Commission endorsed a bill in hopes of limiting the rise of self-proclaimed convenience stores that primarily sell pipes and other drug accessories, according to WHYY.

Philadelphia currently regulates stores that explicitly sell drug paraphernalia. It requires related-use permits and a zoning variance.

Some stores have been able to bypass these regulations by applying for a convenience store permit instead and then selling prohibited merchandise.

Councilmembers Katherine Gilmore Richardson, Cherelle Parker and Bobby Henon co-authored legislation to update and broaden the definition of what a “drug paraphernalia store” is in Philadelphia.

The new bill would apply to any store that displays drug paraphernalia in its windows, which would theoretically make code enforcement easier for inspectors. It also expanded the definition of paraphernalia.

The older definition included things like water pipes but did not include things such as vaporizers, herbal and decarboxylation infusers, grinders or mesh screens. The new bill would also include novelty glass tubes and dab rigs.

The legislation is currently in committee but is expected to move forward with the endorsement of the commission.",1,https://www.newsbreak.com/pennsylvania/philadelphia/news/2185771075885/new-bill-seeks-to-expand-regulations-on-stores-selling-drug-paraphernalia-in-philadelphia
420,Paul,Rand,newsbreak,"Chuy's, one of Austin, Texas' most popular restaurant concepts, has arrived in South Florida – and it even has its own shrine to Elvis.

The Pembroke Pines restaurant opened on February 16, and marks the 93rd restaurant overall for the established brand, which opened its first restaurant 38 years ago.

The concept is the vision of founders Mike Young and John Zapp, who had a vision of creating a fun, funky Tex-Mex restaurant. Founded in 1982, the Chuy's chain has since spread its vision of authentic Tex-Mex to over 95 locations nationwide.

Young and Zapp will tell you their first restaurant opened in an old, abandoned Texas barbeque joint on Barton Springs Road in Austin, Texas. Built on a budget, the duo's ""decorator"" — affectionatley referenced as Jose Cuervo — helped them to make some eclectic decor decisions. Today, the funky touches — like hubcaps hanging above your booth to the Elvis shrine — are still alive today.

At Chuy's Pembroke Pines, a variety of rooms that keep the chain's motto alive, ""If you've seen one Chuy's, you've seen one Chuy's."" Along with its own Elvis Shrine, you'll also see a school of hand-carved wooden fish on the ceiling at the La Chihuahua Bar. The bar also features pictures of local dogs from the Pembroke Pines community. Anytime you bring a framed photo of your dog to Chuy’s, they'll add it to the wall — and give you a free appetizer.

Today, the restaurant is best known for preparing true Tex-Mex food. Chuy’s dishes go deep into the heart of Tex-Mex witht a menu that offers family recipes culled from South Texas, New Mexico, the Rio Grande Valley, and the area's neighboring Mexican border towns.

According to Chuy's field marketing manager Holly Robbins, everything at Chuy's is made in-house — and most of it prepared to-order. Don't believe her? Ask to see the freezer — it's alleged to be the size of the one you have at home.

""From our handmade corn and flour tortillas made fresh all day long and eight signature sauces to fresh-squeezed lime juice for a perfect margarita,"" Robbins says. ""Every day starts with the freshest ingredients.""

Standout menu items will include the As Big As Yo’ Face Steak Burrito, a flour tortilla stuffed with grilled steak that is marinated in Shiner Bock Beer and spices, plus jack cheese, topped with the restaurant's Hatch Green Chile sauce; Chicken Flautas, corn tortillas filled with roasted chicken and cheese, rolled, fried and topped with smoky Chipotle sauce and served with guacamole and sour cream; and Steak or Chicken Fajitas, meat marinated for 24 hours in the signature Shiner Bock beer, serrano peppers, lime juice, and secret spices.

At Chuy's, the hand-rolled enchiladas are something special, adds Robbins. Every dish is made fresh to-order, from the roasted chicken that's hand-pulled before serving, to the corn tortiallas that are rolled just minutes before cooking.

""Chuy's Chicka-Chicka Boom-Boom Enchiladas are a special dish,"" says Robbins. ""We have a long-standing love affair with Hatch Green Chiles and our chefs are always coming up with new and fun sauces, which is how Chuy's Boom Boom sauce was born. At Chuy's, we like to say, 'we all need a little boom-boom in our life.'""

The sauce gets its name from the restaurant's signature chiles, which are grown for us in Hatch, New Mexico. Blended with serranos, spices, green onions, and cilantro and melted into a creamy shredded cheese, it's the perfect compliment to smother over handmade corn tortillas stuffed with chicken.

Chuy’s cocktail lineup will feature all the greats — great margaritas, that is — from Chuy’s Famous Ritas, scratch-made margaritas with fresh-squeezed lime juice, served on the rocks or frozen to the hand-shaken Original Texas Tini, served in an 18-ounce shaker with a salt-rimmed martini glass and jalapeño-stuffed olives. Additional libations on offer include Texas-Sized Drinks including Tito’s Cherry Limeade – fresh lime juice and cherries spike with Tito’s Handmade vodka; and New Mexican Martini – el Jimador Silver tequila infused with green chiles and Cointreau, served with a salt-rim and jalapeño-stuffed olives. Chuy’s will also serve a variety of domestic and premium beers and wine by the glass or bottle.

""We're thrilled to be opening our doors to the Broward community following an unexpected year,"" says Chuy's area director Jack Baum. ""Pembroke Pines is an exciting, growing community hungry for new and fun places to dine and drink, making it the perfect location for our newest Chuy’s.""

422,Paul,Rand,foxnews,"The proper role of government is to ensure that individual rights are protected, the most basic of which is the right to life.

In 2019, Planned Parenthood was responsible for 345, 871 abortions. Averaging out to a rate of 947 per day, or one every 91 seconds. Also, in 2019, Planned Parenthood received $616.8 million in federal funding.

The Constitution already guarantees the right to life in the 14th Amendment, yet last month Democrats once again tried to use tax dollars to fund an organization that violates the rule of law.

This time, Democrats attempted to go a step further to not only fund individual Planned Parenthood affiliates across America but also to allow them to qualify for Personal Paycheck Protection (PPP) loans.

PLANNED PARENTHOOD LATEST REPORT SHOWS INCREASE IN ABORTIONS, GOVERNMENT FUNDING

Well, they tried and failed.

I forced Democrats to remove a provision in their massive $1.9 trillion liberal wish list of a spending bill that would have allowed every Planned Parenthood affiliate across America to receive free money through the Paycheck Protection Program – money which was always intended for small businesses.

Under the House passed version of the bill, individual Planned Parenthood clinics were treated as separate and distinct entities, being eligible for federal assistance under the PPP.

The original congressional intent of PPP was to limit large and well-financed groups, such as Planned Parenthood from receiving a loan, and instead provide relief to small business affected by COVID-19.

PLANNED PARENTHOOD CEO: IT'S 'STIGMATIZING' TO SAY ABORTION IS A SMALL PART OF OUR WORK

Democrats had planned to waive affiliation rules in the third stimulus bill for nonprofits to provide paycheck protection loans to their liberal allies.

Time and again, I have led the charge on defunding Planned Parenthood. I have stood up to Democrats and even some Republicans to ensure tax dollars are not inappropriately spent.

The left knew this was never about COVID relief or helping small businesses. In the early hours of March 6th, minutes before passage, Democrats made a last-ditch effort to add the provision back, but my team successfully blocked that too.

It was a shameless attempt to fund their radical agenda on the taxpayers’ backs and I was successful in preventing that from happening by stopping these funds from going to abortion mills.

Time and again, I have led the charge on defunding Planned Parenthood. I have stood up to Democrats and even some Republicans to ensure tax dollars are not inappropriately spent.

Since I was elected to the Senate, I’ve introduced legislation every year that would defund Planned Parenthood or at least lead us in the direction of defunding. I have introduced and cosponsored several pro-life bills including the Protect Life Act, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, and the Child Interstate Abortion Notification Act.

Kentucky sent me to Washington to fight for conservative principles and put an end to excessive government spending. Stopping this radical left-wing legislation of providing Planned Parenthood with paycheck protection loans dually achieves both.

Elected officials often forget the American people sent them to Washington, and consequently put special interests ahead of constituents and the Constitution.

At what point will elected officials refocus to uphold the Constitution and represent the American people?

423,Paul,Rand,newsbreak,"The Hopkins County Commissioners recently approved another 381 agreement for a solar project to be located in Precinct 4 with two major land owners involved. The contract provides a 100% tax abatement for the Bright Arrow Solar project for the first ten years of the contract as Hopkins County has chosen to take a payment in lieu of taxes (PILOT) in the amount of $360,000 annually for those same ten years. The solar company would then start paying 100% of the taxes owed on the depreciated value of the panels and equipment for the following years. The original investment in panels and other equipment for the 300 megawatt facility is estimated to be $275 million and will include a “battery array” for electricity storage as well which has driven the value of investment up from previous estimates. Bright Arrow Solar representative, Sean Pattee, told KSST News that local solar projects are having to re-evaluate their installations in the area as the wholesale prices for electricity that is being paid to solar providers has been going down recently due to supply and demand. The largest solar farm in the country is under construction currently north of Hopkins County and covers portions of Lamar, Franklin, and Red River counties. The Samson Solar Energy Center will provide over 1,300 megawatts of electricty (enough to power 300,000 homes) and that electricity will be transferred directly to the grid.

424,Paul,Rand,foxnews,"Democrats (and many Republicans) don’t seem to care about the mountain of debt Congress added last year and continues to add this year. Instead of simply opening the economy back up as the virus wanes, Democrats are plowing ahead with another $2 trillion in deficit spending.

The Congressional Budget Office, a non-partisan agency, warns that this mountain of debt will explode interest payments, such that over the next 30 years, taxpayers will have to pony up $61 trillion in interest. (Interest payments, by the way, don’t buy you government services. Interest payments just eat up cash and crowd out other government expenditures.)

By 2050, interest payments will consume nearly half of the entire budget!

The latest CBO report doesn’t pull any punches, the rapid expansion of the debt will ""increase the risk of fiscal crisis – that is, a situation in which investors lose confidence in the U.S. government’s ability to service and repay its debt, causing interest rates to increase abruptly, inflation to spiral upward...""

WHAT ARE THE NATIONAL DEBT’S BIGGEST COMPONENTS?

CBO further warns that this mountain of debt could cause the world to replace the dollar as the reserve currency.

By 2050, the CBO estimates that our national debt will equal 202% of our gross national product. For years, fiscal conservatives, like myself have warned of the danger of having the national debt exceed 100% of the GDP but the CBO points out we are hurtling toward a time when our debt will be twice the size of the economy.

On more than one occasion, the police have saved my life. When a deranged Bernie Sanders supporter spewed 200 rounds of ammunition onto the baseball field, I was only a few steps away from meeting my maker. Congressman Steve Scalise almost did. Capitol Hill Police and a brave policewoman from Alexandria battled the gunman and brought him down.

Just recently, an angry mob surrounded my wife and I, threatening to kill us. If you watch the video you can tell by our faces we absolutely believed the threats hurled at us. Once again police saved our lives.

For the record, both times the police officers were both Black and white, male and female. The narrative that the violence around us all revolves around race is false. Recently, when discussing the burning of Portland and Seattle, a black Dallas-Fort Worth airport police officer explained to me: “It’s not about race. It’s about right and wrong.”

Related:Kentucky Senate passes ban on many, but not all, no-knock warrants

The death of Breonna Taylor, likewise, is a tragedy, regardless of her race. For years before her death, I have been advocating an end to no-knock raids. I’ve often repeated the story of a no-knock raid in California where a 10-year-old boy was tragically and accidently shot in the back at close range. His race shouldn’t matter, but he was white.

In the sad days after Breonna died, I talked with the family. I introduced legislation to end no-knock raids and cheered when the Metro Council voted unanimously to end these raids.

I cheered, though, not just for the memory of Breonna, but with the understanding that ending no-knock raids will also save the lives of police. We shouldn’t forget that rank-and-file police officers didn’t decide to perform a no-knock raid, their superiors did and really, ultimately, a judge made the decision.

I know feelings are still raw and many will lash out at me for having the temerity to try to make things better. But really, shouldn’t this be one of those issues that actually brings us together?

'Deadly serious':NAACP leaders, Beshear encourage COVID-19 vaccine receptiveness

Both parties now understand that no-knock raids are a danger to the community and to the police. Kentucky Senate President Robert Stivers has introduced legislation to ban no-knock raids throughout the state. I suspect it will pass with large bipartisan majorities.

Nothing will bring Breonna back, but I hope changing this policy will save many lives in the future.

426,Paul,Rand,wvxu,"



Republican state lawmakers and U.S. Sen. Rand Paul are rallying around a yet-to-be-revealed bill that would make changes to Kentucky’s election laws, though it’s unclear what exactly the bill would do.



Rep. Jennifer Decker, a Republican from Waddy and the bill’s sponsor, said Thursday she won’t unveil the contents of the bill to the public or Democratic lawmakers until the day before the bill receives its first vote.



Decker said she has received input from county clerks, the State Board of Elections and current and former GOP officials.



“We combined our list and we’re paring it down in an attempt to include only those ideas that would help advance the goal of enhancing the integrity and trust in our election system,” Decker said.





The Kentucky House Elections, Constitutional Amendments and Intergovernmental Affairs Committee is scheduled to vote on the measure on Tuesday.



Paul joined the state committee via Zoom and threw his support behind the mystery legislation. He said he’s seen the proposal and it would help Kentucky avoid problems that he says happened in other states.



“I think these are things that aren’t criticism of anything you’ve done, or criticism of our government or elections, but just being careful that we don’t slip into what has happened in other states,” Paul said.



Paul listed several election changes he would like to see, including placing limits on secretaries of state from making election changes during states of emergency and forbidding election officials from “soliciting voters.” He also proposed mandating the purging of unqualified voters from the state’s voter rolls, which is already a law in Kentucky.



Much of Paul’s testimony focused on reducing the number of people casting votes by mail.



“Typically, all of you know in the room, mail-in votes were small percentage of votes, and during the pandemic became the majority of votes. To my thinking, I think inherently it’s harder to verify mail-in votes than it is in-person votes,” Paul said.



Republican Secretary of State Michael Adams and Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear last year expanded eligibility for mail-in and early voting during the coronavirus pandemic. The legislature voted to give them the power to do so during last year’s legislative session.



Paul has repeatedly downplayed the seriousness of the pandemic and continues to question the outcome of last year’s presidential election, though he did vote to certify election results hours after the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, where rioters killed a Capitol Police officer.



Democratic Rep. Attica Scott asked Paul how Republicans can make sure they “don’t contribute to inciting insurrectionist attacks” in Frankfort when some of their supporters are still claiming there is widespread voter fraud.



Paul responded by equating the U.S. Capitol riot to racial justice protests last year.



“Frankly I think the violence of Jan. 6 was abhorrent, but there was also violence all throughout the summer that many on the Democrat[ic] side did not criticize the violence or try to stop the violence in our cities. We had violence in Louisville, frankly,” Paul said.



“I think there has been violence on both sides and extremists on both sides ought to be condemned.”



Rep. McKenzie Cantrell, a Democrat from Louisville, said Republican sponsors of the yet-to-be-revealed election reform bill “have not been specific at all” about what is in the measure.



“Sen. Paul has said that he has seen some of the proposals from Rep. Decker, yet we did not hear a single specific proposal today about what is going to be in this bill,” Cantrell said.



Rep. James Tipton, a Republican from Taylorsville also supporting the bill, said unveiling the bill ahead of time would “cause a lot of confusion.”



“If you come out and put something out in draft, there might be some comments made that might cause some decision points to be made differently between now and then,” Tipton said.



Lawmakers regularly file bills long before they are voted on in committee to give lawmakers and the public time to review legislation.



House bills are usually required to be posted three days in advance of being heard in committee, but this year the House adopted rules shortening the posting requirement to one day.

427,Paul,Rand,wfpl,"The Kentucky House of Representatives has voted to re-legalize historical horse racing, a slot-machine-style of gambling that was struck down by the state Supreme Court last year.

The horse industry rallied around Senate Bill 120, saying parlors filled with the slot-like machines have buoyed racetracks and revenue has trickled down to trainers, breeders and farms.

Rep. Matthew Koch, a Republican from Paris, said historical horse racing, or HHR, has been a shot in the arm for the industry.

“HHR has allowed our industry to expand and grow our purses by 102% in ten years,” Koch said. “That’s helping the little guys. That’s going to the guys like my family that have been in this for generations.”

Kentucky only allows three forms of gambling—lottery, charitable gaming like church bingo, and pari-mutuel wagering, the form most commonly used to bet on horse races.

Historical horse racing machines function and look like slot machines, but have been allowed to operate for more than ten years in Kentucky because they base results on previously-run horse races.

But last year, the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled that many of the machines don’t qualify as pari-mutuel wagering, sending the horse industry and lawmakers scrambling.

The bill that passed on Thursday changes the definition of pari-mutuel wagering in state law to include the historical racing machines.

The debate split the 75 Republicans in the House. Religious conservatives railed against the bill, saying that it amounted to an expansion of gambling in the state and didn’t go through the proper legal process.

Rep. David Hale, a Republican and pastor from Wellington, said the bill amounted to a bailout of a “greedy industry.”

“We have an industry that is a multi-million-dollar industry that doesn’t care who they hurt, they don’t care how the process goes about to hurt them, their one passion is greed to make more and more,” Hale said.

With a final vote of 55-38, only 36 Republicans voted in favor of the bill and were joined by 19 Democrats.

Louisville Republican Rep. Kevin Bratcher said he supported the bill because it would keep jobs in his area, comparing it to votes he made to prop up the ailing coal industry.

“I’ll say this: the coal industry has some pretty greedy characters too. But you know what, I voted and I stayed on track for coal jobs. Because I know no matter how corrupt the industry is, the coal industry is very important to areas I’ve barely visited,” Bratcher said.

Racetracks like Churchill Downs and Keeneland have spent millions of dollars building “racinos” across the state that house thousands of machines and employ hundreds of people.

Churchill Downs CEO Bill Carstanjen issued a statement thanking the legislature for passing the bill.

“Tens of thousands of Kentuckians have contributed to the growth and success of our racing circuit and equine industry. I am thankful not only for the important work they do each day to keep our industry moving forward, but for taking the time to reach out to their legislators on this critical issue. Your voices truly made a difference in the effort to keep HHR in Kentucky,” Carstanjen wrote.

Critics have pointed out that Kentucky taxes historical horse racing machines at a far lower rate than surrounding states and urged lawmakers to raise taxes on them to bring in more revenue.

House Minority Leader Joni Jenkins, a Democrat from Louisville, said she was disappointed the House didn’t vote to do that.

“I hope that next year when we are on this floor that we will work together to make sure we have a fair tax on this industry,” Jenkins said.

The bill has already passed the Senate and now heads to Gov. Andy Beshear’s desk.

Beshear issued a statement in support of the bill.

“The passage of SB 120 is crucial to ensuring that our signature Thoroughbred industry remains strong. In working toward the passage of this bill, each of our major tracks committed to enacting a more fair and equitable tax structure this session. This is what can happen when we stop fighting and work together,” Beshear wrote.

428,Paul,Rand,wfpl,"Gov. Andy Beshear announced Thursday the opening of 156 new coronavirus vaccination sites in Kentucky.

Six of the new sites will serve as regional vaccination facilities, located in Adair, Carter, Franklin, Henderson, Lawrence and Union counties. Ten of the sites will be at Kroger stores throughout the state, and 15 more will be at Walmart stores.

A majority of the new locations will be operated at Walgreens and Good Neighbor independent pharmacies as part of a recently-announced federal program. Beshear said the program will administer 13,000 additional first doses a week at 125 pharmacies.

“We are expanding at a phenomenal rate,” he said. “We are very quickly covering the whole state to get to our desired outcome, where you never have to drive more than one county to get vaccines. We know that there’s more that we need to fill in.”

The governor announced 1,880 new COVID-19 cases. It’s the lowest case total in at least four weeks, Beshear said. This week is on track to become the fifth week in a row with declining cases.

The positivity rate dropped to 7.08%, the lowest it’s been since Nov. 6. Despite the downward trend, 36 new deaths were reported Thursday.

“Like just about every one of the days we’ve had for the last week, we have declining cases,” Beshear said. “But we still have stubbornly high deaths.”

Beshear said the state will relaunch its Healthy At Home Eviction Fund on Monday. Last year, about $15 million in relief was dispersed to 4,135 households.

Residents can apply for assistance with rent and utility bills dating back to April 2020 and future payments, which will go directly to landlords or utility providers.

“We need to be patient and vigilant,” Beshear said. “We’ve got to keep masking up, maintaining social distance, practicing good hygiene, and avoiding crowds. This fund is going to help make that possible.”

431,Paul,Rand,wvik,"Republican state lawmakers and U.S. Sen. Rand Paul are rallying around a yet-to-be-revealed bill that would make changes to Kentucky’s election laws, though it’s unclear what exactly the bill would do.

Rep. Jennifer Decker, a Republican from Waddy and the bill’s sponsor, said Thursday she won’t unveil the contents of the bill to the public or Democratic lawmakers until the day before the bill receives its first vote.

Decker said she has received input from county clerks, the State Board of Elections and current and former GOP officials.

“We combined our list and we’re paring it down in an attempt to include only those ideas that would help advance the goal of enhancing the integrity and trust in our election system,” Decker said.

The Kentucky House Elections, Constitutional Amendments and Intergovernmental Affairs Committee is scheduled to vote on the measure on Tuesday.

Paul joined the state committee via Zoom and threw his support behind the mystery legislation. He said he’s seen the proposal and it would help Kentucky avoid problems that he says happened in other states.

“I think these are things that aren’t criticism of anything you’ve done, or criticism of our government or elections, but just being careful that we don’t slip into what has happened in other states,” Paul said.

Paul listed several election changes he would like to see, including placing limits on secretaries of state from making election changes during states of emergency and forbidding election officials from “soliciting voters.” He also proposed mandating the purging of unqualified voters from the state’s voter rolls, which is already a law in Kentucky.

Much of Paul’s testimony focused on reducing the number of people casting votes by mail.

“Typically, all of you know in the room, mail-in votes were small percentage of votes, and during the pandemic became the majority of votes. To my thinking, I think inherently it’s harder to verify mail-in votes than it is in-person votes,” Paul said.

Republican Secretary of State Michael Adams and Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear last year expanded eligibility for mail-in and early voting during the coronavirus pandemic. The legislature voted to give them the power to do so during last year’s legislative session.

Paul has repeatedly downplayed the seriousness of the pandemic and continues to question the outcome of last year’s presidential election, though he did vote to certify election results hours after the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, where rioters killed a Capitol Police officer.

Democratic Rep. Attica Scott asked Paul how Republicans can make sure they “don’t contribute to inciting insurrectionist attacks” in Frankfort when some of their supporters are still claiming there is widespread voter fraud.

Paul responded by equating the U.S. Capitol riot to racial justice protests last year.

“Frankly I think the violence of Jan. 6 was abhorrent, but there was also violence all throughout the summer that many on the Democrat[ic] side did not criticize the violence or try to stop the violence in our cities. We had violence in Louisville, frankly,” Paul said.

436,Paul,Rand,nationalinterest,"After almost twenty years, we have lost over 7,000 killed, suffered over 50,000 wounded, and spent over $5.4 trillion, in Iraq and Afghanistan alone. And that doesn’t even account for our total human and monetary costs in the greater Middle East over the same period of time. More so, there is no way to begin to count the impact of lives shattered, relationships destroyed, and continued loss of life through suicides.

Some would say this is the cost of war. Perhaps. But in a war, loss should have an objective.

That objective must be to deliver a better state of peace. It should have a theory of victory to make that happen. We teach this to our strategists and future general officers at our war colleges. Under our Constitution, war should have the approval of Congress, and thereby consent of the people, to achieve those war aims.

But yet, after almost twenty years of war we don’t have any of this in a coherent fashion. We are still no closer to victory nor do we even really have a realistic idea of what victory looks like. We haven’t been honest on the conduct of the war. We have continuously shifted our war aims. We have paid staggering opportunity costs, immeasurable amounts of treasure, and most importantly, an unimaginable number of lives—again over 7,000 dead and over 50,000 wounded. After all of this, we owe it to those in uniform, some of who weren’t even born on 9/11, to be brave enough to ask, “When will it be enough?”

With a new year and a new administration, we have the opportunity to answer that question. I had hoped that we would begin to see the light at the end of this tunnel. However, with such appointees like newly confirmed U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his proven track record of military intervention, we are reminded once again that the more things change the more they stay the same.

When it was my time to question Antony Blinken at his nomination hearing on the lessons learned from his involvement in continuing our combat operations in the Middle East, he proceeded to dance around the issue, standing firm in his beliefs that we must advance American diplomacy as our first answer, rather than engage in war and conflict. We can only hope he believes that.

During the questioning, we addressed the fact that he, along with then-Vice President Joe Biden and President Barack Obama supported toppling Muammar Gaddafi in Libya. It wasn’t long after that they realized no rival power is capable of replacing Gaddafi and chaos ensued.

One would think they would have learned from what happened in Libya. Why then did they advocate for invading Syria? The failure in Syria, he said, wasn’t doing enough. I disagree. We have seen time and again that regime change does not work.

My concern for us as a country, however, is that it seems that Mr. Blinken will default to the past, continuing on an interventionist path using military force with no clear objective. A path that has had a consistent track record of failure in past administrations.

President Biden has a golden opportunity in the coming days to reset American foreign policy and end our seemingly endless war. We must return to thoughtful diplomacy that doesn’t rely on the bayonet to achieve something we can’t clearly define. We must be willing to keep open lines of communication. To stand firm when necessary, but have an open ear where possible. We must return our military “over the horizon” to reset and refocus on our true national security interests.

But it seems the confirmation of Mr. Blinken means we are far from taking that path.

It would be so easy to neglect my duty as a U.S. Senator and “go with the flow.” I will not. I have continuously led the fight to reassess our foreign policy, to end our “forever war,” and bring our fighting forces home. I have been and will continue to be vocal about finding a way to make this happen. And now that means reminding Mr. Blinken, and all those who he brings with him, the errors of their past ways. I urge my colleagues in the 117th Congress to do the same.

437,Paul,Rand,foxnews,"This week, I will sit on a panel of jurors in the U.S. Senate in a most unusual trial.

The trial is of dubious merit and even more dubious constitutionality.

It will stop both sides of the political aisle from pursuing solutions and goals for policy, from presidential appointments to COVID relief bills.

ANDREW McCARTHY: TRUMP IMPEACHMENT TRIAL – WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW, WHAT MAY SURPRISE YOU

All of this could be stopped if the leaders of the House and Senate were not still locked in last year’s partisan struggle with Donald Trump.

It also could have been stopped with a small gesture of bipartisan healing from President Biden, if he had told congressional leaders he didn’t want them proceeding.

But none of that happened, so here we are.

Two weeks ago, I forced a vote to ask my colleagues if they even thought an impeachment of a former president was constitutional – 45 of them said it was not, leaving no doubt as to the outcome of the sham of a trial this week.

Beyond the constitutional question lies the merits of the impeachment against former President Trump.

I’ve spoken out against the words of many on my side, including those of President Trump.

I’ve spoken out against those who tried to object to the seating of the electors, as I thought that was not the role of Congress.

But where is the other side? Where were they all last year when political violence ravaged our cities, when people could barely dine or walk the streets in many places? When businesses burned and people were injured or killed by mobs?

They were silent.

Where was the outrage from the left when their politicians, from Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., to Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., asked people to ""get up in the faces"" of people they disagreed with politically? When they said to not let Trump officials have a moments peace, even if you see them out in public, dining in restaurants?

Where were they when it was shown the political rhetoric of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and the rest of the socialist left inspired the shooter who fired at Republicans at our baseball practice, nearly killing Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La.?

Our system only works well if we understand the speaker is not responsible for the actions of the listener no matter if they are Republican, Democrat or other.

And where were they when Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., stood in front of the Supreme Court last year, when he called out Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh by name saying, ""You have released the whirlwind, and you will pay the price. You won’t know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions""? This earned Schumer a rare direct rebuke from the chief justice, and scathing rebukes from senators and others in the GOP, but not a word from the Democrats.

Their outrage is one sided and that’s not how this works.

You either go after the Democrats who ""incited violence"" or you say that political speech always inspires great passion, and the speaker is not responsible for the actions of the listener unless clearly calling for violence.

President Trump deserves the same standard as the other side.

He deserves the protections of our Constitution.

438,Paul,Rand,wfpl,"Legislation to keep slot machine-like historical racing games in Kentucky got its first hearing in the General Assembly on Thursday.

Senate Bill 120 seeks to codify historical racing in state law after the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled last year that the machines don’t qualify as “pari-mutuel wagering,” the gambling form traditionally used for betting on horse races.

Historical racing parlors have become lucrative businesses for some racetracks in Kentucky, which doesn’t permit traditional casinos.

Tom Drury, a horse trainer from Goshen, said revenue from historical racing has helped keep the horse industry afloat in the state.

“If this doesn’t go, we’re going to lose tracks, and we’re going to lose jobs, and we’re going to lose horses, and we’re going to lose people,” Drury told a legislative committee.

The bill passed the Senate Licensing and Occupations Committee on Thursday and now heads to the full Senate.

Kentucky’s constitution only permits three types of gambling: the lottery, charitable gaming like bingo and pari-mutuel wagering—a system where gamblers bet against each other and there can be multiple winners.

Though historical racing machines function and look like slot machines, they base their results on the outcomes of actual horse races that took place in the past. That’s how they’ve remained legal in Kentucky since they were introduced more than a decade ago.

But in September, the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled that at least some forms of historical racing machines aren’t pari-mutuel, writing that the system “does not create a wagering pool among patrons such that they are wagering among themselves as required for pari-mutuel wagering.”

The ruling was a blow to racetracks like Churchill Downs and Keeneland, which have spent millions building “racinos” that house thousands of machines.

The Kentucky Family Foundation has fought to make historical racing illegal in the commonwealth for years.

Martin Cothran, a spokesperson for the organization, said during the Thursday hearing that the effort to enshrine historical racing is a “millionaire’s stimulus bill.”

“How does legislation to allow historical horse racing slot machines help the state, when little of [its revenue] goes into state coffers and most of it goes to enrich wealthy corporations, some with out-of-state owners,” Cothran said.

Kentucky gleaned about $15 million from taxes on historic racing last year, an amount critics say is too low when compared to the $3 billion handle.

A group of 17 organizations, including the Kentucky Education Association, the Kentucky Mental Health Coalition and the Kentucky Coalition Against Domestic Violence, sent a letter to lawmakers urging them to raise taxes on the machines.",1,https://wfpl.org/kentucky-lawmakers-advance-historical-horse-racing-bill/

440,Paul,Rand,needtoknow,"Officials for the City of Detroit have filed a lawsuit against Black Lives Matter activist groups alleging a “civil conspiracy.” The lawsuit claims the protests “have repeatedly turned violent, endangering the lives of police and the public,” and contends that law enforcement officers sustained injuries that included “cracked vertebrae, lacerations, and concussions.” The lawsuit serves as a counter claim to a lawsuit filed by activists that alleged police officers “repeatedly responded with violence” when protesters took part in mass demonstrations. City officials hope that the documentation of the repeated violence will nullify claims by a BLM affiliate group. -GEG

In an attempt to discourage the continued assault on their city by ideologically based activist groups, the City of Detroit has taken a new tack in filing a lawsuit against the activists of the Black Lives Matter movement.

Officials for the City of Detroit have filed a lawsuit against Black Lives Matter activist groups alleging a “civil conspiracy.” The lawsuit claims that the protests in that city “have repeatedly turned violent, endangering the lives of police and the public.”

The city’s lawsuit charges that the activists took part in the conspiracy, “defamed” the mayor and law enforcement, and insists the city should be awarded damages.

441,Paul,Rand,needtoknow,"The EU gave the green light for a Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine on Monday, paving the way for the first inoculations to start across 27 countries just after Christmas.

The government has been forced to delay the legislation for several months after angry protests.

France: A radical new bill could ban people who fail to get a Covid-19 vaccination or provide a negative test from using public transport and other activities. France has imposed some of the strictest lockdown measures in Europe, with citizens having to fill out a form every time they leave their home. A recent poll found that 59% of the population will refuse the new vaccine. French President Emmanuel Macron and the Health Minister promised that coronavirus vaccinations will not be mandatory. Critics say that Macron is planning a health dictatorship and that the government is using ‘vaccine blackmail.’ A law professor pointed out that the bill would curb parliament’s powers because the exceptional measures could all be implemented by decree and would give executive authorities nearly unlimited power.

People who fail to get a Covid-19 vaccination could be banned from using public transport in France, according to a draft law sparking angry protests from opposition politicians on Tuesday.

Prime Minister Jean Castex on Monday got his cabinet’s backing for a bill that is designed to provide a legal framework for dealing with health crises, including the coronavirus pandemic.

According to the text, which will now be submitted to parliament, a negative Covid test or proof of a “preventative treatment, including the administration of a vaccine” could be required for people to be granted “access to transport or to some locations, as well as certain activities”.

The government’s vaccination campaign is to start on Sunday, and officials already face widespread resistance to a treatment developed in record time since the outbreak hit Europe early this year.

A recent poll by the Journal du Dimanche newspaper found that 59 percent of respondents said they would not get a Covid shot, one of the highest rates in the European Union.

President Emmanuel Macron has promised that coronavirus vaccinations, though strongly recommended, will not be mandatory, a pledge reiterated by Health Minister Olivier Veran on Tuesday.

“I say it once again, vaccination is not mandatory,” Veran said, while also appearing to leave the door open to modifications of the bill as it “matures” during parliamentary debates.

But opposition politicians condemned the draft law, with Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right RN party, calling it an “essentially totalitarian” measure.

“In a backhanded way, this bill does not aim to make vaccinations mandatory, but will prevent anybody who doesn’t comply from having a social life,” she said.

Suspend our freedoms

RN party spokesman Sebastien Chenu said Macron’s government was planning “a health dictatorship”.

Guillaume Peltier, deputy leader of the centre-right LR party, said it was “inconceivable” that the government should be allowed to “get all the power to suspend our freedoms without parliamentary control”.

Centrist senator Nathalie Goulet said the draft was “an attack on public freedoms”, while the far-left deputy Alexis Corbiere said “we could at least have a collective discussion if the idea is to limit our public liberties.”

Laureline Fontaine, a law professor at the Sorbonne Nouvelle university in Paris, told AFP that the draft bill would effectively curb parliament’s powers, “because these exceptional measures could all be implemented by decree.”

But now, WHO has redefined herd immunity again, this time stating that herd immunity can be achieved only by mass vaccination programs – which, of course, is not true. The WHO’s website, under a section about COVID lockdowns, states:

“Herd immunity’, also known as ‘population immunity’, is a concept used for vaccination in which a population can be protected from a certain virus if a threshold of vaccination is reached. Herd immunity is achieved by protecting people from a virus, not by exposing them to it.” In other words, the WHO is trying to make people believe that the only way they can be protected from a virus by means of herd immunity is to be vaccinated.

In the US, Dr. Anthony Fauci now says as much as 90% of the population may need to be vaccinated or infected to achieve herd immunity against COVID-19, admitting in a new interview that he has been intentionally raising the bar based, in part, on what he thinks the country is ready to hear. -GEG",1,https://needtoknow.news/2020/12/world-health-organization-changes-definition-of-herd-immunity-so-it-can-only-occur-with-vaccines/

Good morning and Happy #Festivus . Today we will air some more grievances in the holiday tradition!

I’ll throw in a new wrinkle this year because SO MANY people are joining in with my grievances that I want to highlight how the word is spreading — your government is out of control, and a LOT of us have grievances.

We will talk about Congress, Petty Tyrants all over, foreign aid, wasteful spending, science denying “experts” and other holiday goodies.This is not the time for holiday cheer! That’s for TOMORROW, AFTER we air our grievances.

Later, for feats of strength, we will see who can lift with one hand the 5593 page monstrosity of a bill Congress just passed. Good luck!

I’ll start where everyone in American should begin with their grievances. Congress. Oh, Congress, where to even begin.

Congress passed a nearly 5,600 page bill that was written in secret, put in public 6 hours before the vote, and read by NOT ONE person in the body. Not. One. We will spend all week and probably longer trying to figure out all that was wrong with it. But we have a few already...

Congress gave you $600. Would you like to know what they gave everyone else? #Festivus

$15 million buy high speed boats for Sri Lanka.

$130 million to promote democracy in Nepal. $15 million to promote it in Pakistan. Interesting, since we can’t even seem to validate mail in ballots in the United States properly.

$33 billion to promote Democracy in Venezuela. That seems to be going well so far.

OH WAIT I FOUND IT. We are going to promote Democracy in America with $132 million in “assistance for GEORGIA.” No, wait, that’s the former Soviet Republic, never mind.

This morning I promoted a great video by President Trump highlighting so much waste and abuse of taxpayers dollars. I hope he gives me a #Festivus miracle and vetoes this monstrosity and tells Congress to start over again.

Speaking of things President Trump opposes, by all accounts he is going to veto the NDAA. Do you want to know what’s important in Congress? They’re going to call us all back to try to override his veto, because they want to make sure he can’t end a war.

Liz Cheney & others in the war caucus are so hell-bent on continuing their endless wars, they will call a special session, over holidays, fly everyone back to DC (remember when that was a problem) JUST to make sure wars don’t end. That’s probably my biggest grievance of the day.

Let’s move on to some Governors. I have an idea for Governor Newsom. How about he bring his fancy meals to school cafeterias and OPEN UP THE SCHOOLS. Same for all the petty tyrants who have locked down our kids and businesses, while going off to their dinners and vacations.

My own petty tyrant Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear has closed the schools again too, defying everything we know about how the disease spreads and the harm it does to kids to be home.

My #Festivus wish is that all kids can be back in school in 2021, and that petty tyrants who screamed to “follow the science” then ignored it about schools will suffer the consequences. Surely they’ve made the kids and parents suffer enough in 2020.

Speaking of science...I’ve had at least a half dozen encounters with Dr. Fauci so far this year, and he has yet to have a rant about how there are no good bagels or pizza in DC. I don’t even think he’s really from Brooklyn. I’m calling for a Special Counsel to investigate this.

The good news is, he’s proved his worth this year. He has shown us his skills and where he truly belongs. I’ve asked for special approval to put him on the Congressional baseball team as the new pitcher for the GOP. It actually couldn’t be much worse than out usual crew.

444,Paul,Rand,thefederalist,"As this term ends, and I look back on the record of Donald Trump as president, one thing stands out: he has been far more libertarian and done more on foreign policy and civil liberties than has any recent president.

First, as in my previous profession as a physician, my first yardstick for a politician is to “do no harm.” President Trump has started no new wars, has kept us out of conflicts like Syria, and has been actively attempting to wind down the wars he inherited in Iraq and Afghanistan.

He also inherited another reaction to the war on terror — the so-called Patriot Act. The Patriot Act has been used to spy on Americans since 2001, and many parts of it should never have been passed and should not be allowed to continue. This past year, when some of the worst parts of the Patriot Act were up for renewal, President Trump stopped its renewal with a veto threat.

The Deep State and the War Caucus were in a frenzy when that happened — “How will we survive? The terrorists will surely overrun us!” When I filibustered the renewal of the Patriot Act, a senior Republican senator warned me, “We’ll have no way to fight the terrorists!” I replied, “We could try something novel and simply follow the Constitution!”

Well, we’ve done that for months now, and all is well. We should keep doing that in the new administration.

Lovers of liberty have President Trump to thank for his foreign policy and opposition to Patriot Act renewal — but there is one more important symbolic step he needs to take now. He should pardon Edward Snowden for revealing the unconstitutional spying that was going on, even beyond what was envisioned from the Patriot Act.

Itis important to remember that Snowden leaked information about unconstitutional spying and was motivated to do so after watching Obama Director of National Intelligence James Clapper lie about it under oath. Clapper lied to Congress multiple times, along with participating in many unconstitutional endeavors, including spying on Americans and participating in the Russia Hoax. He lied in 2013, and he lied again during the Russia probe.

He and others like him in the Deep State abused power and shredded the Constitution. And Snowden exposed them.

Contrary to the media narrative, Snowden was attempting to expose this type of anti-American behavior from the Deep State, not damage our security. In his own words, he said,

I would say the breaking point was seeing the Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, directly lie under oath to Congress. There’s no saving an intelligence community that believes it can lie to the public and the legislators who need to be able to trust it and regulate its actions. Seeing that really meant for me that there was no going back. Beyond that, it was the creeping realization that no one else was going to do this. The public had a right to know about these programs. The public had a right to know that which the government is doing in its name, and that which the government is doing against the public.

Barack Obama, trying to protect the Deep State liars, tried to imprison Snowden for being a “traitor.” Joe Biden — an ally of the Deep State and self-proclaimed author of parts of the Patriot Act — would continue the wrongful prosecution.

But Snowden is no traitor. He is a true whistleblower who was trying to expose those like Clapper who used Deep State powers in secret to go after Americans. Snowden should be pardoned. And this president, who distinguished himself as an opponent of the Deep State on issues of war and spying on Americans, should be the one to do it.",1,https://thefederalist.com/2020/12/17/rand-paul-president-trump-should-pardon-edward-snowden/

446,Paul,Rand,responsiblestatecraft,"Any real advocate for ending the war should ‘vote against this monstrosity’

The best part of any debate is when you see people twisting themselves in knots, going against their own alleged principles to get their desired results.

Today, the subject is war powers. The hawks and neocons somehow want you to believe, in contrast to all logic, that the President of the United States has the unitary power to go to war anytime he wants, anywhere, free from interference from Congress. That’s their stated position anytime war comes up.

Yet, they now say a President cannot leave a war without their permission. How absurd is that? It’s exactly the opposite of what both the constitution and logic would dictate.

When Congress tried to impose time limits on troop engagements during the Iraq War, the neocons squawked that it would be a mistake to have 535 generals. During the Bush administration, Dick Cheney and a team of legal apologists argued for something called ‘the unitary executive theory.’

Professor Edelson at American University describes this theory of an all-powerful commander in chief concept as claiming to justify effectively unchecked presidential power over the use of military force, the detention and interrogation of prisoners, extraordinary rendition, and intelligence gathering.

According to the unitary executive theory, since the Constitution assigns the president all of the “executive power,” he can set aside laws that attempt to limit his power over national security. This is enormous: critics say that it effectively puts the president above the law.

Now these same people who advocated for virtually unlimited commander in chief powers have put forth limits to restrain a president from removing troops from a country.

Effectively, these neocons put forth a belief that the commander in chief has virtually unlimited powers to initiate wars but they are just fine with hamstringing and preventing the commander in chief from ending a war.

Hypocrisy, anyone? Without a shred of embarrassment they happily constrain a President from leaving a war theater while simultaneously advocating for the White House to start war anytime, anywhere across the globe without Congressional authorization.

Our founding fathers would be appalled. Primary among our founders’ concerns was that the power to initiate war not be in the hands of one person. As Madison wrote in the Federalist Papers: The executive is the branch of government most likely to commit us to war. Therefore, the constitution with studied care vested the war power in the legislature.

To our founders, initiation of war was the sole prerogative of Congress. But a great deal of discretion was given to the President in Article II to execute the war. Likely, our founders would have agreed with the common complaint that we don’t need 535 generals. In other words, success in war requires most decisions on executing the war to be in the hands of one person, the President.

So, the decision to go to war requires the consensus of 535 members of Congress, or under the Constitution, it’s supposed to require a formal declaration of war by Congress. But, the execution of the war would largely be left up to the President.

Countless current and former members of Congress have agreed.

Representative Liz Cheney has argued that “the nature of military and foreign policy demand the ‘unity of the singular Executive,’” and that the Founders “certainly did not intend, nor does history substantiate, the idea that Congress should legislate specific limits on the President’s powers” in wartime.

Senator Lindsey Graham said “the one thing he has been consistent on” is that “there is one Commander-in-Chief, not 535, and I believe this Commander-in-Chief and all future commanders-in-chief are unique in our Constitution and have an indispensable role to play when it comes to protecting the homeland. If we have 535 commanders in chief, then we are going to be less safe.”

The late Senator John McCain said, “it would be a very serious situation where we are now 535 commanders in chief… the President of the United States is the only commander.”

Senator James Inhofe, the Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said “we don’t need the 535 generals in Congress telling our troops how to win this fight” in reference to the Iraq war.

And of course, former Vice President Dick Cheney was adamant that the War Powers Resolution, which requires the President to report to Congress on matters of war, was unconstitutional as “an infringement on the president’s authority as the commander in chief.”

Senator Lamar Alexander also said, “there is a reason why we don’t have 535 commanders in chief or 100 commanding generals each saying charge down this street or over that hill.”

Until recently, this chorus of voices sang of nothing but the almighty, endless powers that Presidents had as Commander in Chief. That is until a President arrived on the scene who wanted to reduce overseas troop levels and end America’s longest war in Afghanistan.

Then the promoters of a strong commander in chief suddenly jumped ship and began advocating that 535 members of Congress should indeed become generals and limit the President’s ability to remove troops from Afghanistan.

Shouldn’t we call out hypocrisy? Shouldn’t someone stand up and expose this rank demagoguery? Shouldn’t someone cry foul that those advocating for unlimited commander in chief power want it only to apply when that President advocates for war?

But the moment a President advocates to end war or lessen overseas troop deployments, he or she must be shackled by 535 generals.

This Defense Authorization Bill could more aptly be entitled A Bill to Prevent the President from Ending the Afghan War.

As such, any serious advocate for ending the Afghan War should vote against this monstrosity. The neocon advocates for unlimited Presidential war powers should own up to their hypocrisy and admit that their love of perpetual war trumps their oft-stated Unitary Executive Theory.

In reality, the neocons are enamored of their theory of unbounded Presidential power only when that power is used to foment war. The minute a President decides to end war, their true stripes are exposed as they beat their chests and proclaim, as 535 generals might, that the President will not be allowed to remove troops without Congressional permission.

This bill sets a very dangerous precedent for limiting a President’s power to end war and should be vigorously opposed.

447,Paul,Rand,thepoliticalinsider,"Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) confirmed on Monday that there will not be any investigation into who funded the protesters who infamously attacked the conservative senator and his wife as they left President Donald Trump’s speech at the Republican National Convention.

Rand Paul Confirms There Will Be No Investigation

“The DC U.S. Attorney today confirmed to me that they will not pursue an investigation of who is funding the thugs who attacked my wife and me and sent a DC police officer to the hospital,” Paul tweeted.

Paul Calls Out The Irony

The senator said afterwards that the mob of protesters was trying to get him to say the name of Breonna Taylor, the black woman who was shot and killed by police during a raid at her Louisville, Kentucky, apartment in March. In an interview with “Fox & Friends,” Paul pointed out how ironic this was, given the fact that he wrote the bill that outlawed the kind of raid that led to Taylor’s death.

“I’m actually the author of the Breonna Taylor law to end no-knock raids. So the irony is lost on these idiots that they’re trying to kill the person who is actually trying to get rid of no-knock raids,” Paul said.

RELATED: Rand Paul Says Mob Who Attacked Him And His Wife Were Paid Out-Of-Towners – Calls For Them To Be Arrested

He went on to say that he believes the protesters who attacked him were being funded by somebody, as he does not think they were from Washington D.C.

“My feeling is there is interstate criminal traffic being paid for across states lines,” said Paul. “They flew here on a plane, they all got fresh new clothes, and they were paid to be here. It is a crime to do that and it needs to be traced.”

If a Democratic lawmaker like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (D-NY) or Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) was accosted in this way, we can only imagine the level of outrage there would be from the left, and the FBI would surely investigate immediately. Because Paul is a conservative however, the feds seem t be quickly sweeping this under the rug.

Despicable.

449,Paul,Rand,thepoliticalinsider,"Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction. Sometimes fictions presages truth by decades. That’s the case with “Bonfire of the Vanities,” the brilliant conservative novel by author Tom Wolfe. It was published in 1987. It reads like an accurate satire of every staged racial “protest” movement from George Floyd to this hour.

Wolfe Predicted Racial Rioting

The novel is overtly about a very rich Wall Street bond salesman, Sherman McCoy, who runs over a black kid in the Bronx after getting lost. His mistress is at the wheel but he gets blamed. The story follows him through his life, work, the incident, and the fallout that destroys his elite existence.

But the secondary plot line is everything we see today, and sadly much of what now again bedevils New York City. It is set in 1987, seven years before the Giuliani renaissance began. Rampant crime, leftwing obsessions, an out-of-touch elite, police sold out by their superiors in City Hall and the district attorney’s office, and a news media hoping for violent riots to boost ratings and confirm their leftist racial narrative are all in the novel’s mix.

RELATED: Protest Violence and the See-No-Evil Media

Wolfe Hits The Nail On The Head

And that’s the part Wolfe really gets right: the riots. He writes them as staged-for-television events anchored by blow-dried airheads and prefabricated at a moment’s notice to get media coverage. He also nails the cynical manipulation of race by the hard-left to advance their political goals. For them it’s really never about race one way or another, only about raw power.

This was five years before the Rodney King riots, so America had not yet slipped into violent riot mode. Wolfe’s riots are violent in a minor key, though the Left is portrayed as violent in other circumstances. In fact, the prologue, featuring an Ed Koch-like mayor of New York, is almost a play by play reenactment of what happened to Senator Rand Paul after Thursday night’s Republican National Convention. Only it was written over thirty years prior to the event.

RELATED: Rand Paul And His Wife Attacked By Angry Mob Outside White House

Wolfe’s Hilarious Conservative Book

Wolfe also wrote, years before “Bonfire,” the funniest conservative book ever written. Though some of P.J. O’Rourke’s works are stiff competition, Wolfe’s “Radical Chic and Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers” is a sardonic look at limousine liberals and the second part, Mau-Mauing, is a pitch-perfect portrayal of white guilt in government and the welfare state. Though set in the mid to late 1960s, both scenes could have been set in 2020. Here’s an excerpt that chronicles a Manhattan liberal celebrity party for the Black Panthers. Today it would be Black Lives Matter.

“Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. These are nice. Little Roquefort cheese morsels rolled in crushed nuts. Very tasty. Very subtle. It’s the way the dry sackiness of the nuts tiptoes up against the dour savor of the cheese that is so nice, so subtle. Wonder what the Black Panthers eat here on the hors d’oeuvre trail? Do the Panthers like little Roquefort cheese morsels rolled in crushed nuts this way, and asparagus tips in mayonnaise dabs, and meatballs petites au Coq Hardi, all of which are at this very moment being offered to them on gadrooned silver platters by maids in black uniforms with hand-ironed white aprons…” Thus, at the end of your summer reading list, try Wolfe. Either work will do. “Radical Chic and Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers” is much shorter than “Bonfire.” They entertain and enlighten, as any good writing should.

450,Paul,Rand,thepoliticalinsider,"Earlier today, we reported that Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) and his wife were attacked by a mob as they left the Republican National Convention at the White House in the early hours of Friday morning. Now, Senator Paul is speaking out to reveal that the mob was made up of paid demonstrators from out of town, and to call for their immediate arrests.

Paul Discusses Attack By Mob

Paul told “Fox & Friends” host Steve Doocy that the attack on him and his wife may just be a small part of a major operation that involves “interstate criminal traffic being paid for across state lines.”

“They were yelling threats. They were trying to push the police over to get to me,” Paul said. “They were grabbing at us, and it got worse and worse and worse, and then finally, we decided to make a move. I said, ‘We’ve got to move.'”

RELATED: Rand Paul And His Wife Attacked By Angry Mob Outside White House

Paul went on to say that as the situation escalated, the mob began screaming threats of violence.

“If there’s not reinforcements, we have to try to get to the hotel, which was another block and they were shouting threats to us, to kill us, to hurt us, but also threats, shouting ‘Say her name, Breonna Taylor,’ and it’s like you couldn’t reason with this mob — but I’m actually the author of the Breonna Taylor law to end no-knock raids,” he added.

Taylor is the 26-year-old black woman who was fatally shot by Louisville police during a raid back in March.

“[T]he irony is lost on these idiots that they are trying to kill the person whose actually trying to get rid of no-knock raids and they were shouting and screaming and just, really these people were unhinged, but I can’t tell you how, I’m not sure we would have made it,” Paul acknowledged.

Paul Says Police Saved His Life

In the end, he credits the police with saving his life, with one officer in particular stepping up to help the senator and his wife.

“[A]s we’re walking sort of surrounded by the police, they’re attempting to push the police over to get to me, so at one point they push a policeman backwards, he stumbles and he’s trying to catch his balance and I catch the back of his flak jacket to stabilize him to make sure he’s OK because he’s our defense,” Paul remembered. “If he’s down, the mob is loose on us, and you’ve seen the pictures of what they do to you.”

“[W]e are thankful we have police, and we’ve got to wake up,” he said. “We can’t have Joe Biden rule the country and have no police. I mean, we can’t walk down the street in D.C. safely now. That’s how bad it is.”

Paul believes that there is something far more sinister going on here than meets the eye:

“My feeling is that there is interstate criminal traffic being paid for across state lines, but you won’t know it unless you arrest them. Otherwise you just think ‘Oh, these are some normal hoodlums from a big city.’ I promise you that at least some of the members and the people who attacked us were not from D.C. They flew here on a plane with fresh, new clothes and they were paid to be here. It is a crime to do that and it needs to be traced. The FBI needs to investigate, but the only way you can do it is you have to arrest people. And usually we say, ‘Oh, well you didn’t get hurt, so we’re not going to arrest them.’ They were inciting a riot and they would have killed us had the police not been there.”

This serves as a reminder of the dangers that conservatives are facing every day in this country thanks to the increasingly radicalized Left. These days, there’s no telling what Democrats have up their sleeves, and there’s no limit to how far they will go to force their radical agenda on the American people.

451,Paul,Rand,foxnews,"In his speech to the Republican National Convention Thursday night, President Trump said if you want the rest of the country to look like Portland, Ore., put the Democrats fully in charge and that’s what you’ll get.

That’s hard to argue with considering what we are seeing in many of our cities, where well-intentioned protest marches long ago were hijacked into lawless and violent destructive anarchy, often led by outside agitators and violent Marxists.

I experienced some of this in Washington after the president’s speech.

RAND PAUL CALLS FOR FBI ARRESTS, INVESTIGATION INTO 'MOB' HE BELIEVES 'WOULD HAVE KILLED US,' IF NOT FOR POLICE

My wife Kelley and I were attempting to leave the White House event. We were staying at a hotel directly across the street, maybe 50 yards from the gates of the White House. But as we went to leave, it became apparent there was no safe exit out the gates and through the unruly mob that had gathered there.

Why? Because another Democratic-run city had decided it would bow to lawless rioters instead of protecting its citizens. Mayor Muriel Bowser was asked by the Secret Service to allow wider and better protection for those leaving the White House Thursday night, but she refused.

Mayor Bowser and many others are responsible for what happened. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., called my Senate colleagues and me “enemies of the state.” Democratic vice-presidential nominee Sen. Kamala Harris has advocated paying bail to get violent rioters out of jail.

Three Democratic House members who are part of the socialist “Squad” have called for people to “take to the streets.”

Well, national Democrats, your people are listening to you. How does it feel to watch it happen? Are you comfortable watching the mob go after my wife and me?

SEN. RAND PAUL THANKS DC COPS FOR SAVING HIM FROM 'CRAZED MOB' AFTER RNC

When we realized we couldn’t go the way we planned, we boarded a bus with others and went to the Trump International Hotel. It took us 45 minutes to get there and we waited there a while longer, figuring the crowd would settle down or leave.

As our Uber approached our hotel we ran into roadblocks two blocks out, preventing us from driving all the way. So we got out and walked.

That’s when the mob saw us.

Thankfully, a friendly observer named Jack Murphy had been out all night directing people to safety and taking videos of the mobs.

Murphy directed police toward us and we found a couple of policemen on the corner, just as a chanting mob came at us.

The crowd multiplied fast. One of them yelled: “We’ve got Rand Paul trapped!”

First, there were a handful of people — then 30, then 60, then over 100 screaming and out-of-control lunatics.

I leaned in close to the police officer in charge, who I don’t think recognized me, and said: “They’ve recognized me. I’m in Congress. We’re going to need reinforcements.”

The head officer spoke into a headset as the crowd hurled invective and pressed their menacing bodies against us.

Reinforcements were slow to come. I suggested to the lead officer that the mob’s anger was rising in pitch and venom, and that we couldn’t hold out much longer.

He agreed to try to get to us to our hotel, and two or three police officers joined us. The officers formed a human barricade, putting their bodies and bikes between us and the mob.

The mob continued shouting awful death threats. Curses. Shoving. One person in the mob violently slammed into a policeman just behind me. I turned to see the officer losing his balance. I grabbed the lower edge of his bulletproof vest to stabilize him. I yelled into his ear. “I’ve got your back!”

I noticed that my mouth was completely dry. “Cottonmouth” is what we called it when we were kids. I look at Kelley. Both of us realized we might not make it to our hotel.

But slowly the D.C. police were able to force our way through the throng.

My thanks to the police, who bravely handled a terrible situation. Both Kelley and I believe that without the courage of the police we would have been pushed to the ground and kicked and pummeled, as so many others have been.

And why?

Mob violence is never justified. Ever. But in this case, it doesn’t even make sense regarding what they were protesting. In between death-and-violence threats, protesters screamed “say her name” at us, in reference to the Breonna Taylor, who was fatally shot by police in my home state of Kentucky.

That’s off-base, because almost no one has said Breonna Taylor’s name as often or sincerely as I have. In fact, after speaking with Breonna’s family I authored the “Justice for Breonna Taylor Act” to end no-knock warrants like the one police used before they shot her in her own apartment in March.

I’ve authored or co-sponsored over 20 criminal justice reform bills, and I did it well before it was an acceptable thing to do in my party.

The cause of reform has no greater GOP ally than me, and yet know-nothing mobs angrily chanted and attacked me and my wife.

After we got back to our hotel room and some safety we heard something frightening. The “protesters” were staying on our floor— including the room next door to us. They were talking about their mob activities and even saying they thought we were here on this floor. We had to develop a 3 a.m. plan with the Capitol Police to get to safety.

My question is: Who are these people? Who paid for their hotel rooms? Who flew them in? Law enforcement needs to look at the funding of violent criminal activity like this.

And national Democrats need to confront it. It’s organized. It’s paid for. It’s violent. It’s not about Black lives or any lives; it’s about anarchy and destruction. The American people are starting to catch on and grow tired of it.

So I ask Democratic presidential nominee former Vice President Joe Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris this:

452,Paul,Rand,thepoliticalinsider,"Even Vernon Jones, a black former Democrat and supporter of President Trump, wasn’t safe from the mob outside the Republican National Convention (RNC) Thursday night.

Jones, who was accompanied by a woman as he tried to navigate his way to his hotel, was accosted by Black Lives Matter activists and hit with insults and racist slurs.

At first, the pair seem rather collected, with the woman even smiling as she corrects one of the ignorant protesters who tells his little friends that Jones is in Congress.

Things get a little tense, however, as the mob closes around them and begins to shout expletives.

Jones Apparently Doesn’t Matter

Upon hearing that Jones is not, in fact, a congressman, the protester in the video responds by apologizing and offering reasoned discourse about their opposing views.

Just kidding, he actually replied “f*** this dude!”

Which, you have to give him credit, is two words more than his usual vocabulary arsenal.

The insults from the Black Lives Matter protesters didn’t stop there.

“Are you a black Trump supporter?” one man asks Jones, confused to know that they do exist.

“You’re a fucking disgrace! Shame!” somebody yells.

Another shouted, “You house [n-word]!”

Jones and his guests had to be surrounded by police using their bicycles as a wall of protection in order to eventually make their way back to the hotel.

Freedom of Thought – Not Allowed

What is it about Jones that raises the ire of fake race activists like BLM? It’s one thing and one thing only – he supports President Trump.

And that freedom of thought will not be tolerated in the pro-segregation branch of the BLM/Democrat movement.

Jones actually addressed this in his speech to the RNC.

“The Democratic party does not want black people to leave their mental plantation,” he proudly stated. “We’ve been forced to be there for decades and generations, but I have news for Joe Biden. We are free.”

“We are free people with free minds, and I’m part of a large and growing segment of the black community who are independent thinkers, and we believe that Donald Trump is the president that America needs to lead us forward,” Jones added.

They don’t want a man like that, with that kind of message, out there roaming the streets. They’re one true goal is to introduce Communism, Marxism, and anarchy to America. They don’t care about the black community.

Media’s Racism Towards Black Conservatives

Where would they get the crazy notion that only certain black lives matter? From the BLM/Democrat/Media movement.

CNN Senior Political Reporter Nia-Malika Henderson slammed Jones and other black Trump supporters for speaking at the RNC, claiming they “had to testify and be Donald Trump’s black friend.”

MSNBC host Craig Melvin recently suggested Jones had to be getting paid to support the President.

You feed enough of this pseudo-intellectual drivel to the public, and eventually, the low-information people comprising the BLM/Democrat/Media/Joe Biden movement will use it as a means to justify their unhinged actions.

We’re almost certain that these people in a group supporting “black lives” are unaware of the irony involved in them harassing a black man for walking down the street.

How 1960s of them.",1,https://thepoliticalinsider.com/blm-protesters-harass-hurl-slurs-at-black-trump-supporter-vernon-jones/
453,Paul,Rand,thepoliticalinsider,"Like many conscientious, law-abiding Americans, I thought I’d reached my limit when it came to tolerating violent riots weeks ago. But then I saw a horrifyingly graphic video of “protesters” in New York last week chasing a scared raccoon out from underneath a car and clubbing it to death in the middle of the street. Are there people out there who really believe that helpless animals are tools of white supremacy? Or can we finally admit the violence that’s been raging since the police killing of George Floyd has become completely wanton and unmoored from notions of justice?

Maybe raccoon lives don’t matter much, but the fate of the poor critter proved to be a very bad omen. Tuesday, two people were killed after attacking an armed 17-year-old who was running away from a mob in Kenosha. A high school kid may have had no business carrying a gun in the middle of a riot, but the various videos also show he may have had valid reasons to fear for his life. The New York Times, to its credit, has a good breakdown of what happened, but the young gunman is now charged with first-degree murder.

How bad were things in Kenosha? Well, this is the week CNN finally began fretting about the rioting sweeping the country for months. Unfortunately, it’s not that the news channel suddenly noticed dozens of people are dead and damage to property may cost billions. If you want a near perfect tableau of cable news in the Trump era, it’s hard to top what happened on CNN Tuesday night. Reporter Oscar Jimenez stood in front of an inferno of burning vehicles and the chyron underneath him read, “Fiery But Mostly Peaceful Protests After Police Shooting.”

The real problem for CNN is that Kenosha happens to be one of the swingiest districts in a swing state and, well, the Republican National Convention was going on. “The rioting has to stop. … It’s showing up in the polling, it’s showing up in focus groups. It is the only thing right now that is sticking [for Republicans],” host Don Lemon told his colleague Chris Cuomo, who nodded along sympathetically. This is certainly a change in tone at CNN. Back in June, Cuomo asked viewers to “please, show me where it says protesters are supposed to be polite and peaceful.” (The pride of Fordham Law School must have momentarily forgotten about the First Amendment.)

RELATED: Rand Paul And His Wife Attacked By Angry Mob Outside White House

Incredibly, Lemon went on to urge Joe Biden to give a speech denouncing the riots and blaming Trump for violence that has been most directly enabled by Democratic governance. Exhibit A is progressive Oregon Gov. Kate Brown, who on Wednesday took a look at the polls and tweeted, “It’s time for the violence and vandalism to end so Portland can focus on the important work to be done to achieve real change for racial justice. Those who have committed acts of violence will be held accountable.”

This also represents a big change in rhetoric for Brown. Throughout July, she publicly blamed the city’s riots on the increased federal law enforcement presence at the federal courthouse in downtown Portland. The city had already stood down when rioters burned a police building to the ground a few blocks away from the courthouse, so the governor’s argument was curious at best.

Still, Brown got away with scapegoating the feds because the media credulously adopted the false narrative that Portland didn’t have a law and order problem until the feds arrived. Just this past the weekend, The New York Times ran a puffy profile of Portland’s young district attorney, who has dismissed charges against half of the 600 people arrested for rioting in the city since May.

However, the feds secured a protection agreement from the city and drew down their presence weeks ago. On July 31, the Washington Post headline was “Trump ordered federal forces to quell Portland protests. But the chaos ended as soon as they left.” Not only has the chaos in Portland not ended, it has ramped up. Portland police have declared riots 12 times so far in August, compared to 10 times from the end of May through the end of July. Brown and the Washington Post don’t have Trump to blame for the violence this month. But when a police union building was subsequently torched, the Post switched tacks. It published a piece essentially cheering the arsonists on.

Portland’s neighbors to the north in Seattle are undergoing a similar reckoning. During the RNC Wednesday night, MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow broke away from South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem’s speech to do an urgent “fact check” on Noem’s contention Democratic-led cities are overrun with crime. Maddow brought Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan on the air to rebut Noem – Durkan dutifully pronounced Noem “purposefully wrong” and blamed “the president and Fox News” for creating a false impression of violence in her city.

Back on planet Earth, Durkan ordered police to abandon a precinct building earlier this summer and let protesters set up a lawless zone of the city where two people were murdered. Things haven’t really improved since then. Last week, Durkan held a press conference about “significant concerns regarding an increase in arsons, homicides, and shots fired.” This week rioters tried to seal up the doors to Seattle’s east precinct police station with quick-dry cement and then set the building on fire. Federal police are now coming in whether Durkan wants them or not – the incident has triggered an ATF investigation. So far, there has been next to no national media coverage of the attempted mass murder of Seattle cops.

But in order to cover the riots properly, journalists would have to take time out from participating in them. On Tuesday, angry mobs charged down the streets of D.C. – a town where Donald Trump captured a whopping 4% of the vote in 2016 – and confronted diners in restaurants and demanded that they raise their fists and affirmatively express agreement with the Black Lives Matter movement. They angrily confronted and menaced those few patrons who refused to bow to the mob. According to a Washington Post reporter present, one of the leaders of this cultural revolution-in-a-teacup was a journalist – a writer for the sports website Deadspin, which not that long ago was considered a reasonably mainstream publication.

RELATED: Virginia Senate Passes Bill That Makes Assaulting A Police Officer A Misdemeanor

Obviously, very few journalists are in the streets acting like Maoist thugs, but after months of violence with no end in sight, it’s worth reviewing whether major media coverage of the upheaval following the killing George Floyd has at least been helpful or accurate. In June, Astead W. Herndon and Dionne Searcey wrote in the Times that polling showed Americans were broadly supportive of the Black Lives Matter movement, a development that would likely benefit Biden in November. “Just 37 percent [in battleground states] said rioting was a bigger problem,” they wrote, “though Mr. Trump and his allies have tried to discredit the protests by focusing on some isolated incidents of violence.”

That “some isolated incidents of violence” line was insulting to readers two months ago, and looks even worse now as Biden supporters freak out about his sudden vulnerability due to the continuing cycle of riots. And after that brief embrace of Black Lives Matter following Floyd’s killing, polling now shows it’s returned to being as polarizing as it was before his death.

Whether the complicity in downplaying months of violence means Trump has a real shot at overtaking Biden or will merely get a dead raccoon bounce in the polls, remains to be seen. But the lesson for the media is obvious enough: When you put politics before the facts, the facts have unexpected ways of reshaping politics.

Scary Video

Nerve-wracking video of the incident emerged showing a crowd of protesters swarming the Senator and his wife, essentially chasing them back to their hotel.

Paul had to be surrounded by police, with one officer in front defending him with a bicycle.

Protesters began shouting “no justice, no peace,” with justice in their minds seemingly being random violence and harassment of civilized people.

At one point, the officer with the bike appears to be shoved and momentarily falls to the ground. Paul turns back to make sure he’s okay before he returns to his feet and continues to escort the Kentucky Republican to safety.

Democrat Sponsored Violence

Paul has, on more than one occasion, been the victim of violence either directly or indirectly sponsored by his Democrat colleagues. Certainly, recent rhetoric could be linked to this latest incident.

Just days ago, we wrote that “Democrats have sent a … signal to ‘protesters,’ a not all that subtle dog-whistle to keep the violence going.”

Why? Because Representative Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) told her supporters there needs to be “unrest in the streets.”

Paul’s Past Experiences With Violence

Paul has seen more than his share of such violence.

In 2017, he was physically assaulted by his neighbor, leaving him with a myriad of injuries including six broken ribs, pleural effusion, and, consequently, pneumonia which resulted in part of his lung being removed.

The Senator was also on the field during a congressional baseball practice in Alexandria, Virginia that same year, when James Hodgkinson carried out a mass assassination attempt of Republican lawmakers.

“I was there at the ball field when Steven Scalise almost died from a very, very angry violent man who was incited really by rhetoric on the left,” Paul said in a later interview.

As a libertarian Republican, there are often times I agree with those on the other side of the aisle. Among those issues are war and criminal justice reform. Many if not all of my efforts in these areas have been rooted in my commitment to lead as many of my fellow Republicans as possible to what I believe is the position of principle and constitutional government.

Unfortunately, and too often in the past, these are the exact areas where the new Democratic ticket has fallen very short. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, much like Hillary Clinton, have poor records on foreign policy and criminal justice.

In 2002, Joe Biden was the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. As such, he could and should have been the check and balance against a misguided attempt by the Bush administration to go to war with Iraq.

Instead, as usual, Joe Biden chose the wrong, more hawkish path. Twenty-one of his Democratic colleagues, including my friends Ron Wyden and Pat Leahy, took the principled stand to oppose this war.

Check Trump record on intervention

Do you know who else opposed this war? Donald Trump. By 2004 he was a full-blown opponent, and he ran for president loudly proclaiming that it was a geopolitical mistake that led to 15 years of increasingly bad policy in the Middle East.

When a candidate for office comes to me to ask for my endorsement in their campaign, this is the first question I ask: “Do you believe the Iraq War was a mistake?”

Joe Biden, who defended his vote to authorize the war for years, fails that test.

Biden is a reliable interventionist. He supported war in Libya, Syria and Serbia. He pushed for NATO expansion and for more foreign aid to countries who hate America, like Pakistan.

Donald Trump’s policy is to stop the endless wars Joe Biden spent his career starting.

The choice is very stark and very clear.

On the issue of criminal justice, we have a two-for-one deal. Both Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have a troubling history of putting minorities in prison for drug crimes.

Of course, once again, Joe Biden tops the list by far.

In 1994, President Bill Clinton signed into law a bill that brought great harm to a generation of Black and Hispanic Americans.

Who stood behind him, applauding,when he signed the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act into law?

Joe Biden.

It was part of a long history of Biden playing the “law and order” card, which meant putting people away for harsh sentences, with clearly racial implications.

Glenn Harlan Reynolds:When Black lives matter to Democrats, and when they don't

Biden said it himself in a Senate floor speech earlier that same year: “The truth is, every major crime bill since 1976 that’s come out of this Congress, every minor crime bill, has had the name of the Democratic senator from the state of Delaware: Joe Biden.”

Or, to put it more colloquially as Biden did: “Lock the SOBs up.”

Kamala Harris' record as a prosecutor was closely examined in the Democratic primary, and she was famously taken to task on it by my friend Tulsi Gabbard. Harris was on the wrong side of reform, or consciously silent. She refused to fight to overturn wrongful convictions, worked to continue draconian marijuana laws, and aggressively went after parents of truant school children.

Be wary of Biden and Harris

To put it mildly, this is not a ticket that those with liberal or libertarian views on war and justice should embrace.

Donald Trump signed historic, first-in-a-generation criminal justice reform legislation with the First Step Act, the first step to undo the damage of both Biden and Harris.

He has changed our foreign policy away from the hawks of both parties, and he became the first president in memory to not start a war in his term in office — and is working to end the ones he inherited.

As America watches the Democratic ticket this week at their convention, I urge them to look closely. Look at the issues, the record and the facts, rather than the rhetoric and promises of the speeches.

461,Paul,Rand,reason,"In a free society, citizens should be able to easily distinguish between civilian law enforcement tasked with keeping the peace in our communities and the armed forces tasked with protecting our country from foreign adversaries.

Unfortunately, thanks to the federal government flooding our neighborhoods with billions of dollars of military equipment and property over the years, the line between peace officer and soldier of war has become increasingly blurry.

Police officers have an incredibly difficult and often thankless job where they lay their lives on the line every day. Without the rule of law, a civilized society cannot exist, and our officers deserve our gratitude. The horrific actions of a few bad actors should not erase all the good done by the vast majority of these brave and hardworking men and women.

But as the federal government has enabled our local police to become more and more militarized, it has placed them in greater danger by eroding the community trust crucial to doing their jobs well.

While I respect the determination to preserve law and order, sending in federal forces to quell civil unrest in Portland further distorts the boundaries, results in more aggression (including pepper-spraying and repeatedly striking a Navy veteran whose injured hand will need surgery), and has led to reports we should never hear in a free country: federal officials, dressed in camouflage, snatching protesters away in unmarked vehicles.

Sending the feds into Chicago won't make the situation there any better, either.

Nothing you'll read here excuses the actions of those who have destroyed lives and property in a mockery of peaceful protest—actions I have condemned. But many of us have been inspired by seeing protesters confronting these rioters, making the difference between righteous cause and opportunistic destruction even more stark.

Restoring lost trust is essential to reducing the tension and returning to peace. This means stopping the federal militarization of our local law enforcement and keeping federal agents and troops on the national posts where they best serve our country.

According to the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), which operates within the Department of Defense, ""More than $7.4 billion worth of property"" has been transferred to law enforcement through the Law Enforcement Support Office (LESO) program. DLA also reveals that ""as of June 2020, there are around 8,200 federal, state and local law enforcement agencies from 49 states and four U.S. territories participating in the program.""

Back in 2014, NPR reported the federal government had sent out 79,288 assault rifles, 205 grenade launchers, and 11,959 bayonets from 2006–2014.

Yahoo recently reported that ""the California Highway Patrol received what appeared to be a drone worth $22 million in 2016. The Howell Township Police Department in New Jersey received an MRAP [mine-resistant, ambush-protected vehicle] worth $865,000 in 2016. An MRAP provided to the Payne County Sheriff Office in Stillwater, Oklahoma, cost $1.3 million.""

As the Senate debates the latest National Defense Authorization Act, I joined a bipartisan group of senators to introduce an amendment based on my Stop Militarizing Law Enforcement Act, which I originally introduced with Sen. Brian Schatz (D–Hawaii) in 2015 and have reintroduced in each session of Congress since.

Our amendment would have limited the transfer of certain offensive military equipment including bayonets, grenade launchers, and weaponized drones—all without prohibiting the continued distribution of defensive equipment, such as body armor.

It would also have ensured that communities are notified of requests and transfers by posted notices throughout the area and on a public website, and it would have required that a jurisdiction's governing body approves of the transfers.

Though the Senate voted against these common-sense changes, my standalone legislation goes even further to reform the system, and I will keep working to advance it through Congress.

Our bipartisan approach takes seriously the idea that cops on the beat can only do their jobs well when they are well-known by their neighbors and trusted by their communities.

The Stop Militarizing Law Enforcement Act will help build that relationship, making our citizens, police, and neighborhoods safer.",1,https://reason.com/2020/07/21/rand-paul-its-time-to-demilitarize-the-police/

When Alice Johnson ran to embrace her family after her release from prison, she was a 63-year-old grandmother who spent almost 22 years behind bars. But Johnson was supposed to die in custody.

The co-defendants who testified against her received sentences ranging from probation to 10 years. Johnson received no such leniency. Rather, Johnson, an African American woman and first-time offender, was sentenced to life without parole for her participation in a nonviolent drug conspiracy. But for President Trump commuting her sentence in 2018, Johnson would have paid for her one-and-only mistake by remaining in prison until her dying day.

The killings of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd remind us of the racial disparities that are indicative of a criminal justice system in dire need of reform and a drug war that needs to end. But discussion of criminal justice reform rarely focuses on how the crime of conspiracy contributes to unfair sentences and mass incarceration, particularly of Black Americans. It is time to acknowledge that the doctrine of criminal conspiracy is unsound, unnecessary and unjust.

Conspiracy, the notion that a mere agreement between two or more people to violate the law is itself a crime, has long been considered a serious threat to fairness in the administration of justice.

Generations ago, in 1948, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson stated, “The modern crime of conspiracy is so vague that it almost defies definition,” and he also observed that it “will incriminate persons on the fringe of offending who would not be guilty of aiding and abetting or of becoming an accessory, for those charges only lie when an act which is a crime has actually been committed.”

In other words, conspiracy introduces confusion into the justice system and imprisons those who might agree to violate the law but do not actually commit the supposedly agreed upon crime.

Had Justice Jackson’s words been heeded, the drug war might not have waged so much destruction on urban families. Instead, as the Drug Policy Alliance reports, “One out of every 14 children in this country has had a parent imprisoned.” As the study they link to on that statistic also shows, Black children have borne the brunt of the drug war’s impacts and are twice as likely to lose a parent to incarceration compared to white children.

As the NAACP notes, “African Americans and whites use drugs at similar rates, but the imprisonment rate of African Americans for drug charges is almost 6 times that of whites.” When conspiracy laws become weapons in the drug war, Black families are more likely to be the casualties.

Federal drug-related conspiracy laws are pernicious because, as The Sentencing Project describes, “Sentences for federal drug crimes are based on the quantity of drugs involved, not the individual’s role in the crime.”

Case in point, Kemba Smith had to personally pay for the crimes of her abusive boyfriend, who headed a multi-million-dollar crack operation. Although prosecutors conceded that they had no evidence that Smith participated in drug trafficking, the government made little distinction between the supporting roles Smith played and the crimes of her boyfriend.

As a result, Smith’s conspiracy charge resulted in a sentence of over 24 years. Nearly a quarter century of imprisonment for someone else’s crime is not justice; it’s ruthlessness.

'I can't be weak':How the Say Her Name movement impacts young Black women

We must resist punitive and overzealous sentencing and take care to ensure that the laws Congress passes are just. With that in mind, I recently offered an amendment to the Emmett Till Antilynching Act, a bill that would label any conspiracy to violate a federal hate crime as a lynching, punishable by up to 10 years in prison. My amendment would preserve harsh sentences for the hateful crime of lynching but ensure that conspiracies involving minor altercations and lesser crimes are not categorized as a lynching.

Unfortunately, recent events validated this concern and demonstrated the tragic illogic of conspiracy laws. In May and June, protesters sympathetic to the Black Lives Matter movement defaced St. John’s Episcopal Church in Washington, D.C. Damage to religious property classifies as a federal hate crime.

Because more than one person was involved, had the Emmett Till Antilynching Act been federal law, those who conspired to deface St. John’s Church could have been prosecuted for lynching and faced a decade in prison. If the first prosecutions under a federal antilynching law were made against vandals, then Congress would have finally achieved the height of unintended consequences. We cannot fight injustice by passing laws that create more injustice.

Although criminal justice and police reform have thus far stalled, I sincerely hope it is a temporary setback and that Congress reconsiders these worthy causes soon. And, when it does, Congress could make significant progress by repealing conspiracy laws that result in easier convictions and cruel prison sentences that either do not fit the crime or apply when no crime has been committed at all.

(OpEd by U.S. Senator Rand Paul)

In 2015, I filibustered reauthorization of the Patriot Act. My filibuster was not popular with other senators because it kept them in Washington over a Memorial Day weekend. I still remember one or two hotheads muttering and directing profanity under their breath. I have to admit I may have given them right back some choice words of my own.

A senior Republican in leadership admonished me that I’d be sorry if terrorists struck the United States while the Patriot Act was expired. I responded, “Couldn’t we just rely on the Constitution for a few hours, like we did for over 200 years?”

Sturm und Drang, fear and more fear, always are disingenuously attached to the debate over the Patriot Act. Our ‘dear leaders’ emotionally warn of impending terroristic calamity if Congress should restrict the Patriot Act’s power to sift through American phone and business records.

Fast forward five years, and the Patriot Act came up for reauthorization this spring. The only difference is Republicans, and an occasional honest Democrat, have discovered that the Patriot Act and its facilitator, the FISA court, were abused to conduct a partisan investigation of a major presidential candidate.

The secret FISA court was used to issue secret warrants to spy on the Trump campaign. This knowledge became so widespread that simply sweeping it under the carpet became impossible. Instead, the defenders of the deep state conspired to put forth fake reform.

FISA would still be allowed to investigate political campaigns, but new procedural hurdles were put in place. Weak sauce, I say. I offered an amendment to exclude the FISA court from investigating Americans.

My logic was that FISA warrants did not require adherence to the Fourth Amendment, so FISA warrants shouldn’t be issued for Americans. FISA warrants ask that a judge ascertain ‘probable cause’ of someone being an agent of a foreign country, and the accused is not allowed to challenge or even know of the warrant.

The Constitution, via the Fourth Amendment, requires that a judge ascertain ‘probable cause’ of a crime, and the accused ultimately gets to challenge the warrant.

Anything short of guaranteeing that each and every American gets the protection of the Fourth Amendment is ‘weak sauce’ and an insult to Americans that want the abuse heaped on this president by the intelligence community to never happen again.

My amendment failed. Eleven constitutional conservatives voted for it, and not one Democrat could emerge from Trump Derangement fog to support the Constitution.

Funny thing, though. President Trump watched from afar and then threatened to veto the bill because it didn’t really reform FISA. So, three provisions of the Patriot Act, including Section 215’s mass surveillance of Americans, have been expired for some three months.

Hmmm. Perhaps we could go back to just living under the Constitution? I hope President Trump will veto the ‘weak sauce’ fake reform bill, as it does next to nothing to prevent another president from being abused by our Intel Community.

In the meantime, Americans should remember Franklin’s admonition that those who trade their liberty for security may well wind up with neither.",1,https://www.thenewsjournal.net/potus-should-veto-weak-sauce-fake-fisa-reform-bill/

President Donald Trump speaks to the troops during a surprise Thanksgiving day visit at Bagram Air Field, on November 28, 2019 in Afghanistan. (Photo by OLIVIER DOULIERY/AFP via Getty Images)

In 1988, a certain congressman from Texas ran for president on a platform of bringing home our troops from around the world. Even then, more than 30 years ago, U.S. troops were in over 100 countries, and tens of thousands were still in Europe.

That Texas congressman was my father, Ron Paul, who 20 years later ran again for the presidency and was still calling “to begin bringing American troops home from around the world—an absolute necessity if the budget is ever to be brought under control. We’re going broke and we still have 75,000 troops in Germany?”

In his best-selling book The Revolution, my father wrote: “We can either withdraw gracefully, as I propose, or we can stay in our fantasy world and wait until bankruptcy forces us to scale back our foreign commitments.”

This week, President Trump called for a modest reduction of American troops in Germany, reducing them from 34,500 to 25,000 (a great start that will hopefully lead to further reductions there). The Republican neocon caucus responded exactly as you would expect. You’d think the Berlin Wall was still in place and two million Russians were about to invade Germany. Utter nonsense.

With the Cold War now 30 years moribund, the hysteria over removing troops is ludicrous. Meanwhile the very real threat of bankruptcy and menacing debt grows each day. Just this year, the United States will add $4 trillion to the national debt. Can the Germans afford to defend themselves? Without question. Germany actually balances its annual budget every year.

Yet the U.S. still has about 170,000 troops in about 150 countries at great expense in both lives and treasure. Often that puts our soldiers on the front lines of civil wars whose origins we barely even comprehend. The U.S. also becomes allied with governments, such as Saudi Arabia, that are barbaric, despotic, and anti-American. And yet the cycle continues because the war caucus vows to never, ever let our troops come home.

President Trump is also advocating ending our nation’s longest war in Afghanistan. It couldn’t happen soon enough. The American taxpayer is paying $50 billion a year to build roads and bridges in that country, while our own nation’s infrastructure crumbles.

President Trump has also discussed having fewer troops in South Korea, and has actually forced Seoul to pay more for our presence. Possibly the best aspect of the Trump presidency, though, has been his willingness to challenge the bipartisan neoconservative consensus on forever war.

Yet critics, including myself, will admit the Trump presidency has not always practiced what it’s preached here. While Trump has consistently advocated for fewer troops in Europe, he has re-introduced U.S. troops into Saudi Arabia, a mistake that eventually will lead to more war or terrorism or both.

But today, give credit where credit is due. Trump, the disrupter, is right to bring the troops home. And I say don’t stop until we once again have a military whose primary job is to defend America.

When I ran for office, I promised to read the bills. Apparently, that is not a requirement for Courier Journal columnists. Had The Courier read the anti-lynching bill and listened to the floor debate before launching into an ad hominem attack on me, they might have discovered that not only did I not “block” the bill, I actually sought the Senate’s immediate consideration and passage of the Emmett Till Antilynching Act with an amendment.

I offered an amendment to strengthen the bill because of my long-standing commitment to work in a bipartisan fashion to enact criminal justice reform and ensure that all people, regardless of race or class, are treated equally under the law.

Second, understanding what the anti-lynching bill actually addresses is particularly relevant. To be perfectly clear, lynching and murder are already against the law. Hate crime statutes have been on the federal books for more than 50 years and murdering someone because of his or her race has been a federal hate crime for over a decade.

Because I stand so strongly behind the belief that a hateful crime such as lynching deserves a severe sentence, I could not support a bill that places such a low threshold on what could be considered a lynching. My immediate concern was the unintended consequence of making victims out of the very people we seek to protect.

Gerth:Rand Paul's timing impeccable as he blocks lynching bill during racial unrest

For example, Tiffany Harris is a black woman from New York and was arrested in December 2019 after slapping three Jewish women and making a religious slur. Harris was initially charged with a misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in jail. But, if she were convicted under a federal hate crime statute, she could be sentenced for up to 10 years in prison.

I fear that, with the low threshold provided in this bill, the jury trial will be eroded. Prosecutors will inevitably threaten people guilty of the crimes like those committed by Tiffany Harris with trumped up charges in an effort to obtain a plea bargain.

Prosecutors already have enough blank checks. I do not intend on giving them another one.

This is why I have led on criminal justice reform. For too long, Congress ignored the impact of our system’s harsh penalties, turning a blind eye as mandatory minimum sentences led to the problem of over-criminalization and mass incarceration. A 10-year sentence for slapping someone is an abomination and the law has already incarcerated too many people unfairly. I am trying to preclude that kind of unintended consequence.

But you don’t need to take my word for it. I actually encourage you to take a look at my record and the nearly two dozen justice reform bills I’ve authored and co-sponsored In the Senate. But the left would prefer to politicize my record on criminal justice reform — contorting facts and quotes to fit a rigid narrative that all Republicans are to blame. That is not only uncalled for, but completely counterproductive to what I thought we all were fighting for.

Instead of personal slander and innuendo you would think a newspaper of record would have the decency to portray my attempts to strengthen the Emmett Till Antilynching Act honestly.

We passed the First Step Act to begin to fix some of the racial disparities in criminal justice. I led that bipartisan effort, first meeting with President Obama and ultimately getting it passed under President Trump. It only happened because partisans put away the slings and arrows of partisanship to address serious inequities in our system.

Is it too much to ask that we try again, in a bipartisan way, to work together to come up with an anti-lynching bill that doesn’t unintentionally mete out 10-year sentences for minor altercations?

The terrible act of lynching deserves the most severe penalty we can apply. But the bill as written could potentially define slapping someone as a “lynching” and thereby eligible for 10 years in prison. That is an injustice and the public deserves to know the facts.

We can work together for a better future, or we can continue to divide our nation by hurling unfounded insults and silencing important perspectives that could lead to real progress. No matter how loud the noise gets, no matter what comes my way, I will always continue to work for a more just America.

On the day of George Floyd’s funeral, as American cities continued to fill with protesters demonstrating for Black lives, Congress sought to pass a bill that would make lynching a federal crime. But one man, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul (R), stood in the way.

In an emotional exchange on the Senate floor Thursday, Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) pleaded with Paul to stand down and allow their legislation to pass. The bill, the Emmett Till Anti-Lynching Act, named after the 14-year-old Black teenager who was brutally murdered in 1955, has broad bipartisan support.

“I have had children break down with me this week wondering if this is a country that values their lives as much as white people’s lives,” Booker said, choking up on the Senate floor. “I have had to explain to grown men this week that there is still hope in America … For one member to yield … for one day and give America this win. Let us pass this legislation today of all days, let us give a headline tomorrow that will give hope to this country that we can get it right. It may not cure the ills that so many are protesting about but it could be a sign of hope.”

Just as we were getting into the swing of socially distanced meet-ups in parks and gardens, the June sun disappeared and the heavens opened.

Boris Johnson has already urged members of the public to avoid going inside if they get caught in the rain with members of another household. “We relaxed the rules on meeting outside for a very specific reason, because the evidence shows that the risks of transmission are much lower outdoors,” he said in Wednesday’s Downing Street briefing.

So with more dreary weather coming up, should you cancel your (safe) social plans altogether? Absolutely not, we say – it’s time to embrace the rain.

Instead of perceiving a rainy day as disappointing, why not see it as a chance to practise mindfulness?

As Ian Banyard, founder of Cotswold Natural Mindfulness, told the New York Times: “The human body is largely made of water, and yet so many of us feel uncomfortable walking in the rain and getting wet. That need not be the case. Walking mindfully in the rain is a wonderful opportunity to get closer to nature, and our true nature.”

Pause a conversation with pals to listen to the sound of rain trickling down a drainpipe, welcome the freshness of droplets touching skin, and inhale the delicious scent of water meeting earth.

Rain taps into each of our senses, making it the perfect weather to get us out of our heads and into the present moment – something that’s been proven to boost mental health. “Mindfulness meditation has been shown to affect how the brain works and even its structure,” states the Mental Health Foundation.

“People undertaking mindfulness training have shown increased activity in the area of the brain associated with positive emotion – the pre-frontal cortex – which is generally less active in people who are depressed.”

If mindfulness isn’t your bag, race your mates to the shelter of a tree, grab your brollies, dig out your brightly coloured mac, wear wellies to splash in puddles, and laugh as your mascara runs down your face. Rain presents a chance to be a bit silly – and we can all benefit from having a laugh in difficult times.

Laughing triggers a beneficial hormonal response in the brain, neuroscientist Professor Sophie Scott previously told HuffPost UK. You get a change in adrenaline – the flight or fight neurotransmitter – and, in turn, become more relaxed.

“You also get an increase in the circulating endorphins, meaning it feels good to laugh,” she said. “Over a longer time scale, you then get a reduction in cortisol – the stress hormone.”

The rain also doesn’t need to stop you getting outdoors to exercise – especially if you’re among the many people who’ve discovered a love of running during lockdown.

The pandemic has made life weird, and lockdowns and restrictions are just some of the recent events to have a tremendous effect on the human psyche.

A few months ago, tons of people started experiencing wild and vivid coronavirus-themed dreams. As the days passed, many lost their sense of time and stopped caring about whether it was a Sunday or Tuesday.

Behavioural health specialists suspect this isn’t a coincidence. Here’s why so many people are revisiting their pasts in quarantine:

We’ve got more time on our hands.

The main reason people are reminiscing so much is that many of us have more time to do so.



Kathryn Crimmins, who is living through the pandemic in New York City, told HuffPost she’s been thinking about past break-ups now more than ever. She did this before the coronavirus crisis, too, but would start feeling anxious and quickly turn away from the memory. But now she is diving deep into long-ago memories, mostly because she can.

“Perhaps because a lot of the daily routine stressors and stimuli of my life are gone, the past has turned into a welcome retreat,” Crimmins said.

Collin Reiff, a psychiatrist at NYU Langone Health, has observed this phenomenon with his patients. Generally, people have more free time right now to think back on their lives. Some have been laid off or furloughed from work, and on top of that, there’s not so much to do since most places are shut down.

“Often what happens in daily life is we take some issues that may be conflictual for us and we make a conscious awareness to suppress them, or it can be unconscious and they can be repressed. If you don’t have the distraction of daily life … it could be easy to get pulled back in [to the past],” Reiff said.

Westend61 via Getty Images Looking at the past is a way to regain some control in a situation that’s making you feel helpless.

The past can be grounding.

For some, the past can also provide a sense of calm and stability that people aren’t getting from their daily lives right now. There’s a lot of uncertainty and instability ahead, and people may resort to the past to find peace. “The past is very comforting. It’s a known,” Reiff said.

It’s human nature to make negative assumptions when we’re faced with uncertainty, according to Reiff. In this case, people may have doubts about what the future holds. Looking at the past is a way to regain some control in a situation that’s making you feel helpless.

Mayra Mendez, a psychotherapist with Providence Saint John’s Child and Family Development Center in Santa Monica, California, added that looking back can help people understand how they once dealt with grief and uncertainty and that they can overcome difficulties yet again. Most people will realise they have a great capacity for resilience, Mendez said.

The past can also be grounding, she added. It validates our existence and gives our life meaning, especially in a time when there’s so much instability.

“When you’re grounded in your own existence, it stabilises your thinking, your emotions, your ability to problem-solve and cognitively process information,” Mendez said.

People are grieving life as they knew it.

A lot of people are also likely experiencing loss ― their jobs, their loved ones, their milestones, their sense of normalcy ― and are struggling to adjust to the new situation. “We miss life as it was before, and we don’t know if it’s going to come back,” Reiff said.

To Reiff, it appears that many people who are swept up in reminiscing on their past may be stuck in the bargaining phase of grief, during which they explore the “what ifs” and “if onlys” of past decisions, life events and choices. They’re going back and wondering what life would look like had they done certain things differently.

Westend61 via Getty Images

What to do if you’re stuck on or struggling with the past.

Some reflecting can be healthy, especially if it’s bringing you peace and helping you learn about yourself right now.

That said, reminiscing can turn negative if you’ve experienced trauma or are prone to rumination, depression or anxiety. If that’s the case, Mendez recommends speaking with a trained mental health professional who can help you work through some of your memories.

It can also help to talk about your past with friends, since they can provide new perspectives and help you see things in a new light, according Reiff. Doing so can also create a sense of solidarity when you realise other people are in the same boat.

“When you talk to different people, it helps you realise that you’re not alone with it,” Reiff said. People need an outlet— i.e. a phone chat, Zoom call, or email or text conversation — to open up their mind and see things from a different point of view, Mendez noted.

A lot of people are struggling to cope and want things to go back to the way they were before the pandemic.

“I’m sure we all know people who feel really down right now and are making negative predictions about the future and really miss the past,” Reiff said.",1,https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/heres-why-youre-reminiscing-more-than-usual-during-the-pandemic_uk_5ed90adac5b63cce951104fd?ncid=tweetlnkukhpmg00000001

470,Paul,Rand,yahoo,"Disturbing footage taken during a Buffalo, New York, protest shows police pushing a lone 75-year-old protester to the ground, causing him to hit his head on the concrete and bleed.



After an initial statement said the man “tripped and fell,” the police commissioner ordered an investigation and two officers were suspended without pay. The protester was hospitalized in serious condition.

Videos captured by local media organizations show a large group of officers closing in on Buffalo’s Niagara Square to enforce an 8 p.m. curfew amid scattered anti-racism protests in the area. The graphic footage offers a close-up look at the force some officers use on protesters, even when they’re peaceful.

As seen in the clips, a single protester approached the officers and began speaking to them. Two of the cops moved toward him, and at least one shoved him with his hand. The protester, a white man, fell to the ground and audibly hit his head on the concrete, where he lay still and began to bleed from his ear. The officers stopped to look at him until another officer stepped in and directed them to keep walking.

“One person was injured when he tripped & fell,” police said in a statement issued by the city that doesn’t match what’s shown in the videos.

Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown (D) issued a statement late Thursday saying he was “deeply disturbed” by the incident and said the officers had been suspended without pay.

He also said the protester, who was not identified, was in stable but serious condition at Erie County Medical Center Hospital in Buffalo.

Katie Gibas, a Spectrum News producer who captured some of the footage, said the injured man was taken away in an ambulance and appeared to be alert. Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz, whose county contains Buffalo, confirmed on Twitter that the man was in serious but stable condition and said the footage he saw “sickens” him.

“Police officers cannot continue to hide behind the lie that they are protecting and serving,” the ACLU of New York said in a statement calling out “military-geared” police.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in a tweet that the incident was “wholly unjustified and utterly disgraceful,” and he had spoken with Brown about suspending the officers.

The protest in Buffalo was part of the swarm of demonstrations across the country. The demonstrations were sparked by the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis last month and the outrage over the racism and violence in law enforcement that disproportionately affects Black people. Police have used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse crowds, before and after curfews went into effect.

This is the second time this week Buffalo police have come under fire for aggressively responding to peaceful protesters. On Monday, video captured cops approaching a Black protester giving a TV interview with his hands up and tackled him to the ground.

471,Paul,Rand,news,"WASHINGTON – An anti-lynching bill that Sen. Rand Paul has held up in the Senate for several months led to a heated and passionate battle on the Senate floor Thursday, pitting the Kentucky Republican at odds with two of the Senate's three black members over changes to the bipartisan legislation.

The emotional debate centered on the Emmett Till Anti-lynching Act, which passed the House in a bipartisan 410-4 vote in February and would make lynching a federal crime. Paul has put forth changes to bill he argues would prevent those involved in minor altercations from being charged with lynching and receiving a 10-year sentence. The bill is named in memory of Emmett Till, a 14-year-old black teenager who was murdered in Mississippi in 1955 and whose death was a catalyst for the civil rights movement.

Paul offered changes to the measure Thursday afternoon, which was met with blunt and emotional opposition from Sens. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Kamala Harris, D-Calif., two of the chamber's three black members, leaving the measure's future unclear.

""I seek to amend this legislation, not because I take it or lynching lightly, but because I take it seriously and this legislation does not,"" Paul said on the Senate floor, adding that the bill ""would cheapen the meaning of lynching"" by defining it so broadly that it would include bruises and cuts. He chronicled the history of lynchings in the USA and his issues with the bill.

Paul's proposed changes were blocked by Harris and Booker who offered a stern and emotional objection, launching a debate that coincided with the memorial services for George Floyd, an unarmed black man who died after a Minneapolis police officer held his knee on the 46-year-old's neck for several minutes. The footage of his death spurred worldwide protests, riots in several cities and renewed calls to stop racial injustice and police brutality.

""That we would not be taking the issue of lynching seriously is an insult, an insult to Sen. Booker, an insult to Sen. (Tim) Scott and myself,"" Harris said, listing the only three black senators that serve in the chamber, each of whom have been leaders on this issue. She called Paul's amendment and his comments ""ridiculous"" and said the changes he is pushing for are things that ""would weaken"" the bill and put a ""greater burden on victims of lynching than is currently required under federal hate crime laws.""

""There is no reason for this,"" Harris said. ""There is no reason other than cruel and deliberate obstruction on a day of mourning.""

Booker joined Harris in objecting, offering an emotional speech that nearly brought him to tears several times. He pleaded for Paul to allow this bill to pass as is, arguing that it will not only help embolden federal laws but it would also send a message and ""give hope to this country.""

""I do not question the sincerity of his convictions. I have had too many conversations with him to question his heart. But I am so raw today,"" Booker said, his voice cracking as he looked over at Paul. ""Of all days that we're doing this right now, having this discussion, when God, if this bill passed today, what that would mean for America.""

Booker chronicled going to the Legacy Museum in Montgomery, Alabama, and watching black families cry as they saw stories about pregnant black women lynched and their babies ripped out of them. He added ""I do not need my colleague, the senator from Kentucky, to tell me about one lynching in this country.""

""I don't mean to be emotional,"" Booker said. ""I'm raw this week.""

He noted that he's been trying to come to a solution on his issues with the bill and is working with Booker's office.

""You think I'm getting any good publicity out of this? No,"" Paul said bluntly. ""I will be excoriated by simple-minded people on the internet who think somehow I don't like Emmett Till or appreciate the history and the memory of Emmett Till. I'll be lectured to by everybody that I've got no right to have an opinion on any of these things. I should be quiet. But we can't just not read our bills.""

Paul's amendment failing on Thursday and his continued opposition means the bill will continue to sit in the Senate until Paul either concedes or changes are made to the legislation. A vote on the legislation has not been scheduled.

The Senate unanimously passed a bill that would accomplish the same goal, Justice for Victims of Lynching Act, by a voice vote last year.

One of the authors of that legislation, Sen. Tim Scott, R-South Carolina, told Politico that the quickest way to make lynching a federal hate crime is for the House to take up the Senate's bill, pass it and send it to President Donald Trump for his signature.

Huawei Technologies executive Meng Wanzhou’s marathon extradition case may be about to get even longer, after her lawyers asked to adjourn the final phase of the hearing for more than three months, saying they expect new evidence about her alleged bank fraud case from HSBC. They applied to the Supreme Court of British Columbia in Vancouver on Monday to delay the last three weeks of the case until August 3, in light of a Hong Kong court settlement in which the bank agreed to provide more material supposedly relevant to the case. The hearings had been slated to start on April 26. Meng’s lawyer Richard Peck told Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes that the “modest” adjournment was necessary as a matter of “fundamental fairness”, and he denied “just trying to string this out”.Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. Canadian government lawyers, representing US interests in the case, cried foul. “Two and a half years from the start of these proceedings, countless hours spent fashioning a schedule agreed by both sides, and mere days from reaching the finishing line, the applicant asks this court to take a several month pause,” they said in a written response. “Her request should be denied.” In court, the Canadian Department of Justice’s top lawyer, Robert Frater, said: “There is literally no basis for this request … they are asking once again to have this court turn itself into a trial court.” It was only Meng’s “unlimited resources” that allowed her to file the application, he said. More than 500 Hongkongers apply for special Canada visa in first three weeks Meng’s lawyers claim the material from HSBC may boost their case that US authorities have deceived the Canadian court and Meng’s extradition should therefore be thrown out. The delay was needed “to obtain, review, assess, and, if justified, seek to introduce relevant evidence that is reasonably believed may assist in demonstrating that the requesting state has mislead this court and Canadian authorities”, they wrote in their adjournment application. HSBC has agreed to provide material to Meng as a result of a consent order granted by the High Court of Hong Kong on April 12. “[There] is a reasonable inference that the Hong Kong HSBC disclosure that the applicant will receive may include evidence … establishing that the ROCs [records of the case] are misleading,” the BC court application said. My lady, this process must come to a conclusion. Extradition hearings are supposed to be expeditious. Canadian government lawyer Robert Frater Meng, who is Huawei’s chief financial officer and the daughter of company founder Ren Zhengfei, is accused by US authorities of defrauding HSBC by lying to the bank about Huawei’s business dealings in Iran, thus putting the bank at risk of breaching US sanctions on the Middle Eastern country. She was arrested at Vancouver’s airport on December 1, 2018 and has been fighting a US request to have her extradited to face trial in New York ever since. In their application, Meng’s lawyers separately argue that a delay is also needed in light of the Covid-19 pandemic, saying “rising and critical health concerns” about the virus in BC made a three week hearing starting next week “unadvisable and potentially dangerous”. BC has recently been averaging about 1,000 new Covid-19 cases per day. Canada had to arrest Meng Wanzhou and it was not arbitrary, but detention is now unlawful, her lawyer says The Canadian government lawyers’ response says there is no evidence that the new material would be either admissible or relevant. The request “is the latest in a series of attempts to turn these proceedings into a trial that should properly take place in the requesting state”, they wrote. Material related to the Hong Kong court’s consent order was provided to Holmes in a sealed envelope. But some terms of the order seemed to prevent it being seen by anyone except the Hong Kong court, Meng and HSBC, Holmes said. The sealed envelope “puts the [BC] court in a very awkward position … one doesn’t go into a sealed envelope to find the authority to open it”, said Holmes. After receiving agreement from both sides, Holmes said the material – which has already been redacted – should be put on the record but subjected to a publication ban. The forthcoming material, which Peck called “likely highly relevant”, would relate to the relationship between Huawei and HSBC and two subsidiaries – Skycom, through which Huawei did business in Iran, and a shell company called Canicula – he said. Meng Wanzhou’s extradition judge should not decide on US jurisdiction, Canadian government lawyer says “This could be of great value to the final decision in this case,” Peck added. The material would be “copious” but it would be reviewed by his team in a “focused and expeditious manner”, Peck promised. “No one here desires to adjourn this case for an adjournment’s sake,” said Peck, calling the requested three-month delay “short in the context of this case” and noting that Meng’s behaviour forming the basis of the charges had occurred in 2013. That was a reference to a meeting between Meng and a HSBC banker in a Hong Kong teahouse, at which she delivered a PowerPoint presentation about Huawei’s Iran business. Peck said his team had already received a first batch of the HSBC documents, with another batch due on Tuesday and more within six weeks. Holmes asked if Peck had considered proceeding with the existing April 26-May 14 court dates, then asking to reopen the hearings if demanded by the new documents. The judge said she had not planned to issue any decisions immediately upon the conclusion of the three weeks in question. But Peck said there was a risk of “throwing away time” on arguments that would need significant amendment later. Government lawyer Frater told Holmes the eleventh-hour delay request was unacceptable. “My lady, this process must come to a conclusion. Extradition hearings are supposed to be expeditious,” he said. He told Holmes that she had no way of knowing what was in the HSBC material, and only the word of Meng’s and Huawei’s lawyers that it would be relevant and delivered soon. Xinjiang: will the West’s sanctions on China force the issue or unravel? “They do not know what is in these documents and they do not know when they are going to get them,” Frater said. As for the Hong Kong settlement, Frater said it was “inexplicable” that HSBC had agreed to provide the material, considering that the bank had “won on every point” in a prior attempt to secure the material through the British courts. But in Hong Kong, HSBC had acquiesced to Huawei “for reasons known only to themselves”. Regarding the risk posed by Covid-19, Frater said his team was willing to take whatever steps the court deemed necessary, such as by conducting them entirely remotely. In reply, Peck denied seeking to protract the case unreasonably. “It’s not a runaway train by any stretch of the imagination,” he said. Holmes adjourned the hearing until Wednesday afternoon, when she will deliver her decision on the application.More from South China Morning Post:HSBC suffered no risk from Meng Wanzhou’s alleged deceptions, court hears, as extradition fight enters crucial stage‘US laws do not apply in China,’ court is told, as new front opens in Meng Wanzhou extradition fightMeng Wanzhou’s lawyers say HSBC ‘fully knew’ that Huawei controlled affiliates that did business in IranExtradition judge is told she, not minister, must decide if US has jurisdiction over Meng Wanzhou’s actions in Hong KongHuawei’s Meng Wanzhou accuses US of giving Canadian court ‘grossly misleading’ evidence summary in extradition caseThis article Meng Wanzhou seeks three-month delay to marathon extradition case, citing new evidence from HSBC first appeared on South China Morning PostFor the latest news from the South China Morning Post download our mobile app. Copyright 2021.",1,https://sg.news.yahoo.com/justin-walker-mitch-mcconnell-court-seat-affordable-care-act-224552352.html

474,Paul,Rand,huffpost,"On the day of George Floyd’s funeral, as American cities continued to fill with protesters demonstrating for Black lives, Congress sought to pass a bill that would make lynching a federal crime. But one man, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul (R), stood in the way.

In an emotional exchange on the Senate floor Thursday, Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) pleaded with Paul to stand down and allow their legislation to pass. The bill, the Emmett Till Anti-Lynching Act, named after the 14-year-old Black teenager who was brutally murdered in 1955, has broad bipartisan support.

“I have had children break down with me this week wondering if this is a country that values their lives as much as white people’s lives,” Booker said, choking up on the Senate floor. “I have had to explain to grown men this week that there is still hope in America ... For one member to yield ... for one day and give America this win. Let us pass this legislation today of all days, let us give a headline tomorrow that will give hope to this country that we can get it right. It may not cure the ills that so many are protesting about but it could be a sign of hope.”

Congress has failed to pass similar anti-lynching legislation repeatedly over the last century. In a separate session last year, the Senate passed this bill unanimously, in a voice vote. The House passed an identical bill this February, and it has sat in the Senate until now.

But on Thursday, Paul objected to the bill, which would make lynching a federal hate crime with an heightened sentencing penalty, because he said it was too broad. It could implicate people who got into a bar fight, or had an altercation that led to “minor bruising,” Paul said, citing an incident in which a Black woman slapped three Jewish woman that the senator said could be wrongly over-sentenced under the bill.

“You think I’m taking great joy in being here? No,” Paul said on the floor. “You think I’m getting any good publicity out of this? No. I will be excoriated by simple-minded people on the internet who think I somehow don’t like Emmett Till or appreciate the history and memory of Emmett Till. I’ll be lectured to by everybody that I have no right to have an opinion on any of these things.”

Paul said he’s been working with Booker’s office for three months to tighten the language in the bill, noting that his objections are closely tied to the debate around mandatory minimums.

Paul offered an amendment to address his concerns, which Harris and Booker called unnecessary. If the Senate were to take up Paul’s amendment, it would further delay passage of the bill by requiring the legislation to go back to the House for yet another vote.

Anti-lynching legislation has volleyed between the House and Senate for decades, making its passage a symbolic gesture in the face of continued racial injustice. Harris called Ahmaud Arbery, the Black man who was shot to death by white neighbors while on a run in Georgia, “a victim of a modern day lynching.”

“There’s no reason for this,” Harris said of Paul’s objection, saying the amendment would put “a greater burden on victims of lynching than is currently required by federal hate crimes law.”

“There is no reason other than cruel and deliberate obstruction on a day of mourning,” she said.

Booker, who has worked with Paul on criminal justice issues in the past, made a heartfelt plea to Paul saying he did not question the senator’s convictions. But still his frustration with the Kentucky Republican was explicit.

“I’m so raw today,” Booker said. “Of all days we are doing this. Of all days we are doing this right now — God, if this bill passed today, what that would mean for America that this body and that body have now finally agreed.”

“I do not need my colleague, the senator from Kentucky, to tell me about one more lynching in this country. I have stood in the museum in Montgomery, Alabama, and watched African American families weeping at the stories of pregnant women lynched in this country and their babies ripped out of them while this body did nothing.”

475,Paul,Rand,news,"Former Colorado governor and current Democratic Senate candidate John Hickenlooper skipped a remote hearing and ignored a subpoena by the state’s Independent Ethics Commission over his alleged violations of Colorado’s gift ban.

When Hickenlooper did not appear at the virtual hearing — which suffered from technical difficulties — the commission voted unanimously to have the state attorney general’s office enforce the subpoena. After the vote, Ethics Commission chair Elizabeth Espinosa Krupa said that she found Hickenlooper’s actions “a little bit contemptible,” and the commission later voted 5-0 to hold him in contempt for failing to comply with the subpoena. The commission will meet tomorrow to determine further action.

The allegation, filed by the Staiert’s Public Trust Institute in 2018, alleges that Hickenlooper accepted private jet flights and paid travel expenses from wealthy friends and corporations while serving as governor. Federal Election Commission records show that Hickenlooper’s current campaign has taken over $1 million in corporate donations, despite claiming to fight “to get big money out of politics.”

Hickenlooper has denied the allegations and has repeatedly said he will not testify virtually, prompting the Ethics Commission to subpoena him. Despite Hickenlooper’s attempt to block the subpoena by arguing his due-process rights were being violated, a judge ruled against him Wednesday night and ordered him to testify.

“John Hickenlooper has made clear he will testify in person. Today’s debacle of a hearing has made clear that WebEx doesn’t work for a legal proceeding like this,” Melissa Miller, a spokeswoman for Hickenlooper, said in a statement.

Reporters later went to Hickenlooper’s home, only for his wife to say he was not home.

Around one million women have had their smear tests cancelled or postponed during lockdown, charities estimate, with some warning that the longterm impact could mean an increase in cervical cancer cases.

Going for a smear test – a process officially called cervical screening – allows a clinician to check for the HPV virus or cell changes in your cervix. Some cases of HPV and cell changes go back to normal by themselves, but in other cases, treatment is needed to prevent abnormalities developing into cancer.

Screening has been paused almost completely in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, where only “a handful of appointments” have been carried out during lockdown, according to Kate Sanger, a spokesperson from Jo’s Cervical Cancer Trust. Meanwhile, screening services in England have become a postcode lottery, with decisions about whether or not to run services decided at a local level

Pausing screening “is far from ideal”, but necessary to protect women and NHS staff from the immediate threat of coronavirus, says Sanger.

“That’s not to downplay the anxiety or frustration that will be felt by some women who are having tests delayed, especially if they have experienced abnormal cells in past tests, which will mean anxieties will be even higher,” she tells HuffPost UK.

Around five million people are invited for screening every year in the UK, Sanger says. Due to the disjointed approach across England during lockdown, we do not know exactly how many appointments have been missed in the past few months, but the charity estimates at least a million women have been affected.

“We are anticipating there to be an increase in people with cell changes and potentially some additional cancers as a result of the pausing,” Sanger says.

Women are sharing details about their cancelled appointments on social media, with many expressing concerns about when services will resume.

Smear test cancelled twice now. All that campaigning in 2019 to get women to attend them. Just to tell them they are now insignificant. What the hell are we doing? — HarrietLucy (@MissHarrietLucy) May 16, 2020

Four years ago today my friend, Claire, lost her battle to cervical cancer. I had my smear test cancelled in March as it was a non emergency appointment. Let’s get these services back online as soon as it’s safe to do so, so that people can get tested and the treatment they need. pic.twitter.com/53WwAfBmUq — Trish Roberts (@TrishAtAspire) May 14, 2020

Rang my doctor today about smear test and she said it’s closed for now. I need a yearly test due to previous serious issues and it’s overdue now. Will try to get it done privately instead. — Máire (@busymammy26) May 16, 2020

My surgery have cancelled all smear tests. Due early March. I was too late just before they shut the doors. Now just been told to wait. Worrying really. — A girl (@Losing_Nemo) April 28, 2020

At the end of March I had an NHS letter reminding me to attend my smear test. It’s drummed into us that we mustn’t leave it. Catch cervical cancer early they say. I rang my GP and all smear testing is cancelled at the moment. Worrying! — Clare (@cosyhomeceramic) April 26, 2020

Hearing about the delays can be particularly troubling for women like Penny Simmons – a cervical cancer survivor who now campaigns to raise awareness of the importance of cervical screening.

“If I hadn’t gone for screening, I’d have never found out I had cancer, or if I had found out, it would have been much, much further down the line,” Simmons tells HuffPost UK. “At the time of my screening I had no symptoms at all and there was nothing to indicate that there was anything wrong with me.”

Penny Simmons Penny Simmons and her three children.

The mum-of-three was 37 when she was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2018. She’d had a smear test one year previously that had detected “borderline abnormalities” so was invited for another smear 12 months later, instead of the usual three-year gap.

“I went from borderline to cancer in a year. I’ve been thinking about this a lot during lockdown,” she says. “We don’t know when the screening will resume. All these months are passing and for someone like me, those months were really quite crucial.”

Simmons had a hysterectomy to remove her cancer and didn’t require chemotherapy or radiotherapy, but she’s worried women impacted by lockdown will not have the same treatment options available to them.

“I don’t know how fast growing my cancer could have been in that time if I’d had a delay – and thank God I’ll never know,” she says.

“I went from borderline to cancer in a year. I’ve been thinking about this a lot during lockdown.” - Penny, cervical cancer survior

Even after it’s declared safe for smear tests to resume, the system “won’t be up and running quickly”, says Sanger.

GP surgeries – where the majority of women go to have their smear tests – will be dealing with a backlog of “all manner of health conditions” post-lockdown, on top of a long waiting list of women due their smears. They’ll also need to implement social distancing, which may reduce the number of patients they can see in a day.

Sanger is also concerned that fewer women will choose to attend their appointments, because some women will be concerned about undergoing “a very intimate test after so long social distancing”.

Gemma Jackson, 38, from Derbyshire, admits she’s cancelled her smear test for this reason, despite the fact they’re still going ahead in her area. “I don’t know if that’s wise, I’ve had pre-cancerous cells before,” she says. “I’m just scared to go to the doctors.”

Jackson has two children and her husband is a key worker, so when her April smear test date approached, she decided it “just wasn’t worth the risk of catching coronavirus”.

“I appreciate that the chances of us getting seriously ill are slim even if we do get it, but I’m just wanting to stay home now,” she says. “The thought of going to the doctors just feels surreal and risky. I just need to pluck up the courage to go I think. I understand potentially getting cancer could be much worse.”

Other women share Jackson’s concerns. The Eve Appeal’s nurse-led information service, Ask Eve, saw a 22% increase in calls in March compared to February 2020 with people worried about the impact of the pandemic on gynaecological cancers.

Karen Hobbs, who runs the service, tells HuffPost cervical screening is by far the most common topic women have been calling to discuss.

Some women have increased anxieties about screening, or are confused about whether or not they can book a smear test in their area, she says. Others calling the helpline have had appointments cancelled and are now worried about the implications for their health.

Hobbs tries to reassure women that HPV – the virus that causes abnormal cells in the majority of cases – is usually slow-growing.

“For the most part, it’s medically safe to postpone an appointment a little bit. Routine screening is usually a check of a healthy cervix,” she says.

However, she says the risk of lockdown delays will be higher for women who are already overdue having a smear test. Women delay smears for a multitude of reasons, from difficulty getting an appointment around childcare to past trauma that makes the procedure itself difficult.

“It would be very rare and unlikely [to develop cancer during lockdown], but of course it’s a risk and I would be lying if I said it wasn’t a risk,” she says.

So what can women do while services remain paused? Hobbs recommends refreshing yourself on the symptoms of cervical cancer that can be detected without a smear test.

These include unusual bleeding – such as bleeding while not on your period, particularly after sex – unexplained pelvic pain, pain and discomfort during sex, and an unpleasant smelling vaginal discharge. If you recognise any of these symptoms, you should contact your GP surgery to arrange a virtual appointment.

“I was diagnosed with cervical cancer a few years ago. I had bleeding after sex and was diagnosed very quickly and treated very early,” Hobbs says. “So I’m very passionate about people knowing that these things can be sorted out. Cancer doesn’t need to mean what it used to mean.”",1,https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/one-million-women-have-missed-smear-tests-during-lockdown-what-will-the-longterm-impact-be_uk_5ec5259dc5b61e26b0d9fb98

As much as we respect Dr. Anthony Fauci’s service to our country and medical opinion, we disagree that his current positions on the virus outbreak provide the best path forward. Instead, discouraging states from reopening will only prolong a long-term public health and economic crisis.

Fauci and company have relied on models that were later found to be deficient. He even has suggested that he can’t rely on any of the models, especially if the underlying assumptions are wrong. Yet, Fauci persists in advocating policies that have emasculated the medical care system and ruined the economy.

Fauci claims his message has been consistent, but it is contrary to that of the administration he works for.

Economic, societal impacts matter

While President Donald Trump urged governors to safely open our country, Fauci testified to a Senate committee last week that opening too soon would “result in needless suffering and death.” What about the countless stories of needless suffering and death produced by Fauci’s one-size-fits-all approach to public health?

Health leaders:We stuck together to #StayHome, now we can start together to #OpenSafely

“It’s inconvenient from a societal standpoint, from an economic standpoint to go through this,” Fauci stated at the end of March. How come he is so understated when it comes to compassion for the people whose lives have been wrecked by his policies but so demonstrative when trying to scare the American people?

Unbelievably, Fauci has suggested that the economic and societal impacts of policies for which he has advocated were not considered when he offered his advice.

It seems to us that he has not fully considered the public health risks, either. We are seeing hospitals and medical groups having to close because they couldn’t treat patients. The very foundation of our medical care system has been rocked — not solely because of the virus, but also because of the response to the virus.

Out-of-touch advice

As a medical bureaucrat in far-away Washington, perhaps he cannot empathize with the millions of Americans who have already closed down their businesses or are poised to lose them and their life savings, and who have seen their retirement funds depleted as the economy soured. Maybe he is simply oblivious to the health problems that inure when a person is one of more than 33 million Americans who have lost their job.

Is it possible that he has not been keeping up with the stories of people who have experienced significant health problems due to the economic and emotional stress resulting from his insistence on closing what was once the most robust economy in the world?

It isn’t just the economy that has been enervated. The foundation of the health care system has also been ruptured.

The president has never mandated implementation of Fauci’s dogma, but Fauci has had an incredibly powerful influence on what many states have done.

And now that governors are trying to open up their communities, allow hospitals to determine whether they can provide elective surgeries, and trust the American people to exercise their freedom responsibly, Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx have attempted to scuttle the opening.

Trust Americans to do what's right

We should acknowledge that certain populations are more vulnerable, and we should advise governors and state legislatures to take precautions for those populations and their caregivers.

Freedom allows us to judge the risk and reward and determine a course we think best.

If we feel going to a certain retailer, barber shop, restaurant, or some other business is risky, we have the judgment to decide to not go there. If we want to stay home, we can.

President Trump has expressed a desire to restore our economic greatness and the positives that come with it — including better public health — by opening up our communities. We must forge ahead even as Fauci tries to brush away the optimism of the president and the American people.

483,Paul,Rand,foxnews,"We now know that Vice President Joe Biden and dozens of other Obama administration officials requested the unmasking of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn’s private phone conversation without a constitutional warrant. Biden’s abuse of government power to go after a political rival is more than a little disturbing.

This scandal reaching, perhaps, all the way to President Obama himself, is why innocent Americans wonder just how much their own government has been spying on them and vacuuming up their most sensitive information.

Despite Edward Snowden’s devastating revelations, Congress has largely abdicated its responsibility to protect the Bill of Rights, and small tweaks to the system have not stopped abuse or waste of vital resources that could have been spent actually protecting our country. Yet Congress has patted itself on the back even as it steamrolled meaningful debate on one of the biggest issues of our time.

RAND PAUL: FLYNN UNMASKING WAS 'DEVASTATING ABUSE OF POWER' BY BIDEN, OBAMA OFFICIALS

This week, the U.S. Senate will take up the U.S. House-passed government surveillance bill extending certain expired Patriot Act powers. Once again, the bill plays with reform but falls far short of bringing real change to a system that currently relies on secret courts and the hope that the government will police itself.

So I will offer an amendment to protect all Americans and help rebuild the trust our institutions have shattered over the years.

My amendment would empower the government to conduct necessary surveillance on non-Americans and our enemies, but it would force federal officials who want to surveil an American to get a warrant from a regular court as established by our Constitution instead of the secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC).

It would also protect Americans’ privacy and restore due process by preventing the government from introducing into evidence any information it gathered from surveilling an American without a warrant. Americans would, however, be allowed to use evidence collected this way to defend themselves.

My amendment would also make it illegal to use this secret, foreign court to investigate any political speech or campaign.

The alarm about abuses of our system has only grown as we have learned about the Obama administration’s spying on Donald Trump as he ran for office and then transitioned into the presidency. They used the FISA court, which meets in secret and was intended for use against foreigners.

Late last year, Department of Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz made headlines when his office released a report that, among other findings, “identified at least 17 significant errors or omissions” in four applications the FBI made to the FISC to spy on former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

The system as constructed lends itself too easily to mistakes and abuse that we discover far too late, and this is too important an issue for only cosmetic changes.

Not long after, we learned the Department of Justice stated that in two of the applications, “‘if not earlier, there was insufficient predication to establish probable cause to believe that Page was acting as an agent of a foreign power.’”

And, for some reason, the fact that a sitting president spied on an incoming national security adviser’s conversation continues to be regarded as just a footnote in the controversy over the FBI’s egregious treatment of Lt. Gen. Flynn.

As set up right now, and as would still be the case under the House bill, our secretive system leaves the door wide open for abuses that are only revealed long after the damage is done.

The Carter Page story led DOJ IG Horowitz to dig further, and he uncovered more shocking information concerning 29 other applications “relating to U.S. persons,” with the IG finding “apparent errors or inadequately supported facts in all of the 25 applications we reviewed.”

The FBI couldn’t find what is supposed to be required documents for the other four applications that back up the claims made, with it not even sure those documents “ever existed” for three of those four, according to the IG.

Do not misunderstand me here. Our government is filled with lots of good, hardworking men and women, and the FBI is making efforts to help prevent future problems. But the system as constructed lends itself too easily to mistakes and abuse that we discover far too late, and this is too important an issue for only cosmetic changes.

We need substantive reform and not window dressing.

I don’t believe tinkering around the edges with process reforms can make FISA constitutional. FISA employs a less-than-constitutional standard. Instead of the Fourth Amendment’s requirement of probable cause that a crime was committed or being committed, the FISA standard allows for investigations if there is probable cause that an individual is working for a foreign government.

I believe the only way to fix FISA is to exempt Americans from this court that was intended to investigate foreigners.

I, for one, am tired of hearing after-the-fact outrage, only to see it vanish when it comes time to vote.

Let’s take an important second to get something straight: I actually support the concept of states taking the lead in responding to the pandemic, and I applaud President Donald Trump for following this approach as he focuses on broader federal efforts that no state could do on its own.

Is it any wonder, when tensions are already ratcheted up due to the virus itself, that we are seeing false accusations and outright violence and threats?

But it does not excuse abuse of authority. It does not require executives to ignore their legislatures or place unreasonable or unconstitutional burdens on Americans, and we should call those overreaches out when we see them.

In fact, I have said time and again that reopening our nation will require an even more tailored local response, right down to the city level. Bowling Green is not New York City or even Louisville, for example, and should be free to take different steps to get its local economy going again.

This means state and local leaders working with each other instead of acting unilaterally.

In some cases, authority figures are turning Americans against each other, echoing stories we once thought we would only hear coming out of the Soviet Union or Communist China as neighbors are encouraged to turn one another in to the authorities if they see or even suspect anything less than perfect compliance with often arbitrary guidelines.

Mayor Bill de Blasio, saying, “[W]e still know there’s some people who need to get the [social distancing] message,” has encouraged New Yorkers to take a picture when they think social distancing guidelines aren’t being followed and text it to the city. “[A]ction will ensue,” promises the mayor.

Is it any wonder, when tensions are already ratcheted up due to the virus itself, that we are seeing false accusations and outright violence and threats?

A dad and mom taking their young kids into a bank to try to open a joint account are criticized for supposedly not socially distancing enough and are – anonymously – turned in to Child Protective Services on false accusations.

A woman identified as a teacher in New Jersey wishes “a long, painful death” from coronavirus on students playing football. We read stories of alleged choking over social distancing, and the antagonism plays out in attacks online.

C.S. Lewis also warned us that “[t]he robber baron's cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience.”

There is little government cannot – and has not tried – to justify with the words “for our own good” or “to keep us all safe.” And once that justification – even if genuinely offered – is allowed to automatically stifle debate, actions build “without end.”

You don’t have to look far back into our own history to see where such roads can lead, as the federal government’s response to 9/11 morphed into surveilling innocent Americans. Yet I and others cannot even bring the issue up in Congress without being accused of not taking our national security and safety seriously.

Already, we hear talk of how much additional surveillance we will be expected to tolerate due to the pandemic – for our own good, of course.

As concerning as these issues are, I remain encouraged by the many positive stories that exist of Americans coming together to face this challenge, and I am confident we will beat it as we have so many others.

But it’s imperative we do so while protecting both life and our unique way of life – defined as one that gives the benefit of the doubt to freedom and responds from that philosophical grounding.

485,Paul,Rand,thehill,"The coronavirus pandemic is testing the American workforce in ways no one has ever seen. According to some estimates, the heavy-handed stay-at-home orders imposed in many states could lead to unemployment rates on par with the Great Depression before the end of summer. But a crisis like this doesn’t just create hardship; it also gives us reason to innovate and meet the needs of today.

Two generations ago, only the milkman would make deliveries to your door. Now, with a few taps of a smartphone, you can order a gallon of milk and all your other weekly groceries, complete with GPS tracking and an up-to-the-minute report of when your order will arrive. In these times of bare supermarket shelves, UberEats, Instacart, and DoorDash drivers have helped feed our neighbors and kept a small part of our economy on its feet. They’ve even been deemed “essential” workers in some places. But they aren’t immune to the virus, and many of them struggle with underlying health conditions. These hardworking couriers face danger on every delivery run, yet they lack good health insurance because they have no employer to get it from.

We need a better way to deliver health coverage to these folks and to all the other self-employed workers across our country. A bill I recently introduced in the Senate, the American Healthshare Plans Act of 2020, offers exactly that. This legislation would adapt the law to how we work in today’s economy, allowing all kinds of groups to offer health insurance to their members, whether that membership is based on employment or not.

Employer-based health insurance came about nearly 80 years ago, when people didn’t move around as much, and workers often stayed with one company from the time they graduated high school until the day they retired. These days, the average American works a dozen jobs in a lifetime, so his health benefits have to change a dozen times, too. What’s more, the self-employed sector now makes up almost a third of our labor market, and one out of every four self-employed workers has no insurance at all.

But employer-sponsored insurance still works well for those who can get it. Big corporations like GM and Toyota can leverage large numbers of employees to negotiate good rates from insurance companies, who want the business. That’s how large corporations can afford to offer generous benefit packages.

But why should anyone have to pay higher premiums just because they don’t work for a giant corporation? Current law arbitrarily locks people out of the large group market (and its more affordable rates) if they work for a company with fewer than 51 employees. The American Healthshare Plans Act would open the gates to that market to folks who work for small businesses or for themselves, so they can leverage strength in numbers, too.

The local business with one small storefront and three employees could join a healthshare through an auction site like eBay or Etsy, where it operates an online shop. Not only would the employees and their families then have access to quality coverage, but the storekeeper could use the savings to hire more workers and re-invest in the community.

Healthshares would also be fully portable, so people could carry them from job to job, and even in between jobs. The seasonal worker with a Costco or Sam’s Club membership could purchase a healthshare plan off the shelf, the same way he buys food and vitamins, and cough medicine for the kids. As long as he keeps that warehouse club membership, he won’t have to worry about losing coverage.

Without a bold new approach like this, this year’s spike in unemployment could strip health insurance from more than 7 million Americans — and millions more of their family members. On top of that, millions of the self-employed who are lucky enough to keep earning a living will remain uninsured or underinsured because they can’t afford premiums on the individual market.

By passing the American Healthshare Plans Act, Congress could retool our employer-based system for the way we live and work today. Doing so would open up new delivery routes to coverage, without blocking off the tried-and-true ones. Every day, our economy is innovating and adapting to meet the needs of modern life. Shouldn’t we have a health care system that can do that, too?",1,https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/politics/496271-reform-health-care-by-offering-more-choices

His team tested the breathability and droplet-blocking ability of 11 common household fabrics, using a medical mask as a benchmark. The fabrics selected ranged from new and used garments, quilted cloths, bedsheets and dishcloth material.

April 20, 2020

Contact: Press@paul.senate.gov, 202-224-4343





WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) joined several other senators in sending a letter urging Administrator Jovita Carranza to reopen the U.S. Small Business Administration’s (SBA) online portal and accept Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan applications that were completed as of April 16, when the program ran out of funding.



This is just the latest in Dr. Paul’s efforts to ensure a fast-moving and effective response to the novel coronavirus pandemic. Reopening the online portal would allow small businesses to more quickly receive the assistance they’re seeking after Congress authorizes additional funding and would help the program run as smoothly as possible.



“Thus far, lenders have made impressive progress, sifting through scores of applications and fighting paramount pressures. By providing access to the E-Tran system, lenders will be allowed to submit the backlog of applications they have already received. It will also protect businesses that previously applied from being leap-frogged by new applicants should the program reopen. Regardless, businesses and lenders will need to understand that these submissions will not be funded without additional appropriations from Congress,” the senators stated.



The senators also noted that they “are concerned that the E-Tran system will be overwhelmed, if the SBA does not allow submissions before the program reopens. Keeping the system operational will mitigate the influx once the program receives more funding, and will have the added benefit of being able to more accurately gauge demand in the current backlog.”

I did not quarantine while awaiting a coronavirus test because I did not meet the criteria for quarantine. In fact, I did not meet the current criteria for even being tested, much less quarantined.

I have not had an encounter with anyone that health officials recommended quarantining or testing.

I took the test because my wife and I had traveled extensively during the weeks prior to COVID-19 social distancing practices, and I am at a higher risk for serious complications from the virus due to having part of my lung removed seven months ago.

I did attend Louisville’s Speed Art Museum charity ball on March 7. Unlike the other Kentucky government officials there, I had zero contact or proximity with either of the two individuals who later announced they were positive for COVID-19. The event was a large affair of hundreds of people spread throughout the museum.

The Metro Louisville Communicable Disease department announced that “those who public health officials consider at higher risk from possible exposure are being notified,” according to the museum’s director, Stephen Reily.

Background:Rand Paul the first known U.S. senator to test positive for coronavirus

I was not considered to be at risk since I never interacted with the two individuals even from a distance and was not recommended for testing by health officials.

For those who want to criticize me for lack of quarantine, realize that if the rules on testing had been followed to a T, I would never have been tested and would still be walking around the halls of the Capitol.

The current guidelines would not have called for me to get tested nor quarantined. It was my extra precaution, out of concern for my damaged lung, that led me to get tested.

Instead of hounding people who got tested and then quarantined themselves, perhaps we need to broaden the testing and quit the finger-wagging.

It is important to approach the current coronavirus pandemic with equal measures of prudence and hope. Practical solutions to stop the spread of a novel disease are not new. They have worked in the past, and they do not need to lead to fear or panic. In fact, looking at our history of fighting and winning against so many diseases, it should give us optimism.

My life has been spent mostly as a physician and scientist. My current life is that of a member if the Senate, including on the committee dealing with Health Care. I’ve spoke to many in and out of government in the past week, and these are my conclusions.

Let’s start with prudence. This virus seems to spread very easily — think of the way the common cold spreads like wildfire every year — but it is more serious and potentially lethal. That’s a bad combination, and we should take it seriously. We must calmly and clearly implement as much social distancing as we can in the coming weeks. The six foot rule is a good one.

Stay home when possible, call your doctor or hospital before you go if you are symptomatic, so that they can advise you of best practices. Avoid as many group gatherings as possible.

The CDC has advised that at-risk groups remain entirely at home if they can. These include older Americans and anyone with co-morbidities that put that more at risk, especially chronic respiratory conditions.

But even young people should be paying attention to this. You might think you’re safe, and you probably are. But your parents, grandparents, and others may not be. The virus is spreading from asymptomatic people, and you could not even know you are doing it.

The Governor of Kentucky has joined many other states in closing down public schools for a few weeks. I think that’s a good decision and one we will not regret later, which cannot be said of staying open. The Governor will likely be required to take additional actions as the situation develops, which is why I have personally sent a letter to President Trump urging his prompt consideration of any future possible requests from the Governor asking for federal assistance for the Commonwealth’s COVID-19 response efforts.

I personally have instructed my staff to work from home. I want to set the right example for those who can follow suit. I realize that’s not everyone, but every bit helps. During this period, however, we are still available to handle the needs of the Commonwealth and of government. Anyone with a federal issue can still contact our office as before and we will be happy to provide assistance.

If you’re a member of a church, community group, HOA, Rotary, service organization or similar, I encourage you to both practice what I’ve said here, but also reach out to the most vulnerable in your community to make sure they’re ok and if you can help keep them that way, perhaps by running errands for them or bringing them food and supplies if they choose to isolate more completely.

If you are sick – no matter what you think you have – I urge you to stay at home for the duration of your illness, especially with a fever above 100.5.

Obviously, the more prevalent this is in your own community, the stricter you will need to be.

As this public health crisis unfolds, there will surely be some hardships for people. Some will fall ill. Unfortunately, some already have and more will succumb to this disease. But while we are implementing these steps to mitigate the spread, I want to also take a moment to remind everyone of the triumph of modern medicine over all sorts of diseases.

One hundred years ago, one in five children didn’t even survive childhood due to viruses and bacteria. Our life span was shorter. The list of viruses and bacteria that could kill you was long and dangerous. The world was a much more dangerous place than it is right now.

From cholera to polio, from small pox to measles, we beat them, with antibiotics, antivirals and vaccines. History tells us we can do it again. It tells us not to let our fear get the best of us, not to think the end is near, and to approach this pandemic without unnecessary levels of alarm.

Be safe, be prudent. Be respectful of those who might need greater protection in an outbreak like this by being disciplined in the coming weeks. There are resources available with information, including Kentucky’s own website: kycovid19.ky.gov

But remain hopeful that our modern medical system, if given the time, can treat and beat this. This is a time for us to come together as people. To show the world what Americans can do. Together we will weather this crisis.

Upon a request received from a state’s or territory’s Governor, SBA will issue under its own authority, as provided by the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act that was recently signed by the President, an Economic Injury Disaster Loan declaration.

Any such Economic Injury Disaster Loan assistance declaration issued by the SBA makes loans available to small businesses and private, non-profit organizations in designated areas of a state or territory to help alleviate economic injury caused by the Coronavirus (COVID-19).

SBA’s Office of Disaster Assistance will coordinate with the state’s or territory’s Governor to submit the request for Economic Injury Disaster Loan assistance.

Once a declaration is made for designated areas within a state, the information on the application process for Economic Injury Disaster Loan assistance will be made available to all affected communities as well as updated on our website: SBA.gov/disaster

SBA’s Economic Injury Disaster Loans offer up to $2 million in assistance per small business and can provide vital economic support to small businesses to help overcome the temporary loss of revenue they are experiencing.

These loans may be used to pay fixed debts, payroll, accounts payable and other bills that can’t be paid because of the disaster’s impact. The interest rate is 3.75% for small businesses without credit available elsewhere; businesses with credit available elsewhere are not eligible. The interest rate for non-profits is 2.75%.

SBA offers loans with long-term repayments in order to keep payments affordable, up to a maximum of 30 years. Terms are determined on a case-by-case basis, based upon each borrower’s ability to repay.

SBA’s Economic Injury Disaster Loans are just one piece of the expanded focus of the federal government’s coordinated response, and the SBA is strongly committed to providing the most effective and customer-focused response possible.

498,Paul,Rand,foxnews,"In 1964, Ronald Reagan famously observed that “[n]o government ever voluntarily reduces itself in size. So governments' programs, once launched, never disappear. Actually, a government bureau is the nearest thing to eternal life we'll ever see on this earth.”

Each year since has only proven that view more correct.

Consider, for example, how tenaciously government clings to being able to spy on American citizens.

DR. QANTA AHMED: BORDERS MATTER IN CORONAVIRUS FIGHT – TRAVEL BANS BOUGHT US PRECIOUS TIME

Once again, Congress is debating certain Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) powers passed as part of the PATRIOT Act (which are expired at the moment), and, once again, the only idea of “debate” Congress will tolerate is one where you are supposed to automatically vote “yes” at the end of the day to whatever leadership proposes (always in favor of as much power as possible) unless you want to be smeared as being “unpatriotic.”

Same script. Every time. Under both parties.

So far.

Recently, in keeping with his long-held stance on “draining the Swamp,” President Trump made it clear he wants to reform FISA.

And for good reason. The president has been the victim of the same abuse that many of us have warned about for years.

In December 2019, Department of Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz released a report revealing “that FBI personnel fell far short of the requirement in FBI policy that they ensure that all factual statements in a FISA application are ‘scrupulously accurate’” in their first application to the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) to spy on Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

The report went on to say that the IG’s office “identified multiple instances in which factual assertions relied upon in the first FISA application were inaccurate, incomplete or unsupported by appropriate documentation, based upon information the FBI had in its possession at the time the application was filed.”

Ultimately, the IG’s office “identified at least 17 significant errors or omissions” in the initial application and the following three renewal applications to spy on Page.

We do not protect our way of life when we treat the Fourth Amendment as optional. Instead, we erode trust in our institutions and undermine the very values we claim to defend.

No secret, unaccountable court should be allowed to authorize spying on an American citizen again, and my amendment to the House-passed FISA bill will help guarantee it doesn’t happen.

My amendment stops government from surveilling an American citizen unless it gets a warrant from a normal court established under Article III of the Constitution.

It would also force government to abide by the Fourth Amendment and respect due process by preventing it from using information collected under FISA against an American citizen. Government can follow other laws to obtain the necessary information to charge a citizen, including Title III of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, which lays out how law enforcement can surveil suspects consistent with the Fourth Amendment.

Following that same script Congress often uses to ram through whatever leadership wants, the House waited until nearly the last minute to pass its FISA bill and then left town.

Making matters worse, the House bill simply poses as “reform” while leaving the door wide open for future abuses. The Horowitz report destroys the House’s narrative that government will police itself.

The House bill is so weak that the provisions purportedly designed as a response to the Carter Page fiasco would not have protected Carter Page. Yet the Carter Page story is only one example of a secretive system abusing its authority to spy on the American people.

We know government used Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act to hoard details on innocent Americans’ phone use. Even after Congress reformed that particular program to narrow the focus, the National Security Agency (NSA) still ended up with information it was not allowed to have.

Proving Reagan right yet again, even after the NSA ended the revised program, we’re supposed to believe the power must be extended basically just in case it’s needed. This comes despite government spending over $100 million on the program over a four-year period with next-to-zero results.

The broader Section 215, among those provisions up for renewal, relies on claimed “relevance” to an investigation to grab the records of your life. Such a standard falls far short of our Constitution, which demands due process and makes unreasonable searches illegal.

Here’s the thing.

We should want our counter-intelligence efforts, which I believe fight terrorism much more effectively than endless nation-building, to be as strong as possible, but we do not bolster those programs when we allow for the possibility of sweeping up innocent Americans’ records. Instead, we leave room for once again wasting vital resources that should be focused on actual threats overseas. My amendment ensures government properly directs its FISA powers.

We do not protect our way of life when we treat the Fourth Amendment as optional. Instead, we erode trust in our institutions and undermine the very values we claim to defend.

Yes, in America, we are supposed to do things differently. We were founded on the principle of “innocent until proven guilty,” which is in an entirely different universe than “If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear.” Due process for our citizens is foundational to that system, and I firmly believe the Founders would as adamantly defend your right to be secure in your phone, text and email conversations under the Fourth Amendment as they would your right to use those same tools under the First.

The Founders knew times and technology change. Their ranks included inventors on the cutting edge of such progress. So they crafted a system built on timeless principles.

This is why I urge President Trump to veto the House bill if my amendment is not included. If my amendment is rejected, American citizens are far safer if the expired provisions remain just that way.

We cannot be confident government will not again abuse its surveillance powers against American citizens unless we remove the possibility.

This week, the Senate will have that chance.

Contact: Press@paul.senate.gov, 202-224-4343







WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, the U.S. Senate will vote on an amendment offered by U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) to the nearly $8 billion coronavirus supplemental that would pay for the legislation. The Senate is expected to vote on Dr. Paul’s amendment around noon eastern today.



“I support our government’s efforts to fight the coronavirus. We also owe it to the American people to do it in a way that avoids piling billions more in debt on their backs. My amendment responsibly uses taxpayer resources by reducing waste to pay for this new spending,” said Dr. Paul.



Dr. Paul’s amendment would rescind unobligated FY 2020 balances for the East-West Center, which was highlighted in the Citizens Against Government Waste’s 2019 Congressional Pig Book on wasteful spending. Previously, even the Obama administration proposed significantly reducing the Center’s funding.



It would also rescind unobligated FY 2020 balances for the Inter-American Foundation (IAF), a past topic of Dr. Paul’s Waste Reports. The IAF is largely duplicative of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and has used American taxpayer dollars on projects such as teaching circus arts in Argentina, helping deported illegal immigrants start a business (and without being able to rule out that the money would not go to criminal deportees), jumpstarting the Haitian film industry, and promoting a Haitian dance troupe. In addition, the IAF has not been reauthorized since 1984.



Dr. Paul’s amendment would also proportionately rescind funding for the State Department’s Cultural Exchange programs and USAID’s non-health activities. Both agencies have been frequently cited by Dr. Paul for massive waste of taxpayer dollars.

500,Paul,Rand,newsweek,"On a rainy Monday night at Dover Air Force Base last week, I joined President Trump for the final homecoming of Sgt. First Class Javier J. Gutierrez and Sgt. First Class Antonio R. Rodriguez, who gave their lives the prior weekend in Afghanistan.

I will never forget the soldiers saluting their fallen brothers, the weight of the silence in the air as they carried the flag-draped transfer cases off a military transport plane, or the grief of the families shattered by loss.

Two more of America's young heroes gone in an instant in our longest war.

Last year marked the 18th since we invaded Afghanistan after the horrific 9/11 attacks. I supported our initial response, and I would have voted to authorize force had I been in Congress at the time.

Our soldiers once again made our country proud and quickly achieved a decisive victory.

But what I cannot support is politicians' nation-building effort following that victory that continues nearly two decades later and leaves our troops embedded in a quagmire.

In December 2019, The Washington Post published ""The Afghanistan Papers,"" a series of investigative reports drawn from once-classified memos from former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and some 400 interviews conducted by the Office of the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) with those with firsthand knowledge of the war effort.

The Post's report confirms my worst suspicions about the problems inherent with nation-building.

The Afghanistan Papers tell of a directionless war, lacking clear or even achievable objectives. They reveal government spinning statistics to the American people to present a different picture than what was happening on the ground. They show a massive waste of taxpayer resources and widespread corruption in Afghanistan.

In 2015, now-former Ambassador and retired U.S. Army Lieutenant General Douglas Lute, whom the Post noted ""served as the White House's Afghan war czar during the Bush and Obama administrations,"" told SIGAR, ""[W]e were devoid of a fundamental understanding of Afghanistan — we didn't know what we were doing.""

""We were burning $400 million per month at one point,"" the Papers quote an official at the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) as saying. That official added, ""We lost objectivity. We were given money, told to spend it and we did, without reason"" and noted that ""10% of what we spent would have been appropriate.""

Our servicemen and women go above and beyond their assignments, and they and their families risk everything for our country. They deserve Congress' very best. That means sending them to war only in accordance with our Constitution— giving them a clear, consistent mission with an endgame, and ensuring maximum oversight and accountability.

The day after returning from Dover Air Force Base, I continued my efforts to provide such support by holding a hearing on the Afghanistan Papers, featuring testimony from Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction John Sopko, Lieutenant General Lute, former Ambassador Richard A. Boucher, and retired U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Daniel L. Davis.

In his written testimony, Lt. Col. Davis stated: ""Countering terrorist threats in Afghanistan does not require permanent U.S. ground forces. America's global intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance and strike (ISR-Strike) capabilities are more sophisticated today than ever before; terrorist communications and training facilities are more easily detected and monitored. The U.S. military can identify, target, and eliminate direct threats anywhere around the globe, even in Afghanistan.""

Yet, there is no greater bipartisanship on Capitol Hill than when it comes to sending more troops to more places forever.

That's one reason I cheered President Trump's statement that ""great nations do not fight endless wars."" I support him in seeking to reduce troop levels in Afghanistan, and I will continue to urge him to push further. In March 2019, in a bipartisan move that goes against the congressional norm, I introduced a bill with Senator Tom Udall that would end the war while setting a framework for peace, providing bonuses to those who have served, and redirecting the savings to our pressing domestic needs.

Just as government cannot provide absolute safety at home, it cannot guarantee perpetual stability abroad. Nation-building only endangers our troops.

We have already lost thousands in Afghanistan, with tens of thousands more wounded.

Last year — that 18th anniversary year — saw the highest number of U.S. combat casualties there since 2014.

As I said during my hearing last week, the Afghanistan Papers make it ""crystal clear"" that ""doing nothing is no longer an option for any senator or member of Congress with a conscience.""

501,Paul,Rand,abovethelaw,"During yesterday’s impeachment trial, Rand Paul tried to pull a fast one.

The senator from Kentucky has a hard-on to unmask the whistleblower who first sent a complaint to Senator Richard Burr and Congressman Adam Schiff over Donald Trump’s behavior vis-à-vis Ukraine foreign aid. Yes, of course there is a compelling public interest in keeping the identity of whistleblowers confidential. And yes, there’s a whole network of federal legislation build around the premise that confidentiality is essential to stem corruption. But all that just goes out the window when there’s a chance to own the libs.

So yeah, Rand submitted a question during the impeachment trial to the presiding officer, Chief Justice Roberts, naming the whistleblower. But Justice Roberts was having none of that ish, saying, “The presiding officer declines to read the question as submitted.” Rand reportedly stormed out of the chamber.

But unfortunately we live in the worst timeline, and Rand was not content to merely accept the rebuke. No, of course not. As HuffPost reports, he held a press conference throwing out names like it’s of no consequence:

Paul then stormed out of the chamber and held a press conference where he twice said the name of the alleged whistleblower ― whose identity has not been confirmed ― as well as another individual but insisted he was not outing anyone. “I think this is an important question, one that deserves to be asked, and makes no reference to anybody who may or may not be a whistleblower,” Paul told reporters.

This farce of a trial is expected to reach its conclusion today, without calling any witnesses.

502,Paul,Rand,foxnews,"The American people have seen a grand charade on display in Washington.

First, the circus toured the U.S. House for weeks, and now the sideshow has stopped over in the U.S. Senate. Democrats have accused President Donald Trump of using the government to go after his political opponents, yet they are doing the very same thing right now on the floor of the U.S. Senate.

They have wrongly weaponized the U.S. Constitution in order to go after their political opponent, President Trump. Does their hypocrisy have no shame? They have been bitter and disgruntled about the outcome of the 2016 election since day one, and this is the latest chapter in trying to undermine the will of the people and declare the last election illegitimate.

JUSTICE ROBERTS BLOCKS SEN. PAUL FROM NAMING WHISTLEBLOWER, SOURCE SAYS – AND PAUL MAY FORCE THE ISSUE

This partisan exercise is wrong, divides our nation, and wastes not only time but millions of taxpayer dollars on a doomed theatrical production.

House impeachment managers have railed against the president with marathon speechifying, hoping if they repeat untruths often enough, they will somehow become true. President Trump’s legal team has chosen a different approach: a succinct case, and one relying on facts, rather than hearsay. Their avoidance of gossip, speculation, rumor, half-truths, and outright lies has been warmly received in the greatest deliberative body on Earth.

But what was the delay in bringing the articles to the Senate? Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi sat on the articles of impeachment for a month after the House voted for them, trying to leverage the Senate into adopting rules that would benefit House Democrats, at the expense of the president, the Senate, and any notion of fairness.

Her weeks-long delay fundamentally undercuts the “urgency” of impeachment. Either the impeachment needed to take place as soon as possible because President Trump was a threat to democracy — as Democrats claimed — or the impeachment could gather dust as long as the Speaker wanted. It can’t be both.

But political gamesmanship notwithstanding, consider the articles of impeachment themselves. The first article accuses the president of ‘abuse of power,’ for the ostensible “crime” of suggesting in a phone call that foreign aid to Ukraine would be conditioned on investigations of corruption — including corruption on the part of the Bidens and their associates.

Not only have previous presidents withheld foreign aid, including President Obama, but the United States has regularly conditioned aid on compliance with certain goals, principles, and policies. And plenty of people on both sides of the aisle have raised questions regarding the Bidens and Ukraine. However, President Trump is right when he says people need to read the transcript of the call that started all this. You won’t find conditionality in there.

The second article, which accuses the president of “obstructing Congress,” is even more ridiculous and baseless than the first. Having the courts determine what conversations of the president and his advisors are privileged is not “obstruction” — it is correct, constitutional, and appropriate. Under House Democrats’ bizarrely stretched interpretation of “obstruction,” every single American president in history would have warranted impeachment.

Implementing their new “standard” would not only ignore that history, but it would have a chilling effect on the freedom of interaction between presidents and advisors moving forward. It would also distort the idea of separation of powers to one where a president is expected to instantly bow every time to whatever demands partisans in Congress make — or face impeachment.

The Democrats are not preserving justice with their end-run around our legal system. If anything, it is they who are abusing their power of impeachment simply because of their impatience.

If we truly want to talk about obstruction, however, there is no more conspicuous case than the obstruction and deception perpetrated by Rep Adam Schiff, D-Calif. — the head chef of this toxic impeachment stew.

Mr. Schiff told us there was no FISA abuse on the part of partisan senior members of the FBI and DOJ — a claim the Obama-appointed Inspector General of the Department of Justice proved to be wholly false.

Mr. Schiff told us that President Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia — a claim the endless and baseless Mueller investigation found to be false.

Mr. Schiff claimed he had no contact with the so-called whistleblower, whose discredited allegations became the basis of this impeachment scam — this too has been proven false.

Though witnesses are not necessary for this trial, should they be called, Adam Schiff must be among them. He is a fact witness to the matter at hand.

The American people know this impeachment isn’t really about secondhand gossip about a phone call with Ukraine. The whole saga is nothing more than the sloppy sequel to Robert Mueller’s failed Russia Hoax — and the ‘Russia Hoax’ itself was never anything more than a transparent attempt to nullify the 2016 election and override the will of the American people.

It seems Democrats will do anything to avoid having to persuade the American voter to embrace their increasingly radical and unpopular political platform.

As we move toward the end of the impeachment trial, it is imperative the American people remember that the president’s only true “impeachable” offense was winning the 2016 election — against all odds, and against the coordinated opposition of the establishments of both parties, the Bush and Clinton dynasties, the mainstream media, Wall Street, and the Deep State.

I ran for office because I was tired of being misled by Republicans who promised conservative government and gave us bank bailouts and more debt. The Wall Street bankers got richer and the American taxpayer got poorer.

The Tea Party erupted over dissatisfaction with false conservatives. It amazes me that anyone in the Tea Party movement could possibly consider Clinton/Reid/Pelosi supporter Donald Trump for President.

I honestly have no idea what Mr. Trump’s real philosophy is. He was liberal before he was conservative, and has openly professed for decades that his views are those of a Democrat.

In 1990, he said if he ever ran for office, he’d do better as a Democrat. He became an independent briefly in 1999 before he switched back to registering as a Democrat. In 2004, he identified more of his beliefs as those of a Democrat, especially on economic policy, stating on CNN that“it just seems that the economy does better under the Democrats than the Republicans.” He only registered as a Republican in 2009 before dropping the party again in 2011, only to re-register in 2012.

This is a guy who said in 1999 that he was a strong supporter of the United Nations. He was for partial birth abortion before he was against it. He lavished praise on the bank bailouts. He was for Obamacare before he was against it and has said he’s “liberal on health care.”

In the debate, I reminded Trump that conservatives in the GOP have spent decades opposing a single-payer system like the socialized medicine of Canada and England. He responded that I hadn’t heard his answer. The problem is, I had heard his answer and, like many of his answers, it made absolutely no sense. What I heard was that he was once for a single-payer system—today, he’s against Obamacare but still kind of likes the concept of single-payer and isn’t sure it works.

No conservative in America supports a single-payer government-run healthcare system, and yet around 25 percent of Republicans seem to favor Trump. How can this be possible? How can a quarter of the GOP support a guy who was a Republican, then an Independent, then a Democrat, and then a Republican again?

Are conservatives really willing to gamble about what Donald Trump really believes in?

It is refreshing to hear someone speak truth to power, to transcend Washington-speak, and cut through the staidness of our politically correct world but not when it is all blather, non-sequitur, and self-aggrandizing bombast.

Donald Trump is showing he isn’t suited to lead the country, and I think we all need to discuss why.

Frankly, it sounds too much like he is someone used to bullying to get his way. What do you do to a bully? You stand up to him. That’s what I did on the debate stage, and I was the only one.

The only one to tell Donald Trump that if he is willing to possibly give the election to Hillary, he shouldn’t be on the stage. That should be our first and uniting principle.

We don’t need a bully, and we don’t need another President who thinks he is King. We certainly don’t need someone who has driven his companies into bankruptcy four times yet smugly tells us he uses our nation’s Chapter 11 laws to his own personal advantage. All well and good for him – but what of the creditors and vendors he defaulted on?

Voters are hungry for a plain-spoken critique of Washington. But I’m unsure how credible that voice is when it comes from the consummate insider, a man who buys and sells politicians like he does Lamborghinis.

Trump has paid over 1.5 million dollars to politicians from both sides of the aisle, from Harry Reid to Rahm Emanuel to Jeb Bush. The majority of his donations were to Democrats until a few years ago when he began thinking more seriously of making a play for the Republican nomination.

(For the record, Donald Trump has NEVER donated to any of my political campaigns, perhaps because he knows I can’t be bought. He has donated to an eye institute that sponsored the medical mission I took to Guatemala where the funding was directly spent on our surgical work restoring sight to over 200 men and women.)

He has, however, put a significant down payment on Hillary Clinton—at least a $100,000 investment in the Clinton “Foundation” in addition to repeated donations to her campaigns—and acknowledges he spoke to Bill Clinton before he decided to pursue the Republican nomination. What kind of access was he purchasing?

I asked him in the debate why he’s hedging his bets. If he doesn’t win the GOP nomination will he support Clinton? Will he run as a third party candidate? Ross Perot gave us Bill Clinton. Will Trump give us Hillary Clinton?

Why give so much money to both sides?

That’s the problem with the system. Big Government and Big Business get in bed together, and the ordinary taxpayer ends up with the short end of the stick while our country is driven deeper into debt.

I for one don’t think you should run for President if you believe what Trump says about money in politics: “When you give, they do whatever the hell you want them to do.”

Isn’t this buying and selling what’s wrong with Washington?

Bill Clinton is under fire for accepting donations and high speaking fees from foreign governments while Hillary served as Secretary of State. I think it’s despicable that politicians like Hillary sell access. But isn’t it equally despicable for people like Trump to buy access?

It makes me sad to think that Tea Party awakening could be hijacked or hoodwinked by a guy who supported the bank bailouts, supported Obamacare, and continues to support the Clintons.

I was there at the first Tea Party in 2007 and I’ll be damned if I’m going to stand passively by and watch the movement destroyed by a fake conservative.

I will stand up to anyone, Republican or Democrat, who tries to use government as their own personal piggy bank and I won’t be bought or sold.

I will run this race on issues important to the American people. Unlike Trump, I have serious, specific proposals for the largest tax cut in American history and a five-year balanced budget. I offer real solutions to defeat the Washington Machine like ending corporate welfare, term limits and forcing Congress to read the bills.

We owe the American people substantive answers like that, not bluster and bombast. I plan to stand up to anyone who doesn’t have the temperament or ideas to be President. Maybe it’s time for the GOP voters to tell Mr. Trump he’s fired so we can find a serious candidate who will bring real change.",1,https://web.archive.org/web/20150810174326/http://journal.ijreview.com/2015/08/246266-dont-fall-for-a-fake-conservative/

In case you missed it, last month I introduced my bold, innovative plan to help make higher education more affordable by revolutionizing how students and their families pay for college and immediately reducing tuition by 20 to 30%.

Currently, everyone has to pay student loans and tuition with money out of their pockets that has already been taxed. My Higher Education Loan Payment and Enhanced Retirement (HELPER) Act changes that by essentially making college tax deductible.

Over the past several weeks I’ve been pleased to receive so much positive feedback from Kentuckians all across the Commonwealth, including students, parents planning to save for college, university and administrative officials, financial planners and more.

Shortly after introducing the HELPER Act, I held a forum on student loan debt at Northern Kentucky University so I could hear firsthand from those who would benefit from this legislation, and along with the feedback came some great suggestions to make my plan even better. After listening to those in attendance and to the thousands of Kentuckians who have reached out with comments, I’m proud to announce an exciting change to the bill.

Instead of only allowing parents to give tax-free contributions, we have changed the bill to allow grandparents, aunts, uncles, or just about anyone to pay for a student’s tuition tax-free.

At the end of the day, you have to pay your loans or tuition regardless, so the HELPER Act gives you the beneficial option of using money that hasn’t been taxed to do so.

This is a huge improvement to the legislation and capitalizes on the fact that each successive generation has more wealth. Those in their 60s have nearly $200,000 saved on average in their 401(k)s. At that amount, 2.6% annual growth would fund the maximum tuition or loan contribution without depleting an account’s principle balance.

Not only would this legislation help make college significantly more affordable, but working college students could also reap the benefit of employer contributions. Most of the top 25 largest companies in America, such as Walmart and Target, offer 401(k)s with matching. That would increase the amount of funds available to pay for college and lead to graduating with less outstanding loan debt.

Furthermore, paying off student loans and tuition under the HELPER Act actually saves money and provides for a more secure retirement. It is true that saving early takes advantage of compounding returns, which is great if you can pay your loans AND have extra money to invest. The problem is that for far too many new graduates, paying those loans means not contributing anything to a 401(k). If you cannot contribute anything to a 401(k) because you are paying your student loans, then it does not matter if the rate of return is 8% or 80%, over 2 years or 20 years – the end balance is still zero.

Throughout my time in the Senate, I’ve been proud to propose bold, innovative solutions to solve the most critical problems facing Kentucky and the nation. My HELPER Act would make great strides in alleviating the student loan debt crisis, allowing individuals to pay off loans faster and focus on retirement savings sooner in their careers. I welcome your feedback, ideas, and concerns, and look forward to continuing our work together to improve and expand this legislation.

505,Paul,Rand,kentucky,"When I ran for the Senate, I promised Kentuckians I would fight against endless spending and endless wars.

Since my first day in office, under presidents of both parties, I have worked hard to honor that promise in a Congress where principle is unwelcome, and “compromise” is defined as, “You spend some more money, and I’ll spend some more money, and we’ll call it a bipartisan breakthrough.”

So I appreciate the Herald-Leader’s recent backing for my position that war must be declared by Congress. It’s unfortunate, however, that it comes sandwiched between playground name-calling and distorting my record.

For instance, I’m not quite sure how one can have a “welcome return” to a position they never left.

Under President Obama, I condemned actions that turned Libya into a breeding ground for terrorists, pushed to end nation-building, and opposed selling over $1 billion of military support to the brutal Saudi Arabia regime. I filibustered, speaking continuously for 13 hours to protest President Obama’s extensive drone killings, until I obtained what should have been a simple answer from the administration: a president cannot use a drone to kill an American on American soil without that person being found guilty or even charged with a crime.

As I promised, I have stood with President Trump in rolling back the War on Coal, cutting taxes, appointing constitutionalist judges, reforming our criminal justice system, expanding health care choice, creating jobs, and growing our economy.

In speaking to President Trump privately and listening to him publicly, I also remain impressed by what I see as his sincere desire to end forever wars.

However, I have spoken out when policies have departed from that shared goal. I have continued to force votes to stop the U.S. from perpetuating the Yemeni humanitarian crisis and propping up the Saudis and their allies (and I called for holding the Saudis accountable for the dissident Khashoggi’s death). I pushed for de-escalating tensions with Iran and for getting our troops out of Syria.

In addition, I voted to protect the constitutional right of Congress to control the power of the purse.

I have also maintained, despite the op-ed’s claims, my fight against debt.

When Congress cut taxes in 2017, I demanded a vote to keep corresponding spending cuts intact, asking on the Senate floor, “Who’s willing to say, ‘You know what, I’m for tax cuts, but I’m also for saying, across the board, we need to have spending restraint’?” For all their talk since, every single Democrat voted against me and for ignoring spending limits. When big spending bills come to the floor, I force votes on finding matching cuts, and I have repeatedly introduced balanced budgets, including a plan requiring only a two-percent cut to balance in five years. I regularly issue reports to alert Americans to how government uses their money and have held multiple hearings on waste.

I stand accused of shifting on whistleblowers, but just last year, consistent with my position, I offered legislation to extend whistleblower protections - including retroactively - to all federal contractors, which would cover perhaps the greatest whistleblower of all time, Edward Snowden. While I believe whistleblowers should not be fired, I also believe the accused has a right to face his accuser. Is that really too much to ask in our system of “innocent until proven guilty”?

Here’s the bottom line: I support President Trump but have also disagreed with him, consistent with principles I have held since long before I took office and acted on under both parties.

It is those principles and my promise to Kentuckians that will continue to guide me.

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY), chairman of the Federal Spending Oversight and Emergency Management (FSO) Subcommittee for the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC), released his 2019 Festivus edition of The Waste Report.



Dr. Paul’s fifth edition of the Festivus Waste Report collects his 2019 Spring, Summer, and Fall Waste Reports as he continues working to alert the American people to how the government uses their hard-earned money.



Highlights include: building up Tunisia’s political system and the Pakistani film industry; funding research that involves hooking Zebrafish on nicotine; continuing to turn over so many taxpayer dollars to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority; sending low-quality textbooks to Afghan students, with many of the textbooks sitting in warehouses; supporting “green growth” in Peru; making improper payments; and studying frog mating calls.

The more things changed in 2019, the more they stayed the same. Hollywood continued going back to tried and true classics, releasing hits like

The Lion King

and

Aladdin

. And the federal government clung to old ideas such as failing to fund the government on time and spendi ng even more taxpayer dollars. Americans rang in 2019 with a government shutdown. Democrats, perhaps bolstered by a new House majority, instantly blocked funding to stop Republican action on the border. Worse than that, in August, Congress undermined the Budget Control Act of 2011, throwing out the budget caps and suspending the debt ceiling for two whole years

—

setting the stage for even more reckless spending! Meanwhile, the Congressional Budget Office projects more than $1 trillion annual deficits as far as the eye can see. Needless to say, it

’s been a bad

year for federal spending. In fact, a November review of Fiscal Year 2019 from the CBO states Congress spent $4.4 trillion in FY2019, 8 percent more than 2018. Net interest payments on the debt also skyrocketed to $423 billion, $52 billion more than FY2018.

It’s easy if you’re a conservative to get depressed. But don’t give up. I will continue to fight the

wasteful spending. In the future, I will rate each waste of taxpayer dollars I cover on a sca le of 1 to 5 pigs as I hand out

the “Platinum Pig Awards

Stay tuned for more about that. Meanwhile, this year, I am highlighting a whopping $50,463,462,292.35 of waste, including a study of Panamanian frog mating calls, sending low-quality textbooks to Afghan students, and a grant to fund a Peruvian Green New Deal.

508,Paul,Rand,theamericanconservative,"When our kids were little, we would make Santa’s magic boot prints from the front door to the Christmas tree by sprinkling baking soda around a crude cardboard cutout. This explained how the presents showed up on Christmas morning, since we didn’t have a fireplace. It was cute to watch our daughters react back when they believed it was all true. But as they got older, logic began to creep in—how did Santa get past the locked front door? And why didn’t the dog bark?

That’s how the real world works, sad as it can be to see them grow up. Logic overcomes belief. Otherwise you’d be 45 and still wondering why Santa didn’t eat the cookies you left out.

The bad news is that magic is back, at least in terms of politics. And it isn’t the good kind, the one that makes holiday marshmallow memories. It’s the bad kind, which turns rational people into blithering idiots ready to believe anything that supports their point of view. Accusations become evidence, for impeachment or harassment or Islamophobia or a society gone white nationalist wild, and the more accusations, the stronger the evidence seems to be. Simply filling a bus with people claiming without evidence that someone did something should mean nothing, but it now means more than ever.

So even as the hive mind agrees that a flippant remark is “demanding foreign intervention” or “a national security threat,” or that an investigation is “interference in our democracy,” or with even less evidence that Trump is a Russian agent, Tulsi a Russian plant, Facebook a Russian tool, Jill Stein a Russian something or other, it does not make it true. Adding “-gate” to a noun does not create a crime. Believing a phone call is bribery, or a tweet is witness intimidation, does not negate the need for the law degree that allows you to use those words accurately. This is about the law, not about writing marketing copy. And kids, I’m sorry, I know how much you wanted to believe in the elves, but it really was Mom and me buying the presents all those years.

It is sadly no surprise that the one semi-favorable witness Democrats allowed to testify at the Impeachment Gladiatorial Thanksgiving Spectacle, Gordon Sondland, was soon accused of misconduct by not one but three women (so it has to be true). The alleged incidents took place years ago, there were no witnesses or physical evidence, and none of the women found reason to bring the accusations forward until Sondland emerged as a possible weak point in the Dems’ case against Trump. What they said is fully and forever unprovable, and can only be “believed” because anyone who supports Trump must be on the naughty list.

Watching those accusations front-paged by a believing media, and with memories of the ugly Kavanaugh confirmation still fresh, one can only view Ruth Bader Ginsberg’s deteriorating health with concern. We all know that whomever Trump nominates as the Ghost of Christmas Past’s replacement will be accused of terrible things. For a male nominee, it will be more sexual harassment incidents than Jack the Ripper. For a female, something “racist” she wrote in junior high. And that doesn’t even include the hidden horrors in their taxes, decisions from their days on the traffic court bench, and so on. It is as inevitable as Santa’s yearly visit.

Wanting to believe accounts for much of what we call fake news. That is, a lot of it is stuff based on anonymous sources who could not possibly know what the president was thinking, or what he said in a closed door meeting, but are quoted anyway because we already know that what we want to know is true.

Democratic parents, er, candidates, have felt the reason for the season, outdoing one another in hinting at what might be under the tree simply because we want it to be there, however impractical it might be. And yes, honey, I still remember the year you believed there’d be a real pony in the backyard and you cried. Elizabeth Sanders believes rich people will give us Amazon gift cards to pay off student loans and provide health care. Mayor Pete will fill our stockings with his Douglass Plan, offering $50 billion (Cory Booker proposes double, $100 billion) to black colleges as a Christmas Eve teaser. They believe they will find the money under the tree, or in the backyard with the pony. Yeah, we tried to buy our kids’ love with expensive presents, too, but at least we spent equally on each of them.

Belief works for the negative as well. There is a profound belief that things are much worse than they really are. Democracy has just one more chance, or perhaps the Republic is already done for and we’re just waiting on the funeral arrangements. First, maybe a military coup, or a civil war. Or Trump will simply refuse to leave office (the New York Times, CNN, MSNBC, Vox, Politico, Newsweek, The Atlantic, Slate, Salon, and MSN all believe so). Certainly women, POC, and LGBT are done for. When pressed for specifics, there are none, as who but a true believer could count as a “specific” something that starts with “Well, Trump tweeted…”?

Driving the sense that The End is near is a profound ability to not only know very little about history, but not even remember stuff from a few weeks ago. Those End of Days wars with China, Iran, Venezuela, and North Korea—what happened to them? Did the Kurds turn out okay with that genocide? “Trump will trigger nuclear Armageddon” is a go-to article when WaPo has op-ed space to fill. No one seems to know much about the rise of Hitler in any detail, but everyone believes we are seeing it again (except there’s no mass party, no Brownshirt vanguard, no overarching ideology, no annexation of neighboring territory, no Nuremberg laws, no Dachau, and no exercise of state power like in the 1930s). Scale doesn’t seem to matter; Trump cut back on immigration and so did Hitler, so boom, they are the same.

So a tiny group of Nazi cosplayers in Charlottesville three years ago is still held up as proof of sweeping white nationalism, along with Colin Kaepernick not being able to get a job. Alongside that you get the NYT saying “Trump is president only because a constitutional provision invalidated the choice of the American people,” referring to the Electoral College, which has been used to choose presidents for over 230 years. The same article goes on to say “Democrats and pundits have been bullied into accepting the fiction that he has democratic, and not just constitutional, legitimacy.” Even the outcome of an election under the same system in place for centuries is today subject to the belief test.

Adding to this damp blanket of nihilism is the endless failure of insta-folk heroes. The mood is so desperate for a savior that a new one is created regularly. The now-discredited antisemites who organized the Pink Pussy Hat march, the media-abused Parkland Kids, Greta the Amazing Climate Change Girl, it’s almost to the point where you can’t believe in anyone anymore. Remember Beto? He went from the cover of Vanity Fair to, well, we don’t know what he’s doing—working at Wendy’s with Kamala, Stacey Abrams, and the other unemployed elves, maybe.

None of it is real: that is the nature of belief. Getting your hashtag trending is only the illusion of action. Twitter doesn’t elect anyone, or stop anything, or do anything. Yet you believe it matters because it is disappointing when nothing changes in the real world after what seems like a lot of effort. You can make #SantaIsReal the most popular hashtag ever but it won’t make Santa real. The problem is that belief in politics today is not organic. It didn’t grow on its own. It is created and sold, much like each new generation of parents resells the Santa myth to its toddlers.

Bringing it all home, Salon declares that “whatever enthusiasm I once felt for Christmas has dissipated entirely in the age of Donald Trump. He ruins everything he touches, and Christmas, for me, is no exception. …Forget Tiny Tim declaring, ‘God bless us, every one!’ It’s clear that for that 40 percent of people in the Trump cult, it’s closer to ‘Damn anyone to hell who isn’t exactly like us!’ The point of Christmas is to declare white supremacist America as the only ‘real’ America.”

And kids, it wasn’t me who ate the cookies you left out for Santa. Putin came down the chimney and gave them to Trump. That’s where belief has brought us these past few weeks before the holidays: you can’t even believe in Christmas anymore. Ho ho ho!

Today, the Senate passed the latest National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to authorize the programs and policies of the Department of Defense.

Our national defense is incredibly important; it’s mandated in the Constitution. It is arguably Congress’s primary constitutional responsibility.

I have great respect and honor for those who serve in uniform. In fact, I recently introduced a bill to give each soldier who served in the war on terror a $2,500 bonus and at the same time officially end the war in Afghanistan. Ending the war in Afghanistan would save us about $50 billion a year.

Unfortunately, the bill that passed today does not end any of our multitude of wars. It continues the status quo and throws more money around the world at conflicts we can’t even begin to fathom.

Before the Senate rubber-stamped that money, I urged it to take a step back and consider two things.

First, we need to ask ourselves whether borrowing billions of dollars, year after year, to fuel our appetite for more military spending is a wise policy.

Second, we need to look at how this bill has been loaded up to carry things only somewhat related, or not related at all, to national defense.

As I’ve reminded my colleagues often, Admiral Mullen, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the national debt was our greatest national security threat. His exact wording was “[t]he most significant threat to our national security is our debt.”

This was in 2010. When he made that remark, our debt was about $13 trillion. It’s over $23 trillion now. We just keep borrowing, and there is no end in sight.

Under our new budget deal, we will be borrowing $2.75 billion every day next year, nearly $2 million every minute.

We spend more than the next seven largest militaries in the world combined.

Our Defense Department is so large that it took them a decade to even figure out how to audit themselves. Then they said that the audit itself would cost almost half a billion dollars. Last year, we arrived back at square one: after all that effort, we still couldn’t audit the Army, the Navy, the Marines, or the Air Force.

We spend so much money that the Department of Defense literally can’t keep track of it all. We don’t even have a great idea of how much, exactly, we’re wasting.

A few years ago, the Defense Business Board, which is a defense advisory panel of corporate executives that reports to the secretary of defense, suggested that the Defense Department could save $125 billion on administrative expenses.

According to news accounts, that report scared the Pentagon, so they buried it. Everyone tried to keep it away from Congress for fear that they might actually cut something—not that I would have been too worried about that.

We’re set to spend $738 billion on military spending this year, up $22 billion from last year. Our budget deal provides $740 billion for next year.

Over the past six years, military spending has risen over $120 billion.

We say we’re for accountability and efficiency and savings, yet we keep piling money on top. How can we demand better accounting and efficiency when budget increases are seemingly guaranteed every year?

And to be clear, I support national defense. Backing our service members is a worthy cause, and there are things in this bill I like.

I’m a cosponsor of a bill to eliminate the so-called “Widow’s Tax,” which I’ve argued is the right thing to do, and that we should find the money to pay for it. That’s in this bill.

I support returning the 101st Airborne at Fort Campbell to its full air assault capacity with the return of a Combat Aviation Brigade. That’s in this bill.

I support giving our service members a pay increase. That’s in this bill.

But I take issue when Congress adds other things that don’t have anything to do with our military.

This bill sanctions NATO allies and potentially American energy companies if they have any involvement with the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. That pipeline is basically done, yet we want to jeopardize our relationships with our allies over it anyway.

This bill drops more sanctions into the middle of the Syrian civil war, as well as funding for so-called “vetted” Syrian rebel groups. All this would do is prolong the Syrian conflict and with it the humanitarian suffering and displacement we’ve seen in the region. The Syrian civil war is largely over. I agree with President Trump that it’s time to come home.

Another problem with our insatiable appetite for more military spending is that it requires conservatives to make bad compromises. If you want $40 billion in new defense spending, then you have to give the other side $40 billion in new domestic spending. That’s the nature of today’s bipartisanship: you can have your money as long as we get our money.

The dirty little secret is that there is actually too much compromise in Washington. Republicans want more military money and Democrats want more welfare money. Every time they compromise, Congress chooses to spend and borrow more.

For example, this bill provides a new mandatory benefit program—paid parental leave for all federal employees starting next year. That will cost more than $3 billion over the next five years, and, of course, Congress failed to provide for any means to pay for it. In essence, Congress today is simply saying, “Add it to my tab! The deficit be damned.” Regardless of how you feel about the issue, this represents a better benefit than many working Americans enjoy, and it has nothing to do with national defense.

Conservatism is about more than supporting military spending at any cost. We have to do more to make the tough decisions that enable a strong national defense AND a balanced budget.

Many so-called “conservatives” will hail this bloated military spending, but in truth there is nothing fiscally conservative about borrowing money from China to pay for our armed forces.

In fact, I would argue that borrowing to buy more tanks or planes or to police the far corners of the earth actually damages our national security.

Some have charged that our military is hollowed out, exhausted from so many far-flung conflicts. They will argue that we must expand military spending to meet the mission.

Perhaps we should do the opposite. Perhaps it isn’t that our military budget is too small, but that our military mission is too large. I, for one, hope for a day when Congress rediscovers that our constitutional mandate is to defend America first and to only become involved in war as a last resort. And even then, America should only become involved in war when Congress has debated and done its constitutional duty to declare war.

Until that day, I will continue to argue that the only fiscally conservative, fiscally responsible course of action is to vote against expanding the military budget.

In case you missed it, last week I introduced my bold, innovative plan to help make college more affordable. My plan will revolutionize how students pay for college by immediately reducing college tuition by 20% to 30%.

Currently, everyone has to pay student loans and tuition with money out of their pockets that has already been taxed. My Higher Education Loan Payment and Enhanced Retirement (HELPER) Act changes that by essentially making college tax deductible.

Here’s how it works.

Everyone has the ability to create an IRA or 401(k)-style account, and most employers offer contribution matching, as well. Under current law individuals must pay a penalty for withdrawing funds from such accounts. For some situations people can take a “hardship” withdrawal, but that only waives the penalty, not the taxes. My bill would instead allow individuals to take out, tax and penalty free, up to $5,250 — every year — to pay for college or to pay back student loan debt, and those funds could be used to pay tuition and expenses for a spouse or dependent.

You have to pay your loans or tuition regardless, so the HELPER Act gives you the beneficial option of using money that hasn’t been taxed to do so. The 401(k) or IRA is simply the mechanism. You would not have to have a balance on day one; you could just start contributing and reaping the benefits.

Read this:Rand Paul wants to allow students to dip into retirement accounts to pay off loan debt

Not only would this help make college significantly more affordable, but college students could also reap the benefit of employer contributions. Most of the top 25 largest companies in America, such as Walmart and Target, offer 401(k)s with matching. That would increase the amount of funds available to pay for college and lead to graduating with less outstanding loan debt.

Furthermore, paying off student loans and tuition under the HELPER Act actually saves money and provides for a more secure retirement. It is true that saving early takes advantage of compounding returns, which is great if you can pay your loans AND have extra money to invest. The problem is that for far too many new graduates, paying those loans means not contributing anything to a 401(k). If you cannot contribute anything to a 401(k) because you are paying your student loans, then it does not matter if the rate of return is 8% or 80%, over two years or 20 years — the end balance is still zero.

Additionally, the HELPER Act will incentivize parents to create IRAs for their children, as they are far more flexible than a 529 account. If parents aren’t sure whether their child will go to college, they can still set money aside in the account, knowing the funds will at least go toward their kids’ retirements.

This plan will also combat rising tuition costs. Since withdrawals are limited to $5,250 annually, parents and students who save will be more judicious about where they spend their education dollars, and they will ask if one school is worth taking out loans for when they could pay out of pocket for a similar school. Colleges will have to respond by keeping down tuition, and that will benefit everyone.

These are just a few ways my bill will help reduce the cost of college. If you’re interested in learning more, I urge you to visit my website at www.paul.senate.gov to read about the entire plan. Additionally, I have posted examples on my social media demonstrating how much someone could save under the HELPER Act.

Throughout my time in the Senate, I’ve been proud to propose bold, innovative solutions to solve the most critical problems facing Kentucky and the nation. My HELPER Act would make great strides in alleviating the student loan debt crisis, allowing individuals to pay off loans faster and focus on retirement savings sooner in their careers.

511,Paul,Rand,theamericanconservative,"The Washington Post editorial board interviewed Pete Buttigieg recently, and his foreign policy answers left a lot to be desired. When he was asked about Iran and the JCPOA, he said this:

As for Iran, it’s unlikely that we could simply resurrect and rejoin the JCPOA in its prior form. But leaving it was a mistake, and agreements to contain Iranian nuclear ambitions remain a good idea. The picture is different. The economic pressures are different. The political scenario is different. And crucially, our relationship with some of the allies that account for — I believe the “J” stands for “Joint” — the allies that account for the coalition that was securing this has obviously changed. But I also think there remains an opportunity, especially given the economic, if not isolation, certainly vulnerability of the Iranian regime, to achieve something that would help us once again slow or stop the move toward nuclear weapons there.

Buttigieg’s answer is vague and his remarks at the end about “the move toward nuclear weapons” suggest that he accepts a very hawkish framing of this issue without having given it much thought. He begins by saying that it is unlikely that the U.S. could “simply” rejoin the JCPOA as it was. Why is that unlikely? If the next administration is determined to reenter the agreement and lifts the sanctions imposed by Trump, it is not hard to imagine how the agreement might still be restored. Buttigieg doesn’t want to commit to doing this, and so he gestures in the direction of some future agreement that might be made. He is trying to pass off a very underdeveloped position as if it is clever and nuanced, which is par for the course for his presidential campaign.

When Buttigieg turns to talking about the “opportunity” to exploit Iranian economic vulnerability, that is where his answer goes from weak to awful. Trump’s economic war on Iran has strengthened hard-liners politically inside Iran, and it has undermined supporters of engagement with the U.S. so much that a future administration will be hard-pressed to find anyone willing to negotiate as long as the economic war continues. Golnar Motevalli and Arsalan Shahla report:

“By undermining Rouhani’s most important achievement, Trump gravely damaged his presidency and popularity,” said Ali Vaez, senior analyst at the International Crisis Group. “What has been fatally damaged in the process is not just pro-engagement Iranian politicians, but the whole concept of engagement with the West.”

If a future administration tries to use more economic coercion after years of Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign, they will find Iran to be just as intransigent as they are now. The damage to supporters of engagement inside Iran has been done and it won’t be easily repaired, but a surefire way to give hard-liners an additional boost is to continue coercive measures aimed at extracting more concessions.

Buttigieg’s line about “the move toward nuclear weapons” shows that he doesn’t understand that the Iranian government isn’t moving toward these weapons and hasn’t been doing that for the last 16 years. He talks about their “nuclear ambitions” without acknowledging that those ambitions don’t include developing and building nuclear weapons. In that respect, he comes off sounding more like a young John Bolton than a Democratic presidential candidate.

The candidate’s understanding of the U.S. role in the world and U.S. interests also warrants a few comments:

The fact that American prestige has been reduced to an SNL mockery of the guy in the lunchroom nobody wants to talk to shows you what’s at stake and something that goes beyond just what’s interesting to foreign policy buffs, but the more basic question of whether America can continue to be regarded as a credible, reliable force for good in the world, something on which our own security depends, because our advantage has always been that our interests have aligned with universal interests or I should say, universal values [bold mine-DL], as well as more specific concerns.

The claim that U.S. interests have always “aligned” with “universal values” is nonsense, and the worrisome part here is that Buttigieg may actually believe it. It is an assumption that has warped the conduct of our foreign policy for a very long time, and it is usually invoked as a pretext to interfere in other countries’ internal affairs and to trample on international law. Buttigieg’s statement suggests that he has a dangerously expansive definition of U.S. interests that is divorced from reality.

Buttigieg’s foreign policy speech earlier in the year was underwhelming, and in the last six months he has become a much more conventional and hawkish candidate. That will undoubtedly satisfy “centrist” hawks and members of the “Blob,” but it doesn’t offer Democratic voters much of an alternative.",1,https://www.theamericanconservative.com/larison/buttigiegs-increasingly-hawkish-foreign-policy/
512,Paul,Rand,foxnews,"Sometimes the hypocrisy in Washington is so bad it is almost laughable. The House impeachment witch hunt reached that level this week with the revelations that Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., had acquired and published personal phone records of Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., (the ranking member on the Intelligence Committee), two of President Trump’s personal attorneys, and an investigative journalist Schiff doesn’t like.

This act was brazen and shameful. While it may not have been illegal (because Congress writes its own rules on investigations) it certainly was wrong. It certainly tramples on rights normally held dear by the left.

But most of all what it did was expose that Schiff, for all of his pompous bluster, is doing exactly what he has accused President Trump of doing: using his power to investigate his political opponents.

NUNES RIPS SCHIFF OVER SUBPOENA OF PHONE RECORDS: 'I ACTUALLY HAVE SOME CIVIL RIGHTS HERE, TOO'

Instead of another panel of witnesses, we should get Schiff a mirror.

I shouldn’t be shocked by this. This has been a partisan exercise from Day 1. Want proof? There were articles of impeachment filed against President Trump in January 2017, right after his inauguration.

Want more proof? The votes in these impeachment “proceedings” have been completely partisan, every time.

It used to be that Democrats and their co-conspirators in the media didn’t believe in partisan impeachment.

Current House leaders have quotes from the 1990s saying as much – like current House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y. But apparently that was just their standard for Republicans, not for themselves.

Partisanship is bad enough. But trampling rights and norms of conduct in investigations is worse, and that’s why Schiff should be formally censured by the House for his actions.

Part of the problem lies with Congress writing its own rules for subpoenas and investigations, without any thought of due process.

For example, when someone attempts to get an attorney’s records in a judicial proceeding, he or she has to show why and must prove it to a court, and then a special judge is appointed to assist with the review. Care is taken. Attorney-client privilege is assumed unless there is evidence of a crime by the attorney. That didn’t happen here because Congress and Schiff don’t think they need to follow this standard.

Part of the problem also lies with our “third-party doctrine” in privacy law, something I’ve been fighting for years. It goes like this: your records are not necessarily your records if they are held by a third party – like a phone company, an Internet service provider, a credit card company, or a physician.

Ask yourself this: When you make a call, send an email, fill your prescriptions, or otherwise live your life, do you think your records are yours, or are they public? Because of some awful and ancient court decisions that predate the digital age, the law currently deems them to not belong to you.

As a result, someone like Schiff can just go to the phone company and you will never know it, even if you are a fellow member of Congress or the president’s lawyer.

That’s wrong. It’s been wrong to do to ordinary citizens. It’s wrong to give Congress this power with no check. And it’s wrong to do this to the president of the United States.

House Democrats are shameless. But with these violations of rights, they’ve reached new lows in an already low process.

It’s time to stop Adam Schiff. It’s time to move on from this witch hunt. And then it’s time to fix the rules and laws that govern our privacy so Americans can feel safe in knowing their information and rights are being protected.

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Yesterday, U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) introduced S. 2962, the Higher Education Loan Payment and Enhanced Retirement (HELPER) Act, a pro-taxpayer plan to help Americans more quickly and easily pay off their student loan debt and save more money for retirement.



“Instead of empowering the federal government to increase its involvement in education, which will only raise costs even higher and further lower the value of our dollars to cover them, we can empower the American people to reduce the burden of debt, realize the dreams they studied hard to achieve, and grow their retirement savings,” said Dr. Paul.



As U.S. student loan debt hits its highest-ever levels, Dr. Paul’s HELPER Act would allow Americans to annually take up to $5,250 from a 401(k) or IRA — tax and penalty free — to pay for college or pay back student loans. These funds could also be used to pay tuition and expenses for a spouse or dependent.



The plan would enable two parents and a child, for example, to put over $15,000 in pre-tax funds in one year toward tuition or loan repayment if each set aside the maximum. Currently, Americans can only pay for their student loans with after-tax money, placing an unnecessary constraint on their budget.



The bill would also allow employer-sponsored student loan and tuition payment plans to be tax free up to $5,250, and it would repeal the cap (and the phasing out) on deducting student loan interest, as student loans do not disappear when someone earns more money throughout their career.



To help give Americans the opportunity to save as much as possible for retirement, Dr. Paul’s HELPER Act would also offer workers the choice to have an employer contribution to a 401(k) count as a Roth contribution. While current law defers the taxes on employer contributions, forcing Americans to pay taxes on the funds and its gains in retirement, this change would allow workers to pay the taxes right away, freeing their savings to grow tax free and giving them greater financial security after they retire.



Although individuals can set up 401(k) or IRA plans on their own, and would be able to take advantage of the bill’s reforms to use pre-tax dollars to pay down their student debt, passing the HELPER Act will encourage more employers to offer 401(k)s or education benefit plans if they do not currently do so, as more workers will be able and incentivized to use such plans.

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Yesterday, U.S. Senator Rand Paul introduced his Penny Plan to Enhance Infrastructure Act (S.2792), which will help prioritize funding for Kentucky’s critical infrastructure projects by cutting just one percent from the federal government’s non-infrastructure discretionary spending and directing that money to infrastructure.



Dr. Paul’s bill would provide $12.3 billion for 2020 for new infrastructure spending, and it doesn’t touch Medicare, Medicaid, or Social Security.



“Kentuckians shouldn’t pay the price for a Congress that doesn’t know how to prioritize funding for our nation’s most dire needs over less immediately important ones,” said Dr. Paul. “My plan would ensure more of your hard-earned tax dollars are allocated to infrastructure projects right here in your communities, not sent overseas or spent on wasteful programs.”





Spending would be directed toward things such as Highway Infrastructure Programs; airport and airway improvement; railroad infrastructure; waterway improvements, including port infrastructure; military construction; safe and clean drinking water; and rural utility services.



Based on some estimates, this new funding alone could pay for between 2,500 and 6,200 miles of new 4-lane highways, 2,200 miles of 6-lane interstates, or resurface nearly 20,000 miles of existing 4-lane roads.

Recently on a national TV appearance, I made the point that regarding federal income taxes, the wealthy pay most of the income tax, and those making under $50,000 pay close to zero. The ill-informed audience hooted and hollered, and liberal voices in the media chimed in.

The problem for all of them is, I was right. I have my facts straight, something that was even borne out by the usually liberal Poltifact, saying my comments were TRUE in their fact check.

We find this a lot when arguing with the left. They, at least, appear to not want to listen to facts. The facts, for those willing to read, are overwhelming that taxpayers making over $200,000 pay most of the income tax.

The mantra of the left that the rich are not paying their fair share is without question — false!

I’m not advocating that we punish any specific group of income earners — I don’t want ANYONE to pay more taxes. I want to lower yours, your neighbors, your bosses and the guy down the street who you’re not sure what he does for a living. I really don’t care. I want LESS money going to the government, and MORE money staying in the hands of taxpayers.

I pushed hard to get even more tax cuts in the Trump tax cut plan — both by insisting on lower rates and by helping push for the individual mandate repeal, which led to a larger tax cut. (While the left-wing media won’t admit it, the Trump tax cut brought rates down, but overall tax revenue to the federal government actually increased). Turns out that lower tax rates spur economic growth, which actually leads to more tax revenue. Thank you, Art Laffer!

The left, though, likes to play tricks with statistics. Recently, in the biased New York Times, some Elizabeth Warren advisers argued that the poor are paying a higher tax rate than the richest 400 people. Horse-hockey!

Their study doesn’t show their math, but two obvious falsehoods are used to reach their conclusion: First, the authors don’t count welfare as income. So, if you earn $28,000 and the government gives you $4,000, they divide your tax bill by $28,000, not $32,000. That’s simply lying.

Second, the authors claim an average sales tax for the country of 12.3% when the real average is closer to 6%. Once again, the authors don’t count welfare dollars, so the sales tax rate is also artificially increased.

The authors also don’t acknowledge that the total taxes paid for by the richest 400 dwarfs the total taxes paid by the poor. In fact, the top 1% of taxpayers pay 40% of the income taxes. The top 20% pay nearly 80% of the taxes.

We actually have one of the most progressive systems in the world. In fact, the Trump tax cuts made our tax code even more progressive by removing more poor people from paying any income tax. In my new book, ""The Case against Socialism,"" I point out that the U.S. tax code is actually more progressive than all of the Scandinavian countries that American socialists seem to love.

Despite what the left claims, the Trump Tax Cuts benefited every American. When the tax cut was passed, every income category was estimated by the Joint Committee on Taxation to get a tax break, the largest going to those making between $40,000 and $50,000 who got a 9.8% cut. Those making more than $1 million got a 5.4% cut.

Also:Rand Paul vs. Mitch McConnell? Kentucky senators at odds over Syria

The middle class pay far higher taxes in Europe with their expansive welfare state. In fact, that’s one of the myths that American left-wing politicians, particularly those running for president, continue to perpetuate. They want you to believe that they can raise taxes on the super rich and pay for their nearly $90 trillion in programs including free college, Medicare for all, and others.

That’s pure fantasy. And it isn’t even borne out in the more limited socialist experiments in Europe. Europeans pay 2-3 times the income taxes the American middle class do. Europeans pay the bills for their experiment with Socialism by massively taxing the working class and the middle class. It can’t be done any other way; there simply isn’t enough money if you only tax the upper class.

The problem for all of them is, I was right. I have my facts straight, something that was even borne out by the usually liberal Poltifact, saying my comments were TRUE in their fact check.

We find this a lot when arguing with the left. They, at least, appear to not want to listen to facts. The facts, for those willing to read, are overwhelming that taxpayers making over $200,000 pay most of the income tax.

The mantra of the left that the rich are not paying their fair share is without question — false!

I’m not advocating that we punish any specific group of income earners — I don’t want ANYONE to pay more taxes. I want to lower yours, your neighbors, your bosses and the guy down the street who you’re not sure what he does for a living. I really don’t care. I want LESS money going to the government, and MORE money staying in the hands of taxpayers.

I pushed hard to get even more tax cuts in the Trump tax cut plan — both by insisting on lower rates and by helping push for the individual mandate repeal, which led to a larger tax cut. (While the left-wing media won’t admit it, the Trump tax cut brought rates down, but overall tax revenue to the federal government actually increased). Turns out that lower tax rates spur economic growth, which actually leads to more tax revenue. Thank you, Art Laffer!

The left, though, likes to play tricks with statistics. Recently, in the biased New York Times, some Elizabeth Warren advisers argued that the poor are paying a higher tax rate than the richest 400 people. Horse-hockey!

Their study doesn’t show their math, but two obvious falsehoods are used to reach their conclusion: First, the authors don’t count welfare as income. So, if you earn $28,000 and the government gives you $4,000, they divide your tax bill by $28,000, not $32,000. That’s simply lying.

Second, the authors claim an average sales tax for the country of 12.3% when the real average is closer to 6%. Once again, the authors don’t count welfare dollars, so the sales tax rate is also artificially increased.

The authors also don’t acknowledge that the total taxes paid for by the richest 400 dwarfs the total taxes paid by the poor. In fact, the top 1% of taxpayers pay 40% of the income taxes. The top 20% pay nearly 80% of the taxes.

We actually have one of the most progressive systems in the world. In fact, the Trump tax cuts made our tax code even more progressive by removing more poor people from paying any income tax. In my new book, ""The Case against Socialism,"" I point out that the U.S. tax code is actually more progressive than all of the Scandinavian countries that American socialists seem to love.

Despite what the left claims, the Trump Tax Cuts benefited every American. When the tax cut was passed, every income category was estimated by the Joint Committee on Taxation to get a tax break, the largest going to those making between $40,000 and $50,000 who got a 9.8% cut. Those making more than $1 million got a 5.4% cut.

The middle class pay far higher taxes in Europe with their expansive welfare state. In fact, that’s one of the myths that American left-wing politicians, particularly those running for president, continue to perpetuate. They want you to believe that they can raise taxes on the super rich and pay for their nearly $90 trillion in programs including free college, Medicare for all, and others.

That’s pure fantasy. And it isn’t even borne out in the more limited socialist experiments in Europe. Europeans pay 2-3 times the income taxes the American middle class do. Europeans pay the bills for their experiment with Socialism by massively taxing the working class and the middle class. It can’t be done any other way; there simply isn’t enough money if you only tax the upper class.

519,Paul,Rand,foxnews,"President Trump did the wise thing by moving 50 soldiers out of the way of tens of thousands of invading Turks. There can be no doubt that the situation in Northern Syria involving Turkey, the Kurds, and Syria is messy, complicated, and potentially costly. The only questions are for whom, as well as what is the role of the United States.

Regarding the problem with the Turks and the Kurds, we have to realize a certain reality: the Turks and Kurds were fighting before we arrived in Syria … or even Iraq. They were fighting while we were there. And they will be fighting after we leave. The only question is what day we leave.

If that is true, why would we stay one day longer than we need to? Whose son or daughter should risk their life? Whose taxpayer funds should go to policing this area?

TURKEY, RUSSIA ANNOUNCE JOINT PATROLS ALONG SYRIA BORDER IN LATEST MOVE AGAINST KURDS

I say not mine. And not yours, either.

We are in our current position because our well-intentioned policies have turned out to be just plain bad decisions. Our military interventions in the Middle East have led to more chaos, not less, and more terrorism, not less. The foreign policy swamp — Republicans and Democrats — have over-militarized our foreign policy; they have an inexplicable need to see an existential threat to our country behind every rock.

But there is a way we could all possibly look at this in a new way, together. I offer that we take a collective deep breath and rationally try to find a way forward. A way out of these quagmires. A way to secure our interests. A way to return to true leadership in the world. A way to lead by example through influence and not bayonets. A way to concentrate more on diplomacy and less on deployments.

We went into Syria, sideways, on the pretext of going after ISIS, but the war caucus, led by Lindsey Graham, saw an opportunity to expand our mission into nation-building. President Trump, though, was clear from the beginning. His intention was to defeat ISIS. While the president’s mission was clear, he did, however, keep U.S. troops in Syria without the congressional authorization the Constitution requires.

South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham and the neocons, however, have always had more ulterior motives. The neocons want Assad gone and a U.S.-guarded homeland for the Syrian Kurds. They opine that ISIS will return if we don’t stay forever (their same argument for eternal occupation of every place on the planet that harbors radical Islamists).

We are at a place where our strategic objectives have been confused. We are no longer aligning our ends, ways, and means to reach a desired end state. If we are completely honest, we don’t really have an achievable end state.

The neocons also claim the Kurds will release the ISIS prisoners. (This claim is absurd, as the brutality of ISIS would immediately fall on the people of Syria). The Kurds would be insane to release the ISIS prisoners, as they would be the first victims. In fact, no country in this five-sided war wants to deal with ISIS again.

We are at a place where our strategic objectives have been confused. We are no longer aligning our ends, ways, and means to reach a desired end state. If we are completely honest, we don’t really have an achievable end state.

This is a growing problem in our military adventures around the world because we have gone beyond the typical defined mission for our armed forces: winning a war, then leaving.

Even the military will tell you there is no achievable military goal in Syria. Yet, we are still there. The neocons are quick to say we have a vital national security interest in Syria. Really? If so, state it. If so, debate it on the Senate floor. Our Founding Fathers defined a path for our nation to go to war, and that path must include a constitutional debate and a declaration of war.

The neocons are partnered now with the liberal Clinton establishment in bashing the president and loudly saying we should stay in Syria. But if these loudmouths came to Congress as the Constitution requires, who would they declare war on? Syria? Turkey? Russia? Iran? Our previous ally, the Free Syrian Army?

Ousting Assad and establishing a Jeffersonian democracy (or even a Californian democracy) in Syria is clearly beyond what we as a nation should be willing to do. Thucydides said nations go to war for “Fear, Honor, and Interest.” Unfortunately, we have clouded interest, are irrational about fear, and dwell too heavily on honor. We need to realign our attitude to return to the more traditional American foreign policy of strength through restraint.

I will not attempt to justify Turkey’s perceived, real, or politically motivated security concerns that have led them to conduct their current operations. If asked by their government, I would urge them to stop immediately and use diplomacy, with our assistance.

At the very least, I would insist they show restraint in their actions and make sure they were operating well inside the law of armed conflict. I would also argue for the Kurds to show similar restraint in any form of reprisals against the Turks. I don’t advocate for the needless use of military force by any country, including my own. But this current battle is a symptom of a bigger problem that I hope our country can find a way to solve.

How do we reach an end state that meets our security needs as well as finds an end to the on-going tragedy? Unemotionally, I offer the following broad outline of a strategy that will hopefully get us to that end state.

U.S. forces in the region must be repositioned outside of the battle zone. Our few forces near the border are at risk and serve no realistic deterrent. They aren’t enough to stop the Turks, nor should we ask them to do that, and they won’t be able to temper the Kurds.

We must urge all sides to have a real, lasting, immediate tactical ceasefire. This will require dialogue between Turkey’s Erdogan and Syria’s Assad.

Instead of stoking war by arming all sides of every Middle Eastern conflict, we should withhold arms as leverage to encourage diplomacy. We must use whatever diplomatic leverage and limited influence we have left in the area to call for regional talks to find solutions to the more strategic problems.

Ironically, less U.S. involvement has already led to fertile negotiations between the Syrian Kurds and Assad. Realistically, any chance for a Kurdish semi-autonomous zone (similar to the one in Iraq) will only happen if the Kurds can make peace first with Assad, and then Assad must give assurances to Erdogan that he will keep the Syrian Kurds in Syria and at peace with the Turks.

We must be prepared to compromise as a way of seeking this “grand bargain.” We can’t let our ego, or our pursuit of honor, make us think we can make it all look exactly as we want through the sheer force of our will. We will have to find the courage in ourselves to accept the art of the possible or maybe even practical.

520,Paul,Rand,nypost,"Four in 10 Americans now consider some kind of socialism “a good thing for the country as a whole” — an 18 percent increase since 1942, according to Gallup. But, in an excerpt from his new book, “The Case Against Socialism,” out now, SEN. RAND PAUL explains why this embrace of economic equality would make life worse for us all

The commentator Selwyn Duke makes an important point that socialists ignore: “The richest men hail primarily from nations providing economic freedom whereas the poorest live disproportionately in socialist countries.”

“Equality tells us nothing about quality,” Duke continues. “You can have equality in poverty, equality in misery, or equality in incompetence, ignorance or stupidity.”

Yet, socialists like Bernie Sanders still use equality as their measuring stick and Scandinavia as their model. “Why can’t we be like Sweden?” they protest. “That’s the socialism America needs.”

Economist and writer Walter Williams points out that it’s important to know what choices you give up if you want the equality of Swedish socialized medicine. Williams tells the story of a patient with multiple sclerosis, which is an incurable disease that sometimes spirals downward. New medicines are becoming available, but they are expensive. Williams tells of how a Gothenburg, Sweden, multiple sclerosis patient’s prescription for a new drug was denied because the drug was significantly more expensive than the older medicine. Not only was the patient denied government-insurance payment for the drug, but he was also prevented from buying the drug himself. The Swedish equality police argued that “it would set a bad precedent and lead to unequal access to medicine.”

One might ask: Do high-ranking Swedish officials get the same denials?

Socialists say they want equality, but if you ask what people really want, they’ll answer that what is important is the quality of their own standard of life.

Even if socialists admit that our standard of living is improving, they typically fail to understand why. For the socialist, economic progress is some quirk of history perhaps related to technology, but they deny that the voluntary exchanges of capitalism have anything to do with it. Williams, however, points out the undeniable correlation between capitalism and wealth.

Quoting Williams, Duke writes, “if you rank ‘countries according to whether they are closer to being a free-market economy or whether they’re closer to having a socialist or planned economy’ and based on ‘per capita income,’ you will find a general ‘pattern whereby those having a larger measure of economic freedom find their citizens enjoying a higher standard of living.’ ”

Economist Thomas Sowell makes the point as well: “None of the Marxist regimes around the world has ever had as high a standard of living for working people as there is in many capitalist countries” dominated by the free market.

Yet many think public policy should try to ameliorate income inequality. Reports of a handful of people owning nearly half the world’s wealth incite calls to disallow such accumulation of wealth.

In an article for The Washington Times, Dalibor Rohac illustrates how an obsession with income inequality can lead to ludicrous conclusions. He writes, “Liberal pundits are alarmed that income inequality in the United States is higher than in Pakistan or Ethiopia.” Which invites the question: Would anyone then choose to leave the United States and move to Pakistan or Ethiopia? Churchill famously explained the false allure of equality under socialism: “The inherent vice of capitalism is the unequal sharing of blessings. The inherent virtue of Socialism is the equal sharing of miseries.”

Every election we hear Hollywood celebrities, most with barely a high-school diploma, threaten to leave America if Republicans win. They scold us from their Beverly Hills mansions and private jets. They lecture us through their Juvederm-plumped lips. Perhaps we should send them travel brochures on income equality in Pakistan and Ethiopia. Citizens in those countries enjoy much greater income equality, albeit less access to fine dining and Prada sunglasses.

Since people have unequal talents, the only way you get equal outcomes is to treat them differently. This should be anathema. - Sen. Rand Paul in “The Case Against Socialism”

These liberal actors can’t separate themselves from the fiction of the big screen. If they could, they would look at the facts and argue for policies that actually help the poor. Rohac makes this point clearly: “If one cares about the welfare of the poorest and the most vulnerable, income inequality is not a useful measure. Measures of inequality tell us nothing about the living conditions of the poor, their health and their access to economic opportunity.”

The mistake is believing that income inequality has anything to do with economic well-being. Harvard scientist Steven Pinker elaborates on this point: “the starting point for understanding inequality in the context of human progress is to recognize that income inequality is not a fundamental [measurement] of well-being. It is not like health, prosperity, knowledge, safety, peace and the other areas of progress.”

To make his point, Pinker tells a Soviet-era joke.

Igor and Boris are dirt-poor peasants, barely scratching enough crops from their small plots of land to feed their families. The only difference between them is that Boris owns a scrawny goat. One day a fairy appears to Igor and grants him a wish. Igor says, “I wish that Boris’ goat should die.”

Instead of wishing for greater wealth for himself, Igor, like today’s equality zealots, would prefer to have equal misery.

Pinker argues that “the confusion of inequality with poverty comes straight out of the lump fallacy — the mindset in which wealth is a finite resource, like an antelope carcass, which has to be divvied up in zero-sum fashion, so that if some people end up with more, others must have less . . . wealth is not like that: Since the Industrial Revolution, it has expanded exponentially. That means that when the rich get richer, the poor can get richer, too.”

Pinker points out that “total wealth today is vastly greater than it was in 1910, so if the poorer half own the same proportion, they are far richer, not ‘as poor.’ ”

As Rea Hederman and David Azerrad write at the Heritage Foundation, “Free-market economics is not about dividing up a dwindling pie but expanding the pie to serve everyone. Those who succeed do not do so at the expense of others.”

When policy is directed toward eliminating income inequality, the unintended consequence is to lessen the incentives that drive the wealth creation that has lifted millions of people out of poverty over the past few centuries. Hederman and Azerrad explain that “the left’s new American dream is first and foremost about all that the federal government must do to create opportunity and ensure that incomes are distributed more equitably. Individual effort takes a back seat to government spending and cradle-to-grave entitlements.”

Despite the left’s obsession with income inequality, Hederman and Azerrad argue: “Income disparities have not caused a decline in upward mobility. Standards of living have increased for everyone — as have incomes — and mobility, however one measures it, remains robust. Simply put, how much the top 1 percent of the population earns has no bearing on whether the bottom 20 percent can move up.”

The great Austrian economist and writer Ludwig von Mises explained that the incentive of unequal returns is absolutely a necessary component of a successful economic system. Mises writes: “only because inequality of wealth is possible in our social order, only because it stimulates everyone to produce as much as he can and at the lowest cost, does mankind today have at its disposal the total annual wealth now available for consumption.” If government destroys this incentive, it also destroys productivity and economic growth. On average, individuals are poorer when the incentive of “income inequality” is eliminated. Andy Puzder, the former CEO of Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s, describes well socialism’s inherent focus on greed.

“If you’re in a capitalist economy, the only way you can succeed is by meeting the needs of other people,” he said in a recent interview. “Socialism, on the other hand, focuses you inward. You’re focused on what you can get.”

The technology revolution in the United States has also shown that the best outcomes for creating super wealth are often not the traditional paths to success. Who would have thought quitting college and tinkering in his garage would result in Bill Gates becoming the richest man in the world?

And Gates’ success has inspired many more inventors to pursue their dreams. In America, the son of a car salesman and a teacher can invent a new virtual technology in his parents’ garage and make millions. Palmer Luckey, a friend of mine, comes from a conservative, middle-class family. He was homeschooled. He spent one year at California State University, Long Beach but dropped out to work on his idea for a virtual-reality headset. This invention became Oculus Rift, which was ultimately purchased by Facebook for $2 billion in 2014. Palmer’s route to unfathomable success was possible only by having a society with equal opportunity but not equality of outcome.

The economist and philosopher Friedrich Hayek argues that “from the fact that people are very different it follows that, if we treat them equally, the result must be inequality in their actual position and that the only way to place them in an equal position would be to treat them differently.”

His argument deserves restating. Since people have different and unequal talents, the only way you get equal outcomes is to treat them differently. In other words, to have an unequal application of the law. This should be anathema to both liberals and conservatives.

Bernie Sanders and other crusaders for equality admit that they can’t get rid of all inequality, but at the least we should eliminate the extremes of income inequality. Socialists rarely speak of who it is that will have their wealth taken. They shy away from naming names. After all, Michelle and Barack Obama are 1-percenters who live in an enormous mansion and travel the world on luxury vacations. I certainly don’t have a problem with that. They have made millions on book deals and speeches and can afford to celebrate their achievements. But I wonder if Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez does? How does Bernie feel about Michelle Obama’s much-praised $4,000 Balenciaga boots? While Bernie and AOC might find the extravagant footwear of 1-percenters “unequal,” I support the right of the rich to shine in glittery boots! After all, they are helping to support a luxury-goods industry that employs creative people who craft fine materials into beautiful designs. If we didn’t have rich people to buy such luxury items, those talents would be lost. Do today’s socialists want a world without Balenciaga or Tom Ford?

The socialists argue that they’ll leave just enough merit pay to incentivize the entrepreneurs. No harm, no foul. Perhaps, but I’m guessing that no one really knows how much incentive must remain to encourage the great breakthroughs of history. Shouldn’t we at least worry that if enough “income inequality” is destroyed, perhaps the next Steve Jobs chooses to devote his time to surfing instead of entrepreneurship?

President Donald Trump campaigned on a very specific foreign policy. “America First” has its roots in the less-interventionist policies of our Founding Fathers.

Then-candidate Trump said often that the Iraq War was a mistake, and that we were in too many places for too long. Fast-forward to 2019, and the president is now moving forward to stop the “endless wars.” I stand with him.

The idea that our president would make this decision from this perspective is refreshing and long-awaited. Virtually every president in my lifetime has ended up in a new conflict or extending and expanding the old ones.

In particular, in the past 18 years, from Iraq to Libya to Syria, past presidents went into one bad misadventure after another.

The Syrian civil war was a mess from the beginning, with Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton supporting arms that went to Sunni extremists, which allowed the war to go on long enough that hundreds of thousands died and millions were displaced.

During every conflict, as we attempt to extricate ourselves, there is always a chorus of hawks who scream about what will happen when we leave. It usually happens if we stay anyway.

OUR VIEW:Trump pours gasoline on Syria. Now Turkey-Kurds-Russia blowup may one day burn USA.

Iraq. Afghanistan. Now Syria. We hear that our presence could be needed for decades. To what end? What do we hope happens during that time? I, for one, don’t see what our national interest is in policing the Middle East and nation-building. Thankfully, neither does President Trump.

His bold action to remove our troops from Syria is the continuation of his policy to leave that civil war. He sought to defeat the Islamic State and did. What is left is a decades-long battle among Turks, Kurds and Syrians that we cannot solve.

Every decision has a price. Would you be willing to send your son or daughter to stand between two armies 7,000 miles away as a human shield? I would not.

For those who want to stay, come to Congress as you should. Tell us, for starters, whom you would declare war on. Our NATO ally Turkey? The Kurds? Syria? No one can answer this because there is no clear U.S. interest and no need for our troops. That’s President Trump’s standard, and I support it.

524,Paul,Rand,nationalreview,"Sen. Bernie Sanders speaks during the Democratic presidential candidates debate in Westerville, Ohio, October 15, 2019. (Shannon Stapleton/Reuters)

The Scandinavian countries Bernie Sanders professes to admire are not actually all that socialist.

If socialist wannabes in America fail to look at the facts, the United States might finally succumb to socialism. The American Left’s love affair with Scandinavian socialism is dangerous because it holds the possibility of hoodwinking enough of the populace into voting to replace the capitalist system that made America great with the socialist system that made Stalin all powerful and the people all hungry. They say the republic dies when the majority discovers it can vote to take other people’s stuff. Let’s hope that day remains elusive.

How pervasive is the Left’s admiration for Scandinavian “socialism”? Well, it’s definitely not limited to Bernie and his campaign followers. Hillary name-drops Sweden and Denmark as well. You can even go back 20 years and find Bill Clinton waxing poetic about Denmark. Bill even claimed that “Finland, Sweden and Norway offer more chances for individuals to out-earn their parents than the United States does.” No news on Chelsea moving to Scandinavia anytime soon.

But it is Bernie who is most enamored. In fact, according to CNN, “Bernie Sanders’ American Dream is in Denmark” and “Bernie Sanders . . . won’t stop talking about” the Danes. Sanders is quoted as saying: “In Denmark, there is a very different understanding of what ‘freedom’ means . . . they have gone a long way to ending the enormous anxieties that comes with economic insecurity.” Sanders plays the income-inequality trope: “Instead of promoting a system which allows a few to have enormous wealth, they have developed a system which guarantees a strong minimal standard of living to all—including the children, the elderly and the disabled.”

The irony is that while American socialists want to become like Scandinavian socialists, Scandinavian socialists want to become more like American capitalists. I remember hearing a fellow senator put it this way: “The American Left wants to become Western Europe. Western Europe wants to become Eastern Europe. Eastern Europe, sick of socialism and Communism, wants to become American capitalists!” Indeed, the Danes seem a bit squeamish about all the attention from Bernie and want to make sure that the rest of the world knows they are not, in fact, socialist and are open for business.

It’s not just the “socialist” label that might concern the Danes. Denmark’s economic success is inseparable from free trade and low corporate-income taxes. Bernie’s policy decisions are the opposite of policies the Danes believe foster their success.

Indeed, before Republicans lowered the U.S. corporate tax in 2018, Denmark’s corporate tax was significantly lower than ours. Bernie, on the other hand, has not been a fan of free trade or lower corporate-income taxes.

In the MSNBC New Hampshire Democratic presidential debate, Bernie responded, “I do not believe in unfettered free trade. I believe in fair trade which works for the middle class and working families, not just large multinational corporations. I was on the picket line in opposition to NAFTA. We heard people tell us how many jobs would be created. I didn’t believe that for a second because I understood what the function of NAFTA, CAFTA, PNTR with China, and the TPP is, it’s to say to American workers, ‘Hey, you are now competing against people in Vietnam who make 56 cents an hour minimum wage.’”

On corporate taxes, Bernie’s opinion has been consistent: In the fall of 2018, on one of the Sunday shows, Bernie emphatically argued that if the Democrats retake the Senate, corporate taxes would “absolutely” go back up. However, the Scandinavian countries Bernie professes to admire believe the opposite. They support low, competitive corporate taxes and have embraced the free-trade agreements.

The Danes are vocal in distancing themselves from Bernie’s policies and quite emphatically don’t want to be known as a bad place to do business. The executive editor in chief for Politiken, a Danish newspaper, writes: “There is this idea that we are a heavily regulated society with a closed economy. The opposite is true.”

As Chris Moody of CNN writes, “In terms of pure semantics, few Danish politicians today would characterize themselves as ‘socialist’—even a ‘democratic socialist’—as Sanders does. The word has largely fallen out of fashion in recent decades.”

Lars Christensen, a Danish economist, writes: “When I hear Bernie Sanders talk about himself as a democratic socialist, it’s a little bit 1970s. The major political parties on the center-left and the center-right would oppose many of the proposals of Bernie Sanders on the regulatory side as being too leftist.”

525,Paul,Rand,harpercollins,"A recent poll showed 43% of Americans think more socialism would be a good thing. What do these people not know?

Socialism has killed millions, but it’s now the ideology du jour on American college campuses and among many leftists. Reintroduced by leaders such as Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the ideology manifests itself in starry-eyed calls for free-spending policies like Medicare-for-all and student loan forgiveness.

In The Case Against Socialism, Rand Paul outlines the history of socialism, from Stalin’s gulags to the current famine in Venezuela. He tackles common misconceptions about the “utopia” of socialist Europe. As it turns out, Scandinavian countries love capitalism as much as Americans, and have, for decades, been cutting back on the things Bernie loves the most.

Socialism’s return is only possible because many Americans have forgotten the true dangers of the twentieth-century’s deadliest ideology. Paul reveals the devastating truth: for every college student sporting a Che Guevara T-shirt, there’s a Venezuelan child dying of starvation. Desperate refugees flee communist Cuba to escape oppressive censorship, rationed food and squalid hospitals, not “free” healthcare. Socialist dictatorships like the People’s Republic of China crush freedom of speech and run massive surveillance states while masquerading as enlightened modern nations. Far from providing economic freedom, socialist governments enslave their citizens. They offer illusory promises of safety and equality while restricting personal liberty, tightening state power, sapping human enterprise and making citizens dependent on the dole.

If socialism takes hold in America, it will imperil the fate of the world’s freest nation, unleashing a plague of oppressive government control.

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Yesterday, U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) introduced the National Patient Identifier Repeal Act to overturn a dangerous provision of existing law requiring the creation of a “unique health identifier,” also known as a National Patient ID.



“As a physician, I know firsthand how the doctor-patient relationship relies on trust and privacy, which will be thrown into jeopardy by a National Patient ID. Considering how unfortunately familiar our world has become with devastating security breaches and the dangers of the growing surveillance state, it is simply unacceptable for government to centralize some of Americans’ most personal information,” said Dr. Paul.



The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) established the statutory authority to create a unique health identifier, a distinct ID code to identify the medical records of every individual, employer, health plan, and health care provider in America.



Dr. Paul’s father, former Congressman Ron Paul (R-TX), introduced language to the Labor-HHS appropriations bill in 1998 to restrict the use of federal funds to develop the identifier, and such a ban has been continually renewed in each Labor-HHS appropriations bill since.



This June, however, an amendment stripped this critical protection for Americans out of the version of the Labor-HHS appropriations bill ultimately passed by the U.S. House of Representatives. Enacting the bill into law with this amendment or a similar provision would open the floodgates for a government-issued ID to be linked with the private medical history of every man, woman, and child in America.



Prior to introducing standalone legislation to repeal the original authority created under HIPAA, Dr. Paul successfully advocated this month for keeping language banning federal funding for the unique health identifier in the proposed Senate version of the Labor-HHS appropriations bill.

Senator Rand Paul is waging battle against waste. In his latest ‘waste report’, the Senator reveals how the government is adding to the $22 trillion national debt by subsidizing all manner of pointless activities, including $48 billion in improper Medicare and Medicaid payments.

All in all, Senator Paul totaled up $50 BILLION in wasted dollars, and he could have found a lot more had he scratched beneath the surface.

Some of the more bizarre things the government is wasting money on include the State Department spending $100,000 in subsidies for the Pakistani film industry.

The money will reportedly go to teach ‘aspiring filmmakers’ how to write screenplays, with a particular focus on themes of “strength in diversity” and “women’s empowerment”.

Why does this help America? No one really knows. Best guess is that its some sort of odd virtue signal on a grand scale. ‘Look at America helping these poor brown people make better films’.

The National Science Foundation, a government branch, also spent close to $500,000 studying the difference between frog mating calls in the city and in the forests in Panama. The frogs are not even an endangered species, they just did the study for fun.

It found that city frogs “call at a higher rate”. Good to know. I’m sure Americans will gladly hand over another half a million. Lets see how many frogs have turned gay this time, perhaps?

The government also spent a whopping $10 million on Peru’s version of the ‘Green New Deal’, with the US Agency for International Development committing the money “to develop new and innovative alliances with the private sector that advance environmentally-friendly economic development (i.e. green growth) in Peru.”

Helping out Peruvian gardeners has zero benefit for taxpaying Americans.

Other waste includes $2 million to “promote democracy” in Tunisia. The report notes that the US State Department has spent more than $1.4 billion on such efforts since 2011 when things went to shit in the country.

Why is it working Americans’ responsibility to fix a failed nation in Africa when their own infrastructure is crumbling?

Perhaps the most amusing example is the much beloved Department of Homeland Security having spent more than $2.1 billion on an effort to transform an abandoned DC mental hospital into its new HQ, with the project no where near completion.

The U.S. government has plenty of needs to dedicate money to whether it be the plague of homelessness, the opioid plague, or fixing our national healthcare crisis. But instead, the U.S. government is spending its money on frogs.

Dr. Rand Paul, Senator from Kentucky, released his annual “Waste Report.” The report finds expenditures that the U.S. government is misappropriating funds on and some of them are unconscionable.

The report found that nearly half of a million dollars was spent on investigating the mating behavior of Panamanian frogs. The National Science Foundation (NSF) spent $466,991.68 on studying the mating calls of frogs in Panama.

Dr. Rand Paul’s grand total of “The Waste Report” for Summer 2019 is $50,190,108,562.35 for federal grants. In the report of taxpayer dollars wasted, other funds wasted were on an abandoned Civil War-era mental hospital in Washington D.C. and the $100,000 spent on the Pakistani film industry.

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY), chairman of the Federal Spending Oversight and Emergency Management (FSO) Subcommittee for the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC), continued his efforts to reform the big-spending status quo with the release of a Summer 2019 edition of The Waste Report.

Once again, Dr. Paul’s Waste Report turns the spotlight on just some of the ways the federal government spends the American people’s hard-earned money, with this edition including stories of building up Tunisia’s political system and the Pakistani film industry, supporting “green growth” in Peru, teaching English and IT skills at madrassas, studying frog mating calls, making improper payments, and more.

531,Paul,Rand,yahoo,"Extra virgin olive oil is one of the few foods that health experts seem to unanimously praise. In fact, the list of benefits is so extensive that olive oil is widely considered to be a superfood. It’s thought to fend off Alzheimer’s disease and cut your risk of diabetes, heart disease and stroke. It’s also packed with antioxidants and good, healthy fats.

Now, new research published in the journal PLOS One suggests that extra virgin olive oil just might have the power to kill off cancer cells — and some types of olive oil may actually protect the body against cancer better than others.

We talked to experts to figure out if extra virgin olive oil really can prevent cancer and what type we should be stocking in our kitchen cabinets.

Here’s what you should know:

The cancer-fighting power in olive oil mainly relies on one ingredient.

Top view of an olive oil bottle and a little glass bowl filled with green olives on rustic wood table. Two olives with leaves are at the top-right while a bowl filled with olive oil is at the center-top beside the two olives. An olive tree branch is at the left-top corner. A wooden spoon with three olives comes from the right. Predominant colors are gold, green and brown. DSRL studio photo taken with Canon EOS 5D Mk II and Canon EF 100mm f/2.8L Macro IS USM (Photo: fcafotodigital via Getty Images)

This isn’t the first study to find that extra virgin olive oil might have cancer-killing properties. Previous evidence suggests that certain olive oils can lower your odds of developing cancer, all thanks to an ingredient called oleocanthal — an antimicrobial, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compound naturally found in high-quality, nonrefined olive oils.

This new PLOS One study not only reinforced these claims, but also found that extra virgin olive oils rich in oleocanthal are much more protective against cancer than those with only a little bit of oleocanthal. Where extra virgin olive oils seem to zap away cancer cells, non-extra virgin olive oils don’t appear to have any effect on cancer cells.

In other words, because of oleocanthal, extra virgin olive oil can help (key word being help) prevent a range of health conditions and suppress melanoma, breast, liver, and colon cancer cells, according to the researchers.

There are some limitations with this study.



Before you rush off to the grocery store and buy olive oil in bulk, there are a few things you should know. First, while it’s obviously exciting that olive oil could potentially nix cancer cells, it’s way too soon to conclude that olive oil can treat or cure cancer in people based off the research.

Story continues

“You’re not taking a medication, you’re just eating olive oil, so I’m not going to be trying to give you some advice like ... once you have been diagnosed with cancer, go have olive oil,” explained Vasilis Vasiliou, chair of the department of environmental health sciences at Yale Cancer Center.

Additionally, the new study was conducted in animals — specifically mice — not humans. More research is needed to better understand how well oleocanthal works in humans, not just mice, before we can recommend olive oil as a cancer treatment, Vasilou explained. Still, these findings add to the growing body of evidence that oleocanthal can destroy cancer cells in some capacity, and it’s definitely worth exploring if it can be used to help treat cancer in people.

Bottom line: Olive oil is incredibly beneficial — but make sure you’re getting the right kind.

All things considered, it is important to include olive oil in your diet. However, if you want to reap the all the health benefits, you’ll need to invest in the higher-quality stuff. The cheaper, overly processed products aren’t going to do you much good.

“Olive oil comes from olives. Anytime we take a whole food and degrade it, process it, pack it, transport it, stabilize it, etc., we are changing its original form,” said Sharon Zarabi, a nutritionist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York. Creating capsules, supplements and oils from the olive’s natural form affects our metabolism and how our bodies process it, she added.

To reap the most benefits, always buy extra virgin olive oil, which usually goes for anywhere from $20 to $150 a bottle. Most higher-quality olive oils that contain potential cancer-fighting powers will have a strong, pungent — even peppery — taste.

“When you eat olive oil that has high content [of oleocanthal], you get a little burning in your throat. You may think that this is a bad quality, but that’s the opposite — it’s the [oleocanthal],” Vasilou said.

Another important tip: Buy small bottles of extra virgin olive oil. If olive oil isn’t stored properly or used swiftly, the fats can degrade over time and may actually pose more of a health risk than benefit.

“Degradation of any compound will cause oxidative stress and actually contribute to degenerative disease, doing the complete opposite of what it was intended to treat,” Zarabi said.

Lastly, don’t overdo it. While it may be tempting to center your meals around olive oil based on all its health powers, it’s always best to eat your foods in moderation. Adding high-quality olive oil to an overall healthy diet is the best way to go.

Saudi Arabia disregards basic human rights, slaughters innocents in Yemen, horrifically murders dissidents, puts millions on the edge of starvation, and supports and strengthens our enemies.

One would think it would be an easy choice to not sell our weapons to such a country, but like every push for positive change in Washington, getting Congress to take a stand on this issue has been a hard-fought battle.

Recently, we gained a major victory, when more than 50 senators voted to pass 22 joint resolutions of disapproval to block over $8 billion in American weapons and support primarily going to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

Only a few years ago, the odds of such a win seemed long, as just 27 senators voted to stop an arms sale to the Saudis when I and a bipartisan group of senators forced a vote in the Senate in 2016. Yet we kept pushing. When we took another stand in 2017, our numbers skyrocketed to 47 senators.

The Senate has now even voted multiple times to end U.S. support for the catastrophic war in Yemen, with the House of Representatives finally joining us earlier this year.

While we do not yet have veto-proof numbers to stop the arms sales, we will once again keep pushing until we get there.

We have to.

How Saudi Arabia is using our weapons

Just a day before the votes, a United Nations investigator released a report concluding that journalist Jamal Khashoggi was “the victim of a deliberate, premeditated execution, an extrajudicial killing for which the state of Saudi Arabia is responsible under international human rights law.”

CNN reported earlier this year that our weapons have flowed from Saudi Arabia and its allies to our enemies.

What else are they doing with our weapons? Bombing civilians and school kids in Yemen.

Saudi justice:One of my clients is dead. Another is living, but he could be next

Add this to their financial support to spread radicalism that teaches hatred against the West, as well as Hillary Clinton’s own admission that ""the governments of Qatar and Saudi Arabia … are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to (the Islamic State) and other radical Sunni groups in the region.""

In an alarming development, we’ve heard reports of the United States seeking to boost the Saudis’ nuclear power capabilities, which is courting unintended consequences and escalation in the region.

In a report last year, Human Rights Watch revealed that the kingdom “is detaining thousands of people for more than six months, in some cases for over a decade, without referring them to courts for criminal proceedings.”

The truth is not complicated. Saudi Arabia will not change course as long as we keep the weapons flowing. Why should they?

Yes, this vote. Yes, this time.

It seems that any time the status quo is challenged, the response is “not this vote, not this time.” We hear it when the big spenders want to ram through one of a thousand budget-busting ideas. We hear it when we try to remind politicians that the Fourth Amendment still exists, and we hear it when we try to stop our country from selling arms to radicals.

If not now, when?

For the Washington establishment, the answer is simple: never. For the warmongers who see the whole world as something to be reshaped in their image, we can never bring the troops home or stop propping up extremists if we feel they serve our ends.

We don't need your virtue signalling:I'm Muslim but don't wear a headscarf. Stop using hijabs as a tool for ‘solidarity.’

They’ve left nothing but failure, death and destruction in their wake, yet their appetite for more remains seemingly insatiable.

Look at the photos of the dying, the wounded and the starving in Yemen — the parents holding their emaciated children — and tell me Saudi Arabia is a nation that deserves our support. Your support.

I agree with and support President Donald Trump on many issues, and I have vigorously defended him against the outrageous assaults he faces on a daily basis. But I disagree that selling arms to Saudi Arabia strengthens our national security, and I urge him to do here what he has boldly done in so many other areas: Reject the failed policies of the past.

We simply cannot profess to want Middle East peace on one hand and fuel a deadly arms race in the region on the other.

It’s time to say “no more,” and our momentum to do just that took a major leap forward last month.

Acting Commissioner Norman E. ""Ned"" Sharpless, M.D.

Food and Drug Administration

United States Department of Health and Human Services

10903 New Hampshire Avenue

Silver Spring, MD 20993

Dear Acting Commissioner Sharpless,

With the change in leadership at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), there is a unique opportunity for the FDA to better prioritize bringing life-saving drugs to patients faster and at a lower cost by expanding the FDA's Parallel Track for drug approval to other critical diseases.

In recent years the FDA has sought to streamline its drug approval process, and such efforts should be commended. However, significant barriers to ready access remain. Despite FDA's efforts, it still takes on average 10 to 12 years and as much as $2.8 billion to bring a new treatment from lab to patients. Many patients with critical illnesses cannot wait that long.

One unused solution that the FDA already has at its disposal is to expand the already existing Parallel Track to other diseases.

Created in 1992, the Parallel Track allowed individuals to access breakthrough drugs to treat HIV/AIDS years ahead of such drugs' final FDA approval, while these drugs were still in Phase II and III clinical trials. Thousands of suffers had their lives saved because of this quicker access to innovative medications.

Today, millions of Americans are similarly afflicted by or dying from debilitating diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, cancer, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Similar to the HIV/AIDS crisis, promising, potentially life-saving drugs for these diseases are mired in Phases II and III of the drug-approval process. Although demonstrating amazing results for the few Americans allowed to participate in clinical trials, these much-needed drugs and therapies remain years and billions of dollars of investment away from FDA approval and full access by patients.

In order to bring these drugs and therapies more quickly and at a lower cost to Americans, we strongly urge the FDA to expand the Parallel Track to target these devastating diseases. Under an expanded Parallel Track, the sponsors of any drug or therapy that has successfully passed safety criteria would have the option to allow patients with critical illnesses-not already enrolled in controlled clinical trials-to access these drugs and therapies after consulting with their doctor.

As we examine the budget of the FDA and its potential new leadership, we are looking for evidence that the agency seeks to act as a bridge-not a barrier-to innovation.

It is time for the FDA to create and encourage an environment that promotes patient choice, patient access, and patient affordability. Expansion of Parallel Track is a proven solution to do just that, and we strongly encourage the FDA to act immediately on this issue.

Sincerely,

/s/

535,Paul,Rand,theatlantic,"Our brave women and men in uniform have served with valor, honor, and effectiveness. It is Congress that has failed to assert its constitutional duty to conduct forceful oversight over the war in Afghanistan, which has now been waged for nearly two decades. Congress must step up and step in to ensure that another generation of Americans is not sent to fight a war with no end in sight, especially when there is no military solution to the challenges facing Afghanistan.

For nearly two decades, and under three presidents—both Democratic and Republican—we have committed America’s blood and treasure toward securing Afghanistan. On top of the thousands of American lives lost and forever changed, as the mission has dragged on, we have been left with the fraying of vital relationships and a bill greater than what our nation spent on the Marshall Plan—upwards of $2 trillion.

Despite the exceptional efforts and extraordinary sacrifices of our armed forces and diplomatic corps, we still face enormous obstacles that will not be solved by military force—ranging from rampant corruption fueled by billions of dollars in multilateral aid to a drug-trafficking problem that has upended the rule of law to deep-seated issues of governance that demand a political solution.

By now, it’s clear that American troops have achieved the mission they were sent to carry out in October 2001, including the removal of al-Qaeda’s base and the death of Osama bin Laden. But the continued commitment of our troops will not enable the Afghan people to rebuild their own nation or stabilize the central government. We should not risk more American lives, or continue squandering more than $51 billion each year on these impossible tasks.

We urge our colleagues in Congress to step up to the plate and do our jobs as laid out in the Constitution—to evaluate whether our continued interests in Afghanistan justify the enormous sacrifices required of the brave women and men serving there. The AFGHAN Service Act will enable Congress to act as the Constitution envisioned, bringing our troops home after nearly two decades of courageous service.

For their heroism and valor, our legislation says “Thank you” by ensuring we recognize and honor that service. Drawing from the billions saved by ending the war in Afghanistan, our bill provides a $2,500 bonus within one year to all the members of our volunteer military who have served in the Global War on Terrorism.

Endless wars require endless resources and endless sacrifices. We simply cannot maintain a prolonged military footprint in Afghanistan, putting more Americans in harm’s way and pouring billions of dollars into an endless war, while also addressing the urgent needs we face at home and abroad.

U.S. Senator

In September 2014, I had these words to say: “The president acts like he’s a king. He ignores the Constitution. He arrogantly says, ‘If Congress will not act, then I must.’

Donald J. Trump agreed with me when he said in November 2014 that President Barack Obama couldn’t make a deal on immigration so “now he has to use executive action, and this is a very, very dangerous thing that should be overridden easily by the Supreme Court.”

I would literally lose my political soul if I decided to treat President Trump different than President Obama. (Although, I’ll note, not one Democrat criticized Obama for his executive orders.)

I support President Trump. I supported his fight to get funding for the wall from Republicans and Democrats alike, and I share his view that we need more and better border security.

However, I cannot support the use of emergency powers to get more funding, so I will be voting to disapprove of his declaration when it comes before the Senate.

Every single Republican I know decried President Obama’s use of executive power to legislate. We were right then. But the only way to be an honest officeholder is to stand up for the same principles no matter who is in power.

I was against foreign aid and foreign intervention without a true national security threat — under Republicans and Democrats.

I’ve stood up and voted against budgets that pile up endless debt and borrow too much — under Republicans and Democrats.

I will stand up for the Constitution, the rule of law, and the system of checks and balances we have — under Republicans and Democrats.

There are really two questions involved in the decision about emergency funding. First, does statutory law allow for the president’s emergency orders, and, second, does the Constitution permit these emergency orders? As far as the statute goes, the answer is maybe — although no president has previously used emergency powers to spend money denied by Congress, and it was clearly not intended to do that.

But there is a much larger question: the question of whether or not this power and therefore this action are constitutional. With regard to the Constitution, the Supreme Court made it very clear in Youngstown Steel in 1952, in a case that is being closely reexamined in the discussion of executive power.

In Youngstown, the Court ruled that there are three kinds of executive order: orders that carry out an expressly voiced congressional position, orders where Congress’ will is unclear, and, finally, orders clearly opposed to the will of Congress.

To my mind, like it or not, we had this conversation. In fact, the government was shut down in a public battle over how much money would be spent on the wall and border security. It ended with a deal that Congress passed and the president signed into law, thus determining the amount.

Congress clearly expressed its will not to spend more than $1.3 billion and to restrict how much of that money could go to barriers. Therefore, President Trump’s emergency order is clearly in opposition to the will of Congress.

Moreover, the broad principle of separation of powers in the Constitution delegates the power of the purse to Congress. This turns that principle on its head.

I, and many of my fellow members, called out President Obama for abusing executive authority. President Obama famously said that if Congress wouldn’t do what he wanted, he had his pen and his phone ready. That was wrong. Many of those voting now spent a good portion of their campaigns running ads against these words and actions of President Obama. They will and should be condemned for hypocrisy if they vote to allow this because they want the policy or want to stand with the president in a partisan fight.

Some are attempting to say that there isn’t a good analogy between President Obama’s orders or the Youngstown case. I disagree. Not only are the issues similar, but I think Youngstown Steel implications are even more profound in the case of emergency appropriations.

We spent the last two months debating how much money should be spent on a wall, and Congress came to a clear conclusion: $1.3 billion. Without question, the president’s order for more wall money contradicts the will of Congress and will, in all likelihood, be struck down by the Supreme Court.

In fact, I think the president’s own picks to the Supreme Court may rebuke him on this.

Regardless, I must vote how my principles dictate. My oath is to the Constitution, not to any man or political party. I stand with the president often, and I do so with a loud voice.

U.S. Senator

In September 2014, I had these words to say: “The president acts like he’s a king. He ignores the Constitution. He arrogantly says, ‘If Congress will not act, then I must.’

Donald J. Trump agreed with me when he said in November 2014 that President Barack Obama couldn’t make a deal on immigration so “now he has to use executive action, and this is a very, very dangerous thing that should be overridden easily by the Supreme Court.”

I would literally lose my political soul if I decided to treat President Trump different than President Obama. (Although, I’ll note, not one Democrat criticized Obama for his executive orders.)

I support President Trump. I supported his fight to get funding for the wall from Republicans and Democrats alike, and I share his view that we need more and better border security.

However, I cannot support the use of emergency powers to get more funding, so I will be voting to disapprove of his declaration when it comes before the Senate.

Every single Republican I know decried President Obama’s use of executive power to legislate. We were right then. But the only way to be an honest officeholder is to stand up for the same principles no matter who is in power.

I was against foreign aid and foreign intervention without a true national security threat — under Republicans and Democrats.

I’ve stood up and voted against budgets that pile up endless debt and borrow too much — under Republicans and Democrats.

I will stand up for the Constitution, the rule of law, and the system of checks and balances we have — under Republicans and Democrats.

There are really two questions involved in the decision about emergency funding. First, does statutory law allow for the president’s emergency orders, and, second, does the Constitution permit these emergency orders? As far as the statute goes, the answer is maybe — although no president has previously used emergency powers to spend money denied by Congress, and it was clearly not intended to do that.

But there is a much larger question: the question of whether or not this power and therefore this action are constitutional. With regard to the Constitution, the Supreme Court made it very clear in Youngstown Steel in 1952, in a case that is being closely reexamined in the discussion of executive power.

In Youngstown, the Court ruled that there are three kinds of executive order: orders that carry out an expressly voiced congressional position, orders where Congress’ will is unclear, and, finally, orders clearly opposed to the will of Congress.

To my mind, like it or not, we had this conversation. In fact, the government was shut down in a public battle over how much money would be spent on the wall and border security. It ended with a deal that Congress passed and the president signed into law, thus determining the amount.

Congress clearly expressed its will not to spend more than $1.3 billion and to restrict how much of that money could go to barriers. Therefore, President Trump’s emergency order is clearly in opposition to the will of Congress.

Moreover, the broad principle of separation of powers in the Constitution delegates the power of the purse to Congress. This turns that principle on its head.

I, and many of my fellow members, called out President Obama for abusing executive authority. President Obama famously said that if Congress wouldn’t do what he wanted, he had his pen and his phone ready. That was wrong. Many of those voting now spent a good portion of their campaigns running ads against these words and actions of President Obama. They will and should be condemned for hypocrisy if they vote to allow this because they want the policy or want to stand with the president in a partisan fight.

Some are attempting to say that there isn’t a good analogy between President Obama’s orders or the Youngstown case. I disagree. Not only are the issues similar, but I think Youngstown Steel implications are even more profound in the case of emergency appropriations.

We spent the last two months debating how much money should be spent on a wall, and Congress came to a clear conclusion: $1.3 billion. Without question, the president’s order for more wall money contradicts the will of Congress and will, in all likelihood, be struck down by the Supreme Court.

In fact, I think the president’s own picks to the Supreme Court may rebuke him on this.

Regardless, I must vote how my principles dictate. My oath is to the Constitution, not to any man or political party. I stand with the president often, and I do so with a loud voice. Today, I think he’s wrong, not on policy, but in seeking to expand the powers of the presidency beyond their constitutional limits.

I understand his frustration. Dealing with Congress can be pretty difficult sometimes. But Congress appropriates money, and his only constitutional recourse, if he does not like the amount they appropriate, is to veto the bill.

541,Paul,Rand,theamericanconservative,"I am not in favor of boycotting Israel. Israel has been a good ally. I have traveled to Israel, and it was one of the best and most meaningful trips I have taken with my family. Standing at the Western Wall was special and powerful. Visiting old Jerusalem was incredible, and sailing on the sea of Galilee while a double rainbow glowed above us is something I will never forget. Israel is truly a unique and special place.

I also agree with both supporters of Israel and PLO leaders that a boycott has the potential to hurt both Israel and the Palestinians.

At the same time, I am concerned about what the role of Congress can and should be in this situation. I strongly oppose any legislation that attempts to ban boycotts or ban people who support boycotts from participating in our government or working for our government.

I firmly believe we have to be very careful what powers we exercise in government—and think through whether or not we would want them used if the situation were different.

We must be very, very careful here to not let our dislike for something cloud our judgment in our roles as legislators and what powers we grant to Congress and to government in general.

America is the land of freedom of expression, and the hallmark of a truly free country is that it allows expressions, speech, and actions that we do not agree with. By all means, opponents of boycotting Israel should be heard—but so should their opponents. Legislation to end boycotts goes against the very principles America was founded upon.

America is distinguished by dissent and dissenters. It was founded amidst a boycott of English tea. Abolitionists boycotted slave goods. Rosa Parks led the boycott against segregated busing.

The bus boycott lasted for 382 days in 1955 and 1956. The protest was set off by denying Rosa Parks a seat in the “white” section. Thousands of black men and women boycotted the Montgomery, Alabama, bus system in an attempt to end segregation.

It was their right, and the right of those from Ralph Abernathy to E.D. Nixon to Martin Luther King, to lead these protests.

But throughout the more than year-long protest, the homes of Dr. King and Mr. Nixon were bombed. And on a single day in 1956, over 80 leaders of the protest were indicted on “conspiracy” charges in an attempt to stop the boycotts.

This was wrong, but we don’t fully understand the way the rule of law and our freedoms work if we think it was wrong because we agreed with their boycott.

It was wrong regardless of what was being protested and what was being boycotted. The law shouldn’t be used to shut down protests or boycotts, no matter what the dispute involves.

Courts have ruled on this as well, notably in NAACP v Claiborne Hardware Co. The court held that the economic boycott of white-owned businesses by blacks was entitled to First Amendment protection, as should be the case. It argued that a “non-violent, politically motivated boycott” was political speech and protected. I agree fully.

Whether or not to support a boycott depends on the merits of the argument. Whether or not to allow boycotts should be independent of the merits of the boycott. The First Amendment is about speech you like and speech you don’t like. If anything, it is more about protecting unpopular speech or the speech of minorities, whether they be a minority by the color of their skin or the shade of their ideology.

Let’s hope calmer heads prevail. Let’s hope Congress votes against limiting boycotts or free speech of any kind.

542,Paul,Rand,needtoknow,"Section 230 of the Communications Act of 1934 gives the tech giants immunity from lawsuits against what individuals post on their websites as the companies are supposed to act as neutral platforms. However, the tech giants have been censoring those who politically oppose them, and should be treated as publishers instead of neutral platforms. Republican US Representative Louie Gohmert is pushing legislation that will remove the liability protections and will allow lawsuits to be filed against them for their bias.

Rep. Louie Gohmert pushed legislation on Thursday that will remove liability protections from the liberal tech giants. The bill will force the tech giants to pay for their biased campaign against their political opponents.

Rep. Louie Gohmert: “It is time for social media companies to be liable for any biased and unethical impropriety of their employees as any other media company. If these companies want to continue to act like a biased medium and publish their own agendas to the detriment of others, they need to be held accountable.”

As The Gateway Pundit reported earlier…

It’s no secret that the Silicon Valley tech giants discriminate against conservatives and conservative content.

Facebook has been shutting down traffic to conservative websites since the 2016 election.

The Gateway Pundit spoke earlier with two of the top conservative publishers in America.

Floyd Brown is a conservative author, speaker and media commentator. In 2008 Floyd launched Western Journal which quickly became one of the top conservative websites in America. By 2016 Floyd’s organization of Western Journal and other conservative websites under his umbrella had more than a billion page views. Since 2016 Floyd’s organization lost 75% of its Facebook traffic.

Likewise, we spoke with Jared Vallorani from Klicked Media. Jared traveled to Washington DC with The Gateway Pundit and website owners at 100%FedUp in June to discuss Facebook targeting against conservative publishers with Republican lawmakers. Jared told The Gateway Pundit his organization Klicked Media, which hosts over 60 conservative websites, lost 400 million page views from Facebook in the last six months if you compare the traffic to a year ago. Jared said, “We lost 70% to 80% of our traffic if you compare January to May 2017 vs Jan to May 2018.”

If you combine the total number of page-views lost by just these two conservative online publishers you are looking at a loss of over 1.5 billion page-views from Facebook in one year.

These are numbers from just two of the top conservative publishers in America. This does not include the thousands of other conservative publishers across the country who lost all of their traffic coming from Facebook. Here at The Gateway Pundit our Facebook traffic has been effectively eliminated after we were ranked as the 4th most influential conservative publisher in the 2016 election.

Facebook has also deleted prominent conservatives completely from their platform. Alex Jones, Infowars, Laura Loomer, Gavin McInnes, triple-amputee veteran Brian Kolfage and Roger Stone have lost their pages in the last year.

The fact that Facebook is targeting conservative publishers should not be a surprise to Gateway Pundit readers.

We have been reporting on this for several months now. In July we released a study where we looked at several top conservative websites and discovered that the publishers had lost an average of 93% of their Facebook traffic.

On Thursday Congressman Gohmert pushed legislation that targets the liberal bias at the tech giants.

Via Congressman Gohmert’s webpage:

Rep. Louie Gohmert (TX-01) released the following statement on his proposed bill, H.R.7363, that amends section 230 of the Communications Act of 1934: “Social media companies like Facebook, Twitter, and Google are now among the largest and most powerful companies in the world. More and more people are turning to a social media platform for news than ever before, arguably making these companies more powerful than traditional media outlets. Yet, social media companies enjoy special legal protections under Section 230 of the Communications Act of 1934, protections not shared by other media. Instead of acting like the neutral platforms they claim to be in order obtain their immunity, these companies have turned Section 230 into a license to potentially defraud and defame with impunity.” “Representatives of social media companies have testified in Congressional hearings that they do not discriminate against or filter out conservative voices on their platforms. But for all their reassurances, the disturbing trend continues unabated. Employees from some of these companies have communicated their disgust for conservatives and discussed ways to use social media platforms and algorithms to silence and prevent income to conservatives.” “In one hearing, one of the internet social media executives indicated a desire to be treated like Fox News. Fox News does not have their immunity and this bill will fulfill that unwitting request. Since there still appears to be no sincere effort to stop this disconcerting behavior, it is time for social media companies to be liable for any biased and unethical impropriety of their employees as any other media company. If these companies want to continue to act like a biased medium and publish their own agendas to the detriment of others, they need to be held accountable.”

543,Paul,Rand,townhall,"The brutal murder of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi has opened a window into the world of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and reminded us that there are many places in the world where disagreeing with your government is a death sentence.

I break with the administration on their response to this killing for many reasons. If Saudi Arabia is not held accountable for the barbaric murder of Khashoggi, what will it mean for the fate of other dissidents held in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere who are being held without trial? What message does it send to kingdoms and dictatorships around the region and the world that America considers its defense sales paramount to its stand for human rights?

What will it mean for Ali al-Nimr, the nephew of Nimr al-Nimr, the Shia sheik executed by the Saudis in 2016?

Ali al-Nimr was sentenced to death in Saudi Arabia after being arrested for attending a pro-democracy rally when he was 17. Imagine this — your teenage son or daughter in the place of this boy.

Ali al-Nimr was tortured, denied necessary access to his lawyer, and had a closed “trial.” It has been reported that his confession to false charges was coerced, and he now faces crucifixion and beheading. His mother has written of the damage done to her son by the beatings she could clearly see had taken place in prison, saying Ali “didn’t need to tell me what had happened because his face, hands, feet and body spoke on his behalf.”

What kind of regime does this? What kind of regime are we supporting, while turning a blind eye to this and the hundreds of other dissidents jailed and killed without a real justice system?

Saudi Arabia has added to their human rights abuses with their new “anti-terrorism” law, which is being used to justify torture and killings of dissidents. Using social media to criticize the state is now “terrorism” in Saudi Arabia.

Saudi Arabia is not “liberalizing.” It is not opening, changing, or modernizing in anything other than superficial ways. Additionally, it continues its blockade and war in Yemen, which has killed tens of thousands of lives, left millions near starvation, and threatens an entire nation’s population.

Why do we not act? The stated reason is our “relationship” with the Saudis, which boils down to two things — oil and defense contracts.

How much oil and how many defense contracts justify turning a blind eye to the actions of the Saudis? How many dissidents will we allow to be held without trial, tortured, or killed? How many more people need to die at their hands — and ours — in Yemen?

I stand with those who believe we shouldn’t sell arms to the Saudis unless they change their behavior. We are aiding and abetting this behavior. I’ll work once again to cut off the sales of arms to them and will continue to press for other measures to pressure them into change.

There are those who believe some “sanctions” on the people who killed Khashoggi is a good response. I disagree. It is inadequate and misguided. Do you think anyone in power in Saudi Arabia cares if their underlings are sanctioned? No.

Also, stopping arms sales is a more proportionate response. Sanctions that end all trade with Saudi Arabia might produce more global turmoil than we bargained for.

We must take real action to force real change, and that starts with arms sales and aid in the Yemen war. I will look for every opportunity to fight this battle in Congress.",1,https://townhall.com/capitol-voices/senatorrandpaul/2018/11/29/dangers-to-dissidents-n2536687
544,Paul,Rand,theatlantic,"News reports from 2013 stated that the Saudis offered more than 1,200 death-row inmates a pardon and a monthly stipend for their families to go fight the Syrian government.

In 2009, U.S. officials said Saudi Arabia was the “most significant source of funding to Sunni terrorist groups worldwide.” And in 2014, those same officials wrote that Qatar and Saudi Arabia were “providing clandestine financial and logistic support to [the Islamic State] and other radical Sunni groups.”

So why is America selling arms to a country that has supported terror, has a poor human-rights record, and has waged a reckless war in Yemen?

As they say, follow the money. But no amount of oil business or arms deals justifies our collusion with a regime that sponsors jihadism around the world.

Furthermore, if America is not at war with Yemen—which, technically, we are not—why are we enabling Saudi Arabia to prosecute a war that has killed tens of thousands and left 8 million more “on the brink of famine,” according to The Washington Post? I’m not just talking about bombs being dropped on innocent civilians that bear the words “Made in the U.S.A.” Without American intelligence, logistics, training, and equipment, the Saudi war effort would have fallen apart long ago.

I have spoken out loudly on this for some time, and I’ve also introduced legislation to halt U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia. I have been deeply disappointed with those of my colleagues in Congress who don’t seem to care that Yemenis are being massacred by U.S.-backed-and-armed Saudis.

But I’m giving them another chance. A chance to stand up to Saudi Arabia and say, “America will not tolerate these heinous acts.”

This week, I intend to introduce another measure to cut all funding, training, advising, and any other coordination to and with the military of Saudi Arabia until the journalist Jamal Khashoggi is returned alive.

546,Paul,Rand,liveaction,"Contrary to popular belief, taxpayer dollars do fund abortion at various abortion providers, including Planned Parenthood. And on August 16, 2018, Senator Rand Paul (R-Ky.) introduced an amendment to remedy that. In a press release, Paul’s office noted that the amendment was proposed to “H.R. 6157, the Senate appropriations package for Defense, Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education.” It reportedly “contains the same language preventing such spending as the FY 2019 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education funding bill that passed the U.S. House Appropriations Committee in July.” With this amendment, providers that do not commit abortions would still be eligible “to receive federal funding for women’s health services.”

Unfortunately, the Senate voted it down on August 23rd, with 45 voting in favor of the amendment, and 48 opposed — including, unsurprisingly, GOP Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), who are known to vote solidly pro-abortion. According to Townhall.com, Senator Paul gave an impassioned speech on the Senate floor regarding taxpayer funding of Planned Parenthood, the nation’s largest abortion business:

“Planned Parenthood ends the lives of 320,000 babies each year, that’s about 900 babies every day,” Paul emphasized in his speech on the Senate floor. “Planned Parenthood received over 400 million dollars of taxpayer money, the government with a wink and a nod tells us that Planned Parenthood doesn’t spend the money on abortions but everybody knows that the taxpayers are really cross-subsidizing Planned Parenthood’s abortion mills.”

Sen. Paul is exactly right. Here’s an explanation about how American taxpayer dollars fund abortion:

Senator Paul has attempted to defund Planned Parenthood in the past and also cosponsored the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. He has also attempted to extend protections for preborn human beings under the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution through the Life at Conception Act. Paul stated in his press release, “One of the top priorities for a Republican Congress that professes pro-life values on the campaign trail should be to stop taxpayer funding for abortion providers. This is our chance to turn our words into action, stand up for the sanctity of life, and speak out for the most innocent among us that have no voice.”

Paul Pro-Life Amendment to Senate Appropriations Package – August 2018 by Senator Rand Paul on Scribd

The Trump administration has also made moves to attempt to cut funding to abortion providers, including Planned Parenthood, through the introduction of the Protect Life Act as part of Title X family planning funding requirements. As previously reported by Live Action News’ Carole Novielli, “Any organization that receives family planning funds will also be required to keep facilities where abortions are committed separate from facilities where family planning care is provided.” In addition, as Cassy Fiano-Chesser noted, “Title X providers will also need to provide documentation to prove they are complying with state laws regarding the reporting of child abuse — something Planned Parenthood is known to have a problem with.”

548,Paul,Rand,theatlantic,"But both men persisted. Despite the Cold War atmosphere, rampant mistrust, and fearmongering on both sides, the leaders engaged each other. Ultimately, multiple agreements were hammered out, including the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty and the START treaty. Over a four-year period, the former eliminated nearly 2,700 missiles.

Over the years, though, agreements with Russia to reduce nuclear arms have not followed a straight path of success. Shortly after the 9/11 attacks, George W. Bush announced his intention to withdraw from the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty. Russian President Vladimir Putin responded by announcing that the INF Treaty might no longer be in Russia’s interests. Russia had ratified START II in 2000 but pulled out of the treaty after the U.S. withdrew from the ABM Treaty.

Most recently, New START took effect in 2011. In addition to placing a cap of 1,550 on deployed strategic nuclear warheads, a nearly three-quarter drop from START, New START also cut in half the allowable number of strategic nuclear-delivery vehicles, such as missile launchers and heavy bombers.

New START expires in 2021. If either side allows it to simply sunset, it will be the first time in several decades that a nuclear-arms-reduction treaty between the U.S. and Russia lapses.

As our hour was coming to an end, I asked Gorbachev whether he had any words of wisdom to improve our current dialogue. “Bring the conversation back to nuclear-arms reductions,” he said. “Encourage both sides to restart talk of renewing the START and INF treaties.”

That echoed his public call last year:

If the INF treaty could be saved, it would be a powerful signal for the whole world that the biggest nuclear powers understand their responsibility and take their obligations seriously.

Gorbachev argued then, as he did in our meeting, for a summit between President Donald Trump and Putin to discuss nuclear-arms control.

In my meetings with the foreign-affairs committees in Russia’s upper house, the Federation Council, and lower house, the State Duma, legislators also expressed an interest in holding formal talks to renew New START and continue the INF Treaty. I have invited members of both foreign-affairs committees to Congress this fall to continue these discussions. It is my hope that Democrats who have previously been supportive of nuclear-arms reductions will join in these meetings.

On the long flight home from Russia, as I was reading Eric Metaxas’s book Martin Luther, I realized that great challenges to orthodoxy are rare but necessary at times to right great wrongs or prevent great tragedy. I, for one, am thankful that Reagan and Gorbachev defied orthodoxy to cut stockpiles of nuclear weapons and reduce the tension between our countries. I hope thoughtful minds will prevail in our current standoff with Russia, and embrace the dialogue necessary to further reduce the potential for the terrible, world-altering catastrophe that a war between nuclear powers could bring.",1,https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/08/the-us-must-engage-with-russia/567646/

550,Paul,Rand,latimes,"One year ago this month, Americans learned that their government was engaged in secret dragnet surveillance, which contradicted years of assurances to the contrary from senior government officials and intelligence leaders.

On this anniversary, it is more important than ever to let Congress and the administration know that Americans will reject half-measures that could still allow the government to collect millions of Americans’ records without any individual suspicion or evidence of wrongdoing.

It is time to end the dragnet — and to affirm that we can keep our nation secure without trampling on and abandoning Americans’ constitutional rights.

For years, in both statements to the public and open testimony before the House and Senate, senior government officials claimed that domestic surveillance was narrow in focus and limited in scope. But in June 2013, Americans learned through leaked classified documents that these claims bore little resemblance to reality. In fact, the NSA has been relying on a secret interpretation of the USA Patriot Act to vacuum up the phone records of millions of law-abiding citizens. Under a separate program, intelligence agencies are using a loophole in the law to read some Americans’ emails without ever getting a warrant.

Advertisement

Dragnet surveillance was approved by a secret court that normally hears only the government’s side of major cases. It had been debated only in a few secret congressional committee hearings, and many members of Congress were entirely unaware it. When laws like the Patriot Act were reauthorized, a vocal minority of senators and representatives — including the three of us — objected, but the secrecy surrounding these programs made it difficult to mobilize public support.

And yet, it was inevitable that mass surveillance and warrantless searches would eventually be exposed. When the plain text of the law differs so dramatically from how it is interpreted and applied, in effect creating a body of secret law, it simply isn’t sustainable. So when the programs’ existence became public last summer, huge numbers of Americans were justifiably stunned and angry at how they had been misled and by the degree to which their privacy rights had been routinely violated. Inflated claims about the program’s value have burst under public scrutiny, and there is now a groundswell of public support for reform.

Benjamin Franklin once warned that a society that trades essential liberties for short-term security risks losing both. That is still true today, and even the staunchest defenders of mass surveillance concede that reforms are inevitable.

The debate over exactly what reforms should be made is likely to continue for at least the next few years as Americans continue to learn about the scale of ongoing government surveillance activities. As an initial step, we have worked with our colleagues in the House and Senate to build support for a package of real and meaningful changes to the law that would promote the restoration of Americans’ constitutional rights and freedoms, while protecting national security.

Advertisement

This package of reforms includes overhauling domestic surveillance laws to ban the bulk collection of Americans’ personal information, and closing the loophole that allows intelligence agencies to deliberately read Americans’ emails without a warrant. It includes reshaping the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court by installing an advocate who can argue for Americans’ constitutional rights when the court is considering major cases, and by requiring that significant interpretations of U.S. law and the Constitution be made public. And it would strengthen and clarify the government’s authority to obtain individual records quickly in genuine emergency situations.

These reforms would erect safeguards against the further erosion of our right to privacy, and ensure greater transparency and openness.

We are encouraged by the broad bipartisan support that this package of reforms has received and by the endorsements from both privacy advocates and business leaders. Accordingly, we are disappointed by the House of Representatives’ recent vote to approve a revised version of the USA Freedom Act, with nearly all of the essential reforms either watered down or removed.

It is even more disappointing, although not surprising, that some of the same officials who were responsible for conducting dragnet surveillance and misleading the public about it are now working to make sure that any attempt at reform legislation is as limited as possible.

Advertisement

Although the bill approved by the House is intended to end bulk collection, we are not at all confident that it would actually do so. The bill would require the government to use a “selection term” to secretly collect records, but the definition of “selection term” is left vague enough that it could be used to collect all of the phone records in a particular area code or all of the credit card records from a particular state. Meanwhile, the bill abandons nearly all of the other reforms contained in the Senate version of the USA Freedom Act, while renewing controversial provisions of the Patriot Act for nearly three more years.

This is clearly not the meaningful reform that Americans have demanded, so we will vigorously oppose this bill in its current form and continue to push for real changes to the law. This firm commitment to both liberty and security is what Americans — including the dedicated men and women who work at our nation’s intelligence agencies — deserve. We will not settle for less.

Whether or not to expand NATO is a question that deserves debate. Would it help or hurt U.S. national security?

Does adding countries such as Albania and Montenegro increase our security or ensnare us in possible regional disputes? Are we willing to risk war with Russia by including countries that already are mired in military conflict with Russia?

To understand what NATO expansion does to our relations with Russia, one must at least be aware of Russia’s perspective. Such awareness does not mean we agree with their point of view, but rather that we are aware our actions lead to reactions, and that NATO expansion does not occur in a vacuum.

We once had robust and thoughtful debate in our country over diplomacy and our desire to avoid war. Both parties now tend to shake their fists and declare to our adversaries: “Take this sanction.” “Take this expansion of NATO.” “Take this travel restriction” — under the misguided notion our unilateral actions will lead to capitulation.

Instead, we’ve often seen rising tensions, increased nationalism and a ratcheting up of a Cold War-like fever.

There was a time when many cautioned against reckless expansion.

OUR VIEW: Donald Trump's tirades weaken NATO and please Vladimir Putin

Perhaps the most famous diplomat of the last century, George Kennan, wrote that NATO expansion would be a “fateful error” that would “inflame the nationalistic, anti-Western and militaristic tendencies in Russian opinion” and “restore the atmosphere of the cold war to East-West relations.”

Similarly, Daniel L. Davis, retired lieutenant colonel with Defense Priorities, said, “Extending NATO membership to Georgia — or Ukraine, as others advocate — in no way strengthens U.S. security, but rather unequivocally increases America’s strategic risk.”

I prefer we think of our interests first, and that the U.S. Senate return to being a deliberative body on foreign policy, where ideas are considered, and dissent is heard and debated.

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., serves on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He was one of two senators who opposed Tuesday’s nonbinding motion to support and expand NATO.

""Capitol Police have issued an arrest warrant for a man who threatened to kill me and chop up my family with an ax. It's just horrendous that we have to deal with things like this,"" Paul told WHAS-TV. The man who threatened him made the calls into Paul's Bowling Green office.

Capitol Police declined to comment on the arrest or provide additional details Monday as the investigation into the Paul family murder threats is still ongoing, the Courier-Journal first reported.

Last November, the senator was attacked on his own lawn by 58-year-old neighbor Rene Boucher. Paul suffered five rib fractures after he was tackled, and this week his federal attorneys appealed the 30-day jail sentence Boucher received. Paul is seeking to increase Boucher's criminal jail sentence as well as funds for medical and attorney costs.

556,Paul,Rand,theamericanconservative,"In the near future, Congress will debate a new Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF). I use the word “debate” lightly. So far, no hearings have been scheduled, and no testimony is likely to be heard unless something changes. That’s a shame, because this is a serious matter, and this is a deeply flawed AUMF.

For some time now, Congress has abdicated its responsibility to declare war. The status quo is that we are at war anywhere and anytime the president says so.

So Congress—in a very Congress way of doing things—has a “solution.” Instead of reclaiming its constitutional authority, it instead intends to codify the unacceptable, unconstitutional status quo.

It is clear upon reading the AUMF, put forward by Senators Tim Kaine and Bob Corker, that it gives nearly unlimited power to this or any other president to be at war whenever he or she wants, with minimal justification and no prior specific authority.

That isn’t an AUMF. That isn’t Congress reclaiming its constitutional duties. That’s a complete rewriting of the role of the executive and of the constitutional separation of powers.

The new Kaine/Corker AUMF declares war on at least the following places and people: the Taliban, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, ISIS anywhere, al-Shabaab in Somalia and elsewhere, al-Qaeda in Syria, al-Nusra in Syria, the Haqqani network in Pakistan and Afghanistan, al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, in Niger, Algeria, Libya, and Nigeria, and associated forces (as defined by the president) around the globe.

That is simply breathtaking. Previous AUMFs have never included “associated forces,” and with good reason. Yet the Kaine/Corker AUMF not only codifies military action against those associated forces, but by conservative estimates authorizes war in over 20 nations.

Should Congress declare war? Absolutely. Are there places we will need to be at war? Yes. Should we be having this debate at this time? Yes, we should. But we must have a full debate, with all sides considered, and with the constitutional power of every branch of government clearly in mind.

It is indisputably clear that the authority given to the executive under the AUMF passed after 9/11 has become too broad and needs updating. But this Kaine/Corker AUMF is not the answer. Simply put, it provides even more expansive war-making authority to the executive branch than the status quo.

If this AUMF is passed, Congress will have chosen to make itself irrelevant on the issue of war.

Currently, use of force without congressional authority is limited by the War Powers Act to national emergency or imminent attack. No more, under this AUMF.

Kaine/Corker would forever allow the executive unlimited latitude in determining war, and would leave Congress debating such action after forces have already been committed.

Under this bill, Congress could only disapprove of war, turning the Constitution on its head. Even worse, any resolution of disapproval could be vetoed, meaning two thirds of Congress would need to disapprove of a war, rather than a majority to approve of one. That’s a huge, unwise, and unconstitutional change.

The Founders left the power to make war in the legislature on purpose and with good reason. They recognized that the executive branch is most prone to war. The Kaine/Corker AUMF would completely abdicate Congress’s power under Article I.

Handing war-making power from Congress to the executive branch is not an exercise in congressional power. It is the final and full abandonment of that power. It is wrong, it is unconstitutional, and it should be stopped.

America holds its breath and awaits justice for George Floyd. Because #JusticeMatters

As Minneapolis awaits a verdict in the #DerekChauvin trial, residents are on tenterhooks. Without a conviction for George Floyd's death some worry, ""It's going to be Rodney King all over again, except in Minneapolis and 10 times worse.” wsj.com/articles/minne…

As we await the verdict, we send love to the family, friends, and community of George Floyd. His life mattered and he should still be here.

Awaiting a verdict shouldn't mean awaiting change to what is so clearly broken. That’s why we’ve just donated $10k to @NAACPmpls to help fight systemic racism. We stand with our Black employees, customers, partners, and community.

BREAKING: A verdict has been reached in the trial of Derek Chauvin. It will be read between 4:30 and 5 pm ET.

@mmpadellan 🙏 ⚖️ 🙏 For George Floyd. For America. For the World. (pictures from Germany after the death of George Floyd)

America holds its breath and awaits justice for George Floyd. Because #JusticeMatters

Pres. Joe called the Floyd family to offer support & prayers. “They’re a good family, calling for peace and tranquility no matter what the verdict.. I’m praying the verdict is the right verdict. It’s overwhelming in my view. I wouldn’t say that unless the jury was sequestered.”

Prosecutor: ""You were told...that Mr. Floyd died because his heart was too big. You heard that testimony. Now, having seen all the evidence, having heard all the evidence, you know the truth."" ""The reason George Floyd is dead is because Mr. Chauvin's heart was too small.""

Let’s be clear – a guilty verdict is not what George Floyd’s family wants. They want George to be alive today. A guilty verdict is not what the Black community wants. We want our lives not to be the subject of debate and deliberation.

In closing arguments Chauvin’s argument why he couldn’t take his knee off George Floyd is because there was a crowd of some Black people. Implying you never know what they will do. Here is an image of a cop teaming up with the far-right to arrest a leftist in Portland.

Hundreds of high school students staged a walkout and gathered in downtown Minneapolis to protest the deaths of Daunte Wright and George Floyd and chant “National Guard go home.” At least 600 young people in the the crowd by 2:45. Speakers and participants were 16, 17 years old.

Thousands of people are still incarcerated on marijuana charges

Happy 4/20! I’d like to highlight the racial disparities that exist when it comes to arrests made for marijuana possession, the racial disparities in “legal” weed businesses, and the complete waste of pursuing marijuana use/possession as a crime.

It’s time for a new #VisionForJustice. It’s time to federally decriminalize marijuana. It’s time for the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act. Celebrate 4/20 by texting MOREACT to 40649 to tell your representatives to legalize marijuana. Narration: @BKBMG

Today is #420day. Black and white people use marijuana at similar rates, but: ▪️ Black people almost 4X more likely to be arrested ▪️ POC = 94% arrests in NYC in 2020 ▪️ Convictions cut access to jobs, housing ▪️ Disparities persist in states after legalization (@ACLU)

Notice that all around the country, politicians, law makers, law enforcement, the media, white supremacist militia groups, are all in unison THREATENING Black ppl ahead of this Chauvin verdict? We keep repeatedly hearing how Black ppl BETTER NOT react to tyranny. Im not scared

Prosecutor: ""You were told...that Mr. Floyd died because his heart was too big. You heard that testimony. Now, having seen all the evidence, having heard all the evidence, you know the truth."" ""The reason George Floyd is dead is because Mr. Chauvin's heart was too small.""

BLM-Antifa in Portland promises violence “no matter what the verdict is” in the Chauvin trial. This should make it clear that these months of riots have never been about justice but rather is an excuse to be violent & destructive without consequence. #PortlandRiots

In closing arguments Chauvin’s argument why he couldn’t take his knee off George Floyd is because there was a crowd of some Black people. Implying you never know what they will do. Here is an image of a cop teaming up with the far-right to arrest a leftist in Portland.

Editor’s Note: Rand Paul is a US senator from Kentucky. He serves on the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. The views expressed in this commentary are his own.

(CNN) —

Just over two weeks ago, at a rally in Ohio, President Trump reiterated his long-held belief that the United States should get out of the Syrian civil war, that it was not in our national interest. We should bring our troops home where they “belong,” as he stated clearly.

This was not surprising, since there are dozens of on-the-record statements from the President over the years along these lines, including giving this same advice to his predecessor, President Obama.

Courtesy Office of Rand Paul Rand Paul

I agreed with President Trump in 2013. I agreed with him two weeks ago. In fact, I led the fight in 2013 to stop President Obama from involving us more in Syria, and I’ve been saying ever since that we have no mission there.

Yet, last week, we involved ourselves further, bombing multiple targets against the government of Syria. There was no authorization for this strike from Congress, nor one for any involvement in this civil war, and no long-term military mission to be achieved by it. Those facts are increasingly evident in our foreign policy around the world, and it is something we should all be paying more attention to.

In Libya, President Obama bombed on the side of rebels seeking the ouster of a dictator. He did it without congressional authorization and without a clear military mission. Libya is now a mess, a cesspool of radical, violent Islam.

In Afghanistan, we went in after 9/11 with a mission I supported. But that mission ended over a decade ago, and we are still there. Secretary of State nominee Mike Pompeo, in statements to me last week, reiterated that the administration does not “see a military solution to the war in Afghanistan,” instead pointing to President Trump’s previous comments that “military power alone will not bring peace to Afghanistan” but should be used to help bring about a political solution. Yet our authorization for being there is out of date, and nearly as old as the young men and women being sent there.

Our foreign policy is a mess, and it needs to get smarter and better, fast.

One of the things I liked most about President Trump when he ran for office was that he articulated a clearly different foreign policy. He had opposed the Iraq war. He opposed intervention in Libya and Syria, and he wanted to come home from Afghanistan.

Yet, in just over a year, he is now appointing myopic foreign policy advisers who refuse to learn the lessons of these wars and our recent history. John Bolton and Mike Pompeo are not the advisers needed for a president who wants fewer wars.

President Trump is listening far too much to the foreign policy swamp that he fought against. Our hawkish, neoconservative foreign policy and wars of the last 17 years have brought us trillions of dollars in debt and made us less safe. We need to rebuild here, not there. We need to rebuild our military, not overuse it policing the world and nation-building.

President Trump knew it when he was running for office. He even knew it two weeks ago when he instructed his foreign policy team to get out of Syria. But he’s listened to some bad advice from the same people who created many of these messes in the first place.

Mr. President, trust your gut. Go with what you know to be true. The Afghanistan war should be over; our troops should leave. The Syrian civil war never should have been our fight. Let’s end our involvement.

We can and must fight against terrorism when it rears its ugly head. We can do that in a smarter, constitutional way, and President Trump can lead our country in a new direction, as he seems to want to do. But he’ll have to stop listening to the people who caused so many problems and so much death and destruction over the past 17 years if he wants to make his goals reality.",1,https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/17/opinions/trump-should-trust-his-gut-on-syria-opinion-paul/index.html
559,Paul,Rand,threadreaderapp,"The President indicates that Saudi Arabia is the lesser two evils compared to Iran and so the US won’t punish Saudi Arabia for the brutal killing and dismemberment of a dissident journalist in their consulate. I disagree.

We should, at the very least, NOT reward Saudi Arabia with our sophisticated armaments that they in turn use to bomb civilians.

I’m pretty sure this statement is Saudi Arabia First, not America First. I’m also pretty sure John Bolton wrote it.",1,https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/976909053870911488.html
560,Paul,Rand,theamericanconservative,"Since President Trump took office, our country finally seems to be heading in the right direction. In just the past year, the American people have seen enormous tax cuts, more judges appointed who take the Constitution seriously, relief from the massive regulatory state, and an economy rapidly gaining strength and offering greater opportunities for those seeking to turn their dreams into reality.

But when it comes to our place on the world stage, we are at a crossroads. We can continue to build on our recent successes by reaffirming America’s role as a trusted, powerful nation guided by principle. Or we can throw it all away by allowing neocon interventionists to infiltrate our leadership and make America the purveyor of destruction.

For decades, we have failed to bring about real peace thanks to a foreign policy guided by the idea that war and intervention are the answers. “Blow up and rebuild” has been the battle cry of those determined to keep us perpetually in conflict.

It was the battle cry of Hillary Clinton, who supported military intervention in Iraq, Syria, and Libya. I supported President Trump during his campaign because he advocated for less military intervention. He opposed the Iraq War. He acknowledged that nation-building doesn’t work. He understood the damage previous foreign policy missteps have caused, including helping to strengthen ISIS.

I want to continue making America great again. That won’t happen if we give power-hungry neocons the reins to our nation’s foreign policy.

People already distrust the CIA. So why on earth has this administration picked someone to run the Agency who was instrumental in running a place where people were tortured and then covered it up afterwards?

Multiple undisputed accounts have detailed how Gina Haspel not only ran a CIA “black site” in Thailand but also destroyed video evidence of torture.

The retraction of one anecdote from a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter doesn’t absolve her of wrongdoing and certainly doesn’t negate the rest of the facts, which remain the same. Those actions alone should preclude her from ever running the CIA.

Unfortunately, Haspel is just one of many potential neoconservatives being considered to serve in our country’s top leadership roles. The current CIA director and the president’s pick to become the next secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has defended torture in the past.

Further, he’s been a stalwart defender of the National Security Agency’s (NSA) unconstitutional spying programs and has even written in support of expanding the information government can collect.

I could not support appointing him as CIA director in 2017, and for those same reasons, I will oppose his nomination to be our chief diplomat now.

Just as troublesome are recent news reports that John Bolton is being considered for a senior administration position. Just recently, Bolton advocated for a preemptive strike against North Korea. If he had his way, our nation would be embroiled in dozens of armed conflicts in every corner of the world.

I want to be clear. This issue is much bigger than a simple disagreement over policy—and far more consequential. These are dangerous appointments.

Allowing the failed foreign policies of the past to have a place in this administration, and sanctioning the infiltration of our government by those who eagerly await the next opportunity for war, not only says we don’t learn from our mistakes, it will result in a world with far more enemies than opportunities for stability and peace.

If we are to avoid a future that is war-torn and mired in endless conflicts, we must do better than appointing these flawed nominees. I find them unacceptable, and I won’t support them. I hope the president will reconsider, too.

Dr. Rand Paul to Introduce ‘Audit the Fed’ as Amendment to Senate Banking Bill

WASHINGTON, D.C. – With the U.S. Senate expected to vote on S. 2155, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, this week, U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) today announced he will introduce his “Audit the Fed” bill, which would authorize the first-ever thorough audit of the Federal Reserve System, as an amendment to the financial reform legislation.

“While we have made great strides in reviving our economy through curbing overzealous regulation and cutting taxes, lasting prosperity will escape us if we do not hold the enabler of big government and our astronomical national debt accountable. It’s time for the Senate to side with the American people by removing the shackles on congressional oversight and lifting the Fed’s veil of secrecy. It’s time for us to pass Audit the Fed,” said Dr. Paul.

In January 2017, Dr. Paul reintroduced the Federal Reserve Transparency Act (S. 16), widely known as “Audit the Fed,” to prevent the Federal Reserve from concealing vital information on its operations from Congress. A year earlier, a bipartisan Senate majority voted 53-44 in support of Audit the Fed, falling just short of invoking cloture.

Audit the Fed would require the nonpartisan, independent Government Accountability Office (GAO) to conduct a thorough audit of the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors and reserve banks within one year of the bill’s passage and to report back to Congress within 90 days of completing the audit.

The legislation would amend section 714b of Title 31 of the U.S. Code to allow the GAO to fully audit:",1,https://www.paul.senate.gov/news/dr-rand-paul-introduce-%E2%80%98audit-fed%E2%80%99-amendment-senate-banking-bill

564,Paul,Rand,legalinsurrection,"On Thursday, Sen. Rand Paul succeeded in blocking a vote on the so-called Budget Deal (which we discussed thusly Wednesday). In so doing, the federal government shut down at 12:01 AM.

An hour and a half later, the Senate invoked cloture, voted on the huge spending deal reached by both parties Wednesday evening, passing the bill with a vote of 71-28 (without bothering to debate it). Just before dawn it passed the House and heads to Trump for signature.

Because of the egregious amount of money the bill spends, Paul objected to the deal. The deal includes $1 trillion in spending, raising federal government spending caps for the next two years.

Paul refused to acquiesce and allow the voting on the budget deal without a vote on his amendment which would cap and cut spending.

This debate could have been shortened and could have been finished by noon today had we been granted 15 minutes to have one amendment. — Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) February 9, 2018

The usual suspects are annoyed.

Politico reported:

The dispute will provoke a brief shutdown as midnight draws near, and Paul’s colleagues ganged up on him as they grew increasingly frustrated with a member of their own party. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) blamed Paul directly for “wasting everybody’s time.” Paul “will effectively shut down the federal government for no real reason,” Cornyn said. “I just ask him to reconsider what he is doing in shutting down the entire federal government.” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said Paul is waging his fight “probably to help Rand Paul.” And Cornyn, McConnell, Graham and Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) tried repeatedly to set up a vote before the shutdown deadline. Each time, Paul objected, much to Tillis’ frustration. “Do you want to be a senator that wants to make a point or you want to make a difference? You know what? I don’t see how points alone can make a change in America,” Tillis fumed on the Senate floor. “You can make a point all you want. But points are forgotten. There’s not a whole of history books about the great points of the American Senate.”

Paul rightly pointed out Republican hypocrisy on federal spending, noting that the same people voting to raise the debt ceiling for the next two years lambasted President Obama for wanting to do the same.

I’m so old, I remember Republicans touting cut, cap, and balance back in 2011, even if they don’t.

Which begs the question, why is Paul alone in calling attention to our runaway federal deficit?

Mike Lee stood with Paul, but only to criticize the binary choices parliamentary procedure creates:

After Paul withstood a barrage of criticism from his colleagues, the like-minded Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) came to the floor to defend him. He said individual senators are “left out of the process” and left with a binary choice of voting yes or no, with no alterations to legislation.

The legislation, all 700 pages of it were introduced at midnight Wednesday, leaving less than 48 hours to sort through the spending monstrosity. This is the exact same kind of governance Republicans complained about for 8 years: introduced hundreds of pages of legislation in the dead of night, leave little to no time to review said legislation, insist the legislation must be passed or else! Republicans might not be trotting out children, but they’re shamelessly using the military as a political prop in this battle.

Sen. Rand Paul: “I hope those who look at this bill, who actually truly do believe that debt is a problem, will consider saying ‘Enough is enough,’ and ‘I’m not voting for more debt.'” pic.twitter.com/wT4YQIVpJC — World News Tonight (@ABCWorldNews) February 9, 2018

Without fail, conservative governance at the federal level dies a publicly humiliating death when Republicans are in power.

The war of government is not, nor has it been in my lifetime, a war between dueling parties. It’s a constant, exhausting, and losing battle between the taxpayer and a finagling, self-interested, leach of a government. Unless there’s a clear adversary who can be used as a tool to obtain some political capital, principles fall by the wayside, if they ever truly existed.

When both parties are happy, they’re usually looting the Treasury. And that’s what this bill does. — Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) February 8, 2018

Barely more than a year in control of both houses and the oval office and Republicans have already sold old to big-spending and perpetual government glut. Disappointing is far from sufficient. Disgusting is more accurate.

565,Paul,Rand,washingtonexaminer,"No, that’s not a repeat you’re seeing on the news.

Congress really is about to vote on yet another continuing resolution – its fourth in a row since the fiscal year started. But you can ignore the legislative speak and just remember that “continuing resolution” is shorthand for “Congress didn’t do its job.”

This funding measure lumps together the spending for all 12 departments of the federal government into a huge bill and continues to fund them without reforming or eliminating any wasteful spending.

The powers that be say, ""Either vote to continue the deficit spending or shut the government down."" While I don’t want to shut down the federal government, I also don’t want to keep open a government that borrows a million dollars every minute.

This year, the government will borrow nearly a trillion dollars. The overall debt now exceeds $20 trillion and threatens our national security. We have already had one shutdown, and we are now a third of the way through our fiscal year with no real budget in sight.

When was the last time Congress passed all of their spending bills? 1997. Only four times in 41 years has Congress done its job. That’s absurd.

It’s also unsustainable and a reckless abandonment of our responsibility – one that threatens our national security and limits our economic potential.

Last year, David Walker, former Comptroller General of the United States, told the Senate Federal Spending Oversight Subcommittee that, ""Excessive levels of debt as a percentage of the economy can serve to reduce economic growth and job opportunities. It can also cause a ‘crisis of confidence’ in the U.S. dollar and much higher interest rates if the market ever decides that the federal government has lost control of its finances and is not willing to regain control over them.""

The nearly $300 billion in interest we pay on the debt alone could fund seven cabinet departments and multiple agencies — combined.

Governing by continuing resolution allows this debt to keep piling up with no end in sight, and it also cripples our chance to get government’s wasteful spending under control through regular review and serious oversight of how federal agencies are using your money.

Just this week, another reminder of the urgency of the situation hit the headlines when Politico reported that the Pentagon’s Defense Logistics Agency has “lost track of hundreds of millions” of taxpayer dollars, having “failed to properly document more than $800 million in construction projects.”

One can only imagine what the first-ever full-scale financial audit of the Department of Defense will uncover – even as politicians pour on the pressure of a shutdown to demand we approve more spending regardless. Under the House-passed continuing resolution, the Department of Defense would be the only area funded for a full year. While defending this nation is our top constitutional priority, we are not making our country stronger by breaking our budget rules time and again.

Over the years, my office has identified billions in wasted taxpayer funds, including more than $560 million of waste in our recent Festivus report, which featured stories such as the IRS failing to recover nearly $80 million in “unallowable expenses” to government contractors, and our government spending more than $200 million building roads in Afghanistan while our own infrastructure lags behind in repairs.

But instead of reining in such abuse across government through the regular appropriations process, we are expected to bust the caps, ignore any restraint, and keep making our situation worse.

I’m not going to take it anymore. Leadership says, “Take it or leave it. Either vote for more debt or shut down the government.""

I think there’s another way. That’s why I’ve introduced my Government Shutdown Prevention Act. My bill forces Congress to act or lose funding. If Congress doesn’t pass the individual appropriation bills as they are supposed to, government spending will be cut 1 percent.

It may not seem like much, but cutting 1 percent a year balances the budget in four years.

On Tuesday, my Federal Spending Oversight Subcommittee held a hearing entitled “Terrible, No Good, Very Bad Ways of Funding Government.”

I can’t think of a better way to describe out-of-control deficit spending, and I am urging the full committee to help stop this cycle and advance reform by voting on my legislation.

During Tuesday's hearing, Dr. Alice Rivlin, former director of the Office of Management and Budget and currently a senior fellow in Economic Studies at the Brookings Institution, thanked the subcommittee for calling “attention to the total breakdown of federal budgetary policy-making.” She went on to observe that she believed “this breakdown is a serious threat to our democracy and to America’s future prosperity.”

It’s high time someone says, “Enough is enough,” and fixes our terrible, no good, very bad budgetary process.

569,Paul,Rand,abovethelaw,"Despite the controversies that continue to dog his administration, when it comes to appointing federal judges, President Donald Trump is a veritable “Stable Genius.” Or, at the very least, he’s quietly effective — and maybe effective because he’s quiet. He might not tweet much about judicial nominations compared to other subjects, but President Trump is reshaping the federal judiciary — and now holds the record for the most federal appellate judges confirmed in the first year of a presidency.

But when it comes to staffing the executive branch, the Trump Administration is a bit… SAD. Of 626 key positions requiring Senate confirmation, just 241 have been filled with Senate-confirmed appointees.

Some of this is the fault of the administration, which hasn’t nominated anyone for 245 of the 626 posts (39 percent). But some is the fault of the Senate — which is certainly the case when it comes to U.S. Department of Justice nominations.

When you look at DOJ noms, you’ll see five important positions where the president has made a nomination but the Senate has failed to act. As of this writing (check the latest confirmations on the Senate website), the Department still needs the Senate to confirm leaders — in DOJ parlance, “Assistant Attorneys General” — for a quintet of crucial components: the Criminal Division, the National Security Division, the Civil Division, the Civil Rights Division, and the Environmental and National Resources Division. There are also about a dozen U.S. Attorney nominees still pending in the Senate.

The backlog is starting to attract attention. As former DOJ Inspector General Michael Bromwich told Carrie Johnson of NPR, “Vacancies impair the smooth and effective functioning of DOJ. It’s not a recipe for good government.” As former attorney general William Barr told Matt Zapotosky of the Washington Post, “To me, what’s happening is reprehensible…. This is unprecedented. Anyone who has worked in an administration knows how damaging it is.”

I spoke with two current Justice Department officials earlier this week, and they echoed these sentiments. “It’s frustrating and disruptive,” one of them said. “The acting leaders are doing a good job, but you always want to have your Senate-confirmed leaders in place. The acting heads can steer the ship, but they can’t make all the big, long-term decisions.”

“We are a year into the administration,” he pointed out, “and we still don’t have a chief of the National Security Division and the Criminal Division.”

Given the missions of these divisions — keeping Americans safe from crime and terrorism — this is a problem. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, confirmed by the Senate as an Obama nominee (U.S. Attorney for Maryland) and again as a Trump nominee (Deputy Attorney General), said the following in a recent public appearance about the Senate confirmation process [ UPDATE (1/11/2018, 2:06 p.m.): Rosenstein was actually appointed by President George W. Bush to serve as U.S. Attorney, but President Obama kept Rosenstein on the job — a testament to his stellar reputation and lack of partisanship — and Rosenstein ended up serving for all eight years of the Obama administration.]:

It takes too long to get through the process…. If people are unobjectionable, then there’s no excuse for this process being delayed. I see things like senators who are upset about something completely unrelated to our nominee, so they’re going to punish the nominees. These are people who are like you, in private businesses, who have agreed to set aside their private interests, in most cases to take pay cuts. It’s disruptive to their lives. They can’t make commitments to clients. They’re required to wait months and months and months, even though they’re ultimately going to get confirmed…. The process would be much better if we could find a quicker way to get to the conclusion.

Rosenstein gave a concrete example of how the delay is affecting the Department’s work and his own work in particular:

We have no Assistant Attorney General for the National Security Division. That division is responsible for protecting Americans from terrorism, our number one priority. Our nominee is a man with exceptional experience. His name is John Demers. He’s exceptionally experienced, he’s not partisan, he wants to do the right thing and do this job, and he has not been confirmed. There’s no explanation, no legitimate explanation, for why someone like that can’t get on the job…. There are only three officials in the Department of Justice who are authorized to sign Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) applications… the Attorney General, the Deputy Attorney General, and the Assistant Attorney General for National Security. Whoever is there, and lowest on the totem pole, spends a half hour of their day signing those [warrant applications]. The Attorney General did it from February through April, and I’ve been doing it from April through January. And when John gets there, I’m going to have an extra half hour every day.

This generated laughter from the audience. But kidding aside, I agree with Benjamin Wittes (no cheerleader for the Trump Administration) of Lawfare (the excellent national-security site): “It’s nuts that there’s no Senate confirmed leadership of the National Security Division at DOJ. Really.”

This is especially true in light of the lack of controversy over the nominee to lead the NSD. John Demers, currently Vice President and Assistant General Counsel at Boeing, boasts ample qualifications. The Harvard Law grad and former Supreme Court clerk has worked as corporate counsel (at Boeing), in Biglaw (at Ropes & Gray), and at the Department of Justice — as Deputy Assistant Attorney General for National Security, the division he would lead if confirmed. (Disclosure: John Demers and I clerked for the same judge, Judge Diarmuid F. O’Scannlain of the Ninth Circuit, and I consider John a friend.)

Who deserves blame for the DOJ delays? Some blame belongs to the Trump Administration, which focused its early efforts on judicial nominations, such as Justice Neil Gorsuch to SCOTUS, and could have been faster on executive-branch nominations. Demers, for example, was not officially nominated to lead the NSD until September.

Much of the blame belongs to Senate Democrats. They are using procedural roadblocks to stop or slow down many nominees that they don’t actually oppose, as explained by Carl Hulse of the New York Times:

Here is what is happening: Democrats are requiring that Republicans check all the procedural boxes on most nominees, even those they intend to eventually support. That requires the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, to request a formal “cloture” vote to move forward. An “intervening day” is then required to allow the cloture request to “ripen.” Next is a vote to impose cloture followed by 30 hours of “post-cloture” debate before a final vote. Democrats have refused to shorten the debate time — to “yield back,” in the parlance of the Senate — though in most cases there is little to debate…. Republicans calculate that at the current rate, it will take 11 years and four months to fill all possible Trump administration spots at an average of three and a half days spent considering each nominee.

Eleven years? Don’t expect this abuse of process to continue indefinitely. Republicans are already talking about “streamlining” the confirmation process to dispense with the 30 hours of “debate” (which isn’t actual debate, just the burning up of Senate floor time). If this happens, it would be similar to what happened with the filibuster and then the blue slip for nominees: both practices got abused, by both parties, and both practices got blown up. This is why senators can’t have nice things.

A second Department official I spoke with sees bad faith on the part of the Democrats. In his view, they are abusing the nominations process to do what they can’t do through legislation.

“The Democrats want to keep the DOJ crippled as long as they can,” a second DOJ official complained to me. “They figure that the weaker the Department leadership is, the more difficult it is for the administration to accomplish its objectives.”

“It’s very clear that the Dems are being slow,” he continued. “Why do we have to break filibusters to get confirmation of Engel, Francisco, and Brand?” (The nominees referenced by this official — Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel Steven Engel, Solicitor General Noel Francisco, and Associate Attorney General Rachel Brand — all took quite some time to confirm, despite impeccable credentials and uncontroversial backgrounds.)

The Democrats wouldn’t admit that they are dragging their feet on nominations to throw a wrench in the DOJ works — but Professor Rory Little displays more candor:

Perhaps this is better than the persons likely to be nominated? (His Shhhhh!) — Rory Little (@RoryLittle) January 2, 2018

What do the Democrats have to say for themselves? Senator Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) told the Washington Post, “Given that it is the fount of the judicial system and the sensitivity of its mission, there is no department that needs more scrutiny than DOJ. There is bipartisan opposition to many of the nominees due to the lack of independence that many of the nominees and appointees have demonstrated.”

But in some cases — many cases — there isn’t. The nomination of John Demers to lead the National Security Division, for example, has already been reported out of both the Judiciary and Intelligence Committees, without opposition. As noted by Betsy Woodruff of the Daily Beast, Demers is widely regarded as “unobjectionable,” and “people in the national security space were largely pleased and relieved that Trump nominated him for the influential post.”

Now, in fairness to the Democrats, the Republicans are far from blameless. During the Obama Administration, they too used a wide range of procedural tools and tricks to hold up numerous eminently qualified nominees — most (in)famously, Judge Merrick Garland and his nomination to the Supreme Court, but lots of lower-court and executive-branch nominees as well.

And also in fairness to the Democrats, some of the current obstruction of nominees comes from Republican members of the Senate. For example, Senator Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), infuriated over the DOJ’s new guidance on enforcing criminal laws against marijuana, has declared that he will “take all steps necessary, including holding DOJ nominees, until the Attorney General lives up to the commitment he made to me prior to his confirmation.”

On the Demers nomination, some of the opposition apparently emanates from a different Republican. As reported by the Daily Beast, Senator Rand Paul (R-Ky.) is holding up the Demers nomination over the controversial subject of reauthorizing Section 702 surveillance, aka NSA surveillance without a warrant.

This struck one of the DOJ officials I spoke with as… a bit rich. “The nomination of the head of the National Security Division is being blocked over his support for a provision that is vital for national security.”

But even if one opposes or has concerns about Section 702 surveillance, the best response for Congress is to reform or repeal Section 702 (which it’s currently in the process of doing). As John Demers explained at his Judiciary Committee hearing — sounding a bit like his former boss, the late Justice Antonin Scalia — if Congress has a problem with Section 702, then Congress should fix the problem with appropriate legislation. The DOJ and NSA will, of course, comply with congressional direction. This would be much better than indefinitely delaying the confirmation of a key national-security official who performs many important but uncontroversial duties, like approving FISA applications.

In other words, if Congress doesn’t like what the DOJ is up to, then Congress can and should pass laws directing the Department to act otherwise. For example, if Congress doesn’t like the DOJ’s approach to enforcing marijuana laws, then it should renew the Rohrabacher–Farr amendment, which prohibits the Justice Department from spending federal funds to interfere with the implementation of state medical cannabis laws (or Congress can even expand the prohibition to protect recreational cannabis). This would be a nice example of separation of powers at work, the legislature using its spending power or “power of the purse” to block unwanted action by the executive.

In the meantime, despite the challenges posed by partially filled leadership ranks, the women and men of the Justice Department continue their work in service of the American people.

“The attorney general and everyone here have been doing a good job of advancing Justice Department goals despite not having full leadership in place,” one DOJ official told me. “But once we do have that leadership, then we’ll be able to move much faster and more effectively.”

570,Paul,Rand,breitbart,"Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich slammed CNN’s Jake Tapper Sunday after Tapper cut off White House senior adviser Stephen Miller in the middle of an interview.

“It was very sad to see Jake Tapper, whose book on Afghanistan I really admire, be so condescending and unself aware with Stephen Miller,” Newt Gingrich tweeted Sunday morning.

It was very sad to see Jake Tapper, whose book on Afghanistan I really admire, be so condescending and unself aware with stephen miller — Newt Gingrich (@newtgingrich) January 7, 2018

Tapper interviewed Miller on Sunday’s episode of CNN’s State of the Union, where the two sparred over Michael Wolff’s book Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House.

Things escalated when Miller tried to defend President Donald Trump in the interview and blasted CNN’s critical coverage of the president.

When asked whether he thought Trump’s tweets show the president’s stability, Miller said, “I think in the toxic environment that you’ve created here, and CNN and cable news, which is a real crisis of legitimacy for your network … the president’s tweets absolutely reaffirm the plainspoken truth,” Miller said.

Tapper did not hide his displeasure with Miller, claiming that the senior White House adviser only cared about pleasing Trump.

“I get it. There’s one viewer that you care about right now, and you’re being obsequious and you’re being a factotum in order to please him, OK,” Tapper told Miller.

“And I think I’ve wasted enough of my viewers’ time. Thank you, Stephen,” he said, abruptly cutting off the senior White House adviser.

President Trump fired off a tweet shortly after the interview mocking Tapper as a “CNN flunky” who “got destroyed” by Miller.

“Jake Tapper of Fake News CNN just got destroyed in his interview with Stephen Miller of the Trump Administration,” Trump tweeted. “Watch the hatred and unfairness of this CNN flunky!”

571,Paul,Rand,breitbart,"Sunday on ABC’s “This Week,” American Conservative Union chairman Matt Schlapp got into a heated debate with ABC political analyst Matthew Dowd.

Dowd said, “The reality is I know Matt likes to create a world that is a sort of fictional rah-rah –”

Schlapp interrupted, saying, “Quit saying I’m a liar, Matt. That’s way beyond. I don’t need truth serum. I don’t need to be lectured by you about being a liar.”

Dowd responded, “I have never called you a liar Matt.”

Schlapp said, “You did! You did in the first segment!”

Dowd replied. “No, I did not. I said that if you drank truth serum, you would actually admit what the president is doing.”

Schlapp said, “Clever way of calling me a liar,”

Dowd continued, “Fundamentally, the Republicans have passed nothing that is popular with America in 2017. And I expect them to pass nothing that is popular in 2018. The president is inherently the most unpopular president at this point of any president that we’ve had. The Democrats have a generic ballot lead that is larger than any time in the last 20 years. So, we’re seeing a situation that this huge wave is coming, and I don’t see a president who’s only governed to a base to change that in the course of the next few months.”

572,Paul,Rand,breitbart,"NBC’s late-night funnyman Seth Meyers came out swinging Sunday night in his opening monologue at the 75th annual Golden Globes, taking several swipes at disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, actor Kevin Spacey, and President Donald Trump.

In his 10-minute plus spiel, Meyers took aim at Hollywood’s powerful men and the sexual abuses many of them have been accused of.

“Good evening ladies and remaining gentlemen,” the Late Night host began. “I’m Seth Meyers and I’ll be your host tonight. It’s 2018, marijuana is finally allowed and sexual harassment finally isn’t.”

“There’s a new era underway and I can tell because it’s been years since a white man was this nervous in Hollywood,” he added.

https://youtu.be/IPYy5fHINJQ

“For the male nominees in the room, this is the first time in three months it won’t be terrifying to hear your name read out loud,” Meyers said.

“We’re all here tonight courtesy of the Hollywood Foreign Press. A string of three words that could not have been better designed to infuriate our president,” Meyers said of President Donald Trump. “The only name that would make him angrier would be the Hillary Mexico Salad Association.”

Turning his attention to Weinstein, Meyers said, “Time to address the elephant not in the room: Harvey Weinstein isn’t in the room … he’ll be back in 20 years when he’s the first person booed in the in memoriam.”

Taking aim at Spacey, who’s been accused of by several men of sexual harassment or assault, Meyers enlisted actor Billy Eichner to finish his sentence (the same way he does on his NBC late-night show in a segment called “Jokes Seth Can’t Tell”).

Meyers began with the setup, “Call Me by Your Name is nominated for Best Motion Picture. It’s a gay coming-of-age film…” to which Eichner said: “Said Kevin Spacey, you lost me at ‘of age.'” The joke promoted some grimaces, groans, and a few laughs from the star-studded audience.

573,Paul,Rand,breitbart,"RIGA (POLITICO) — Atis Sjanits has an unusual remit for an ambassador. The Latvian diplomat is not responsible for relations with another nation — but with his own country’s diaspora.

Sjanits’ job is to respond to the exodus triggered by Latvia’s accession to the EU. Since joining the bloc, nearly a fifth of the nation has left to work in more affluent EU nations: The UK, Ireland, Germany.

In 2000, Latvia’s population stood at 2.38 million. At the start of this year, it was 1.95 million. No other country has had a more precipitous fall in population — 18.2 percent according to U.N. statistics.

575,Paul,Rand,breitbart,"O.J. Simpson is threatening to sue a Las Vegas casino for $100 million after the establishment banned him from the premises last year.

Malcolm LaVergne, Simpson’s lawyer, warned the Cosmopolitan hotel-casino that the former NFL player and convict may charge the establishment with “malice and racial prejudice” after being banned over a still largely unexplained incident in November.

“Mr. Simpson has had 100% perfect behavior since he’s been on parole,” LaVergne said according to USA Today. “He was having dinner with a friend from out of town, and everything was going great. The next thing you know, when he was leaving, they told him, ‘Don’t come back.'”

The incident spurred controversy early in November when it was reported that Simpson caused some sort of ruckus in a hotel bar. An early report on the incident claimed Simpson was “drunk and disorderly” and may have violated his parole.

Simpson was banned from the bar and the hotel, according to further reports.

However, in the days after initial stories, the hotel insisted that the reports were “inaccurate,” though no clarification was ever offered.

Simpson’s parole officer quickly intervened to ascertain if the former NFL player’s conduct violated the terms of his parole. Simpson was paroled in September after serving nine years of a 33-year sentence after being convicted of armed robbery in 2008.

Simpson was subjected to a series of drug and alcohol tests, but authorities determined that no such violation took place.

Simpson’s lawyer, though, says that with the very public ban, the hotel fostered the perception that the one-time Heisman Trophy winner was drunk and disorderly.

“The Cosmopolitan Casino discriminately singled out Mr. Simpson amongst his non-African American friends and subsequently expelled him for what turned out to be a fake reason while he peacefully visited the Cosmopolitan property,” LaVergne wrote in a statement.

LaVergne also demanded that the hotel issue a public apology to clear up any untoward perceptions.

576,Paul,Rand,breitbart,"Actress Debra Messing slammed E! networks during a red carpet interview Sunday at the 75th Golden Globe Awards, ripping the network for failing to pay its female hosts as much as their male counterparts.

“I’m wearing black to stand in solidarity with my sisters all over the globe, and I’m here to celebrate the rollout of this incredible initiative Time’s Up. We want diversity, we want intersectional gender parity, and equal pay,” Messing said to an E! reporter, referring to the new star-studded anti-harassment campaign.

“You know I was so shocked to hear that E! doesn’t believe in paying their female co-hosts the same as their male co-hosts. I miss Catt Sadler. We stand with her,” the Will & Grace star said, apparently referring to the network’s dust-up with former and longtime host Catt Sadler who left E!

577,Paul,Rand,breitbart,"The 75th annual Golden Globes kicks off Sunday night at 5 p.m. PT/8 p.m. Eastern. Late-night host Seth Meyers hosts this year’s festivities live from the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Los Angeles.

Follow along as Breitbart News provides up-to-the-minute winners, commentary, and analysis from the Big Hollywood team.

Things to watch for tonight:

– Actresses are expected to wear black tonight to protest the ongoing sexual harassment scandal. Many will also be wearing #Time’sUp pins, to raise awareness of the industry’s newly-created legal fund to deal with harassment.

– The Best Picture race is wide open this year. The Shape of Water leads all films with seven nominations, but faces stiff competition in the major categories from Streep-Spielberg-Hanks political drama The Post, Christopher Nolan’s WWII epic Dunkirk, gay romantic drama Call Me By Your Name, and Martin McDonagh’s Frances McDormand-starrer Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.

– Gary Oldman is the frontrunner to take home Best Actor for his portrayal of Winston Churchill in Darkest Hour, while McDormand could earn her first Best Actress Globe for her performance in Three Billboards, after five previous nominations. Greta Gerwig’s Lady Bird will also likely take home some trophies, with Saoirse Ronan and Laurie Metcalf the slight frontrunners in their respective acting categories.

– On the TV side, Hulu’s The Handmaid’s Tale looks to repeat its success from last year’s Emmys, but goes up against some serious heavyweights in the Best TV Series – Drama category, including The Crown, Stranger Things, Game of Thrones, and This Is Us. Handmaid’s star Elisabeth Moss will win Best Actress. HBO’s Big Little Lies, also a big Emmys winner last year, is a lock to take home some awards. Perhaps the most intriguing category is the Best TV Series – Comedy category, where freshman Amazon series The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel could score an upset over Black-ish, Master of None, SMILF, and the rebooted Will & Grace. My money’s on Maisel.

– Oprah Winfrey is set to accept the night’s honorary Cecil B. DeMille award. Last year’s winner Meryl Streep memorably used her acceptance speech to attack then-President-elect Donald Trump, but it’s anyone’s guess what Winfrey might talk about during her speech. Barbra Streisand is rumored to be presenting Winfrey her award.

– Seth Meyers will try to thread the needle in his opening monologue, attempting to keep the show light and funny while also addressing the Harvey Weinstein-sized elephant in the room and keeping up a steady stream of Trump hate.

8:05 p.m.: Seth Meyers (selected quotes from monologue): “Good evening ladies and remaining gentlemen.”

“There’s a new era underway and I can tell because it’s been years since a white man was this nervous in Hollywood.”

“For the male nominees in the room, this is the first time in three months it won’t be terrifying to hear your name read out loud.”

“We’re all here tonight courtesy of the Hollywood Foreign Press. A string of three words that could not have been better designed to infuriate our president. The only name that would make him angrier would be the Hillary Mexico Salad Association.”

“Don’t worry, Harvey Weinstein will be back in 20 years, when he’s the only one booed during the In Memoriam.”

7:55 p.m. – 5 minutes to showtime. It’s gonna be a long night.

7:41 p.m. – Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large Rebecca Mansour:

So, every woman at the Golden Globes has decided to wear black to “protest” the sexual misconduct plaguing their industry. Let’s pause and appreciate the irony of this perfect example of the very same herd mentality that allowed this town to cover up the abuse for decades. They all decided this year to wear black to show they are protesting a sexual misconduct epidemic that they all previously decided they would not say anything about. If the Hollywood sisterhood really wanted to be brave, they should have protested by staying home and showing their real strength by telling the studios, networks, and magazines to have fun trying to sell a red carpet gala with only dudes in tuxes. (By the way, kudos to Rose McGowan for really protesting this b.s.)

7:35 p.m. – Binder Fashion Update: Actresses Diane Kruger and Margot Robbie arrived at the Gold Globes bringing their fashion A-game. Kruger donned a dramatic look with a sheer cape and criss-cross neckline, while Robbie wore a v-neck plunging gown that featured small puff-sleeves and silver embroidery cascading down the skirt.

7:22 p.m. – A group calling themselves the “Hollywood Handmaids” have apparently staged a protest outside the Peninsula Hotel (one of Harvey Weinstein’s reported favorites). The group is dressed in costumes from Hulu’s hit TV series The Handmaid’s Tale and are carrying a banner reading, “Silent No Longer.”

Handmaid’s is the favorite to repeat its big win at the Emmys and take home Best TV Series – Drama tonight.

7:16 p.m. – Connie Britton arrives wearing a T-shirt reading, “Poverty is sexist.”

7:07 p.m. – Emma Watson weighs in on Hollywood’s sex harassment scandal: “We’re just scratching the surface of this, which is crazy.”

7:02 p.m. – Binder Fashion Update – Early candidate to make tomorrow’s Best Dressed list: Christina Hendricks arrives at the Golden Globes in a part-jumpsuit, part-gown ensemble with velvet, off-the-shoulder detailing.

6:37 p.m. – Binder Fashion Update: Actress Alexis Bledel wears a black and white jumpsuit that features vine detailing around her neck.

6:29 p.m. – The Stranger Things kids are awesome. Gaten Matarazzo (Dustin) does his best Chewbacca impression.

6:08 p.m. – Meryl Streep arrives alongside activist Aj-jen Poo.

“I think that people are aware now of a power imbalance, and it’s something that leads to abuse. It’s led to abuse in our own industry, and it’s led to abuse across the domestic workers’ field of work,” Streep told E! host Ryan Seacrest on the red carpet.

“It’s in the military, it’s in Congress. It’s everywhere, and we want to fix that. And we feel sort of emboldened in this particular moment to stand together, in a thick black line.”

6:05 p.m. – Things are getting interesting (and awkward) already. Debra Messing has trashed E! for sexism directly to an E! News reporter working the red carpet.

“I’m wearing black to stand in solidarity with my sisters all over the globe, and I’m here to celebrate the rollout of this incredible initiative Time’s Up. We want diversity, we want intersectional gender parity, and equal pay,” Messing said.

But, she added: “I was so shocked to hear that E! doesn’t believe in paying their female co-hosts the same as their male co-hosts. I miss Catt Sadler. We stand with her.”

“That’s something that could change tomorrow.”

6:00 p.m. – Hollywood’s best and brightest are already out in full force on the Globes red carpet. It looks like most actresses have kept to the all-black dress code as part of the protest against sexual harassment, and both men and women are wearing Time’s Up pins.

Stars who have already arrived include Alison Brie, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Rachel Brosnahan, Milo Venitmiglia, the Stranger Things kids, and dozens more. Stay tuned for more arrival pics, and find more on all the arrivals from Breitbart’s John Binder here.

578,Paul,Rand,breitbart,"New York Times best-selling author and populist conservative columnist Ann Coulter says the number one priority for President Trump’s administration should be deporting the nearly 800,000 illegal aliens who have been shielded from deportation by the President Obama-created Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.

In a talk radio interview with Larry O’Connor, Coulter reiterated her call for DACA illegal aliens to be deported first, this time saying they should be prioritized for deportation above illegal aliens who are members of the violent El Salvadorian MS-13 gang.

Coulter said:

The one thing Trump should remember, especially now that he’s under attack I mean more than I think ever before, is he has the power to overcome all of this. I mean, he could sell Ivanka merchandise from the White House, he could refuse to be in the White House, he could govern from Mar-a-Lago, if he would just build the wall and deport illegals, starting with the DREAMers. I’m 100 percent for deporting DREAMers first. The order should be DREAMers, then felons, and then you know just random illegals as they come to our attention. We can be discretionary on that. But DREAMers, number one. [Emphasis added] At least the felons, they’re not indignant. They’re not going on TV saying ‘How dare you delay in giving me amnesty, we demand you forgive our law-breaking.’ Oh, the DREAMers are the worst of all. So I put them in line for deportation before the felons. Then we’ll get to the MS-13 members. You’re regular illegal alien, the ones not going on TV every night and demanding amnesty, they’re actually really sweet and hard workers. I’ve always said that about … illegal aliens. They’re so friendly and they really do work hard. So nobody really minds them, it’s the DREAMers who have to go first. [Emphasis added]

Coulter made the remarks as the White House is attempting to cut a deal with the Republican establishment to cut legal immigration levels in half, end the Diversity Visa Lottery, and receive full funding for the proposed U.S.-Mexico border wall in exchange for granting an amnesty for DACA illegal aliens that could eventually lead to an amnesty for all 12 to 30 million illegal aliens residing in the U.S.

While cutting legal immigration levels would raise wages for American workers and reduce burdens on America’s working and middle class, a DACA amnesty is likely to cause a surge along the southern border, as well as being a drain on U.S. taxpayers.

For example, as Breitbart News reported, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that at least 1 in 7 DACA illegal aliens would end up on Medicaid if given legal status and about 1 in 5 would end up on food stamps.",1,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/01/07/ann-coulter-100-percent-deporting-daca-illegal-aliens-first-then-ms-13-gang-members/

580,Paul,Rand,breitbart,"Attorney General Sessions created a wave of controversy last week when he repealed the Obama administration’s 2013 “Cole Memo.” The most heated backlash came from the two U.S. Senators named “Cory.”

While Republican Cory Garner of Colorado was on the Senate floor defending the Obama policy, actually promising to keep Obama’s U.S. Attorneys in place by blocking any replacements, Democrat Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey took a different approach. The Cory named “Booker” announced through MoveOn.org that he would be moving ahead with his proposed “Marijuana Justice Act.”

What bizarre world has the Republican defending Obama and the Democrat defending the rule of law?

Candidate Donald J. Trump was a backlash candidate elected by an amalgam of people frustrated by what Trump labeled the “Swamp,” the special interests who controlled the federal government by assuring that it operated in their interest, not the public interest. We who supported him were animated by his call to restore the rule of law by reigning in lawlessness in open borders, immigration policy, the EPA, etc. Almost daily, we cheer as President Trump roles back one Obama action after another.

As with his refusal to enforce immigration or any other laws, the Cole Memo, enacted by former Attorney General Eric Holder, was an announcement to would-be pot profiteers that the Obama administration would not enforce federal law. It was yet another declaration that the Obama administration would only enforce laws it likes. That green light allowed George Soros, one of Obama’s biggest patrons, to lead national efforts to legalize pot at the state level.

Sessions has repealed 25 other Obama Justice Department “guidance documents.” The “Cole Memo” was an inherently dishonest backdoor gift to white-collar, Wall Street pot dealers.

Yet many of us, like the Cory named “Gardner,” who love seeing any lawless thing Obama did rolled back, suddenly find ourselves awkwardly supporting this one.

Americans enjoy a modicum of protection from illegal drugs stemming from duly enacted and thoroughly adjudicated federal laws separating legal and illegal controlled substances. Should one state be allowed unfettered production of any dangerous substance if it cannot prevent the flow of that substance into neighboring states? Should Colorado replace, or even in effect partner with Mexican drug cartels, enjoying huge profits from drugs distributed to neighboring states that are left only with the downsides?

With the secretive Cole Memo, Barack “pen and phone” Obama effectively voided federal law, for a time, and foisted a new pot industry onto an unsuspecting public.

Setting aside one’s views of pot legality, consider the process. Passing ballot measures is extremely expensive. Passing good laws is, in essence, free. If legal pot makes sense, why would pot proponents not make their case before the public and lawmaking bodies, holding public hearings to change the law?

It is clear that consultants to would-be pot investors informed them that pot is illegal under federal law and 50 state statutes because legalization cannot withstand the scrutiny of public hearings and dueling experts. Thus, the well-heeled pot industry chose the path of backroom deals and direct democracy. They financed ballot issues nationwide that exploited the natural tendency of people of good will to want to ease the suffering of medical patients. They lobbied heavily for the Cole Memo, which gave pot investors the green light to put millions of dollars into state ballot measures, knowing the Obama administration would look the other way.

As we consider Obama policy under the Cole memo, it is worth considering exactly what the Cory from Colorado is defending. The Cole Memo could not decriminalize pot, so it merely defined a number of public protection “enforcement priorities.” How did Holder’s Justice Department do with their own stated pot enforcement priorities?

“Preventing the distribution of marijuana to minors” – There is a lot of conflicting survey data reporting pot use by kids, but logic and hospital data showing a quadruple increase in pot-related child hospital admissions seem most reliable. Anecdotally, my 15-year-old asked to leave California, citing the fact that he knew just four kids in the neighborhood NOT smoking pot regularly. Kids start at 11 or 12 and move to harder drugs by 15. What drives a kid to want to leave life on the beach? “Preventing revenue from the sale of marijuana from going to criminal enterprises, gangs, and cartels & Preventing the diversion of marijuana from states where it is legal under state law in some form to other states” – Gangs have never been stronger, and California already exports more pot to the rest of the country than Mexico, supplying as much as 80% of the pot consumed nationally. “Preventing the growing of marijuana on public lands and the attendant public safety and environmental dangers posed by marijuana production on public lands” – Two rural California counties have rallied for help, citing as many as 1200 illegal grow sites in Yuma county alone and an estimated 50,000 statewide. Mexican gangs and illegal profiteers grab any land they can find in state and national parks, polluting and even drying up streams in the process. Pot plantations are devastating parks and streams across California.

By any objective measure, the Cole Memo is a joke. It represents nothing more than a back-door tactic to legalize an illegal industry.

If one stands for the rule of law in the United States of America, then you must support the Trump administration returning to the rule of law, to transparency. This was a hallmark of the Trump campaign.

Americans voted for the President largely for his promise to restore enforcement of illegal immigration law in opposition to special interests on the left, who want votes, and on Wall Street, who want cheap labor. Curbing illegal immigration and securing the border also mean curbing the drug trade.

While the Cole Memo allowed gangs, growers and investors to enjoy illegal profits at the expense of kids, families and the environment, Attorney General Sessions is restoring protections passed by the peoples’ representatives. Californians and Coloradans may have voted for a vibrant pot trade, but their votes laid huge consequences and costs on the rest of us, despite federal protections that formerly existed on paper only.

If you disagree with a law, then you hold hearings and change it. Threats by Members of Congress and U.S. Senators calling on the Trump administration to adopt the lawless tactics of the previous administration are misplaced.

The high-minded calls to states’ rights in defense of the Cole Memo are actually calls to lawlessness. Politicians disagreeing with their own laws need to have the fortitude to step up and change them.

581,Paul,Rand,breitbart,"New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio claimed Sunday that millionaires would not leave the city if the state imposed a “millionaire’s tax.”

De Blasio, who supports the tax hike to fund the city’s subway system, said New Yorkers would not flee town like residents of New Jersey did when lawmakers made a similar proposal.

“There’s a lot of other people who are really devoted to living in New York City because of all we have to offer,” de Blasio told radio show host John Catsimatidis in an interview Sunday, adding that he was “not an expert” on what caused millionaires to flee the Garden State.

What de Blasio is referring to is New Jersey’s 8.97 percent tax on residents earning more than $1 million, according to data from the New Jersey Department of Taxation.

New Jersey lawmakers grew worried that millionaires would leave the state due to high taxes after the state’s highest-earning resident at the time, hedge fund billionaire David Tepper, moved his family and his business to Florida in 2016 after living in the state for more than 20 years.

Tepper made more than $6 billion a year from 2012 to 2015, and paid approximately hundreds of millions of dollars in New Jersey state taxes.

Despite New Jersey losing one of its highest-earners, state lawmakers want to increase the state millionaire’s tax rate to 10.75 percent.

De Blasio, however, does not fear that New York City residents would “only live here for half a year because of tax issues” and leave for lower-tax areas.

“I don’t fear a negative outcome,” he said during his Sunday radio interview.

The tax would require state approval, but New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in August that such a plan would be “dead on arrival.”",1,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/01/07/bill-de-blasio-millionaires-not-flee-nyc-tax-hike/
582,Paul,Rand,breitbart,"I agree with Donald Trump.

Jeb Bush just talked about my border proposal to build a ""fence."" It's not a fence, Jeb, it's a WALL, and there's a BIG difference! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 25, 2015

I wholeheartedly agree with Donald Trump from back in 2015. There is a BIG difference between a wall and a fence. But the proposals released by the U.S. government this week are in stark contrast with POTUS’s promises. This is the nullification project at work.

The Trump administration will request $18 billion over a 10-year period for 316 miles of fencing, and for a reinforcement of 407 miles where barriers are already in place. This is less than half the U.S. border, and less than half of the strength of a real brick and mortar wall — as Mick Mulvaney was touting earlier this year.

The administration was warned by supportive voices as far back as May that this wouldn’t do, but it appears that at least through 2027, this is their idea for a wall.

As the British have come to learn, this is what happens when you allow the fundamentals of your revolution to be actioned by those who opposed it, career political class, and life-long bureaucrats: Theresa May, Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell, Tony Blair. It’s all the same crowd, backed by the same multi-nationals and corporate interests whichever side of the Atlantic Ocean you’re looking at it from.

Just as Brexit didn’t see a significant change in the British government at any level, nor did 2017 see the required wholesale re-purposing of U.S. government departments. Bush and Obama holdovers, and the departments of Justice, State, and Homeland Security are still running much of the show.

In Britain we have a prime minister who campaigned to remain in the European Union, but who is really led by the hard-line remain voices like Blair, who was, this week, absurdly claiming that Britain should have a second referendum, or perhaps even a THIRD depending on how that one goes.

Similarly, the Department for Homeland Security has at its helm the former Bush staffer Kristjen Nielsen, and now Vice President Mike Pence is inviting Senator Jeff Flake into the negotiations on the Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals (DACA) programme, and amnesty for illegal immigrants.

In American parlance, The Deplorables are “getting rolled”.

In the past history was written by the victors, but since WWII we have become alarmingly accustomed to history being written by the losers.

A bully Germany now runs Europe, the U.S. media is more frightened by the old Soviet Union than ever before, and the cultural warriors of the 60s, whose Marxist pretenses are scarcely covered, now dominate Western media and culture.

This is due to the fetishisation of democracy. Our drummed-in obsession with the ballot box as the be all and end all. But that it is not. The be all and end all is power. And the power is currently being wielded by Remain campaigners in Britain, and by Mitch McConnell, Paul Ryan, and Bush-Obama holdovers in the United States.

This weekend at Camp David, a group of Republicans are compromising amongst themselves on immigration, the wall, and amnesty. Attorney General Jeff Sessions — regardless of what you think of him on the Russia investigation recusal — is a long-standing immigration hawk who was not invited to the Republican conflab.

Remember, they haven’t even got to the negotiating stage with the Democrats yet, who are themselves hurriedly making plans for government shutdowns, taking the U.S. House of Representatives, and impeachment against this President if and when they do.

Caving on DACA and the wall isn’t going to save this President from that. In fact, it opens up the likelihood that real MAGA supporters refuse to vote in droves this coming November, hastening such proceedings.

Think it won’t happen? Look to the collapse of the Conservative Party vote in the snap election last year.

Campaign and policy flubs aside, the Conservative Party suffered from the activation of younger voters, which led to the highest voter turnout since 1992. Yes, the Tories still won the election, but instead of increasing their majority as expected, it was cut to a point where we had a hung parliament. There’s no doubt about it, this was a Brexit backlash from younger, more left-leaning, anti-Brexit voters. It was also due to the “Corbyn” factor — with Marxist Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn offering a terrifyingly authentic Chavista socialism to kids with frontal lobes not yet fully formed.

While the Democrats in the U.S. haven’t just yet handed his American counterpart — Bernie Sanders — the reigns of the Democrat Party, there is almost certainly going to be an anti-MAGA backlash vote in 2018.

Team Trump are currently fooling themselves into believing a deal on DACA — alongside vicious condemnation of MAGA figures — will spare them the rod. It won’t.

The only thing they should be focused on is delivering on agenda items, and making sure the 62,984,825 people who voted for President Trump on November 8th 2016 are motivated and mobilised. But this wouldn’t suit the nullifaction artists. Ryan, McConnell, and their corporate backers are intent on this presidency being a failure. They got their tax reform bill which helped their big business buddies and scarcely impacted the ordinary working American. Now, as far as they are concerned, it is time to shut it down.

583,Paul,Rand,breitbart,"The State of California is reporting that the deadly 2017-2018 flu epidemic is running at 300 percent above average for the last five years.

The California Department of Public Health (DPH) reported that for the first three months of the 2017-2018 flu season ending Dec. 30, there were 27 people younger than age 65 that died. That was up spectacularly from the one who died during the same period in 2016-2017.

California provides weekly public health epidemic tracking through 68 enrolled “Sentinel Providers” (physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants) located in all 58 California counties. All patients suffering a fever above 100° Fahrenheit and with a cough and/or sore throat are laboratory tested for influenza and pneumonia.

Of the 41,891 cases tested in California during the first 12 weeks of the 2017-2018 flu year, there were 7,306 that tested positive for influenzas, or 17 percent. But the epidemic is exponentially accelerating. Of the 4,891 cases tested in the flu year’s 12th week ending Dec. 30, there were 2,002, or 41 percent, that tested positive for influenza.

The peak of the flu epidemic is not expected until the second week in February. That means the number of weekly cases are expected to triple, and the peak number of deaths could be substantially higher. Once the epidemic peaks, the number of cases will slowly decline, but the epidemic will last until about August.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) expects the 2017-2018 flu epidemic will be the most deadly since the 2009-2010 swine flu epidemic, which killed 284,000 people worldwide and 657 Californians.

CDC recommends a yearly flu vaccine for everyone six months of age and older as the first and most important step in protecting against this serious disease. Although millions of Californians received a flu vaccination last fall, the broad number of flu variants mean that only about 25 percent of the vaccinated are protected.

The most widely circulating flu strain, Type A, subtype H3N2, is this year’s most dangerous,. Despite vaccination being a third as effective compared to prior years, and taking two weeks before it is effective, the DPH website states it is “not too late to get a vaccination.”",1,http://www.breitbart.com/california/2018/01/07/california-flu-epidemic-running-300-above-5-year-average/
584,Paul,Rand,breitbart,"A Government Accountability Office (GAO) report shows federal agents tried to show ease of illegally purchasing guns online only to fail in 72 out of 72 attempts.

The 72 attempts spanned a two and a half year time frame.

The NRA-ILA reported:

In yet another embarrassment for the gun control lobby, a government investigation of online gun sales designed to determine “whether private sellers would knowingly sell a firearm to an individual prohibited from possessing one” determined that … no, actually, they would not. In 72 attempts undertaken over 2 ½ years, undercover agents trying to buy guns through readily-accessible Internet sites failed exactly 100% of the time to complete a sale when the seller had reason to believe the buyer was prohibited or lived in another state.

The GAO report was titled, “Internet Firearm Sales: ATF Enforcement Efforts and Outcomes of GAO Covert Testing.” It was commissioned by three rabid gun controllers, Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD) and Sens. Brian Schatz (D-HI) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).

Cummings, Schatz, and Warren were apparently all lured in by a Michael Bloomberg-funded 2011 study which claimed “62% of private sellers” would go through with an online sale even after finding out the would-be buyer had a criminal history. Bloomberg’s study gave ammunition to the gun control zealots who then urged the GAO study, only to find that the so-called lucrative market of “unregulated” online sales is not there.

Again, federal agents made 72 attempts to buy guns online during a two and a half year time frame and failed every time.

Gun controllers in the House or Senate and frequently speak of a loophole that allows criminals to buy guns online. Their surrogates in Hollywood and the media often make the same claims following a high profile firearm-based attack. For example, after the Las Vegas attack Jimmy Kimmel claimed, “Right now, there are loopholes in the law that let people avoid background checks if they buy a gun privately–from another party–if they buy a gun online or at a gun show.”



Sorry Jimmy, there is no loophole. There are private sales–which have been legal since the Second Amendment was ratified in 1791–but besides these, Americans have been forced to undergo a background check for every retail sale since 1998. In fact, it is illegal to buy a gun online without going through a background check. If an individual from Florida wants to purchase a firearm online from a gun store in Oklahoma, that gun has to be shipped to a Florida store where the buyer passes a background check before taking possession of it.

The GAO report is clear–72 attempted purchases, 72 fails.

587,Paul,Rand,breitbart,"President Donald Trump’s threats to cut funding to the Palestinians puts the Palestinian Authority on notice that they will face consequences for their intransigence, support for terrorism and anti-Israel incitement, explained Breitbart Jerusalem bureau chief Aaron Klein.

Klein argued that even if the Trump administration eventually continues to provide some funding to the PA, the threat to halt aid is already a winning policy since it communicates to the PA that they will face consequences for their bad behavior.

Klein was speaking in a radio interview broadcast on Breitbart News’ “Whatever It Takes” hosted by former All-Star pitcher Curt Schilling.

Listen to the full interview below:

Here is a partial transcript of Klein’s remarks:

If we continue every year to give $600 million to the Palestinian Authority … why would they stop supporting terror if they keep getting their money? Why would we continue to perpetuate a deal with the Iranians when openly they support terror around the world and openly they are trying to destabilize the world at the expense of American national security. Why would they stop if we don’t do anything about sanctions or if we further this deal? So Donald Trump, even if he does eventually give money to the Palestinian Authority, I think they have been put on notice right now – they have to be – that we are at least looking at this. Also by Trump moving the embassy to Jerusalem after decades of the United States not doing that – and by the way, many presidents, when they ran, promised that they would and then they delayed – this also puts the Palestinian Authority on notice. If you continue to bolt peace negotiations than you are actually going to lose ground. You’re going to lose momentum. And also just think about it. How are they a peace partner if they need to be blackmailed into making peace? That makes absolutely no sense. If they wanted it (a state) they would have it.

The U.S. provides about $600 million per year in assistance to the Palestinians. This includes direct aid to the PA, assistance through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the U.N.’s Palestinian “refugee” agency UNRWA.

Trump made statements on Twitter last week in which he seemingly threatened to cut off U.S. financial aid to the PA.

They were followed up by threats from U.S. Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley, who warned that if the PA refuses to continue peace negotiations with Israel, the Trump administration could withhold funds from UNRWA.

A State Department official denied reports that the U.S. has already frozen UNRWA funding, but confirmed the decision about whether to continue funding is “under review.”

The U.S. is UNRWA’s single largest donor, providing about $300 million annually.

The definition of a Palestinian “refugee” and their actual numbers have long been the subject of debate.

Last week, UNRWA would not comment when asked by Breitbart Jerusalem to provide the total number of Palestinian “refugees” that UNRWA services in Lebanon. This came after Lebanon’s census data recently placed the number of Palestinian “refugees” living in the country at about one third of the nearly 500,000 reported by UNRWA.",1,http://www.breitbart.com/jerusalem/2018/01/07/listen-klein-trump-already-won-threatening-cut-funding-palestinians/

The Port Authority told NBC New York that a China Southern plane’s right wing hit the tail of a Kuwait Airways flight, causing damage to both planes.

No injuries were reported, and all passengers disembarked from the planes safely, said the Port Authority, which manages all three major airports in the New York City metropolitan area.

The Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) said the Boeing 777 jets collided just after midnight when the China Southern flight was being towed.

The China Southern flight had no passengers on board at the time of the crash, according to the Port Authority.

Kuwait Airways released a statement via Twitter announcing that the Chinese aircraft struck Flight 118 from New York to Kuwait while it was parked awaiting takeoff.

The airline added that it was cooperating with New York authorities to investigate the accident.

NBC New York reports that the passengers aboard the Kuwait Airways flight had been taken to hotels while they waited to be rebooked on alternative flights.

CBS News reports that passengers at JFK posted angrily on social media that they had been stranded in the airport for up to 20 hours on Saturday without any indication from airport officials as to what happened.

One passenger tweeted a video at 2:26 a.m. Saturday morning of people lining up in front of the ticket counter and crowding around the waiting area demanding answers.

589,Paul,Rand,kentucky,"Sen. Rand Paul

As we start the New Year, I wanted to look back on a big accomplishment of 2017 and cut through the media chatter and disinformation to tell you exactly what happened and how you will be helped.

First, I worked on and voted for a tax cut that will put $1.5 trillion more in the hands of taxpayers and away from government. This is a huge cut, and a fulfillment of the promise both President Donald Trump and I made throughout the last election.

The bill started out as “tax reform,” which was Washington-speak for “some of you will pay more, and some of you will pay less, and I hope you have a good lobbyist.” I adamantly opposed this and worked with President Donald Trump and congressional leaders to make sure it was a cut, not just reform.

I’m proud to say we accomplished that goal.

I also refused to give my initial full support for the bill because it didn’t do enough for individuals. By standing on principle, our small group of conservatives were able to lower every bracket by another 2 to 4 percent, raise the level at which the brackets began, and keep in many deductions that had been eliminated — thus saving most taxpayers thousands of dollars in comparison to the original bill.

It took a lot of hard work and a lot of quiet negotiation, but it paid off.

There were parts big and small that were made better because people stood up and said: “Wait. We can do more. We can do better.”

On the business side, my idea for repatriation of overseas profits was modified and adopted — clearing the way for trillions of dollars now parked overseas to be brought back to the U.S.

The corporate rate was cut to 21 percent, which, along with other business tax reforms, should unleash a huge wave of jobs and economic growth in the coming years. Already businesses all over America are giving raises and bonuses and upping investment, all a direct result of this tax cut.

The media couldn’t lie enough about this bill. This was always about getting more money into taxpayers’ hands and getting more money into the hands of those who create jobs.

Our economy has been too stagnant for too long. Our only path to future prosperity is more growth and more jobs, and this tax cut is a huge step forward for both.

All the while during this bill, I stood up for taxpayers and job creators. Here’s another example: the original bill included a provision that could have devastated auto dealers across America, raising the prices of cars and costing thousands of jobs, but through my efforts, this was fixed and avoided.

The GOP tax cut was a team effort, from the president, to congressional leaders, to conversation leaders who stood up to make it better. The end result is a massive cut for nearly all Americans. Jobs and growth for our economy. A fairer, simpler system for all.

Let’s do it again next year.",1,http://www.kentucky.com/opinion/op-ed/article192815394.html
590,Paul,Rand,outsidethebeltway,"Fox News Poll Shows Alabama Senate Race Tied, But Skepticism Is Still Called For

A new poll shows Democratic nominee Doug Jones tied with twice-removed former Chief Justice Roy Moore in Alabama's Senate race, but it's still too early to be optimistic.

Doug Mataconis · · 16 comments

A new poll from Fox News Channel shows the race between former Alabama Chief Justice and Republican nominee Roy Moore and Democratic candidate Doug Jones to be tied, but it’s still not clear that this race is as competitive as polling indicates:

Democrat Doug Jones — once thought to be a longshot in the Deep South — has tied Republican nominee and former judge Roy Moore in Alabama’s US Senate race, a new poll shows. The two are tied at 42% each among registered voters, the Fox News poll published Tuesday, conducted by Democratic firm Anderson Robbins Research and GOP firm Shaw & Company Research. Moore and Jones will face off in a special election to fill Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ former seat December 12. The poll confirms Republicans’ fears that Moore — who campaigns on a theocratic, anti-LGBT message and has twice been ousted as state Supreme Court chief justice, once for refusing to remove a Ten Commandments monument and once for refusing to follow the Supreme Court’s ruling legalizing same-sex marriage — would be a uniquely vulnerable candidate in a state President Donald Trump won last year by 28 percentage points. Jones, a former prosecutor who convicted two former Klansmen in the bombing of Birmingham’s 16th Street Baptist Church, has sought to portray Moore as someone who would embarrass Alabama on the national stage. “I can work with Republicans better than Roy Moore can work with anyone,” Jones says in a new TV ad. The poll found that just 53% of registered voters said they were extremely or very interested in the race. Among those voters, Jones has a one-point lead over Moore at 46% to 45%. Moore defeated Sen. Luther Strange, who was appointed to fill Sessions’ seat until the special election, in a September 26 primary runoff. His win came despite Trump having visited Huntsville to campaign for Strange. Moore was backed by Steve Bannon, Trump’s former White House chief strategist. And he has campaigned on removing Mitch McConnell as Senate majority leader.

This isn’t the first poll to show a tighter than expected race in what has long been a deeply red state. As I noted last month, polls taken in the immediate aftermath of Moore’s victory over Senator Luther Strange in the runoff primary election showed Jones within six points of Moore, an unusual result in a state that is normally solidly Republican. As Fox News notes in its own report on the poll, the fact that polls are even indicating that Jones could be competitive is striking:

The competitiveness of the race is striking. Donald Trump won Alabama by 28 points in 2016, yet the Steve Bannon-backed Moore defeated the president’s favored candidate, incumbent Luther Strange, in the GOP primary. “This race exemplifies the difficulty the Republican Party has now,” says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts the Fox News Poll with Democrat Chris Anderson. “There is an element of the party that has had it with the establishment, had it with politics as usual, had it with political correctness. The fissure within the party means divisive primaries, controversial candidates, and hard choices for GOP voters once the general election rolls around.” Jones is helped by greater party loyalty, and hesitancy among Moore’s own backers. The poll, released Tuesday, shows 42 percent of Moore’s supporters have some reservations about their candidate. For Jones, that number is 28 percent. Plus, 21 percent of those in the Jones camp say they’re voting against Moore as opposed to for Jones. That’s three times the number of Moore supporters who say their vote is based on dislike of Jones (7 percent). Nearly half of those backing Jones (47 percent) and Moore (48 percent) say they “strongly” support their candidate. he main reasons Moore supporters give for backing him include party loyalty (41 percent) and his Christian beliefs (20 percent). Among Jones supporters, it is party loyalty (35 percent) and their belief Moore is extreme (32 percent). In a Republican stronghold like Alabama, it helps Jones that Democrats are more likely to back him (85 percent) than Republicans are to support Moore (77 percent). Independents go for Jones by 33-26 percent (27 percent undecided). Moore tops Jones among white evangelical Christians (+51), white men without a college degree (+48), and gun owners (+16). Jones is preferred among blacks (+66), voters under age 45 (+14), and women (+3). About 1 in 10 Trump voters defects to the Democratic candidate (11 percent). That’s nearly three times the number of Clinton voters who are supporting Moore (4 percent). Two months out, roughly 1 in 10 Alabamans is undecided about their vote in the Senate race (11 percent). Thirty-three percent are unfamiliar with the Democratic candidate, while 12 percent say the same about Moore. Still, more view Jones positively than negatively by 25 points (46-21 percent). Moore has a net positive of 10 points (49 percent favorable vs. 39 percent unfavorable). About as many Alabama voters view Trump positively as negatively (48-47 percent). Four in 10 have a “strongly” unfavorable opinion of the president. Are Moore’s attempts to define Jones as a liberal working? The poll finds 29 percent say Jones is too liberal for Alabama. On the other hand, 39 percent of voters feel Moore is out of step with Alabama today. Even 24 percent of Republicans feel that way.

The Fox News poll is the first new poll to be taken in Alabama since those previous September polls, but it’s led to some speculation and hope that Moore could end up going down to defeat in the Special Election on December 12th. According to the RealClearPolitics average, Moore now has only 4.4 point lead over Jones with an average of 46.7% of voters saying they support Moore while 42.3 % saying they support Jones. While these numbers are certainly encouraging for opponents of Moore, they ought to be taken with a grain of salt to say the very least.

Alabama has not elected a Democrat to the Senate since Howell Heflin ran for re-election in 1990, and hasn’t had a Democratic Senator since 1994 when Richard Shelby, the state’s senior Senator, left the Democratic Party and ran for re-election as a Republican. Republicans have also maintained control over other statewide offices such as Governor, Lt. Governor, and Attorney General since the early 1990s and the state’s Congressional delegation is dominated by Republican. The sole Democrat representing Alabama in Congress comes from the 7th Congressional District, which is dominated by African-Americans. Additionally, notwithstanding the fact that national Republicans largely backed incumbent Senator Luther Strange, who was appointed to fill the seat vacated by Jeff Sessions when he became Attorney General, Moore has recently received several prominent endorsements from Capitol Hill Republicans, including Senators Mike Lee and Rand Paul and Congressman Thomas Massie. Given all of that, and Alabama’s historic tendency in recent years to vote for Republican candidates in statewide elections, this polling showing Jones performing far better than a Democrat should in the state need to be backed up by some additional evidence before they can be believed. Nonetheless, given Moore’s controversial history, which now includes recent statements where he said that professional athletes who decline to stand for the National Anthem are breaking the law, one can only hope that this means that Alabamans might actually display some sanity in this race.",1,http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/fox-news-poll-shows-alabama-senate-race-tied-but-skepticism-is-still-called-for/

Who is to blame?

Trending: Rep. Ron DeSantis’ Younger Sister Suddenly Dies

Police have already launched a criminal investigation as to who is responsible for the deaths.

For what ever reason, Florida Power & Light did not have the nursing home listed as “critical” regarding the restoration of power during an outage such as the one caused by the storm.

The facility said that they reported the outage to FPL and the county, but those calls for action fell on deaf ears, at least for a few days. Power was eventually restored, but not the air conditioning system.

Employees of the home tried to keep residents cool, but appear to have failed to see the gravity of the situation. After three rescue calls were made, first responders realized what they were facing.

It was already too late, as paramedics arrived to find 3 dead.

Rescue workers were able to relocate 158 patients of the two-story facility Memorial Regional Hospital, but again, it was too late.

Even with the tragic loss of life, FPL contends that there are too many nursing homes throughout the county to be able to expedite power to, this according to Broward County Mayor Barbara Sharief.

FPL spokesman Ron Gould said nursing homes are not defined as critical facilities in the plan the county gives FPL for restoring power — meaning they are not the first to have power restored.

“We met with Broward in early March. This facility was not listed as a top-tier critical infrastructure facility,” he said.

Regulators do not require nursing homes like Hollywood Hills to have generators. In Florida, nursing homes can comply with licensing regulations as long as they have “alternate forms of power,” said Kristen Knapp, spokeswoman for the Florida Health Care Association. That could include battery-operated fans, she said.

New federal nursing home regulations that will go into effect in November mandate, among other things, that safe indoor temperatures be maintained during power outages. But the rules — which come 12 years after 35 elderly people died in a New Orleans-area nursing home during Hurricane Katrina — also fail to specifically require generators.”-Sun-Sentinel

If she thinks Trump is a white supremacist, then what does she think of President John F. Kennedy, who was not only a Democrat, but the “great white hope” for his party at the time.

Kennedy was all about advancing political career and cared less about the black man’s plight in society, as he acted more of a bystander to the injustices of segregation, than an actual leader who looked to abolish it.

And to that point, why didn’t Kennedy pen an executive order to abolish segregation? After all, segregation all-but ended with Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voter Rights Act of 1965, several years after Kennedy die.

Story highlights Rand Paul: We can be bold yet simple on tax reform He says we can cut taxes and promote growth without picking winners and losers

Editor’s Note: Rand Paul is a US senator from Kentucky. He serves on the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. The views expressed in this commentary are his own.

(CNN) —

As Congress returns next week, attention will turn to matters of budget, spending and taxes. The tax reform package that legislators will take up will have major implications for years to come, and we should get it right.

Unlike health care, tax reform can be simple, but I’m afraid those who are in charge will make it unnecessarily complicated, especially when coupled with an alarming timidity that could render the reform’s impact nearly meaningless.

There is much talk from the wonks in Washington about the need to make tax cuts “revenue neutral,” or offset elsewhere in the tax code. Let me tell you what that really means, and why it is a terrible idea, especially here in the “Swamp.”

Revenue neutral ultimately means that someone pays more for someone else to pay less. It means tax “reform” without real tax cuts.

Let me ask you a serious question. If someone has to pay more for someone else to pay less – which category do you think you and other Americans might fall into? I fear that tax reform that mandates revenue neutrality will result in those with the best lobbyists, lawyers and accountants being the winners, while most everyone else either gets nothing or largely loses out.

It doesn’t have to be that way. We can be bold yet simple. We can cut taxes, and promote jobs and growth, without picking winners and losers.

To get this done, our tax reform needs to have three main areas of focus.

First, every American who pays taxes should get a tax cut. Every rate should be lowered by a percentage. What percentage? That’s where we conservatives can negotiate with fence-sitters if necessary. I’d favor a large cut of at least 15% for every taxpayer. But the main and important thing is that everyone gets a tax cut.

Next, we need to simply slash the corporate tax rate to 15%, and not worry about any complicated reform that no one will agree on, or that takes 500 pages to explain.

Cut the rate so it is competitive with other countries. (15% makes us even with Canada’s federal rate.) Cut the rate so that it can create jobs. Cut the rate to encourage people to start new businesses, hire more people and grow. According to a 2016 Tax Foundation analysis of then-candidate Donald Trump’s tax plan, comprehensive reform, including lowering the corporate rate to 15%, could create around 2 million new jobs.

Finally, let’s stop the double taxation and international money hoarding of our biggest companies. There is more than $2 trillion parked overseas by companies such as Apple, Google and others. Why? Because they already paid taxes on it over there, and we want them to pay 35% to bring it back. They’re never going to do it. That’s a fantasy.

Let’s cut the rate to 5%, make it voluntary and get that money home to create more jobs. A 5% voluntary rate still brings in billions of additional revenue, which could be targeted to building and repairing infrastructure.

Three simple items. Every Republican and even some Democrats agree with the basic premise of this plan, and we can get down to arguing about the exact numbers.

We can do this, but not if we operate the way the Swamp normally does. Secret meetings. Leaders writing complicated bills no one sees. Lobbyists getting their pet provisions in bills.

If tax reform is run like most things around here – like Obamacare repeal, for example – then I can’t predict what will happen other than it will be complicated, won’t help much and could even fail. There’s no excuse for that.

595,Paul,Rand,nypost,"Speaking to the Fraternal Order of Police in Tennessee on Monday morning, Attorney General Jeff Sessions formally announced that the Trump administration will restart giving surplus military weapons and equipment to state and local law enforcement.

That’s a mistake.

What kind of equipment are we talking about? Well, Haverhill, Mass., a town of fewer than 65,000, got a nearly 20-ton Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected vehicle. Keene, NH, a town of fewer than 30,000, got an 8-ton armored BearCat. Over 10,000 bayonets have been handed out. Yes, bayonets.

Police work is unquestionably difficult — and often thankless. I have nothing but the utmost respect and admiration for those who put it all on the line to protect our communities, and I saw their bravery firsthand this summer when Capitol Police officers made all the difference during the attack on our congressional baseball game practice.

To support our local police, we must first realize they aren’t soldiers. But today the line between the two is being eroded.

It’s no surprise you can find big government right at the heart of this problem. Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts by using federal dollars to help municipal governments build what are essentially small armies — where police departments compete to acquire military gear.

Plus, over a third of the “surplus” equipment is new, so it’s disingenuous to portray it as banged-up old stuff lying around the garage.

When we couple militarizing law enforcement with the erosion of civil liberties and due process that allows the police to become judge and jury — national security letters, no-knock searches, broad general warrants, pre-conviction asset forfeiture — we see the magnitude of the problem.

National Review’s John Fund has observed: “The proliferation of paramilitary federal SWAT teams inevitably brings abuses that have nothing to do with either drugs or terrorism. Many of the raids they conduct are against harmless, often innocent, Americans who typically are accused of nonviolent civil or administrative violations.”

Fund also notes: “By 2005, at least 80 percent of towns with a population between 25,000 and 50,000 people had their own SWAT team,” and that “the number of raids conducted by local police SWAT teams has gone from 3,000 a year in the 1980s to over 50,000 a year [in 2014].”

Given these developments, it’s natural for many Americans — especially minorities, given the racial disparities in policing — to feel like their government is targeting them. Anyone who thinks that race does not still, even if inadvertently, skew the application of criminal justice isn’t paying close enough attention. Our prisons are full of black and brown men and women who are serving inappropriately long and harsh sentences for nonviolent mistakes in their youth.

Our Justice Department should be leading the conversation on reforming the system, not setting it back further.

Americans must never sacrifice their liberty for an elusive and dangerous — or false — security. The militarization of our law enforcement is just another symptom of an overall problem that stems from an unprecedented expansion of government power — where we are repeatedly asked to make such “liberty for what we tell you is security” tradeoffs.

Ultimately, if we sacrifice the very nature of the institutions we have set up to enforce the law, what kind of law will we end up enforcing?

When Congress returns, I will reintroduce my Stop Militarizing Our Law Enforcement Act, which will address this issue by prohibiting the federal transfer of militarized equipment to state and local law enforcement, including MRAP vehicles, drones and armored vehicles transferred through the Department of Defense’s 1033, Department of Justice’s Byrne Justice Assistance Grant and Department of Homeland Security’s grant programs.

This prohibition only applies to offensive equipment and not defensive equipment, such as body armor. It’ll increase these programs’ transparency and accountability and also help us find out how federal agencies are using military-style training and equipment.

I have been encouraged by how much progress we have made under President Trump to roll back overzealous government and get unnecessary regulation off the American people’s backs. In cutting onerous regulations, the president has made clear he is listening to the American people.

I urge President Trump and Attorney General Sessions to listen to the concerns Americans have raised regarding police militarization and reconsider their decision.

Today, the Senate voted on U.S. Senator and physician Rand Paul’s amendment, the Obamacare Repeal Reconciliation Act, which was introduced as Amendment No. 271 to the American Healthcare Act of 2017 last night. The vote was 45-55.Dr. Paul released the following remarks:I’m a physician, an eye surgeon. I’ve spent my entire life in medicine. I have seen the disaster that is Obamacare up close.Let’s review why we are here. Why must we repeal Obamacare?Obamacare premiums have doubled in the individual market in just a few short years.Obamacare insurance rules and mandates have caused 4.7 million plan cancellations across 30 states.800,000 fewer jobs because of Obamacare mandates and costs.50% of Americans have only one choice in insurance.Many counties now have NO insurance choices. 25,000 Kentuckians who make less than $25,000 a year pay Obamacare FINES instead of getting insurance, because they can’t afford the prices. Kentuckians who can’t afford Obamacare Insurance pay over $16 million in fines.This bill is a clean repeal – though only a partial repeal. Arcane Senate rules prevent a complete repeal from being considered today. So, this bill is just the beginning. This bill begins to unravel the nightmare of Obamacare. Let me be very clear, large parts of Obamacare remain after this repeal bill today. What this bill does, though, is force both sides to come together to find a bipartisan solution during the two year transition. The bill gives us a two year window for both sides of the aisle to come together to discover how we can get MORE insurance for MORE people for LESS cost.Currently there are still 27 million people without insurance even after Obamacare. Half of them say they can’t get insurance because it is still too expensive. One answer to this terrible situation is to legalize the formation of nationwide health associations. We need to do more for people to get insurance. I want everyone in America to be able to join a group, for protection against illness and to bring costs down.Right now, if you have group insurance, if you work for a large corporation like Toyota or Ford, you’re protected if you get really sick. You don’t lose your job or your coverage. But if you’re an individual or small business, you are left out. I want to change the rules to allow nearly any group to offer insurance, From your local Chamber of Commerce to your credit union, to your professional association. Instead of talking about how many fewer people we can cover, let’s talk about how many more we could cover if we legalize choice. We also have to bring competition to healthcare, and let the market bring down prices. We can only do that by dramatically expanding the size and scope of Health Savings Accounts.Since we won’t be doing that today, we have more work to do, and we should keep working at it.But we have to start somewhere. And where we should start is where we all promised we would be – here to repeal Obamacare.We all ran on it. All but one of us voted for it in 2015. It is simple. If you are against the taxes and mandates of Obamacare you have an obligation to vote for this bill today.Of course it isn’t the last word. Some may want more repeal, and we can try that. Some have different replace ideas – I’m one of those people – and we have to keep working on THAT. But today let’s pass a repeal, one with a two year window to wind down, and let’s do what we told the American people we would do.There are some, especially on the other side or in the media – or both – who ask, “Can Republicans govern?” That’s a good question. I say yes, but I tell you this – it’s hard to say yes if we cant do something as simple as keeping our word. As simple as voting today how we voted before, when we were asking to be in charge.If you tell people you’re going to do something, do it. It’s just that simple.Let’s repeal Obamacare.",1,http://www.wlky.com/article/paul-senate-votes-on-dr-rand-pauls-obamacare-repeal-amendment/10366009
599,Paul,Rand,nytimes,"Kalief Browder, a 16-year-old New Yorker, was arrested on charges of stealing a backpack in 2010. To ensure he would show up for trial, and because of a previous offense, the judge set bail at $3,000. But his family could not afford to pay. So Mr. Browder was sent to jail on Rikers Island to await his day in court. He spent the next three years there before the charges were dismissed. Haunted by his experience, Mr. Browder hanged himself in 2015.

Our justice system was designed with a promise: to treat all people equally. Yet that doesn’t happen for many of the 450,000 Americans who sit in jail today awaiting trial because they cannot afford to pay bail.

Whether someone stays in jail or not is far too often determined by wealth or social connections, even though just a few days behind bars can cost people their job, home, custody of their children — or their life.

There are those who insist Republicans must act as a team to repeal Obamacare. I agree — if the topic is repeal. Every Republican has run on repealing Obamacare for seven years, and all but one voted for clean repeal in 2015.

Now we have a president who will sign it and is asking for us to send the same repeal bill to his desk, one that repeals with a two-year window to work with. We also have a majority leader who has said he will bring this vote to the Senate floor.

I’m encouraged by the fact that the original bill, which did not keep our promises to repeal, is dead. It’s a great step forward that we plan to take up the 2015 repeal bill instead.

Now it’s time to act on the things our team has stood for.

I watched my colleagues campaign on repeal. I watched them vote on it in 2015. Now I’m calling for them to keep their promises, stick to the principles they ran on and voted on, and end the harm Obamacare has done to our health care system.

OUR VIEW

The Obamacare repeal fiasco

The previous Senate bill kept the majority of the Obamacare taxes and spending, and it had a $200 billion bailout for insurance companies.

The 2015 clean repeal is far better; it simply offers repeal and a two-year window to fix our broken system.

The burden is now on those who promised to repeal Obamacare to keep their word. I was keeping mine when I opposed a bill that did not repeal it, and I’m keeping mine now.

I will vote for less than what I want. I will compromise on how much repeal we can get, as long as it is not coupled with massive new spending and bailouts.

For those who’ve been saying “join the team,” I say I’m right here, holding up each and every one of the promises every member of my caucus made to repeal. I’m looking at every one of the dozens of votes my “team” cast when President Obama was in office to repeal.

Let’s do what the team promised.

Obamacare left 27 million people without health insurance and created a situation where insurance premiums have risen over 100 percent. Of the 27 million people that Obamacare left behind, about half of them don’t buy insurance because it is too expensive.

So any debate to repeal and replace Obamacare must acknowledge the failures of Obamacare and try to insure more people at a lower price.

There has been a lot of discussion of Obamacare, Medicaid and other aspects of our varied and largely broken healthcare system over recent months – and a lot of bad information. But mostly, there have just been a lot of ideas that don’t address the core problem of access and price of insurance.

As most of you know, I am not a career politician, and I don’t think like one, which makes it difficult sometimes in Washington.

In my over 20 years as a doctor, I’ve seen both the good and the bad aspects of healthcare. One of the main reasons I ran for the Senate was to combat the Obamacare takeover of our healthcare system.

Now, make no mistake, healthcare was broken before Obamacare, but Obamacare accelerated the decline and increased prices at alarming rates.

I am in favor of repeal and I’ve been fighting for it since I was elected. Obamacare cost too much, mandated too much, told the states what to do too much – and still left 27 million people uninsured.

We can and must do better.

There are many facets to healthcare reform, but today I want to address one that is not getting enough attention as part of a fix – Association Health Plans.

Currently, under the law, certain types of employer groups may band together to offer insurance to their members and employees, thus allowing them to have a larger group and more leverage to get protections against pre-existing conditions and high prices.

But the current association rules are strict and the hoops that people have to jump through to join them and comply with regulations are still too steep. Additionally, not enough groups and individuals are even eligible to form or join these plans.

On Thursday in Kentucky, I will have a discussion with members of many groups who could become leaders in offering group insurance to their members, and to individuals.

From the chambers of commerce to credit unions, the farm bureaus to fast food franchisees, there are millions of Kentuckians who could be eligible to join such groups if we change the laws and regulations as part of the Obamacare repeal debate.

More:McConnell touches on health care bill, protesters rally in Elizabethtown

My goal is that no one has to go at it alone. A husband and wife’s plumbing business should not have to buy insurance as a pool of two, dreading that one of them may get cancer. Association plans would let plumbers, carpenters, welders or any type of small business band together to get group health insurance.

The biggest problem in health insurance is if you are on your own or part of a very small group, you have no leverage for prices, and if someone gets very sick, then you don’t have the protection of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of people sharing the risk.

That’s what association health plans do. They let individuals join an association that then buys health insurance as a group. Not just those I mentioned above or those I'm meeting with in Louisville. Literally any group - your church, the NRA, the ACLU. Any group of people who choose to do so could offer cheaper, better health insurance.

Right now, the insurance companies don’t treat people in the individual or small group market like valued customers whose business must be won. Why? They don’t have to.

I want to turn the tables on this out of control big business. I want the consumer to be king. I want the insurance companies to come on bended knee to these large groups, forced to negotiate.

This can happen. The credit unions in Kentucky have over 800,000 members. The groups who appeared with me have over a million. But really, this is not limited, at all. We should make it so that no Kentuckian, no American has to go it alone to get health insurance.

More:McConnell's health plan would wreak havoc on Kentucky | Jason Bailey

More:GOP proposes better health care | Mitch McConnell

So what’s stopping this? You won’t be surprised to learn it's the federal government and crony capitalism.

Who opposes this plan? Insurance companies. Who has been in the room writing the fake Obamacare Lite plans put out so far by Congress? Insurance company lobbyists.

We can do better. At my urging, and with the help of President Trump, a portion of my Association plan is in the Senate bill right now. But it is nowhere near enough and doesn’t fix the problem. I’ll be working with my colleagues to get it right, and I’m hopeful we can.

As the bill reads now, the association plans would still be subject to Obamacare regulations and would not be allowed to organize innovative self-insured plans.

We need to repeal Obamacare, now. But we need solutions like a full Association plan included as part of what happens next, or we do a disservice to those we represent.

I want every Kentuckian to have good, inexpensive insurance. I want them to have the protections of group coverage like guaranteed insurance and coverage for preexisting conditions. That’s what my Association Health Plans provision helps ensure.

603,Paul,Rand,reason,"Engagement or embargo? That is the question not just in Cuba but also in places like Iran, Russia, and China. Should we trade, or should we withhold our trade in hopes of changing the behavior of other nations? Which will have more impact?

For over half a century, we have had an embargo with Cuba. Not only did the Castros survive it, but they milked it for everything it was worth. As the only source of information on the island for decades, they stoked the nationalism of those Cubans who remained in Cuba to blame America for any of their shortages, instead of the true culprit: socialism.

The embargo did nothing to defeat Castro—absolutely nothing. It is possible it kept him in power longer because of the ability the embargo gave him to further control his people.

President Obama and I agreed on very little, but his slight opening with Cuba was one of those areas. Since his decision to allow more travel and commerce with Cuba, Americans are visiting in record numbers and on their trips they are displaying the greatness of American capitalism: wealth. Every dollar left in the hands of cab drivers, hotel workers, waitresses, and valets is a show of what awaits Cubans if they reject socialism.

We can't spread democracy through force, as we have shown time and again in our recent foreign policy. But we can model capitalism to the world, export it through our people and goods, and win the debate without one bullet being fired.

When I was a kid, my family was virulently anti-communist. We still are. We were opposed to the opening of ""Red"" China and all that entailed. We were wrong. China may still have aspects of socialism, but no one can argue it isn't more capitalist and freer than before we opened diplomatic relations and trade.

Instead of hiding our capitalism behind a failed embargo, we should tear down the walls of trade restriction and open up travel and trade even more. Instead of allowing the socialists to continue their propaganda unopposed, we should have sufficient confidence in capitalism to let them go head to head.

Let's see what Cubans will choose when they come face to face with iPhones, modern cars, and tourists with fistfuls of dollars buying Cuban services and goods.

I don't fear the government of Cuba. I don't fear competition between capitalism and socialism. End the embargo now and capitalism, like the endless waves that lap the Cuban shore, will erode the weak grasp of socialism, day by day, until freedom comes to Cuba—not with a beach landing of troops, but in the realization that poverty and socialism are, in fact, synonyms.",1,http://reason.com/archives/2017/06/20/capitalism-should-be-our-weapon-of-choic

Story highlights Rand Paul: Congressmen and staffers hid behind a bathroom, cars and the dugout as shots were fired The senator describes the agonizing moments after a shooter attacked GOP members of Congress at baseball practice

Editor’s Note: Rand Paul is a US senator from Kentucky. He serves on the Foreign Relations Committee and the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. The views expressed in this commentary are his own.

(CNN) —

Gunshots! Shooter! Run! I’m not likely to forget that sequence anytime soon. The trauma of the congressional baseball shooting will unfold and recapitulate itself in our minds for some time.

The shooter was a blur to me, but I was close enough to see the dirt fly with each barrage of bullets. Thank God for the diameter of a large willow oak just outside the right field batting cage.

The first shot rang out in isolation. We weren’t even sure, at first, if it was a shot. But there was no question when the next five to 10 shots followed. Rep. Steve Scalise was shot in that first barrage. Rep. Trent Kelly stared down the muzzle from less than 20 yards, and the shooter missed repeatedly as he careened, zigzagging toward the first base dugout.

Rand Paul Rand Paul

From my spot against the oak tree, I watched as Zach Barth and another staffer raced along the warning track from left field toward my location in right field. As they dove into the dirt, face first, the bullets sent puffs of dirt around them.

A 20-foot chain-link fence separated me from them. I felt helpless, with no weapon and no way to reach the wounded. Rep. Scalise lay at second base, but no one could help him.

Large, long series of shots rang out across the field.

The decision

The decision for all of us was: Should I stay or should I go? Which was riskier – to make a run for it and expose yourself as a target or stay still and hope the shooter tired of using you as target practice? The danger in staying was that if the shooter advanced and came to point-blank range, it would be certain death.

As these thoughts went through my head, another barrage of bullets hit the warning track five feet to my right. A staff member jumped up to try to climb the 20-foot fence just as Barth cried out, “I’m hit.” Within two to three seconds, the staffer cleared the chain-link fence, like Spider-Man in fast motion.

He and I crouched behind the oak tree. The question returned. Should we stay or should we go? Should we risk the run across the open field over two more chain-link fences, or should we remain behind the tree?

Shouts spread. The shooter was on the move. Though we could only catch glimpses of him, we could see congressmen and staffers shuffling and repositioning themselves behind the concrete bathroom, the cinder block dugout, and various cars.

Should we stay or should we go? We knew that we had two Capitol Police officers there, Rep. Scalise’s security detail. Were they already dead? We took about 10 seconds to deliberate, not exactly a pros and con debate but monosyllabic, “Run? Yeah …”

To escape, we had to leave the protective shadow of our oak and sprint across an open field. We would become targets again. As we jumped up to run, we heard the report of pistol fire from Capitol Police. The cavalry had arrived.

In the ensuing gunbattle, Special Agents Crystal Griner and David Bailey showed heroism above and beyond the call of duty. Advancing against the shooter, they were seriously outgunned in terms of firepower. The shooter had a long-range semiautomatic rifle, and the police only had handguns. The report of the pistols, though, was louder than the rifle and more explosive in sound.

Without the presence of these brave officers, both of whom were wounded in taking down the shooter, it would have been a massacre. They saved dozens of lives.

Aftereffects

Later in the day, in the aftermath of a killing field, as I walk through the basement of the Capitol, a loud cart follows me, banging – BANG, banging at every bump. BANG, BANG but not really bang. Not really death impending, but death in verisimilitude – jarring, loud, and uninvited but not shooting or exploding.

Every passerby that didn’t smile – didn’t shoot. Didn’t shoot. For that I am grateful.

It’s unlikely they will shoot again. Be smart, look at the percentages. Of course, unlikely, very unlikely. A random event, nothing more.

Sitting alone near the end of the day, fortunate to savor or perhaps castigate the sun’s last rays, I feel the sun on my face. I want to deflect the sun’s gaze. I want to rebuke her for providing aid and abetting the sight lines in today’s killing field.

Aim, aim what is the aim. The rifle juts through the chain-link fence, spraying hate and blowing bone and muscle to bits in a show of nothing.

Apparently, the Courier-Journal would prefer to stoke the flames of partisanship and division rather than engage their readers in an honest discussion of the problems plaguing our criminal justice system.

In a recently printed guest editorial, the Courier turns an issue with significant bipartisan support into a partisan attack on a Republican.

For my entire public life, I have worked with both Democrats and Republicans to eradicate the racial injustices of the war on drugs. I have co-authored a variety of bipartisan bills to reform criminal justice on all fronts.

I’ve advocated to end mandatory minimum sentencing, which has too often unfairly dealt out decades-long sentences for nonviolent offenses.

► The mass incarceration problem – or, why Sessions shouldn’t bring back mandatory minimums

► Sen. Rand Paul not an example of profile in courage| Aaron Kall

I’ve supported second chances legislation to allow nonviolent offenders to expunge their records after a period of good behavior.

With Democrat Corey Booker, I introduced a bill to end solitary confinement for juveniles, and I’ve introduced bills addressing the militarization of our police force, body cameras for police, and civil asset forfeiture procedures.

I've introduced bipartisan legislation to restore voting rights to those who have served their time. I even traveled to Frankfort to testify before Kentucky’s General Assembly as they worked on state legislation to restore voting rights.

I have made these issues an important part of my work in the Senate because we cannot afford to let the current system run its destructive course on the most vulnerable members of our society.

Yet for that work, the thanks I get from the liberal media is to print attacks that discount years of bipartisan efforts to make our criminal system more just.

When the media refuses to even acknowledge one of the few areas of bipartisan agreement, is it any wonder that our political system is so polarized?

Sadly, this is not the first time I’ve been under fire for supporting an issue that is probably one of the best chances we have for finding bipartisan compromise in Washington.

I went out of my way to compliment President Obama on criminal justice reform, a President with whom I disagreed on many, many fronts. I have great working relationships with those across the aisle on this issue.

This newspaper does a disservice to reform efforts by continuing to let their editorial pages serve as a bastion of partisanship.

I urge the media to delve a bit deeper before allowing one of our best chances at bipartisanship to be sullied by petty partisan attacks. The Courier-Journal’s readers deserve better.

606,Paul,Rand,latimes,"In a speech delivered to Congress on July 4, 1821, John Quincy Adams rightly argued that America must hold high the banner for “Freedom, Independence, Peace,” but exercise restraint in foreign policy. He understood that we should offer our prayers and voices to others who seek liberty while avoiding the trap of venturing abroad “in search of monsters to destroy.”

While we don’t oppose all overseas military action, Adams’ warning has never been more relevant. After 15 years of war, Americans are weary of constant conflict, and our interventions have made us less safe. When we were attacked on 9/11, most Americans, including the two of us, supported striking the terrorists in Afghanistan. But our limited and appropriate mission to defend our homeland has morphed into a broader pursuit of regime change abroad.

Invading Iraq, toppling Gadhafi in Libya and interfering in Yemen and Syria have been strategic blunders. After 9/11, Al Qaeda was mostly contained in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Today, the Islamic State network is spreading across the world. We have destabilized regions and, in so doing, helped strengthen a new generation of terror groups.

We should reject the establishment consensus, whether neocon or neoliberal, which too readily defaults to the use of force.

Defending our country remains the federal government’s foremost constitutional priority. To effectively carry out that responsibility, we must craft a 21st century foreign policy based on the restraint Adams envisioned. We should reject the establishment consensus, whether neocon or neoliberal, which too readily defaults to the use of force in the pursuit of perceived American interests and values when there is no direct threat to our national security.

Consider the case of Yemen. Without approval by the American people’s representatives, we have been supplying arms to Saudi Arabia, which is using them to fight the Houthi rebels, a group closely aligned with Iran. We have no stake in this fight, and the policy of arming Saudi Arabia has been counterproductive. Yet we are being blamed by civilians in Yemen, who hold us responsible for the bombs the Saudis are dropping. Nearly 17 million Yemenis face the threat of famine because of this conflict.

What makes matters worse is that the Saudis have formed a temporary alliance of convenience with Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, also known as AQAP, to fight the Houthi rebels. AQAP is our enemy. The group claimed credit for the attack on the USS Cole in 2000, the “underwear bomber” in 2009 and the intercepted plot to send bombs to Jewish organizations in Chicago in 2010. By supporting the Saudi war against the Houthis, we are creating a vacuum for Al Qaeda to gain power.

Instead of changing course in light of Saudi Arabia’s track record and actions, our country is agreeing to what a Pentagon official called “the largest single arms deal in American history” with the Saudis, involving nearly $110 billion in immediate defense equipment sales and training, and up to $350 billion across 10 years. The deal comes less than a year after Congress voted overwhelmingly to allow the families of 9/11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia. Such a comprehensive commitment with an ally that is questionable at best, especially one with a poor human rights record, should not be finalized without thorough congressional debate, and we therefore support a joint resolution of disapproval in order to force such a discussion. Continuing to send billions of dollars in arms to Saudi Arabia will only further destabilize the region without eradicating terrorism.

Syria is another example of failed American foreign policy. Our calls for regime change since 2011 have helped make Syria a magnet for terrorism. No one disputes that Syrian President Bashar Assad is a brutal dictator. But instead of intervening, which has made matters worse, we should seek regional cease-fires involving all the players in the region, including Russia and Turkey. A political solution will not be easy, but reactive and sporadic military involvement does nothing to advance peace.

American political leaders have been tempted to call for military action in recent decades because that is seen as decisive and strong, but restraint often takes more resolve and strength. “Supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy’s resistance without fighting,” wrote the ancient Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu. “If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.”

By repeatedly undertaking interventions without a proper understanding of our enemy, we have weakened our national security. We need to return to the founding principles articulated by Adams; we need to craft a foreign policy that reflects our values yet does not prioritize the use of our power.

Story highlights Rand Paul: This isn't about legalizing drugs -- it is about making the punishment more fitting and not ruining lives Paul urges the attorney general to reconsider his recent action

Editor’s Note: Rand Paul is a US senator from Kentucky. He serves on the Foreign Relations Committee and the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. The views expressed in this commentary are his own.

(CNN) —

The attorney general on Friday made an unfortunate announcement that will impact the lives of millions of Americans: he issued new instructions for prosecutors to charge suspects with the most serious provable offenses, “those that carry the most substantial guidelines sentence, including mandatory minimum sentences.”

Rand Paul Rand Paul

Mandatory minimum sentences have unfairly and disproportionately incarcerated a generation of minorities. Eric Holder, the attorney general under President Obama, issued guidelines to U.S. Attorneys that they should refrain from seeking long sentences for nonviolent drug offenders.

I agreed with him then and still do. In fact, I’m the author of a bipartisan bill with Senator Leahy to change the law on this matter. Until we pass that bill, though, the discretion on enforcement – and the lives of many young drug offenders – lies with the current attorney general

The attorney general’s new guidelines, a reversal of a policy that was working, will accentuate the injustice in our criminal justice system. We should be treating our nation’s drug epidemic for what it is – a public health crisis, not an excuse to send people to prison and turn a mistake into a tragedy.

And make no mistake, the lives of many drug offenders are ruined the day they receive that long sentence the attorney general wants them to have.

If I told you that one out of three African-American males is forbidden by law from voting, you might think I was talking about Jim Crow 50 years ago.

Yet today, a third of African-American males are still prevented from voting, primarily because of the War on Drugs.

The War on Drugs has disproportionately affected young black males.

The ACLU reports that blacks are four to five times likelier to be convicted for drug possession, although surveys indicate that blacks and whites use drugs at similar rates. The majority of illegal drug users and dealers nationwide are white, but three-fourths of all people in prison for drug offenses are African American or Latino.

Why are the arrest rates so lopsided? Because it is easier to go into urban areas and make arrests than suburban areas. Arrest statistics matter when cities apply for federal grants. It doesn’t take much imagination to understand that it’s easier to round up, arrest, and convict poor kids than it is to convict rich kids.

The San Jose Mercury News reviewed nearly 700,000 criminal cases that were matched by crime and criminal history of the defendant. Their analysis showed that whites of similar situation were far more successful in the plea bargaining process and “virtually every stage of pretrial negotiation” than their African-American and Latino counterparts.

I know a guy about my age in Kentucky who was arrested and convicted for growing marijuana plants in his apartment closet in college.

Thirty years later, he still can’t vote, can’t own a gun, and, when he looks for work, he must check the box – the box that basically says, “I’m a convicted felon, and I guess I’ll always be one.”

He hasn’t been arrested or convicted for 30 years – but still can’t vote or have his Second Amendment rights. Getting a job is nearly impossible for him.

Mandatory sentencing automatically imposes a minimum number of years in prison for specific crimes – usually related to drugs.

By design, mandatory sentencing laws take discretion away from judges so as to impose harsh sentences, regardless of circumstances. Our prison population, meanwhile, has increased by over 700% since the 1980s, and 90% of them are nonviolent offenders. The costs of our prison system now approach nearly $100 billion a year. It costs too much, in both the impact on people’s lives and on our tax dollars.

I want to go the opposite way from the attorney general. That’s why I’ve partnered with Senator Leahy and once again will be reintroducing the Justice Safety Valve Act.

This isn’t about legalizing drugs. It is about making the punishment more fitting and not ruining more lives.

The legislation is short and simple. It amends current law to grant judges authority to impose a sentence below a statutory mandatory minimum.

In other words, we are not repealing mandatory minimums on the books – we are merely allowing a judge to issue a sentence below a mandatory minimum if certain requirements are met.

We need this legislation because while there is an existing safety valve in current law, it is very limited. It has a strict five-part test, and only about 23% of all drug offenders qualified for the safety valve.

The injustice of mandatory minimum sentences is impossible to ignore when you hear the stories of the victims.

John Horner was a 46-year-old father of three when he sold some of his prescription painkillers to a friend.

His friend turned out to be a police informant, and he was charged with dealing drugs. Horner pleaded guilty and was later sentenced to the mandatory minimum of 25 years in jail.

As I testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Edward Clay was an 18-year-old and a first-time offender when he was caught with less than 2 ounces of cocaine. He received 10 years in jail from a mandatory minimum sentence.

Weldon Angelos was a 24-year-old who was sentenced to 55 years in prison for selling marijuana three times.

Former federal judge Timothy Lewis recalls a case where he had to send a 19-year-old to prison for 10 years for conspiracy. What was the “conspiracy”?

This young man had been in a car where drugs were found. I don’t know about you, but I’m pretty sure one of us might have been in a car in our youth where someone might have had drugs. Before the arrest, according to news reports, this young man was going to be the first in his family to go to college.

Each case should be judged on its own merits. Mandatory minimums prevent this from happening.

Mandatory minimum sentencing has done little to address the very real problem of drug abuse while also doing great damage by destroying so many lives, and most Americans now realize it.

Proposition 47 recently passed in California, and it has spurred a cultural change in the way nonviolent drug offenders are treated, resulting in more than 13,000 fewer prisoners and a savings of $150 million, according to a Stanford Law School study.

Pew Research found that 67% of Americans want drug offenders to get treatment, not prison, and over 60% want an end to mandatory minimum sentences.

I urge the attorney general to reconsider his recent action. But even more importantly, I urge my colleagues to consider bipartisan legislation to fix this problem in the law where it should be handled. Congress can end this injustice, and I look forward to leading this fight for justice.",1,http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/15/opinions/sessions-is-wrong-rand-paul-opinion/index.html
608,Paul,Rand,cnn,"Story highlights Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham have advocated for more US military intervention in Syria Sen. Rand Paul: This is a mistake -- we need a new foreign policy doctrine, which states we only intervene if it's in our national security interests

Editor’s Note: Rand Paul is the junior US senator from Kentucky. He serves on the Foreign Relations Committee and the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. The views expressed in this commentary are his own.

(CNN) —

Recently, Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham predictably but mistakenly called for greater United States military involvement in the Syrian civil war, proving they have learned nothing from our history in the Middle East.

It seems that every dictator and every atrocity in that region is met with a call for action without a thought to consequences. Those who wish to send our soldiers to “take care” of every atrocity in the world might want to take a glance at Maplecroft’s Human Rights Risk Atlas, which currently lists 35 countries as extreme risks for committing atrocities. Are we prepared to send our military to right the wrongs of all 35 countries?

Of course, Americans were horrified by the use of chemical weapons in Syria on innocent people. But there are horrors all around the world, and surely the suggestion is not that we battle them all.

United States military action is not to be taken lightly. It should be thoughtful, measured, constitutional – and decisive for a victory. For over two decades, we have acted as a traffic cop in the Middle East – sanctions, bombings, no-fly zones, invasions, occupations, policing, nation-building.

American foreign policy now requires a dramatic shift. It must be governed by the question: What are our vital national security interests in the region?

President Trump was elected in no small measure because he castigated the previous administration for the disastrous and destabilizing Iraq War. He lampooned the Obama/Clinton decision to bomb Libya and send it into chaos. And Trump warned, rightfully, that Syria was a quagmire, ripe with opportunities for mistakes and catastrophic consequences to world peace.

For years, I have argued against intervention in the Syrian civil war, and I have done so under both Democrat and Republican presidents.

It isn’t that there aren’t atrocities. There are – and on both sides of the war. But sometimes discerning the good guys from the bad is not possible. Sometimes, there is no good side in war.

Assad, like so many strong hands in the Middle East, is an autocrat and likely much worse. But some of the armies that fight him and seek his ouster are radical Islamic rebels allied with the worst elements on Earth – al Nusra, al Qaeda and, yes, ISIS.

Furthermore, America has no national security interest in this war. It isn’t clear that the Islamic rebels who would replace Assad would be friends of America. However, it is clear that the 2 million Christians in Syria who are protected by Assad fear his ouster.

So why do my colleagues persist in their quest for more war and intervention? I don’t know, but one quote from Senator McCain’s website offers some clarity: “Our strategy cannot presume to separate the fight against [ISIS] from the Syrian people’s fight against the Assad regime. They are inextricably connected.”

It is true that the fight against ISIS and the civil war in Syria are connected, but not in the way neocons infer. Overthrowing Assad may actually lead to an Islamist regime that finds common ground with ISIS, not America.

The neocons’ worldview is warped and naïve. Neocons see military action as the first option, and they never look back to view the mayhem that follows.

In short, they either ignore or do not understand the unintended consequences of our military involvement in the Middle East.

Not only did neocons fail to anticipate that the Iraq War would embolden Iran, but they predicted the opposite – that a yearning for democracy would transform the Middle East into a replica of the West.

They also insisted that the US, along with Qatar and Saudi Arabia, arm the Islamic rebels in Syria. While the arms were not decisive, they were just enough to keep the civil war alive – just enough to push Assad back and create the vacuum in which ISIS grew and thrived.

In Libya, these same neocons argued one year to arm Gadhafi and argued the next year to depose him. I warned that deposing Gadhafi would lead to chaos, and it did. With the iron fist of Gadhafi gone, militant Islamic groups festered and grew, including ISIS. America is at greater risk of Libyan terrorism today than it was before the overthrow of Gadhafi.

The neocons were wrong about the war in Libya. They were wrong about the war in Iraq. And they are wrong about getting us further mired in the civil war in Syria. They’ve been wrong about every major intervention of the past two decades in the Middle East. Maybe it is time to quit listening to them.

Recently, I introduced legislation to ensure that no American weapons are given to terrorist groups, especially in Syria. You wouldn’t think we would have to have legislation to prevent our own government from sending arms to terrorists, but there it is.

In fact, the Syrian civil war involves dozens of “rebel” groups fighting Assad and literally hundreds of splinter militias. One observer reported as many as 1,500 different groups fighting Assad.

McCain and Graham still argue we must depose Assad because Iran is on his side. Well, ISIS is on the other side. Which is worse? I don’t know for sure, but I know neither are our friends, and neither should be treated as such.

McCain and Graham also argue that we must fight in Yemen because Iran supports the Houthi rebels. Yet one major group also fighting the Houthis is al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Is it possible that our involvement in Yemen could also lead to such chaos that al Qaeda picks up the pieces and exploits the vacuum much as ISIS did in Syria?

Any military action against Syria or Yemen must come with the consent of Congress. There are two reasons for this. The first and most obvious is that it is what our Constitution says, and we should follow it. But the second is because we need thoughtful debate. We need to examine consequences. We need to look at enemies and allies, actions and reactions.

Is military action in our vital interest? What goal do we have? Can it be achieved? What are the costs and consequences?

President Trump ran on an America First platform, advocating for less intervention in global affairs, and I support him on that. I hope he keeps to it, and I urge my colleagues in Congress to do their job and hold him to it.",1,http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/18/opinions/less-military-intervention-opinion-paul/index.html
609,Paul,Rand,rare,"By Ron Paul, Rand Paul

As presidents and Congresses come and go, the addiction to busting the budget remains; its voraciousness fueled by the same enabler, the Federal Reserve.

While it took our nation more than 225 years to accumulate nearly $20 trillion in debt (and much, much more if you factor in unfunded liabilities), our central bank can put Americans on the hook for trillions without blinking by simply creating whatever funds it needs out of thin air. Its status as “the lender of last resort” signs a blank check for politicians to spend to their heart’s content without worrying about the immediate consequences.

When pressed to at least provide some measure of substantive transparency for its actions, the Fed tells the American people it’s none of their business.

We disagree.

Time and again, we have been asked to justify our desire to Audit the Fed. Time and again, we answer, how can we afford not to?

Though one of the Fed’s mandates is to keep prices stable, a trip to the grocery store is enough to prove its failure. The Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank’s own website hosts a calculator that reveals that what would have cost you $1 in 1913 would now require $24.

RELATED: Rand Paul and Thomas Massie introduce “Audit the Fed,” and what Donald Trump thinks about it is encouraging

We may chuckle when parents and grandparents tell children about the “good ol’ days” of lower prices, but the massive decline in the dollar’s value is no laughing matter for seniors whose supposed safety nests don’t stretch as far as they used to, or for frugal consumers who are punished for saving for rainy days. Politicians pile debt onto future generations’ backs, and the Federal Reserve makes sure they can’t ever hope to pay for it.

Meanwhile, Americans struggling to cover basic costs watch as favored parties receive bailout after bailout from friends in high places. If you care about income inequality, then you must start fostering change by holding the Fed accountable.

The big-spending status quo is powerfully entrenched, but a growing political coalition, driven by overwhelming support from the American people, is fighting to assert Congress’s right to know the facts about how the Fed is using its tremendous power.

Audit the Fed, which has now passed the U.S. House of Representatives multiple times and received majority support in the Senate, removes the shackles on how the nonpartisan, independent Government Accountability Office (GAO) can examine the Fed.

The bill would authorize the first-ever thorough audit of the entire Federal Reserve System in its 104-year history, including its agreements with foreign governments and central banks, discount window and open market operations, member bank reserves, and Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) directives. Congress would require the GAO to conduct this audit within one year of the bill’s passage and to report back within 90 days of its completion.

The biggest opponent to auditing the Fed is, unsurprisingly, the Fed.

The Fed harnesses its moneymaking machine in an all-out lobbying effort against transparency on its activities. The conflict of interest, with the Fed lobbying against its own audit, should make us question whether such lobbying should be forbidden by law.

The Fed argues that: 1.) It is already audited enough; and 2.) Any further “interference” would threaten its independence and represent a takeover of monetary policy by Congress, with disastrous results.

While it is true that an outside auditor examines the Fed’s financial statements, and that an inspector general also keeps an eye on its activities, Paul-Martin Foss, President and Executive Director of the Carl Menger Center for the Study of Money and Banking, reminds us that both are appointed by and answer to either the Federal Reserve Board or the Fed Chair directly. This amounts to, as he states, the Fed saying, “[W]e can audit ourselves if we want to, so just trust us that we’ve investigated ourselves and found ourselves fully trustworthy.”

The GAO’s opinion is that, while the Fed is subject to limited audits, “no complete audit is done.” The GAO went on to say, “We do not see how we can satisfactorily audit the Federal Reserve System without authority to examine the largest single category of financial transactions and assets that it has.”

As Foss further observes, “The full audit called for by Audit the Fed would necessarily include not just a financial audit (if that were determined to be necessary), but performance and operational audits as GAO is accustomed to carrying out.”

Perhaps the Fed’s real fear is the American people finding out the extent to which the Emperor is parading around without his clothes.

“If the Fed examiners were set upon the Fed’s own documents—unlabeled documents—to pass judgment on the Fed’s capacity to survive the difficulties it faces in credit, it would shut this institution down,” Grant’s Interest Rate Observer founder and editor Jim Grant said on CNBC in 2009 – when the Fed held half the assets it does now.

In December, Alex J. Pollock, former CEO and president of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago, estimated the Fed would fail if subjected to “a simple and standard interest rate stress test,” with it being “highly likely” the Fed would “be hugely insolvent on a mark-to-market basis.”

What about the Fed’s second argument? Would increased scrutiny threaten its independence or create a global economic catastrophe?

When Congress required the Fed to reveal the details of more than 21,000 transactions it made during the 2008 financial crisis that involved trillions of dollars, the sun still rose and Fed officials went about their jobs without a congressman sitting in each of their offices.

Do you remember the chaos that erupted after Bloomberg won its lawsuit to force the Fed to disclose even more details about the specific recipients of its emergency lending?

Neither do we, despite the Fed promising doom.

Though the Fed will claim that further soliciting the GAO’s opinions on its policies and procedures would cause irreparable harm, recent history proves otherwise.

After Congress expanded the GAO’s authority to allow for a one-time audit of the Fed’s emergency activities between Dec. 1, 2007, and July 21, 2010, the GAO made seven recommendations to improve the Fed’s operations, noting, “The Federal Reserve Board agreed that GAO’s recommendations would benefit its response to future crises and agreed to strongly consider how best to respond to them.”

Advertisement

In a letter also included in the GAO’s report, Fed General Counsel Scott Alvarez wrote, “We appreciate the GAO’s substantial efforts to review these complex programs and the understanding of these programs that your report demonstrates.”

There is no reason not to keep expecting such professionalism and expertise from the GAO.

RELATED: Thomas Massie has introduced a bill to audit the Fed, and it has a real chance of passing

Throughout its existence, the Fed’s manipulation of interest rates and expansion of the money supply have led to malinvestment and helped generate a devastating boom-and-bust cycle that routinely levels our economy as the market corrects course.

We hear no shortage of tales about how the Fed rescued the nation during the financial crisis, but this is the equivalent of someone pushing you into an icy lake and expecting you to thank them for saving your life after they pull you out.

Time is of the essence. The Federal Reserve cannot be allowed to continue denying full accountability to the hundreds of millions of people whose financial futures hinge on its actions.

We cannot wait until we find ourselves slipping underwater to ask the tough questions about what keeps putting us there.

With President Trump indicating his support for Audit the Fed, the window of opportunity has never been more open.

If we hope to ever rein in spending, change a failed status quo and avoid paralyzing downturns, we must not let it slip away.

611,Paul,Rand,kentucky,"From my first days representing Kentucky in the U.S. Senate, I pledged to fight back against the Obama administration’s war on Kentucky coal, which imposed suffocating regulations on our hardworking miners and their families.

While we may have once used words such as “struggling” and “devastated” to report on the state of our coal industry, I think it’s time for a new outlook and description: “optimistic.”

We’ve rarely, if ever, seen a positive news story about Eastern Kentucky’s coal industry over the past eight years, but we learned last month that a mine in Knott County is set to reopen, bringing at least 60 new jobs to the area. They hope to double that number in the near future.

Knott County is just one early example of the opportunity that awaits Kentucky, and it demonstrates one of the key reasons why I have led the efforts to repeal the stifling overregulation that has plagued Kentucky’s coal industry.

With the new administration joining in our efforts to lift major roadblocks, I’m excited about the possibilities for revitalizing our coal industry in the years ahead.

While the battle we have waged against the war on coal has spanned several years, many of our biggest wins so far have come in the first 100 days of President Donald Trump’s new administration. Last month, the president eagerly signed legislation I co-sponsored to repeal the Stream Protection Rule.

Before its repeal, the Stream Protection Rule’s provisions included prohibiting coal mining within 100 feet of streams and shutting down surface mining if an animal species that was merely being proposed for listing as endangered or threatened was present in or near the mine.

It also allowed federal bureaucrats to preempt and overrule state permitting standards. The National Mining Association had estimated that the rule endangered one-third of coal-related jobs and could have cost billions in lost federal and state tax revenue.

In addition to cosponsoring the repeal legislation, I previously wrote letters to the Department of Interior and Office of Surface Mining demanding changes to the rule, and I cosponsored the STREAM Act in the 114th Congress to delay the rule’s implementation. After our efforts, finally having this rule repealed is a huge victory for Kentucky.

Following the repeal of the Stream Protection Rule, the president recently signed an executive order calling for a review and reconsideration of the Waters of the U.S. (WOTUS) Rule, which has been a top priority for both the coal industry and Kentucky’s farmers.

Trump’s order requested the term “navigable waters” be redefined in a manner consistent with the Scalia opinion in Rapanos v. United States. Since that definition is identical to the one already used in my Defense of Environment and Property Act, I mailed a copy of my bill to newly confirmed Environmental Protection Agency Director Scott Pruitt to assist in the rewriting.

I originally introduced the Defense of Environment and Property Act to push back on the Obama administration EPA and Army Corps of Engineers’ WOTUS rule because it significantly expanded the definition of waters in the U.S. to include non-navigable waters, certain dry land, drains, ditches, small ponds and even depressions in fields that are only wet after heavy rains.

To address such an outrageous rule that could essentially affect every mine permit in the country, my legislation called for defining navigable waters as navigable-in-fact and relatively permanent bodies of water.

Repealing the WOTUS rule, one of the most egregious examples of government overreach on Kentucky miners, has always been a top priority of mine, and I applaud the president for continuing his efforts to provide regulatory relief to all Americans.

These swift and recent positive developments in rolling back the regulations responsible for so much loss and devastation in Kentucky are a sign of the many opportunities for our commonwealth going forward.

I promised to lead the fight against Obama’s war on coal in Kentucky. While I am extremely proud of my record in keeping that promise, I am even more proud to reaffirm my commitment to working on your behalf to ensure a brighter future for Kentucky.",1,http://www.kentucky.com/opinion/op-ed/article139255823.html

Said Paul of McCain, “he makes a really, really strong case for term limits. I think maybe he’s past his prime. I think maybe he’s gotten a little bit unhinged.”

McCain’s nose was put out of joint when Paul had left the Senate floor after objecting to McCain’s call for Montenegro to be admitted to NATO. Whatever you think of it Paul’s objection, it was based on principle: a desire to have the US avoid additional military entanglements and obligations. The notion that the senator from Kentucky is a secret Kremlin agent is absurd.

JOHN MCCAIN: I note the senator from Kentucky leaving the floor without justification or any rationale for the action that he has just taken. That is really remarkable, that a senator, blocking a treaty that is supported by the overwhelming number, perhaps 98 at least of his colleagues would come to the floor and object and walk away. And walk away. The only conclusion you can draw when he walks away is he has no argument to be made. He has no justification for his objection to having a small nation be part of NATO that is under assault from the Russians. So, I repeat again, the senator from Kentucky is now working for Vladimir Putin. WILLIE GEIST: Senator, a little context around that. MIKA BRZEZINSKI: Wow! Whuh!

613,Paul,Rand,cincinnati,"Rand Paul

U.S. Sen. Rand Paul is a Kentucky Republican and physician.

In 2011, I went to Washington for the same reason why I became a physician – to diagnose problems and prescribe solutions. Yet, it doesn’t take being a doctor or a senator to figure out that the current state of our health care system under Obamacare is an enormous problem.

Just ask your neighbor. Premiums are exploding. The state run health co-ops are mostly bankrupt. Many individuals who gained subsidized insurance are still, for all practical purposes, without insurance because the deductibles are beyond the reach of low-income workers.

I agree with my colleagues that we must repeal this disastrous system, however, that only solves half of the problem. We absolutely owe it to the American people to do so with a replacement plan in place, which is why I have proposed one. My plan brings choice to the health care marketplace, and it legalizes inexpensive insurance.

This week I introduced S. 222, the Obamacare Replacement Act, to provide Congress with a health care plan grounded in broadly supported conservative reforms that is ready for an immediate vote after Obamacare is repealed. My proposal would expand access to higher-quality, lower-cost health care for more Americans, regardless of medical history.

Getting government out of the American people’s way and putting them back in charge of their own health care decisions will deliver a strong, efficient system that doesn’t force them to empty out their pockets to cover their medical bills.

The Obamacare Replacement Act empowers the American people to do many things. It allows us to choose inexpensive insurance free of government dictates, save unlimited amounts in a health savings account and have wider options for using those funds, buy insurance across state lines, and join together in voluntary associations to gain the leverage of being part of a large insurance pool.

My plan ensures that Americans can purchase the health insurance coverage that best fits their needs by eliminating Obamacare’s essential health benefits requirement, along with other restrictive coverage and plan requirements, to once again make low-cost insurance options available to American consumers.

It also protects individuals with pre-existing conditions by providing a two-year open-enrollment period under which individuals with pre-existing conditions can obtain coverage.

The plan helps more people save to buy health insurance and cover medical costs by authorizing a tax credit (up to $5,000 per taxpayer) for individuals and families that contribute to HSAs, removes the annual cap on HSAs so individuals can make unlimited contributions, and allows those HSA funds to be used for a wide range of uses. Its money you have designated for health related costs, so you should be able to use it for things like prescription and OTC drugs, dietary supplements, nutrition and physical exercise expenses, and direct primary care, among others.

By allowing individuals to deduct the cost of their health insurance from their income and payroll taxes, my plan also equalizes the tax treatment of the purchase of health insurance for individuals and employers. It frees more Americans to purchase and maintain insurance apart from their work status, but does not interfere with employer-provided coverage for Americans who prefer those plans.

It helps individuals join together to purchase insurance by allowing small business owners and individuals to band together across state lines through their membership in a trade or professional association to purchase health coverage for their families and employees at a lower cost. It also widens access to the group market and spreads out the risk, enhancing the ability of individuals and small businesses to decrease costs, increase administrative efficiencies, and further protect those with pre-existing conditions.

Additionally, my plan allows for the purchase of insurance across state lines by creating an interstate market that allows insurers who are licensed to sell policies in one state to offer them to residents of any other state.

And lastly, it also paves the way for driving down entitlement costs in Medicaid and better serving families in poverty. My plan enables states to fully exercise their current waiver flexibilities and provides them with expanded freedom if they create innovative plan designs.

I have led the charge to replace Obamacare at the same time it is repealed, and am encouraged that fellow Republicans including President Trump and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan have joined me in calling for simultaneous action.

There is no excuse for waiting to craft an alternative until after we repeal Obamacare, and the Obamacare Replacement Act charts a new path forward that will insure the most people possible at the lowest price.",1,http://www.cincinnati.com/story/opinion/contributors/2017/01/30/empowering-health-care-plan-america/97105200/

615,Paul,Rand,nationalinterest,"War without congressional debate seems to be a recipe for war without rhyme, reason or any concept of victory.

Editor’s Note: TNI’s January/February 2017 print issue convened a symposium on the most significant national-security challenge awaiting the Trump administration. You can find all entries in the series here.

THE GREATEST security challenge facing the next president is the national debt. The United States owes nearly $20 trillion, not counting the nearly $50 trillion entitlement debt. The time approaches when America will no longer be able to manage its debt and fund national defense.

The debt continues to explode because Congress ignores the limitations of the Constitution. The federal government was intended to be limited to specific, enumerated powers, and yet, today’s federal government reaches its meddling hand far afield from the Founders’ intent. To minimize new debt and manage existing debt, officials will have to resurrect the separation-of-powers doctrine. Only by separating power from the president will spending be contained. Power that is not constitutionally given to the president should be taken back by Congress, the states and, ultimately, the people.

The greatest and most ominous of government’s power is the ability to go to war. The Founders extensively debated and then concluded that on issues of war, Congress would be required to give its authority. Neoconservatives and their disciples, elected and academic, feel the constitutional requirement for Congress to declare war is no longer applicable. Under President Obama’s tenure, the United States has gone to war in Libya, Syria and Iraq, and engaged in military activities in Yemen without congressional authority. In each instance, the case can be made that unilateral presidential intervention led to less stability, and less security for the United States.

Military interventions are expensive. The money the United States spends on interventions could otherwise be used for weapons of deterrence or upkeep of its decaying nuclear arsenal.

Restoring the constitutional mandate that war needs to be authorized by Congress would go a long way to ensuring that a full-throated debate occurs before troops are placed in harm’s way.

The Trump administration can take the lead here, but nothing prevents Congress from engaging in what is maybe its most important constitutional role: war authorization. Congress should be resolute and either pass an appropriate authorization or disapproval for current U.S. interventions while simultaneously repealing the 2001 and 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force.

The ease with which Congress allows the president to engage in several “hotspots” around the world tends to make these regions less safe. Members don’t want to appear soft on terrorism or unsupportive of the military. It is easier for them to politicize the ineptitude of an administration’s strategy than to exert proper oversight.

Time after time, the United States has intervened around the world without congressional approval. In Libya, the overthrow of Muammar el-Qaddafi resulted in chaos, leaving an inept Libyan government and large swathes of territory under ISIS control.

Yemen is another engagement in which Congress has had little to no input. The military and advisory support given to Saudi Arabia fosters future jihadists that want to destroy America. The United States is providing air refueling support; intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance; and U.S. military hardware to Riyadh. In the summer of 2016, a fifteen-year-old boy was killed by a U.S. cluster bomb. In October, Saudi forces repeatedly bombed a funeral in Yemen, in which 140 people were killed and as many as five hundred injured.

The Yemeni crisis has been going on for almost two years with no signs of abatement. Houthi rebels have already tried to attack the United States by launching two separate missile attacks on the USS Mason. Let’s not forget the USS Cole bombing, which also occurred in Yemen. Another unfortunate attack on a U.S. vessel or other American personnel will predictably incite calls for more intervention. Lawmakers must see the writing on the wall. When a president sends U.S. troops on an operation not supported by Congress, often America becomes stuck in a stalemate. War without congressional debate seems to be a recipe for war without rhyme, reason or any concept of victory.

In September, a few members and I attempted to insert congressional prerogative in matters of national security. Congress took a vote on stopping the sale of 153 Abrams tanks to Saudi Arabia. Over seventy senators voted to allow the sale. Ironically, these same senators voted overwhelmingly, the same day, to allow 9/11 victims to sue the Saudi government for its possible role in the 2001 bombings. Although we lost the vote in the Senate, President Obama eventually decided to suspend the sale of U.S. air-dropped munitions. In this instance, loud voices in Congress did change a foreign-policy outcome.

The implications of not adhering to constitutionally established roles have huge consequences for U.S. foreign policy. Strategic, operational and tactical considerations by a president and military leaders are of immense consequence. All of these powers are derived from the Constitution. If the Constitution isn’t adhered to as the Founding Fathers intended, the nation and American credibility abroad suffer.

Speaking on “Face the Nation” on CBS on Sunday, the Kentucky Republican lashed out against two of the people President-elect Donald Trump is said to be considering for secretary of state: John Bolton and Rudy Giuliani. “Both Bolton and Giuliani have advocated for regime change in Iran, and that doesn’t sound like diplomacy, that sounds like war,” Paul said. “Giuliani and Bolton are out there on the extreme. I don’t think they are very diplomatic. Bolton might be better as a secretary of war, but he is certainly not a diplomat or someone who acts in a diplomatic way or thinks that diplomacy might be an alternative to war.” Bolton was ambassador to the U.N. under President George W. Bush; Giuliani is a former mayor of New York and a loyal Trump supporter. Paul said there will be 52 Republicans in the next Senate, a slim majority. “It is a very close vote.” (The 52nd would be Louisiana’s John Kennedy, who is facing Democrat Foster Campbell in a December runoff.) “There are several potential Republican votes against someone like a Bolton, possibly Giuliani,” Paul said. “The other thing Giuliani is going to stir up is it is going to be a hornet’s nest on all the financial stuff,” he said, without elaborating. Separately, Paul said he agrees with Sen. John McCain that waterboarding is torture. Trump has indicated he would bring back waterboarding as an interrogation tool. “We should telegraph to the world that we are better than this, and we do not torture,” Paul said.

Paul also said that President-Elect Trump’s choice to head the Central Intelligence Agency, Kansas Congressman Mike Pompeo would have to be questioned to determined if he intends to continue the spy agencies long-standing opposition to any effort to resume waterboarding of present or future terrorism suspects or other detainees. The newly re-elected Kentucky Senator, who had been running an ill-fated Presidential campaign in which he was one of the few candidates to speak out against Trump during candidate debates, also expressed skepticism about Trump’s selection of Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions as Attorney General, most notably due to Sessions positions on issues such as the War On Drugs, including the efforts of some states to legalize marijuana for medicinal or recreational use, and his opposition to criminal justice and sentencing reform, two issues that Senator Paul has been involved with over the past several years along with a small group of Republicans and Democratic Senators such as New Jersey Senator Cory Booker. As a Senator, Sessions has been a vocal opponent of many of the proposals that have been proposed by the groups backing Paul’s proposals, such as continuing the Justice Department’s ‘hands off’ approach to enforcing marijuana laws inside the borders of states where it has been legalized or decriminalized, reforming the Federal mandatory minimum sentencing practices, reforming sentencing guidelines that disproportionately impact minorities and the poor, and changing laws that make it difficult for criminals who have served their sentences and completed parole without violations from resuming normal lives, many of which have been shown to have a tendency to lead former felons to turn to crime again.

Paul’s warnings bring to mind the question of just how much of a barrier Congress is likely to be to President-Elect Trump once he takes office. It’s true that many Republicans in the House and Senate refused to have anything to do with Trump during the campaign, and that several outright stated that they would not vote for him, but in many cases it’s likely that was a political calculation based on the presumption that being associated with Trump would hurt them in the General Election and the presumption, seemingly supported by the polling evidence, that Hillary Clinton would be the 45th President of the United States. Now that Trump has won the election, Republicans are once again bending over backwards to curry favor with the President-Elect and, in some cases, obsequiously answering his call to come to visit him amid speculation they are being considered for a cabinet position. Additionally, party leaders in the House and Senate are currying favor with the President-Elect in the hope that he’ll back their agenda on issues such as spending and tax reform. Given that, one wonders just how intense the oversight of the Trump Administration will be by the Congress charged with doing so. Democrats will no doubt be critical of the incoming President, but because they are in the minority they have limited authority to hold hearings or conduct investigations unless they have the support of some Republicans. The fact that Senator Paul appears to be willing to question the incoming Administration is hardly surprising since he’s done that rather consistently in the past, but it seems doubtful that many other Republicans will join him except perhaps in extreme circumstances.",1,http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/rand-paul-speaks-out-against-potential-trump-nominees/
617,Paul,Rand,thehill,"One of the top contenders to be President-elect Donald Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE’s secretary of State would enter the position with less experience than any predecessor in decades, raising anxiety among some foreign policy experts.



Rudy Giuliani, the outspoken former mayor of New York, was one of Trump’s most loyal allies during his campaign. He’s said to be at the top of Trump’s list for Foggy Bottom but has virtually no foreign policy experience.

Questions about his ties as a private citizen to foreign entities is another potential problem.Giuliani would fit within Trump's promise to place relative outsiders at senior posts throughout government. And his experience running the city of New York and as a federal prosecutor could bode well for his capacity to manage large institutions such as the State Department.His views on Muslim extremism and his pugilistic brand of politics could also be seen as pluses by Trump and Stephen Bannon, the former Breitbart News executive set to be a senior adviser to the new GOP president.While mayor, Giuliani capitalized on the United Nations’ location in Manhattan as an occasional political foil.He needled diplomats about their street parking privileges and in 1995 had Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, ejected from the Lincoln Center during a concert celebrating the U.N.’s 50th anniversary. Giuliani has characterized the Arafat incident as a stand against the Palestinian violence against Israelis.Yet this anti-statesman approach has won Giuliani barbs from members of both parties, and many Democrats would be almost certain to pull out all the stops to block his confirmation.Critics argue he could be in over his head.“You’re going to take a president with no experience and you’re going to have a secretary of State with no experience and you’re going to have a coherent foreign policy? I don’t think so,” said Dennis Jett, a former diplomat who is now an international affairs professor at Pennsylvania State University.It’s not entirely clear that Giuliani, who met with the president-elect at Trump Tower multiple times this week, is the top contender for the State Department job.He does seem almost certain to get a prized position, however.Kellyanne Conway, Trump’s campaign manager, said Thursday on “CBS This Morning” that Giuliani is “a leading contender for any number of positions.”“He's incredibly loyal to Donald Trump. He was very important during the campaign,” she added.Former United Nations Ambassador John Bolton is also rumored to be a top contender for the State Department post, in what would be a more traditional pick. Yet Bolton is no less controversial than Giuliani, given a history of bellicose rhetoric and a famously gruff demeanor.Giuliani has never displayed a deep love of international affairs, as can be typical of top U.S. diplomats, nor has he risen through the ranks of federal government.“I have friends all over the world,” Giuliani told The New York Times in an interview published this week. “When you become the mayor, you become interested in foreign policy. When I left, my major work was legal and security around the world.”As mayor of New York during 9/11, his political life has been profoundly affected by Islamic extremists, and he appears ready to adopt a muscular approach toward Muslim nations. Along with retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, who is reportedly a top contender for national security adviser, Giuliani, could dramatically refocus the U.S.’s engagement with countries in the Middle East and North Africa.“ISIS, short-term, I believe, is our greatest danger,” Giuliani said during an appearance at the Wall Street Journal CEO Council on Monday, referring to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. “And not because ISIS is in Iraq and in Syria, but because ISIS did something al Qaeda never did — ISIS was able to spread itself around the world.”Giuliani’s leadership abilities are a trait that could help him at the State Department and in international gatherings.“His public persona is one thing and that will be disquieting to many,” said Ronald Neumann, a longtime diplomat who now leads the American Academy of Diplomacy.“But he also has some serious organizational experience. And after that, we’ll just have to wait and see.”“Knowing substance is important, but no secretary of State is going to know the substance of every place we have an issue, let alone every place we’re going to have an issue on our watch,” he added.If confirmed, Giuliani would head to work helping to recruit dozens of senior and mid-level State Department officials who would be responsible for the day-to-day work of diplomacy.Those selections could be more influential than anything Giuliani himself does.Giuliani’s confirmation, however, would be far from guaranteed.Sen.(R-Ky.) has promised to “do whatever I can to stop” Giuliani or Bolton from become secretary of State, criticizing their hawkish views and support for the war in Iraq.Giuliani has also faced intense scrutiny for consulting work he did after leaving the mayor’s office in New York.Among other clients, Giuliani’s firm has represented Wall Street banks, major pharmaceutical companies, the government of Qatar and TransCanada, which is building the controversial Keystone XL pipeline that had been under review at the State Department.The most controversial, however, is easily an Iranian opposition organization that had previously sided with former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and was listed as a terrorist group while it paid Giuliani to give supportive speeches. The organization, known as the Mujahedin-e Khalq, or the M.E.K., was taken off of the State Department’s terror list in 2012 after an intense lobbying campaign that included advertisements on the sides of buses in downtown Washington.Trump could lose just two Republican votes for his nominees, assuming Democrats join forces in opposition and a Republican wins a runoff election in Louisiana. If Paul is one opponent, the margin slims to just one.But Paul promises he’s not alone.“Several” Senate Republicans would be similarly “uncomfortable” with either a Giuliani or Bolton nomination, the Kentucky lawmaker said",1,http://thehill.com/policy/nationalsecurity/306644-questions-cloud-giuliani-push

Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin (R), who backed Trump in the primary, is a possibility to head the Interior Department. Some lawmakers question whether she would be up to speed on policy and note she has a penchant for going off script — something that Cabinet members are urged not to do.

New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R), who Trump said earlier this year would make a great attorney general, has the “Bridgegate” scandal hanging over his head. Two former associates of the governor were convicted earlier this month of fraud, conspiracy and a civil rights violation after closing lanes on the George Washington Bridge in 2013 in an act of political retribution.

Giuliani and Bolton face immediate problems because of their vocal support for the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

“I’ll do whatever I can to stop either, either Giuliani or Bolton, because I don’t think that they support the president-elect’s foreign policy views,” Paul told reporters Wednesday.

Paul noted that Giuliani was an outspoken proponent of former President George W. Bush’s Iraq policy and backed his aggressive foreign policy stances.

“There are quotes showing him being an unabashed supporter of the Iraq War. I think there are quotes that actually are similar to Bolton’s quotes on bombing Iran,” he added.

In the 2008 Republican presidential primary, Giuliani and Paul’s father, then-Rep. Ron Paul (Texas), repeatedly clashed over foreign policy.

Paul said “there are several members of the [Senate Republican] caucus who are uncomfortable with Bolton and Giuliani.”

On the Senate floor, Trump can lose only two GOP votes if Democrats are unified against a nominee.

Bolton argued in an interview last year that the decision to overthrow Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein was correct, and expressed support in 2011 for toppling Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi, which later created a power vacuum.

During Bush’s second term, the Senate refused to confirm Bolton as U.S. ambassador to the U.N. He was later tapped for the post via recess appointment.

Trump’s picks will have a lower hurdle to clear compared with most of President Obama’s Cabinet selections. That’s because Democrats changed the rules in 2013 to allow executive branch and most judicial nominees to clear with simple-majority votes. Before then, nominees needed 60 votes to overcome filibusters.

Paul’s opposition alone will make it difficult to move either Giuliani or Bolton to the floor if nominated to serve as secretary of State.

Republicans control 10 seats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which has jurisdiction over nominees to the State Department, and Democrats have nine seats on the panel.

If Paul votes no, the committee would not be able to report Giuliani or Bolton with a favorable recommendation, though it would still be able to discharge the nomination to the floor.

Other Senate Republicans argued Wednesday that Trump should be given wide latitude to choose his Cabinet.

“I would support either one of them,” said McCain.

“They both have a lot of experience,” said Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska). “I’d be inclined to be supportive once I hear some of their views.”

His name has been floated in recent days.

Giuliani faces scrutiny over his business dealings, which could drag out any confirmation process.

His firm, Giuliani Partners, has done work for TransCanada, the builder of the controversial Keystone XL oil pipeline, the government of Qatar and TriGlobal Strategic Ventures, a company that helps facilitate business deals in the former Soviet Union.

Trump, who has never held elected office and ran for president as an outsider, is expected to nominate several Cabinet officers from outside the Washington establishment, raising concerns among some Senate Republicans about what might pop up during confirmation hearings.

“Hopefully they don’t nominate anybody who can’t be confirmed for something other than an ideological reason,” said one Republican senator.

Some Republicans worry that messy confirmation fights could slow Trump’s momentum during his first 100 days in office and undermine high-priority policy fights, such as the repeal of ­ObamaCare.

Democrats say if the president-elect taps Giuliani or Bolton, no one should expect any help from their side of the aisle.

“I think Bolton and Giuliani would have a tough time getting to 51. Some Republicans are going to have a difficult time swallowing some unabashed interventionist who’s unapologetic of the Iraq War,” said Sen.

Trump’s pick to replace the late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court could face a bruising confirmation process, especially because that nominee can be filibustered and would likely need 60 votes.

Lawmakers overwhelmingly backed a bill to extend the banking, defense and energy sanctions by a vote of 419-1. Current sanctions are set to expire at the end of this year.

Libertarian Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) was the only member to vote against the measure.

The international accord reached by the U.S., Iran and other countries last year agrees to lift certain sanctions in exchange for limits on the country's nuclear program.

Lawmakers said extending the sanctions that have been in place for the last 10 years would ensure the U.S. has a backup plan to hold Iran accountable if it violates the nuclear deal.

622,Paul,Rand,thehill,"Some conservatives are calling for the filibuster to be obliterated as a means to expedite the repeal of Obamacare and to quickly confirm a Trump nominee to the Supreme Court. They also want to use it to fast track the Trump agenda. Using the so-called “Nuclear Option” to rid the Senate of the filibuster would be a long-term mistake and would set back the conservative movement for years.

The Hill reported on Nov. 12, 2016, “While Republicans are relishing the chance to pursue an ambitious agenda in 2017, conservatives warn that one thing stands in their way: the Senate filibuster. The 60-vote procedural threshold could stymie GOP priorities in the upper chamber, disappointing voters who handed Republicans control of the White House and Congress for the first time in nearly a decade.” The article cited Gov. Scott Walker (R-Wis.), never-Trump activist and Wisconsin radio host Charlie Sykes, and Hugh Hewitt. They are wrong because obliterating the filibuster would make any Trump victories short lived because, inevitably, Democrats will take power again sometime in the future, and they will use the same tool to repeal all of the Trump agenda. In politics, all victories are temporary.

The most important action item for conservatives is to fully repeal Obamacare. It is not necessary to get rid of the filibuster to repeal Obamacare. There are two reconciliation measures available to Congress in the next year to push through tax reform and Obamacare repeal. Although the reconciliation process is complicated, ultimately the majority can do what they want in reconciliation if they have the will to pile as much as they can in a reconciliation repeal measure.

ADVERTISEMENT

Avik Roy of Forbes disagrees. He wrote on Nov. 9, 2016 that he doubts that reconciliation can be used to fully repeal Obamacare, yet concedes that nothing prevents this new Congress from passing a quick partial repeal bill to start the process of full repeal. Roy wrote that there is precedent for using reconciliation for partial repeal. “Republicans did this in January, when they sent to President Obama’s desk the Restoring Americans’ Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act of 2015. That bill would have repealed Obamacare’s tax hikes, Medicaid expansion, and insurance exchange subsidies, affecting more than 15 million enrollees. That’s a big deal, because it affects $2 trillion of spending over the next decade.” It is possible for a patient Republican majority to chip away and ultimately fully repeal if they are smart.

I think Roy is wrong. Reconciliation can be used to fully repeal Obamacare on day one of President Donald J. Trump’s tenure. Remember, in the last Congress both the House and Senate Budget committees issued specific instructions to use reconciliation to repeal Obamacare. They vetted a one-line repeal and faced resistance from the Senate Parliamentarian, a Senate staffer. The Senate can vote for a different interpretation of the rule. It is possible for the senators to vote to make a judgement as to whether full repeal of Obamacare passes the test of whether a one sentence repeal impacts spending and revenue of the federal government for a fiscal year by a vote of the full Senate.

One conservative leader was quoted in The Hill last year saying that full repeal is within the preview of reconciliation. “We think from what we’ve heard there’s a really credible case to be made that the one-sentence repeal instruction for reconciliation passes all the tests,” said Dan Holler, spokesman for Heritage Action for America. “From our vantage point, we think there are credible arguments that you can get all of ObamaCare [repealed] through reconciliation and that’s where the focus of lawmakers should be as the budget comes up and as instructions are written,” he added. He is right.

As for nominations, that is a whole different set of issues. When Sen. Harry Reid Harry Mason ReidThe Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Tax March - CDC in limbo on J&J vax verdict; Rep. Brady retiring Biden to tap Erika Moritsugu as new Asian American and Pacific Islander liaison White House races clock to beat GOP attacks MORE (D-Nev.) used the Nuclear Option to rid the Senate of the filibuster on judicial nominations exempting the Supreme Court, it was understood by insiders that the Supreme Court exemption made zero sense. Reid used the argument that the filibuster was unconstitutional as applied to nominations, yet he exempted the Supreme Court. Although I would like to see the filibuster on all nominations reinstated, it makes logical sense to go the other way and obliterate the filibuster on Supreme Court nominations to make the Senate precedent consistent. Conservatives would cheer and get revenge on Reid by forcing through a conservative nomination to the Court. This outcome would prove that Sen. Reid’s use of the nuclear option was a major partisan mistake by Democrats.

As for the legislative filibuster, Republicans would be making a big mistake if they used strong arm tactics to ignore the cloture rule, Rule XXII of the Senate’s standing rules. When you look at rule, there is no distinction between the filibuster on nominations and legislation. Ultimately, the most effective senators who use the filibuster to slow bad ideas are conservatives who are fighting their own leadership on bloated appropriations bills, warrantless wiretapping and the defunding of Obamacare using the power of the purse.

There is a case to be made to use the nuclear option on Supreme Court nominations as a way to bring some equity into the treatment of Obama nominees vis-a-vis Trump expected nominees. There is no compelling case to use the nuclear option to rid the Senate of the cloture rule and to convert the Senate into a smaller version of the House where individual senators would be stripped of all power. Conservatives supporting the obliteration of the filibuster need to take a step back before they blow up the Senate and make America’s laws less permanent.

625,Paul,Rand,kentucky,"As a doctor and father of three sons between ages 17 and 23, I know and appreciate firsthand both the value and cost of education. Education not only provides a sense of accomplishment and self-worth, but also opens doors to the future.

Finding a job post-education is the most important thing students need. Unfortunately, policies coming out of Washington in recent years have been holding back employers and making it harder for young people to find a job and more experienced workers to keep their jobs.

Our broken tax code, increased regulations and mandates on businesses such as Obamacare, and restricted access to business capital because of new financial regulations are choking businesses here and costing jobs that new graduates and others would love to have. I have been a leader in trying to roll back those harmful policies and will continue to do so every day that I have the privilege of serving the people of Kentucky.

We must ensure that Kentucky’s students get the best education possible. As in sports and business, competition causes everyone to increase their performance. We need more competition in education, not less. We must modernize Kentucky law to give parents and students greater choice in education. And federal policies need to stop disadvantaging families who seek better education for their children. That is why I have supported legislation allowing federal education dollars to follow the student to the school of their choice rather than the school of the government’s choice.

Traditional public schools will remain a primary education option and can provide a great education. Competition will help them improve, but they also need to be freed to innovate. Using modern video technologies, students in even the smallest school districts and most rural parts of Kentucky could have access to the country’s best experts and teachers, who could supplement the local teachers. Parents and local school officials know best what is needed and should be empowered to adopt innovations to meet the needs of their students.

But once again, Washington gets in the way through the mandates of No Child Left Behind. I have voted to give Kentucky schools more freedom, but Congress still needs to go further in empowering parents, states, and local schools to innovate and tailor the education experience for the needs of their students.

In addition to the challenge of finding a job in today’s economy, college graduates often face the financial burden of paying for their degree. For students about to graduate from high school, competition and choice could significantly lower the cost of their education, leading in turn to less of a student loan burden.

Community colleges, technical schools and private colleges may be the right option for many students, and by not incurring debt in the first place, those students will have less to repay when they do graduate. Once again, however, Washington is making the situation worse by targeting private colleges and schools, such as St. Catharine College, leading to their closure and removing options for students.

Pursuing education is an investment in the student’s future, and just as businesses are able to deduct the cost of their investments from taxes, students and graduates should too. I have a plan to allow the full cost of school to be deducted instead of just the interest on a student loan. Because recent graduates may not have enough income to fully deduct their costs, my bill allows the deductions to carry forward to future years, ensuring the full cost can be deducted.

My plan would make paying for school significantly more affordable for students and their families.",1,http://www.kentucky.com/opinion/op-ed/article111177757.html

Before I was elected to the Senate in 2010, I spent my career as an eye surgeon helping Kentuckians see better. I still perform free eye surgeries several times a year, including earlier this month in Louisville.

I approach my job serving Kentucky in the Senate just as I do in medicine — diagnose the problem and identify the cure.

Though the debate over accessible and affordable health care may appear to be a debate over health care, it is really a debate over what type of economic system delivers the care patients need at the best price. What our country has now is a system of government mandates and price controls, which looks nothing like a real market.

What we need is a true marketplace, where families can choose the coverage they need, not the coverage a bureaucrat in Washington thinks they need, and shop and negotiate for the best price. Unfortunately, Obamacare has done the opposite.

Obamacare has been a disaster for health-care affordability in this country and it is only getting worse. First, the lie that if you liked your doctor you could keep them was exposed. Next, rising costs made it impossible for many employers to keep offering coverage, which forced many families into an Obamacare exchange.

Now we learn that the suffering in Kentucky will only continue to rise next year as more insurers leave the state, leaving many counties with only one option. On top of that are significant premium increases, including a 23 percent increase by the only statewide plan.

In my medical practice, I saw firsthand how competition can and does work in health care. Because LASIK surgery and contact lenses are largely free from government price controls and mandates, there is a true market. Patients can and do shop around for the most affordable option.

The price of LASIK surgery has dropped from thousands of dollars per eye to hundreds of dollars per eye, all while the technology has improved. And because my customers could easily pick up the phone and check on prices, I frequently had to match the price they got somewhere else to keep their business.

True competition in the market for health insurance will lower the price of insurance, but Obamacare has effectively outlawed cheap health insurance. By mandating the type of insurance people have to buy, Obamacare forces individuals and families to pay for coverage of things they don’t want or don’t need.

True freedom of choice would let patients buy any type of insurance they want, including inexpensive insurance. Shouldn’t every American get to decide whether they’d rather buy expensive insurance or save that money for the future?

We can go a step further though, by removing limits on Health Savings Accounts to allow anyone to contribute and expand what the money can be used for. Families can contribute to these accounts and claim a tax deduction, and they pay no taxes when using the money to pay health expenses.

As these savings grow, families will be better prepared to handle their medical expenses and are empowered to shop around and get the best price, enabling a marketplace similar to that for LASIK.

We know the current system isn’t working for families or health-care providers, so perhaps it’s time to try something new. I say we try freedom. More freedom to choose and innovate, leading to more access and affordability, which will help ensure our health-care system remains the best in the world.",1,http://www.kentucky.com/opinion/op-ed/article109788167.html

Community Recorder guest columnist

When I’m meeting with Kentuckians all over the commonwealth, it is troubling how often the heroin epidemic tops the list of their communities’ most pressing issues and concerns.

It is a sad reality, and one you may already know, that the heroin and opioid epidemic has caused pain for communities all over Kentucky. Heroin overdose deaths in Kentucky are at a record high. Last year more people died from heroin in Kentucky than from automobile accidents. And the prevalence of heroin abuse has pushed our available treatment facilities and care providers to the absolute limit.

Kentucky sent me, a physician by trade for over 20 years, to Washington to diagnose the ills that afflict our country and provide solutions. And I have been leading the fight to provide greater treatment opportunities for patients struggling with drug addiction.

As part of that fight, I introduced the bipartisan TREAT Act with Senator Ed Markey. The bill calls for an increase in the number of patients a health care provider is allowed to treat with Suboxone, and gives states important flexibilities under the law.

Before the bill was passed, opiate dependence treatments, like Suboxone, could only be dispensed at a limited number of clinics, as federal law limits the number of patients that doctors can initially prescribe narcotic drugs to for the purpose of addiction treatment to 30.

Under those regulations, even if every doctor certified to prescribe Suboxone and other medication-assisted treatments provided it to the maximum number of patients, at least 1.2 million people suffering from opiate addiction would be unable to receive treatment.

These counterproductive and arbitrary rules sent down from Washington have left some addicts with limited treatment options – leaving them stuck in a cycle of dependency and hopelessness, a stark reality for the growing number of Kentuckians suffering with opiate abuse.

This summer, Congress passed and the President signed into law the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, which provides resources to prevent and treat opioid addiction, and includes key elements of the TREAT Act. Now more people will be able to get the treatment they need to break their addiction.

Specifically, the TREAT Act elements included increased treatment availability by enabling physician assistants and nurse practitioners to provide treatments, exempt office-administered prescriptions from the federal cap, and allows states to adjust the patient cap to meet the needs of their residents.

Fighting for this change for our Kentucky families has been a top priority of mine, which is why making parts of the TREAT Act a reality is an achievement I am incredibly proud of. In a time when Washington is plagued by partisan bickering, it is rare to achieve bipartisan agreement on something, so I am encouraged by those who have joined me in this fight against the heroin epidemic. Kentucky needs leaders to address the problems plaguing our communities, and I’m determined to continue to lead on this issue.

Green Party candidate Jill Stein pretty much signed up to join a wing of the Gary Johnson Gary Earl JohnsonNew Mexico lawmakers send recreational marijuana bills to governor Judge throws out murder convictions, releases men jailed for 24 years On The Trail: Making sense of Super Poll Sunday MORE club after she tweeted out a lot of world leaders she supports who aren’t actually the leaders of their respective nations, ironically in an attempt to mock Johnson.

Stein has clarified that she knows they aren't national leaders but said she admires ""real leaders, not politicians who sell their people out to the global economic elite for power."" So what universe does Stein live in, one where we can redefine our view of who really leads a country based on our beliefs?

Would Stein, if she were president, only meet with like-minded politicians and activists on a foreign visit because of her strong feelings against the elite-appeasing sell-outs actually in charge of whatever given country?

Libertarian Johnson made media waves in early September when he didn’t recognize what was meant by Aleppo, a city at the epicenter of the ongoing Syrian civil war. He recently followed it up by failing to name a single world leader during a televised town hall with MSNBC host Chris Matthews. His running mate Bill Weld helped him out, but it was a mess.

Presidential candidates making big knowledge gaffes are nothing new and even encyclopedic, well-briefed Hillary Clinton has her share, although she's more apt to just lie than gaffe, but these latest ones by Johnson and Stein seem to be in a new league. Some kind of farm league called Dude Am I Really Running for President?

There are mistakes and then there are gaps of knowledge and recollection that disqualify somebody from getting near national executive power (after all Johnson already does have executive experience at a state level as the former governor of New Mexico).

Republican candidate Donald Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE has also had various stunning knowledge gap gaffes for a presidential candidate, particularly on the nuclear triad and Kurds vs. Quds.

Brady retiring Anti-Asian hate crimes bill overcomes first Senate hurdle MORE to say at the time that Trump had “no clue” about the nuclear triad.

Paul consistently came across as one of the most knowledgeable Republicans during the primary season, and I was impressed by the breadth and specificity of his knowledge particularly on foreign affairs while covering his campaign stops in New Hampshire.

However Paul garnered only minimal momentum during the Republican race as the media storm and public enthusiasm centered on Trump and his rallies. Maybe knowledge and lucid arguments don’t get TV ratings?

That said, even Trump is clearly able to rattle off a number of world leaders he likes or dislikes. Plus, if he had a moment like Johnson he’d likely be savvy enough to cover it by saying something like “Right now, none of them. We have to do better,” or something of the sort, and then deflecting from naming a specific one.

Although a random person out of the phone book might be more likely to name Kim Kardashian than a world leader, with 84 million tuning in to the first presidential debate at Hofstra University it’s clear there’s intense interest among the public in the political process and who will lead, especially this time around.

That’s all to say it’s quite possible the average person off the street could do a better job than Johnson, Stein or Trump at answering a random question about politics or foreign affairs. And that’s actually a pretty scary prospect.

Yes, knowledge only goes so far — being decisive and delegating is a vital skill for a world leader, not being a reigning Jeopardy champion. Sure, advisors and the greater administration can compensate weak points. But, and it’s a big but, a national leader is supposed to have a basic grasp of the world.

For that matter, people probably should, too.

But the big pressure is on those hoping to lead. Before waxing poetic on grand theories of governance or world stewardship learn about what country is located where and some of the factors at work in different regions. The world doesn’t need more blissful ignorance, especially from those up on a high-horse about their grand ideals but neglecting to look around about what’s going on in the real world.

How can a potential world leader effectively talk policy when their political and geopolitical knowledge itself is operating at a very basic rough-sketch level? That only lets those world leaders who do know what they're talking about skate circles around the know-nothings,

Why don't some candidates know basic stuff? It’s a question worth asking, and there may well not be an answer in the form of a current presidential candidate.

630,Paul,Rand,thehill,"A congressional panel is planning to examine President Obama’s signature foreign asset reporting law that aims to target offshore tax evasion, Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) told The Hill Extra.

The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) requires that foreign financial institutions and other related entities report to the IRS certain foreign accounts held by U.S. taxpayers. The penalty for foreign institutions that fail to comply is a withholding rate of 30 percent on payments received from U.S. sources, including dividends and interests. The U.S. government has entered into bilateral intergovernmental agreements (IGAs) with dozens of countries to implement the tax reporting law abroad.

FATCA, enacted in 2010 as part of the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment (HIRE) Act, has faced a wide range of criticism involving U.S. treaty obligations, intrusion of other countries’ sovereignty and privacy rules.

“It was having a chilling effect not only on us being able to do business abroad but certainly from expats [who] are running into regulations. I don't believe they were the intent of the law originally,” said Meadows, who recently introduced a bill aiming to repeal FATCA.

The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee is currently planning to hold a FATCA-related hearing, but it is not yet on the schedule, according to Meadows’ spokesperson. The lawmaker is chairman of the committee's Government Operations Subcommittee. He said the hearing is likely to take place after Congress returns from the November elections.

Meadows didn't provide more details about the hearing, but his announcement follows the Sept. 7 release of his own bill that would repeal FATCA and other individual reporting requirements (H.R. 5935), that violate “Fourth Amendment privacy rights,” according to a press release.

The issue with privacy rights stem from the reporting requirements for foreign financial institutions. Currently, there are 63 active IGAs, but other countries with similar or pending bilateral agreements with the Treasury Department will have to now comply to a new set of IRS rules by the end of this year, according to a Congressional Research Service report dated the same day Meadows released his bill.

H.R. 5935 is “designed to hopefully give us still some accountability and transparency, but yet at the same time not make doing business with American citizens not the most difficult in the banking world,” Meadows said.

The bill is a result of the ""far reaching implications of some of the regulations in the banking industry from a foreign perspective,"" he added.

The measure is similar to one offered last year by Sen. Rand Paul Randal (Rand) Howard Paul15 Senate Republicans pledge to oppose lifting earmark ban The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Tax March - CDC in limbo on J&J vax verdict; Rep. Brady retiring Anti-Asian hate crimes bill overcomes first Senate hurdle MORE (R-Ky), who filed a suit against the Treasury Department in 2015 over IGAs. The U.S. District Court of Ohio, however, dismissed the case in April.

S. Michael Chittenden of Miller & Chevalier, however, said that these proposals ""do not have the likelihood of passing"" since similar efforts failed in the past. The Treasury Department has already poured a significant amount of resources to implement FATCA stateside and negotiate the IGAs with other countries, he added.

FATCA inspired a global trend of financial transparency, such as the common reporting standard launched by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

""FATCA is here to stay,"" Chittenden said.

Rahami, who authorities say planted homemade bombs in New York and New Jersey this month, was reported to the FBI by his father in 2014 after he stabbed family members in a domestic incident.

Mateen, who killed 49 people in a nightclub in Orlando, Fla., in June, was interviewed twice in 2014 by the FBI during an 11-month preliminary investigation.

Rahami was also flagged by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) when he returned from a trip to Pakistan earlier in the year. Border agents then reportedly alerted the FBI.

But after Rahami’s father reportedly recanted in an interview with the FBI, agents concluded that the stabbing incident was a domestic dispute. Rahami does not appear to have been interviewed.

“Sitting before you is a deeply flawed human being,” Comey affirmed Tuesday. “We are not perfect people. We aspire to be perfect.”

Comey at several junctures pushed back on Paul for his characterization of the facts but repeatedly argued that the agency “will go back and scrub our prior contact with that matter very, very carefully.”

The FBI head demurred on the question of how the bureau might have missed Rahami.

“This is an active investigation. This guy is alive and entitled to a fair trial. I don’t want to do anything that gives him an opportunity to claim that we deprived him of that right,” Comey argued.

“And secondly, I don’t know yet,” he said, saying investigators are focused on the current situation and have not yet done a retrospective analysis on how the FBI handled Rahami in 2014.

The attacks in New York and New Jersey highlighted the challenges that law enforcement officials face in identifying, tracking and preventing radicalized individuals from creating violence.

DHS head Jeh Johnson during the same hearing noted that the agency now has two new categories of terrorist attacks: “terrorist-enabled"" attacks and “terrorist-validated” attacks.

In the latter classification, a person who has no direct contact with a terrorist group carries out an attack that is then celebrated by that group.

Before now, President Obama had been seen as taking a lonely stance as the Saudi skeptic-in-chief.

Obama angered Saudi Arabia earlier this year in an interview with The Atlantic when he referred to the country as “free riders” and suggested it is too focused on its rivalry with Iran at the expense of broader regional stability.

Lawmakers repeatedly slammed Obama for turning his back on Saudi Arabia as he pursued the nuclear deal with Iran, the country’s traditional foe.

But the roles have now reversed. Obama on Friday vetoed a bill that would allow families of the 9/11 victims to sue the Saudi government in court. Obama argued the bill undermine sovereign immunity and open up U.S. diplomats and military service members to legal action overseas.

Congress is expected to override the veto next week — something that has never before happened in Obama’s tenure.

Cole Bockenfeld, deputy director for policy at the Project on Middle East Democracy, said Congress is more willing to question the U.S.-Saudi relationship for a few reasons.

First, there was Saudi Arabia’s crackdown after the Arab Spring in 2011. Then, there was a growing unease about the Kingdom’s global spread of Wahhabism, an ultraconservative Islam that is said to have inspired terrorist groups like the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Now there are growing worries about the civilian death toll in Yemen, where a Saudi-led, U.S.-supported coalition is fighting Iran-backed Houthi rebels.

“I wouldn’t go as far as to say it’s a shift against the relationship as a whole, but it’s an open questioning,” Bockenfeld said. “I think those questions have been there for some time. Now it’s just much more in the open.”

Bockenfeld compared the arms sale vote to one earlier this year to block a military aircraft sale to Pakistan, which garnered 24 votes in opposition. The Saudi vote being on par with, and even slightly edging out, the Pakistan vote might indicate Congress is beginning to view the two countries similarly — with “discomfort and ambiguity,” he said.

Bockenfeld anticipates congressional antipathy toward Saudi Arabia will continue to grow as the war in Yemen drags on.

“Some lawmakers will start looking at, are there other ways to try to influence the conduct of the Saudis,” he said. “The main component of U.S. support [for the coalition in Yemen] has been refueling Saudi bombers. I think there are some voices that will want to look into that.”

While voices of skepticism are growing louder, many lawmakers have remained steadfast in support of Saudi Arabia.

“Although we face challenges, Saudi Arabia is a critical U.S. partner as we deal with shared threats from Iran and ISIS,” House Foreign Affairs Chairman Ed Royce (R-Calif.) said in statement.

The war in Yemen was the chief issue raised by those who were pushing to block the arms sale to Saudi Arabia. In addition to civilian casualties, lawmakers fear the chaos has allowed for the growth of ISIS and al Qaeda, and that Saudi Arabia’s strikes are targeting neither group.

Sen. Rand Paul Randal (Rand) Howard Paul15 Senate Republicans pledge to oppose lifting earmark ban The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Tax March - CDC in limbo on J&J vax verdict; Rep. Brady retiring Anti-Asian hate crimes bill overcomes first Senate hurdle MORE (R-Ky.), who led the effort to block the sale with Murphy, described the 27 senators who supported the effort as a “growing coalition.”

“A growing coalition of legislators refused to sit idly by while the president inserts America into another war and an escalating arms race in an unstable region without congressional authorization or debate,"" Paul said in a statement after the vote. “As violent jihadists attack the West, the Saudis continue to fund madrassas that preach hatred and violence against the West.”

A bipartisan resolution was also introduced in the House to block the arms sale, though it’s unlikely to get a vote. Still, 64 House members recently signed a letter that expressed reservations about the deal.

“Saudi Arabia continues to spend billions of dollars funding the spread of the Wahhabi Salafist ideology that fuels groups like ISIS, al Qaeda and other jihadist groups around the world,” Rep. Tulsi Gabbard Tulsi GabbardNew co-chairs named for congressional caucus for millennials Tulsi Gabbard blasts new House rules on gender neutral language as 'height of hypocrisy' A vaccine, a Burrito and more: 7 lighter, memorable moments from 2020 MORE (D-Hawaii), one of the House resolution’s cosponsors and a letter signatory, said in a statement this week. “The U.S. must stop arming Saudi Arabia, stop fueling this fire and hold Saudi Arabia accountable for their actions.”

Lawmakers also have lingering suspicions about Saudi Arabia’s role in the Sept. 11, 2001, attack. There was no smoking gun linking the Saudi government to the terrorists in 28 declassified pages released this summer, but many think the Saudis were at least complicit in al Qaeda’s rise. Fifteen of the 19 hijackers on 9/11 were from Saudi Arabia.

Even some who support Saudi Arabia and argued against blocking the arms sale acknowledged there are times that U.S.-Saudi interests do not align.

Senate Republican Whip John Cornyn John Cornyn15 Senate Republicans pledge to oppose lifting earmark ban Cornyn defends controversial tweet as not about Biden's competency Media complicity in rise of the 'zombie president' conspiracy MORE (Texas) made such an argument when defending the seeming contradiction of supporting both the arms sale and the 9/11 bill.

“Some might say, well, how can you agree to maintain the relationship with Saudi Arabia when it comes to providing them with the necessary arms that they need in order to fight this proxy war by Iran against the Gulf State allies, and how can you at the same time support this Justice Against … Sponsors of Terrorism Act, which some say may be focused on the Saudis,” Cornyn said.

“When our interests are aligned with countries like Saudi Arabia, we will stand with them, and we hope they would stand with us. When they diverge, we’re going to take a little different approach.”",1,http://thehill.com/policy/defense/297562-saudi-skeptics-gain-strength-in-congress

Using a procedural provision buried in the 1976 Arms Export Control Act, Sens. Paul, Murphy, Lee and Franken filed legislation that, if enacted, would block the Obama administration's latest defense sale to Saudi Arabia — a package worth $1.15 billion that includes over 150 M1A1 Abrams tanks and assorted enablers to ensure that the tanks keep running.

The Arms Export Control Act allows any senator to force a debate and a vote on an arms sale if the Senate Foreign Relations Committee doesn't move on a disapproval resolution over a 10-day period. And this is exactly what the two conservative Republicans from Kentucky and Utah and the two liberal Democrats from Connecticut and Minnesota chose to do. Members of the Foreign Relations Committee sat on their hands and chose to do nothing, so the Senate chamber was called in to debate the measure.

The fact that the resolution, originally spearheaded by Paul and Murphy, was soundly defeated after a short debate on the floor wasn't unexpected. Indeed, those who follow the issue expected that the motion to block the sale of U.S. tanks to Riyadh wouldn't pass. While there is a growing amount of agitation as of late over Saudi Arabia's behavior in the region from lawmakers in both the House and Senate, Congress as a whole still considers Riyadh a valuable and irreplaceable ally in a dangerous region.

Some, like Sens. John McCain John Sidney McCain'Real Housewives of the GOP' — Wannabe reality show narcissists commandeer the party George W. Bush: 'It's a problem that Americans are so polarized' they can't imagine him being friends with Michelle Obama Congress brings back corrupt, costly, and inequitably earmarks MORE (R-Ariz.) and Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong 15 Senate Republicans pledge to oppose lifting earmark ban It's not 'woketivism,' it's good business MORE (R-Ky.), viewed the disapproval resolution as foolish, if not provocative, to a major American ally at a time when Yemen is at risk of being completely dominated by an Iranian-backed militia in the Houthis.

What matters here, however, is not that the Senate passed the measure, but that lawmakers debated the measure at all. On arms sales and defense exports, Congress has been a placid institution and a spectator despite the fact that both the House and the Senate are integral components in the process under the law. Exports of defense articles on everything from air-to-ground munitions to F-16s typically proceed without so much as a wink and a nod from America's elected representatives — yet another troubling sign of the legislative branch deliberately standing on the sidelines instead of participating as an active player on the field. The Obama administration has sold $115 billion of weapons and defense services to Saudi Arabia in 42 separate deals over the past seven-and-a-half years, and none of those deals were scrutinized by members of Congress.

During a discussion at the Center for the National Interest, Murphy said this trend can only be categorized as an embarrassing abdication of congressional power. ""We are, as a Congress, at risk of putting ourselves out of business of helping to set and conduct foreign policy,"" Murphy remarked.

Speaking at the same event, Paul was equally upset with the way Congress has been derelict: ""There is a war going on. In Yemen, we [the U.S.] are refueling the planes that are dropping the bombs, and we have people helping to guide the missiles."" He then cut to the heart of the matter, saying that Americans ""can debate ... whether we should do it. But we can't just have no debate.""

And debate they did. What Paul and Murphy have accomplished this week is a welcoming change to the cycle of laissez-faire behavior toward every arms sale that the executive branch wants to finalize. They may have lost the vote, but they forced their colleagues to stand in front of the American people and defend why they believe selling additional weapons to Saudi Arabia at a time when Yemeni society is increasingly being destroyed is in the U.S. national security interest.

One can agree or disagree with the result of the vote, but Paul and Murphy should be given resounding applause for promoting accountable, democratic, constitutional government.

For the benefit of the republic's health and welfare, the legislative branch cannot be an inactive and uninterested body on foreign policy. If Congress were to take that path, the institution would become in the words of Sen. Paul ""a lapdog to an imperial presidency."" This week's debate and vote on a weapons sale to Saudi Arabia will hopefully bring Congress back to the proper role that the authors of the Constitution envisioned and demanded.

ISIS SUSPECTED OF MUSTARD GAS ATTACK: A shell with mustard agent landed at an Iraqi base with U.S. troops this week, and ISIS is suspected to have fired it.

From The Hill's Kristina Wong:

The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria is suspected of firing a crudely-made chemical weapon at a base where hundreds of U.S. troops were operating.

ISIS fired an approximately foot-long rocket at Qayarrah air base in northern Iraq on Tuesday afternoon, fragments of which tested positive for mustard agent, a U.S. military official told reporters Wednesday.

After it landed within the base, U.S. troops tested it and received an initial reading for a chemical agent they believe is mustard. A second reading turned up negative, but that could have been due to sun exposure, the official said.

The official added that the rocket landed within 100 yards of the ""security perimeter of the base,"" but did not say how close it got to U.S. troops.

The Saudi-led coalition has fought Houthi rebels in Yemen since March 2015, with the United States supporting the effort by providing air refueling and limited intelligence, as well as selling the Saudis billions of dollars of weapons.

Lawmaker criticism of the campaign has grown louder in recent months amid a mounting civilian death toll, including recent airstrikes on a hospital and a school.

The Saudi coalition has said it is investigating reports of civilian causalities, and U.S. officials have said they encourage avoiding civilian harm.

While applauding the senators who supported the effort to block the latest arms sale, Offenheiser said having a minority of support from the U.S. Senate will provide little comfort to Yemenis.

“Of course, the courage and common sense of a minority of senators will be cold comfort to the millions of Yemenis struggling to survive without adequate food or health services amidst daily bombing and shelling,” he said.

“Today, millions of Yemenis are on the verge of starvation and more than 10,000 children under 5 have died from preventable diseases. Every tank, missile and gallon of jet fuel supplied by the U.S. to the Saudi-led coalition is a clear signal that the US is indifferent to Yemen’s misery.”

Amnesty International said the vote was the latest example of growing lawmaker opposition to the U.S. alliance with Saudi Arabia.

“Today’s vote is the latest example of a growing trend of dissent in Congress when it comes to the United States’ military alliance with Saudi Arabia,” Sunjeev Bery, Amnesty International USA’s advocacy director for the Middle East and North Africa.

“U.S. officials know that the Saudi government continues dropping bombs on civilian communities and yet the Obama administration continues selling them weapons. This arms deal is bad for the people of Yemen, bad for the region and bad for U.S. foreign policy. President Obama should cancel it immediately.”

The Friends Committee on National Legislation (FCNL), the lobbying arm of the Quakers, said the vote is a beginning for congressional opposition to the war in Yemen, rather than an end.

“Just a year ago, it would have been virtually unthinkable that there would even be a Senate vote to block an arms deal to Saudi Arabia,” Kate Gould, FCNL’s legislative representative for Middle East policy, said in a written statement.

“Every one of the 27 votes against this arms deal sends a crystal clear message that the Saudi-led carpet bombing of Yemen must come to an end, and Riyadh must meaningfully engage in a political solution to end the bloodshed in Yemen.”

Gould also called on the public to press Congress and the Obama administration further on the issue.

“Every American who doesn’t want to have their imprint on Yemeni civilian deaths should press the Obama administration and Congress to stop arming and abetting Saudi’s mass killings of civilians,” Gould said.

Win Without War, a coalition of progressive groups, also said Congress and the White House should build on Wednesday’s vote.

“The United States is at its best when it is a global leader in defending human rights, and that commitment must include holding its allies accountable for their actions as well,” Win Without War Director Stephen Miles said in a written statement.

“Today’s vote should also be the beginning, not the end, of a larger debate involving America’s involvement in the war in Yemen, where a Saudi-led military campaign has resulted in thousands of civilian deaths.”",1,http://thehill.com/policy/defense/297084-human-rights-groups-applaud-saudi-arms-sale-vote-despite-failure

Lee, noting that Saudi Arabia has been an ally in an unstable region, said the deal shouldn't ""take effect without so much as a whimper from members of Congress who might feel the need to raise possible concerns.""

Wednesday's vote comes in the shadow of a standoff over separate legislation that would let families of Sept. 11 terror attack victims sue Saudi Arabia in U.S. court. President Obama has pledged to veto the bill, and the Senate is expected to vote on an override next week.

Murphy said it was ""unfortunate"" that the two bills are being taken up at the same time.

However, he acknowledged that those opposing the military sale faced an uphill fight regardless of timing, saying, ""I knew from the beginning that this was not becoming law.""

""I think there are a lot of people who will vote to override the [Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act] veto and then vote against our resolution as a means of balancing their votes,"" he said.

Murphy and his colleagues ran into a fresh round of opposition this week, with McConnell saying Tuesday that he will ""aggressively"" oppose the resolution of disapproval.

He added Wednesday that it would ""harm our nation's long-term strategic interests in the Persian Gulf and the broader Middle East.""

""The resolution would also ignore the shared interests we have with Saudi Arabia in combatting al Qaeda and [the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria],"" McConnell said. ""It would further convince the world that the United States is retreating ... from its commitments.""

But Murphy said that regardless of the failed vote, he hoped his colleagues would pay more attention the war inside Yemen, which he said had been a ""quiet"" war.

""I also think there's very few of my colleagues who had given much thought to the war in Yemen,"" he said.

Lawmaker criticism of U.S. support for the Saudi-led campaign in Yemen has grown since last month when peace talks collapsed, the Saudis reinvigorated their bombing campaign and airstrikes almost immediately hit civilian targets, killing dozens.

The United States supports the campaign against Houthi rebels by providing air refueling and limited intelligence, as well as selling the Saudis billions of dollars of arms.

The latest sale, approved by the State Department in August, would provide $1.15 billion of tanks and other equipment to Saudi Arabia.

But in the House, the Foreign Affairs Committee needs to pass a joint resolution before a member can force a floor vote on an arms sale, so it’s unclear whether the House resolution can get a vote.

Lieu has been vocal about his opposition to U.S. support for the Saudi-led campaign. In August, he led a group of 64 lawmakers in sending a letter to President Obama asking him to delay the pending sale.

In his Tuesday statement, Lieu said the United States should not be “aiding and abetting” the devastation in Yemen.

The United States supports the Saudi-led fight against Houthi rebels by providing limited intelligence, helping with logistics such as air refueling and selling the Saudis billions of dollars of weapons. The latest such sale, approved by the State Department in August, would provide $1.15 billion in tanks and other equipment.

But U.S. support for the Saudi-led campaign in Yemen has come under increasing scrutiny from lawmakers as the civilian death toll continues to rise.

Still, it's unclear whether the senators' resolution can muster enough support to pass.

Paul and Murphy were clear-eyed Monday about the resolution's likely fate, but said a vote is important to raise awareness of an issue that has thus far gotten little attention.

""We do lose, probably,"" Paul said. ""But I think we bring attention to the issue. There's been no debate in our country, almost zero debate in the newspapers, on television, by the presidential candidates whether we should be at war in Yemen. None.""

Murphy said he thinks there's been some change in Congress on the perspective of the U.S.-Saudi relationship.

""You are seeing more willingness to challenge the nature of the relationship, and I think that's positive,"" he said. ""Alliances go both ways. If you're partner is doing things that aren't in your interest, then you need to reserve the ability to start questioning your participation in that alliance.""

Both also acknowledged that the issue was wider than just a single arms sale. Murphy suggested that Congress needs to debate an authorization for the use of military force against the Houthis in Yemen, something that Congress has not been able to do for the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS).

Paul, too, said the United States is ""intimately"" involved in the war in Yemen.

640,Paul,Rand,thehill,"A leading human rights group says it has confirmed a U.S.-made bomb was used in a Saudi-led airstrike in Yemen that struck a hospital.

“It is outrageous that states have continued to supply the Saudi Arabia-led coalition with weapons, including guided and general purpose aerial bombs and combat aircraft, despite stark evidence that those arms are being used to attack hospitals and other civilian objects and in other serious violations of international humanitarian law,” Philip Luther, research and advocacy director for the Middle East and North Africa at Amnesty International, said in a statement.

A Saudi-led coalition has been battling Houthi rebels in Yemen since March 2015. The United States has supported the effort by providing limited intelligence, helping with logistics such as air refueling and selling the Saudis billions of dollars of weapons.

In August, a Saudi-led strike hit a Doctors Without Borders-supported hospital in Yemen’s Hajjah governorate, killing at least 19 people.

In a Monday report, Amnesty International said an independent weapons expert analyzed pictures of a bomb fin at the site and determined that it was part of a U.S.-made precision-guided Paveway-series aerial bomb.

“This attack highlights, yet again, the desperate need for a comprehensive embargo on all weapons that could be used by any of the warring parties in Yemen and for an international investigation to bring those responsible for unlawful attacks to justice,” Luther said.

Amnesty’s report comes ahead of an expected vote in the Senate this week on blocking the United States’ latest planned arms sale to Saudi Arabia.

The State Department approved a $1.15 billion sale of tanks and other equipment last month, but a bipartisan group of senators introduced a joint resolution of disapproval that would block the sale.

It’s unclear whether the resolution has enough support to pass, but lawmaker criticism of U.S.-support for the campaign has grown in recent months in the wake of the hospital bombing and others that have killed civilians.

641,Paul,Rand,thehill,"By next week, Saudi Arabia’s intervention in Yemen will have continued for a year and a half. In that time the conflict has generated over 10,000 civilian casualties and precipitated an appalling humanitarian crisis. In the wake of the fighting, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and ISIS are able to build strength, resources and credibility. It is unquestionably in the national interest of the United States that the conflict in Yemen end immediately. The Obama administration has stated this publicly.

Yet, on the very day that Saudi Arabia escalated its bombing campaign last month, the Obama administration approved a $1.15 billion sale of weapons and defense articles to Saudi Arabia to replace and augment its forces fighting the Yemen war.

The Senate should adopt the measure immediately.

Today, 21.2 million people — more than four out of five Yemenis — needs aid to survive, more than in any other country in the world. More than a quarter of the country is on the verge of famine. According to the UN, over 10,000 children have died in the past year of diarrhea, pneumonia, dengue, and other afflictions caused by poor sanitation, unsafe water, and malnutrition.

Much of this suffering is caused by Saudi Arabia’s bombing of Yemen’s ports and its reluctance to push the Government of Yemen, currently in exile, to make painful compromises to achieve peace. And much of it is being caused directly by blatant violations of the law of armed conflict.

Human rights groups have identified over 70 Saudi air attacks that appear to be violations of the laws of war, many of them possible war crimes. Saudi airstrikes have destroyed or damaged critical infrastructure throughout the country and hundreds of schools and hospitals, including four separate facilities run by the humanitarian agency Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders).

The U.S. government has publicly and privately implored Saudi leaders to improve their targeting practices, but these entreaties have been ignored. Despite calls for an independent fact-finding mission, Saudi Arabia has thus far enjoyed total impunity for its conduct. According to UN Secretary-General Ban-Ki Moon, the Kingdom even blackmailed its way off of the Children and Armed Conflict “List of Shame.”

None of this suffering is advancing US interests. Amidst the chaos, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula — the group’s most powerful franchise — has greatly expanded its influence, controlling Mukallah, a major port and Yemen’s fourth largest city, for most of 2015. ISIS, virtually absent from Yemen before the Saudi intervention, now carries out routine terror attacks and is drawing supporters to its cause. The United States, viewed as the power behind the Saudi intervention, is widely despised throughout the country.

There are two principal arguments against the Paul-Murphy resolution, and neither holds water. Some argue that blocking the sale would disadvantage the Saudis against the Houthis — and by extension, the Iranians — who are themselves responsible for their share of the crisis and their disregard for civilian life. While the Houthis are ideologically aligned with and may receive modest support from Iran, they are not Iranian proxies; they are a distinctly Yemeni movement with local and national grievances and goals.

U.S. policy in Yemen should not be aimed at arming Saudi Arabia; rather, it should seek to return peace and security to the country, restore US standing, and reduce the influence and operating space of terrorist groups. Congressional silence now will signal to Saudi Arabia that our support for its intervention in Yemen is nothing less than unconditional. On the other hand, Congressional action will signal to the Yemeni people, terrorist groups, and Saudi Arabia that we have our priorities straight.

To be fair, Johnson is under an inordinate amount of stress and shouldn’t be expected to never misspeak, but this was not a venial mental lapse. Had it been, Mr. Johnson would’ve instantly cut his hosts off after they began to explain that Aleppo is a city in Syria; he did not. Johnson’s insouciance was difficult to watch, but it would be unfair to only point the finger at him.

Donald Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE, the current Republican nominee, was stumped during a GOP debate earlier this year when he was asked to prioritize our nuclear triad; as Rand Paul Randal (Rand) Howard Paul15 Senate Republicans pledge to oppose lifting earmark ban The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Tax March - CDC in limbo on J&J vax verdict; Rep. Brady retiring Anti-Asian hate crimes bill overcomes first Senate hurdle MORE said, he had “no clue”. However, it’s not only this year’s presidential candidates who are lacking basic knowledge in international affairs. In 2008, Katie Couric asked Sarah Palin what newspapers/magazines she read in order to stay abreast on international and domestic affairs – she couldn’t name one. Palin was nearly a single heartbeat away from being the leader of the free world.

In response to his now infamous Aleppo gaffe, Johnson explained how there “were many things” he didn't know off the top of his head when he served as governor, but by surrounding himself “with the right people,"" he ""succeeded."" ""That would begin, clearly, with daily security briefings that, to me, will be fundamental to the job of being president.""

But daily presidential briefings are meant to provide the president with classified information on how far along country X is with regards to its nuclear weapons program, not enlighten the Commander in Chief on where Aleppo is. A truly qualified presidential candidate wouldn’t wait to become president to begin learning such rudimentary knowledge.

Still, I blame the system, not any of these candidates. So how can we change it?

Considering 30 percent of workers in the U.S. need a license in order to perform their job (electricians, hairstylists, lawyers, et. al.), it’s understandable why some have questioned the logic behind having just three requirements for the most important job in the world (he or she must be at least thirty-five years of age, a resident within the United States for fourteen years, and a natural born citizen).

However, it would be unwise to require presidential candidates to have a specific degree (political science) or have obtained a certain level of education (completed a graduate program). After all, three of the top ten ranked presidents (Lincoln, Truman, and Washington) never received a college degree.

Others have proposed that in order to run for president, candidates ought to have held select positions (senator, vice president, etc.) within the U.S. government for X amount of years. While those who have no previous work experience in government are unlikely to win the presidency, such a requirement could potentially disallow the next great president from taking office for obvious reasons. What do we do?

An examination. I propose that before any individual can officially run for president of the United States, he or she must pass a comprehensive exam that would cover everything from past and present economic crises, foreign leaders, wars, trade deals, the constitution, and yes, even basic geography. The world’s most expensive test would be offered once a year with the questions changing each year.

For example, the 2016 version of the exam may ask where Aleppo is while the 2017 version could ask where Muscat is. Those who fail the exam (it would be a pass or fail score) must wait four years before retaking the exam. Passing such an extensive exam would make it impossible for a candidate to claim they thought classification markings before paragraphs were meant to organize messages in alphabetical order.

When I decided to apply to graduate school after having worked for four years, I had to take the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) — this required me to brush up on mathematical concepts I hadn’t studied since high school. Although annoyed, I never thought twice about it; this was what I needed to do in order to get in to a top program.

I’d imagine that anyone who genuinely wants to become the next president of the United States (as opposed to just adding “former presidential candidate” to their resume) would also be willing to put in the time to study and pass this test. Once they did, the American people could focus on judging the candidate’s trustworthiness, interpersonal skills, equanimity, etc. without wondering whether the candidates are merely regurgitating what their advisors, aides, and speechwriters told them.

Requiring all hopeful presidential candidates to pass a tough exam before entering the race would help prohibit truly unqualified candidates from ever getting close to the oval office. While Palin didn’t become vice president (she was close) and Trump and Johnson are unlikely to win this year’s election (they certainly could), I worry that the longer we continue to allow unfit presidential candidates from entering the races, eventually the bullet will be in the chamber. What say you?

DEFENSE HAWKS V. FISCAL HAWKS: Defense hawks are girding for a fight as the House readies a short-term funding measure to prevent a government shutdown on Oct. 1.

Some members of the House Freedom Caucus are pushing to have the stopgap measure, known as a continuing resolution (CR), last into the next administration to avoid taking it up during the lame-duck session of Congress.

Members of the caucus are wary of a last-minute omnibus bill after the election, fearing it will be used to raise spending. They are hopeful that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump Donald TrumpHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong Former Vice President Walter Mondale dies at age 93 White House readies for Chauvin verdict MORE will bring a budget-slashing approach if he wins the White House.

Clinton has acknowledged her Iraq vote was a mistake and says that as president she will only use military force as a last resort.

But at a veterans forum on Wednesday night, Clinton said Trump's position on the war, at the time, was no different from hers. She said that Trump initially supported the invasion but has since flip-flopped.

Trump has been a fierce critic of the war for years, but Democrats are raising questions about when his opposition began.

Brady retiring Anti-Asian hate crimes bill overcomes first Senate hurdle MORE (R-Ky.) and a slew of House members and Tea Party leaders will host a rally Tuesday to pressure leaders not to pay for healthcare reform in the next bill to fund the government.

ADVERTISEMENT

The anti-funding movement, which dominated headlines at the beginning of the summer, has not gained enough support to assure victory as Congress enters a series of fiscal negotiations over the next two months.

To the contrary, Republican congressional leaders remain non-committal and chatter in Washington has been consumed for the last week with the debate over whether the U.S. military should intervene in Syria's civil war.

Tea Party supporters also face a tough break with the scheduling of their rally, the most prominent in a series of August events across the country highlighting criticisms of ObamaCare.

President Obama said Friday that he will make the case for military strikes in a public address on Tuesday, the same day backers of defunding ObamaCare are set to convene on the Capitol building's West Lawn.

Obama will also not have to encounter face-to-face criticism of ObamaCare from union interests after canceling a trip to Los Angeles.

Anti-ObamaCare activists remain hopeful that they can build enough pressure on Republican leaders to deal a major blow to ObamaCare in any bills to fund the government.

But others expressed skepticism that the movement can achieve its goals amid votes in Congress over Syria and intensifying pressure not to allow a government shutdown.

Pro-ObamaCare groups mocked the campaign in a press call Friday, telling reporters that Tea Party “lost August.”

“Progressive groups and activists across the country have been on the offensive,” said Brad Woodhouse, President of Americans United for Change.

“We're out there aggressively promoting the benefits of ObamaCare.”

Confidence from the left comes as some Republicans communicate equally tough messages from constituents urging them to do whatever it takes to kill healthcare reform.

A wide group of Republican members observed strong grassroots support for the defunding movement at town hall events throughout August, they have told The Hill.

Some conservative leaders and groups have also created a litmus test out of members' support or wariness of the campaign. Pundits and talk radio hosts have turned on GOP lawmakers who are wary of threats to shut down the government unless ObamaCare is defunded.

These criticisms are echoed by a long list of conservative advocacy groups, one of which is running ads against Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellHouse votes to condemn Chinese government over Hong Kong 15 Senate Republicans pledge to oppose lifting earmark ban It's not 'woketivism,' it's good business MORE (R-Ky.) for failing to back the movement.

“McConnell’s the Senate Republican leader, but he refuses to lead on defunding ObamaCare,” says a television ad from the Senate Conservatives Fund. “What good is a leader like that?”

Representatives from more than 10 Tea Party-affiliated groups will speak at Tuesday's rally along with conservative movement figures like Herman Cain.

The event is expected to draw participants from nearby states. As of Friday, the Tea Party Patriots were booking registrations on buses from about 30 towns across the Midwest and the South.

Groups that support the defunding push argue that it is the best — and perhaps last —way to thwart healthcare reform before its biggest provisions take root.

The new insurance exchanges are scheduled to open for enrollment on Oct. 1, the same day government funding would run out under the current continuing resolution. The law's other major provisions will take effect in January.

But supporters of the law have also been invigorated in recent weeks.

A survey released Aug. 28 by the Kaiser Family Foundation found a majority opposes defunding ObamaCare as a way to stop implementation, and several recent studies have predicted that premiums on the new exchanges will be lower than expected, or will not rise overall.

In an interview, Lee's spokesman called these findings misleading and challenged the idea that the defunding push has lost momentum.

Brian Phillips argued that the intensifying debate over Syria will hurt Obama's efforts to promote the healthcare law because he and his deputies will have less time to oppose conservative criticisms.

“My understanding is that the administration had planned a big pushback on the defund effort for September,” Phillips said. “I don't see how they can do that now when they're debating whether to send our troops into harm's way.”

Whatever the outcome, House Republican leaders indicated again Friday that they have not jumped on the defunders’ bandwagon.

House Majority Leader Eric Cantor Eric Ivan CantorWhite House says bills are bipartisan even if GOP doesn't vote for them Trump the X-factor in Virginia governor race Conservative House Republican welcomes Clark as chief of US Chamber MORE (R-Va.) outlined the September and October legislative agenda in a memo that stressed an incremental approach to undoing the healthcare law.

“As the Speaker outlined in July, the House will hold a series of strategic votes throughout the fall to dismantle, defund, and delay ObamaCare,” Cantor wrote.

“The coalition supporting ObamaCare cracks when forced to vote on the most unpopular aspects of the law,” he said.

645,Paul,Rand,kentucky,"Sen. Rand Paul

The recent report on further declining coal jobs is deeply unsettling. Last week as I traveled in Eastern Kentucky, I witnessed the devastation caused by the war on coal. From Corbin to Pineville, to Harlan to Whitesburg, and Pikeville to Campton, people are worried about the future.

The same people who created the war on coal with impossible rules on carbon capture now argue that they will subsidize research to help companies comply with carbon capture. The only problem is that it makes no sense to bankrupt coal companies with regulations and then say, “Oh, now we will subsidize you so you try to meet these impossible regulations.”

President Barack Obama and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton promised they would bankrupt coal. Having come very close to their goal, they are now saying they will rescue us with subsidies.

Forgive me if I am a little distrustful of the “help” being offered by people whose stated goal was to destroy a once great Kentucky industry.

You cannot be a friend to Eastern Kentucky, Western Kentucky or Kentucky coal if you support Clinton. You cannot call yourself a friend to our coal miners and their families if you supported Obama. It’s just that simple.

You see, the problem with coal and jobs in Kentucky isn’t about a lack of funding or research into clean-coal technology or carbon capture, something that is a decade or more away at best. The problem is the oppressive, job-killing regulations of the Obama administration that Clinton has vowed to continue.

I would repeal every one of those regulations. I have voted over and over to repeal job-killing anti-coal regulations, only to have Obama use his veto to keep the regulations alive.

While Kentucky has many conservative Democrats, including some in my family, national Democrats are 100 percent against coal and against Eastern Kentucky. If your state representative supports Clinton, isn’t that a problem? If your local politician supports her, isn’t that hurting any chance Eastern Kentucky has of surviving?

National Democratic funding comes from environmental extremists whose agenda is to kill off coal.

I promised to lead the fight in defending Kentucky from the Obama-Clinton agenda of abusive Environmental Protection Agency regulations, and I’ve fought back at every chance I’ve had.

In 2011, when the EPA proposed its regulation-heavy Cross-State Air Pollution Rule, I introduced a bill to throw it out and ban the EPA from producing similar mandates. I cosponsored legislation to stop the destructive effects of the Clean Power Plan and Stream Protection rules. When Clinton bragged about putting coal miners out of work, I demanded an apology.

I’ve also introduced a plan to help revitalize the communities that have already been so incredibly damaged. I have proposed designating eligible counties in Kentucky as Economic Freedom Zones, which is an empowering solution using the resources we have right here in Kentucky.

Economic Freedom Zones are areas of reduced taxes and regulations, and increased incentives for businesses. Communities are empowered to leverage human capital, natural resources and investment opportunities that already exist. By slashing the federal tax rate to 5 percent for 10 years, we can incentivize businesses to locate in struggling communities, providing jobs and opportunities.

With my plan, Eastern Kentucky would have kept over $500 million this year.

Government shouldn’t be picking winners and losers, like politicians have done with the overregulation of the coal industry. My plan gets government out of the way, and lets consumers in the community decide who succeeds. Reducing the taxes in economically depressed areas is a stimulus that will work because the money is returned to businesses and individuals who have already proven they can succeed.

Recently, I was in Western Kentucky; and although it’s the opposite side of the state, the war on coal has inflicted destruction upon Kentuckians there, too. I met with leaders in the coal industry, as I have done many times before, to hear their concerns and relay what I’m doing to fight back against the regulations strangling their industry and destroying the livelihoods of Kentucky families.

I’m leading the fight for Kentucky, our coal miners and their families; but Kentuckians can join me in that fight. We can put a stop to the Clinton-Obama agenda, and it can happen at the ballot box this November by electing true friends of coal, not allies of the very people calling for mass destruction of our industry.",1,http://www.kentucky.com/opinion/op-ed/article94038932.html
646,Paul,Rand,wsj,"Though many claim the mantle of Ronald Reagan on foreign policy, too few look at how he really conducted it. The Iraq war is one of the best examples of where we went wrong because we ignored that.

In 1984, Reagan's Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger developed the following criteria for war, primarily to avoid another Vietnam. His speech, ""The Uses of Military Power,"" boils down to this: The United States should not commit forces to combat unless the vital national interests of the U.S. or its allies are involved and only ""with the clear intention of winning."" U.S. combat troops should be committed only with ""clearly defined political and military objectives"" and with the capacity to accomplish those objectives and with a ""reasonable assurance"" of the support of U.S. public opinion and Congress and only ""as a last resort.""

Much of the rationale for going to war in 2003 did not measure up to the Weinberger Doctrine, and I opposed the Iraq war. I thought we needed to be more prudent about the weightiest decision a country can make. Like Reagan, I thought we should never be eager to go to war. And now, 11 years later, we are still dealing with the consequences.

Today the Middle East is less stable than in 2003. The Iraq war strengthened Iran's influence in Iraq and throughout the Middle East. Sunni extremists backed by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Qatar have filled the vacuum.

It is said – and most of us have spent our lives believing – that we are a nation of laws.

If the FBI’s decision to not prosecute Hillary Clinton is accepted, we will have become a nation of two sets of laws: one for the Clintons, and one for everyone else.

On July 5, FBI Director James Comey held an astonishing press conference in which he delivered a scathing rundown on Clinton’s wrongdoings in handling classified information and national security during her tenure as Secretary of State.

The FBI showed clearly that Clinton violated classified procedures and carelessly, recklessly endangered national security – and did so repeatedly, over 100 times.

The FBI then announced she would face no charges. This is an outrage, and the rule of law has been shattered.

Any career civil servant or military offer who had been so “careless” with national security and classified information would have had his or her security clearance stripped at a minimum, possibly been fired, and certainly have been open to criminal charges.

In fact, when one ambassador chose to use his own email server to send his traffic, in violation of a multitude of laws and procedures, the State Department cited it as one of the main reasons for his ouster. The Secretary of State at that time? Hillary Clinton.

The Justice Department prosecuted NSA whistleblower Thomas Drake with charges that could have led to 35 years in prison.

General David Petraeus was charged and pleaded guilty to similar classified breaches; he faced two years probation and a $100,000 fine.

There are plainly written laws about this – Title 18 USC Sections 793 and 798, among others. The FBI director singlehandedly changed the meaning of the law July 5 when he decided that if the intent to harm was not present, then there is no violation. That’s clearly wrong both by plain reading of the law and by practice of previous prosecutions. Gross negligence is the standard, not intentional harm. The top law enforcement officers in our country should know this.

But the rules and laws are apparently for the other people, not for Clinton. It’s disgusting, and it should preclude Clinton from ever holding high office again.

How can we trust someone to be Commandeer in Chief who would not even qualify for a security clearance if her name weren’t Clinton?

And how do we tell the people who have faced the consequences that though they received punishment, Hillary gets off with nothing?

We shouldn’t have to. The FBI should be better than this. The Justice Department should be better than this.

How did this all come about? Well, we don’t know for sure, but it sure smells funny.

Last weekend, we learned former President Clinton met with Attorney General Loretta Lynch – and the FBI director’s boss – in private.

Three days later the FBI director announces no charges are being brought against Hillary Clinton.

The appearance is terrible. The decision is astounding. People have gone to jail for far less severe breaches of classified information and national security.

Director Comey and the Obama Administration Department of Justice made it clear to the American people, and all those being unfairly prosecuted by the DOJ, that there is no accountability and no justice. Today, they made it clear that the Clintons are allowed to live by a different set of rules.

This is a loss for the rule of law and further degrades Americans’ faith in the justice system.

U.S. Sen. Rand Paul is a Kentucky Republican.

Conservatives have always been loud and resounding voices on the issue of defending the Second Amendment. However, oftentimes, it seems that our representatives in government, Republicans and Democrats alike, lack that same aggressive defense of the rest of the liberties and freedoms granted to us by the Constitution.

A few weeks ago, I took the stage at the National Rifle Association’s Annual Meeting in Louisville to address a crowd of liberty-loving, pro-gun Kentuckians, eager to hear how their elected officials are working to defend their right to bear arms.

It was there in the fittingly named Freedom Hall that I reminded my fellow Kentuckians and Americans that the freedoms to which we’re entitled by the Constitution, including the freedom to defend ourselves and our families, can only be properly defended if we defend the rest of the Bill of Rights as well.

The entire Bill of Rights should be as vigorously defended as the right to bear arms, because you cannot defend the Second Amendment if you don’t defend the First. If we diminish one iota the right to free speech, we risk not being able to defend our right to bear arms. If we diminish one iota the right to be free from unreasonable search, we risk our right to bear arms. If we allow the government to enter our homes, search our records or phone data without a warrant, we risk undermining not just our Second Amendment right, but the entire Bill of Rights.

I won't let that happen.

In the Senate, my defense of the Constitution and the entire Bill of Rights has been an absolute priority, because in our commonwealth, Kentuckians value all of their liberties.

One of my favorite parts of representing Kentucky is having the opportunity to travel to each and every corner of the state to hear the concerns of each community and find ways to translate those concerns into actions with tangible results.

No matter who I meet – the small business owner, coal miner, hunter, farmer, student – the message is always the same: Get the federal government out of the way and tell the federal government to leave us alone!

I couldn’t agree more. In 2012 when Kentucky was trying to legalize industrial hemp, one of the main arguments I invoked as a leading voice in support of this innovative and job-creating initiative, was the defense of the Ninth and Tenth Amendments. I could not just stand idly by while the federal government tried to prevent economic growth in Kentucky.

The Tenth Amendment declares that the only powers the Federal Government may exercise are those that have been delegated to it in the Constitution. Furthermore, the Ninth Amendment guarantees to the people all rights not enumerated in the Constitution, and reserves to the people those rights.

Most people forget about the Ninth Amendment, but the Ninth Amendment was one of the most important parts of the Bill of Rights. In fact, the Bill of Rights would have never passed without the Ninth Amendment because many of the critics thought that listing certain rights and not all rights would lead people to think it’s a complete listing. So they said, we need to make sure they know this is just the beginning. Just because those rights are not listed it doesn’t mean they do not exist, because your rights come from your Creator and they are unlimited.

Few and limited are the powers given to the government. But it is the opposite with your rights. Your rights are many and infinite. As such, your privacy isn’t a privilege. It is a right. The government has no businesses meddling in the lives and records of law-abiding citizens.

I will stand for as long as it takes to keep the government out of our private lives. I will stand for as long as it takes to protect each and every American's right to be left alone, because our right to privacy should never be sacrificed.

I reject the premise that our Constitution does not work as it is written and that we must choose between having the Bill of Rights and national security. Our nation did not become the most powerful nation in the world because we abandoned our Second and Fourth Amendment rights when outside forces threatened us in ways even more menacing than we now face.

If the government has probable cause that an individual is a criminal or suspected terrorist, then they must first go to a judge and obtain a warrant as required by the Fourth Amendment. Yet, those who crave power over American citizens tell us bulk collection of data from law-abiding citizens is necessary to keep us safe, while effectively admitting their spying schemes don’t even work. We need to collect more records from terrorists, and fewer records from innocent Americans. It’s time for conservatives to push for a national security approach that focuses on our common enemy, rather than on the rights and liberties of the American people.

In addition to defending your privacy, I have advocated for defending your property and right to due process under the law. I recently re-introduced the bipartisan and bicameral Fifth Amendment Integrity Restoration (FAIR) Act because the federal government has no business seizing and profiting off of the property of Kentuckians who have never been charged or convicted of a crime.

America is exceptional because we embraced freedom, because we enshrined it in our documents, because we have lived and fought for the principles of freedom. We have a Bill of Rights and we have a Constitution. We must defend them without exception.

When you elected me as Kentucky’s voice and representation in the Senate, I promised to do just that, and I have defended your liberties, freedoms, and right to be left alone – without exception.

In our ever-changing world, there is one thing you can depend on: This is a fight I will never give up. I will continue defending the commonwealth of Kentucky, no matter what, because your freedoms are precious and they deserve to be protected.",1,http://www.cincinnati.com/story/opinion/contributors/2016/06/09/paul-2nd-amendment-not-only-one-matters/85608744/

Famed statesman Henry Clay, who, like us, represented Kentucky in the U.S. Senate, grew hemp.

Industrial hemp has potential to expand agricultural opportunities for farmers and grow our economy.

As senators from Kentucky, we’ve been fortunate to meet many of the farmers who help make our state work. Agriculture is a vital part of Kentucky’s economy, and we’ve learned from Kentucky’s farmers that one way to keep our state’s agricultural sector growing is to explore new, viable cash crops for the state. This is why we’ve put our support behind expanding industrial hemp research.

Hemp is not new to our state. The first hemp plant was grown in Kentucky in 1775, and Kentucky led the nation in hemp production until the Civil War. Used as a fiber to make fabrics, textiles, construction materials, clothing, paper, and many other products, hemp was a staple cash crop in America for many decades. Famed statesman Henry Clay, who, like us, represented Kentucky in the U.S. Senate, grew hemp.

Under current federal law, however, industrial hemp is classified as a controlled substance like marijuana, limiting the ability of Kentucky farmers to grow it. This is despite the fact that, while industrial hemp and marijuana come from the same plant family, hemp plants contain virtually no THC, the chemical that causes the “high” associated with marijuana.

Furthermore, consumers across the country currently enjoy hemp products despite the domestic restrictions on farming industrial hemp. Each year, the United States imports over $75 million in hemp and hemp products from other countries – in fact, we are the world’s largest consumer of hemp, with a domestic hemp market of nearly $600 million annually. If Kentucky farmers can capture a portion of that market, those dollars could potentially flow into Kentucky.

That’s why in 2014, we advocated for language in the Farm Bill that allows Kentucky and other states with similar state laws and interests to begin growing industrial hemp again through research pilot programs at universities and state Departments of Agriculture. Last year, we built upon that success with legislation that now allows legally grown hemp from these pilot programs to be transported and processed.

The results have been encouraging – by 2016, the commonwealth has more than 150 pilot programs to grow hemp, with participation from seven Kentucky universities and numerous farmers on 4,500 acres of land. Former Kentucky Commissioner of Agriculture James Comer was an early champion for industrial hemp in Kentucky and was instrumental in developing these pilot programs. Current commissioner Ryan Quarles is continuing his good work on this issue.

We’ve heard from countless Kentuckians that these initial hemp pilot programs are a great success, and we share that excitement. Industrial hemp has great potential to expand agricultural opportunities for farmers and grow our economy, which is why we want to continue helping our farmers and researchers further develop this potential market domestically.

In the Senate, we will continue to work to support the hemp pilot programs now underway, and to help them to flourish. We’ve worked to enact legislation that protects the importation of hemp seeds that are vital to our research pilot programs.

We’re also sponsors, along with Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden from Oregon, of the Industrial Hemp Farming Act, which would amend federal law to allow hemp to be grown for industrial purposes beyond just research pilot programs.

This week marks the seventh annual Hemp History Week. Given the important history of hemp in our state and throughout the nation, we felt it was important to remember the role hemp has played in Kentucky’s past, and to envision a future where hemp is a viable crop once again and represents a crucial part of our state’s economy.

In order to commemorate Hemp History Week, we’ve joined together with a bipartisan group of senators to introduce a resolution designating the week of June 6 the official Hemp History Week.

While research on industrial hemp continues, the commodity represents an opportunity to provide a shot in the arm for Kentucky’s agricultural sector. We are hopeful that hemp growth will help Kentucky farmers and create jobs. It’s an opportunity Kentucky must not miss, and based on the expanded growth of research pilot programs in Kentucky, it seems our farmers agree.

Rand Paul is a United States senator from Kentucky

Does foreign aid influence the behavior of its recipients? Is Pakistan a better and more reliable ally after receiving over $15 billion in foreign aid?

I'm reminded of what a Soviet ambassador once admitted about Syria: “They take everything from us, except advice.”

The same could be said of Pakistan. After fleecing us for a decade, after allowing Bin Laden to live comfortably in its midst for a decade, I see no evidence of Pakistan taking our advice.

The Haqqani network remains the most serious threat to American soldiers, and Pakistan is either complicit with the Haqqani network or looks the other way.

Pakistan continues to cash our checks, but they laugh at us and ignore our advice.

Pakistan continues to imprison Dr. Shakil Afridi, who, it is said, helped us to locate Bin Laden. Afridi has essentially been given a life sentence. It hardly seems that Pakistan is our ally against terrorism if they punish the one Pakistani brave enough to help us capture the world's most notorious terrorist.



Does Pakistan take our advice when they condemn Christians to death for criticizing the State religion? Does Pakistan take our advice when they condemn to death anyone who converts to Christianity?



Asia Bibi is one of the few remaining Christians in Pakistan, and she has been on death row for five years because of gossipy accusations of criticizing the state religion.



They say money can't buy love. It is also true that money can't buy friendship. I'm reminded of the poor misfit on the playground who offers the other kids money to be his friend. It takes about thirty seconds for children to apprehend the false friendship that devolves into titters and ridicule.



Throughout the world from Saudi Arabia to Qatar to Pakistan, recipients of our aid and arms laugh behind their Keffiyeh. Saudi Arabia imprisons poets and whips the victims of rapes. Saudi Arabia and Qatar are bequeathed our weapons and our latest technology and then redistribute it to radical jihadists throughout the region.



Fragments of U.S. shoulder-fired missiles sold to our ""ally"" Qatar have been found used against U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan. Yet when I attempted to stop this crazy arms trade with unreliable regimes, the Senate voted 71-24 to continue subsidizing the sale of weapons to our erstwhile ally Pakistan.



The Soviet ambassador was right. Our allies take everything from us but our advice. Foreign aid shows no apparent change in behavior. Couldn't we, for a change, at least try withholding aid to see if they might heed our advice?",1,http://www.cincinnati.com/story/opinion/contributors/2016/04/07/rand-paul-allies-take-aid-but-not-advice/82700790/
652,Paul,Rand,futuresmag,"A response to President Obama’s executive actions

On Jan. 5, President Obama introduced a series of Executive orders to increase gun control. Our Founding Fathers would be aghast.

To date, Obama has issued over 1,000 pages of Executive orders, an unprecedented amount. Executive orders are only supposed to clarify existing law, not create new ones. The Constitution clearly states that Congress makes the laws, not the President.

President Obama — a former Senior Lecturer in Constitutional law — should be well aware of this fact. When he was a U.S. Senator representing the state of Illinois, he claimed to take the Constitution very seriously. “The biggest problems that we’re facing right now have to do with [the president] trying to bring more and more power into the executive branch and not go through Congress at all,” he said. “And that’s what I intend to reverse when I’m President of the United States of America.”

He repeated this in the early years of his presidency, remarking in 2010, “I am president, I am not king. I can’t do these things just by myself.”

Based on past statements, it appears that in recent years the President has knowingly overstepped his bounds.

Obama has attempted to justify his Executive order on gun control by arguing that for the sake of our country’s security, he needed to do what Congress has refused to do. But this is the precise reason why our Founders refused to bestow the power to legislate with the President — to prevent one man, regardless of how good his intentions might be, from making rash, unilateral decisions.

The Founders knew from experience that putting all of the country’s eggs into one basket would lead to abysmal outcomes, so they instead empowered the two-house chambers of Congress with making our laws.

Like the majority of Congress, I believe that increasing gun control will not make us any safer, it will merely stop honest people from buying and selling firearms at the expense of everyone else, weakening the American economy at the expense of the black market economy.

That’s why in December, I introduced the Separation of Powers Restoration and Second Amendment Protection Act — to stop the President from introducing any new Executive orders on gun control, protecting the Constitution while increasing the safety and security of every law-abiding civilian in this country.

In the United States there is no link between murder rates and gun control laws. Gun control activists like President Obama often cherry pick the data to show that states with looser gun control measures also have higher murder rates. But if the President actually studied the data and ran the numbers, he would see that there is virtually no correlation between the gun ownership rate and murder rate in this country.

The truth is that the increasing use of guns in the United States has made our country safer. Though the number of firearms in the United States has increased by more than 50% since 1993, our gun homicide rate has decreased by nearly 50%.

President Obama often refers to Australia as a gun control success story. The problem is that the statistics prove otherwise. Between 1996 and 1997, Australia gained control of over 600,000 civilian guns. The country’s murder and manslaughter rates remained the same, while its armed robbery rate actually increased by nearly 10%. In 2003, the Australian government took possession of 50,000 more firearms, but its crime statistics still hardly budged.

If the world has learned anything over the past century, government bans have not solved anything — they have only worsened the problems they intended to help.

Look at Prohibition in the 1920s. Although the ban on producing alcohol forced bars and other alcohol retailers to refrain from selling, the amount of alcohol consumed did not significantly decrease. The Cato Institute believes that consumption of alcohol would have surpassed pre-Prohibition levels had the ban not been repealed in 1933. Instead of stopping alcohol consumption, Prohibition instead led to the consumption of stronger, harder substances, while also increasing the number of homicides and violent crimes in our country.

Government bans do not work. They simply stop one set of people from selling goods at the expense of another set of people. And that is precisely what future Executive gun-grabbing will do. It will not make our country any safer, and it will not decrease Americans’ possession of guns. Instead, it will simply bankrupt legal gun retailers and traders at the expense of black market retailers. If Prohibition is any indication, it may also lead to other negative side effects, such as increasing violent crime and packing our prisons with even more non-violent offenders.

Throughout my time in the Senate, I have always stood up for every American’s Constitutional rights, including the Second Amendment. I will continue to do so, and I hope more of my colleagues will begin studying this issue and consider supporting my Separation of Powers Restoration and Second Amendment Protection Act — because regardless of where they may stand on the gun issue, one thing is for certain: They swore an oath to the Constitution, and they should defend it.",1,http://www.futuresmag.com/2016/02/15/response-president-obama%E2%80%99s-executive-actions
653,Paul,Rand,businessinsider,"US Sen. Rand Paul. Reuters/John Sommers II US Sen. Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) is a 2016 presidential candidate.

Last year, when the Republican Party gained control of both houses of Congress, the American people were promised that things would change. The American people were promised that the economy would improve — that President Obama and his reckless spending habits would be pinned down once and for all. One year later, however, things do not appear to have changed at all.

Earlier this week, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) announced that the deficit for this fiscal year will hit $544 billion — $130 billion more than expected — while the 10-year deficit is projected to climb over $1 trillion higher than previously forecast.

That’s right: We are already over $18 trillion in debt — we already have a debt that is equal to our GDP — and yet our Republican-controlled Congress is still ready to continue spending more of our money at every turn.

Throughout my time in Washington, I have worked tirelessly to wake up Republicans and Democrats to the dangers of their reckless spending habits, but neither side is willing to face fiscal reality.

In the last decade, we have added nearly $10 trillion in new debt and the results have been far from stellar. Our labor force participation rate is sitting at a near-40-year low. Wage growth has remained stagnant, while real median household income has declined by over 7%.

What frustrates me the most about Washington’s penchant for spending $7 million a minute is that there is clearly hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of pork barrel spending that should be removed from our list of expenditures. For example, we recently spent taxpayer money on everything from a $104 million subsidy for millionaires to live in public housing to $850,000 on a foreign made-for-T.V. cricket league in Afghanistan. I cannot imagine that anyone living outside the beltway would support such wasteful expenditures.

Although there is clearly plenty of waste within our budget, my Republican colleagues — including fellow presidential candidates Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio — refuse to cut even a penny.

This March, Cruz and Rubio wanted to increase military spending by $190 billion over the next two years. I proposed raising defense spending by exactly the same amount, but also proposed offsetting the hike with cuts to wasteful spending. Cruz, Rubio, and nearly every other Republican in the Senate voted against my amendment. Fiscal conservatism is apparently much easier to preach than to do.

The problem in Washington is that there is an unholy alliance between right and left. They come together to spend more of your money at every turn. Conservatives want more military spending and liberals want more domestic spending. As a result, they shake hands and agree to spend more on everything.

Last October, this secret alliance came together to introduce the Bipartisan Budget Act, a statute which aimed to suspend the debt limit until the end of President Obama’s tenure and increase spending by $85 billion in just three years. It also proposed taking $150 billion from the Social Security trust fund — the trust fund that is projected to reach insolvency within 20 years — to fund other areas of the budget.

The US Capitol. Thomson Reuters

When it came time to vote on the Bipartisan Budget Act, I was not shy in expressing my disapproval. In hopes of convincing my colleagues of the negative impacts that this legislation would have on our economy, I voiced my objections on the Senate floor until the wee hours of the morning.

Instead of thanking me for fighting for conservative principles until the bitter end, however, many of my colleagues cursed and yelled at me for wasting their time. In the end, only 34 of my Republican colleagues stood with me to restore fiscal sanity.

It is disappointing that Republicans would agree to any new spending, especially since there is plenty of pork barrel spending that can and should be cut. Unfortunately, however, wasteful spending is the common ground that the unholy alliance never ceases to agree upon.

The truth is, Republicans are just as fiscally irresponsible as Democrats. Conservatives may support lowering your taxes , but they are still willing to spend more of your money at every turn. Cutting taxes while increasing spending simply means that American workers will be taxed in a more discrete and worse way. It means that our borrowing will increase, which will lead to more debt, higher inflation, and less money in all of our pockets.

Unfortunately, both parties will continue to spend us into oblivion until we restrain them from doing so. That’s why I have consistently advocated for a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution. We need to make every Congressional representative swear an oath to balance the budget and ensure that it gets done.

Throughout my time in the Senate, I have also proven that I am serious about balancing the budget by laying out precisely what programs, departments, and expenditures I would cut in order to bring fiscal stability back to our nation's checkbook. Every conservative that pays lip service to reining in the debt should follow my lead. We can't afford for politicians to be ""all talk."" We need action, and we need it now.",1,http://www.businessinsider.com/rand-paul-government-spending-is-out-of-control-2016-1

U.S. Sen. Rand Paul is a Republican candidate for president.

It is my honor and pleasure to serve as your senator. I ran pledging to fight for smaller, constitutional government. I ran pledging to fight President Obama’s war on coal and to take on his higher taxes, regulation and health care takeover. I ran pledging to be a voice of reason on foreign policy and a voice of clarity on liberty. I pledged to work with both sides of the aisle.

I’m proud to say that these last five years I’ve kept every one of those pledges as I’ve served Kentucky.

I’m running for president and have been for nearly a year. And I’ve done my job as your senator every step of the way. While others simply abandoned their jobs to run, I did mine, working all week in the Senate and campaigning largely on weekends – making 95 percent of my votes, a higher percentage than most senators who weren’t running for president.

I am running for president for the same reason I am your senator: to fight for you, for our country and for our rights.

We don’t yet know where that will take me, but as others look at running for Senate against me, I want to remind them, and you, that I have done my job well, done it with Kentucky in mind, and done it exactly how I said I would do it.

You don’t have to wonder where I stand, and that’s quite rare in politics.

It’s also important to know what it means for me to be in office versus an opponent from the party of Sen. Harry Reid and Barack Obama.

Whether it is his war on coal, his out-of-control Environmental Protection Agency, his government takeover of health care, his assault on the Second Amendment or his bungling of foreign policy, Obama has been a disaster. (And he had plenty of help from his liberal ally Harry Reid as majority leader.)

Regardless of whether a Republican like me is in the White House in 2016 or another one of Obama’s liberal friends is elected, the message is clear: We need a Republican Senate more than ever.

If you want your rights to be in the hands of people who believe in Kentucky values you need a Republican Senate. It’s really as simple as that.

Any Democrat, no matter how independent they may claim to be, or how far they may try to run from the national party of Obama, Reid and Hillary Clinton – they won’t succeed in their games of deception. They would caucus and vote with their party, thus endorsing and pushing forward a liberal agenda I and other Republicans have fought so hard against.

There are good conservative Democrats in Kentucky. Many of them voted for me last time, and I intend to earn their vote again this time. But make no mistake, those conservative or independent Democrats don’t exist in Washington. They get swallowed up into the liberal Washington machine that fights against our values every day.

I’ll leave you with this. By no means am I saying that we should not work with our colleagues across the aisle. I’m incredibly proud of the important bipartisan work I’ve done with my fellow senators – like fighting for criminal justice reform by co-sponsoring the REDEEM Act with Cory Booker, and supporting Kirsten Gillibrand’s Military Justice Improvement Act, which would provide judicial recourse to victims of sexual assault in the military.

But if Kentuckians want to continue to have their values and liberties represented, we need to go forth into this election year with our eyes open, not clouded by the misleading rhetoric that will almost surely be spoken by those seeking to replace one of your strongest advocates.

I’m proud of the work I’ve done for Kentucky as your senator, and I will happily put my record up against anyone.",1,http://www.cincinnati.com/story/opinion/contributors/2016/01/13/rand-paul-done-job-senator-ky/78741238/

Sen. Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) is a 2016 presidential candidate.

It is no secret that the Federal Reserve ’s unchecked printing press causes recessions and increases income inequality. Allowing the Fed to inflate our money supply will artificially keep interests rates low, but at what cost? Their acts can no longer go unchecked, which is why I am proud to carry forth my father’s original ‘Audit the Fed’ legislation, which will receive a vote in the Senate in early January.

In 2009, Senator Cruz drafted a legal brief praising President Obama’s American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, a stimulus bill that increased deficit spending by over $800 billion. In the brief, Senator Cruz argued that the bill’s handouts will “directly impact the economy” and “further the greater purpose of economic recovery for America,""

Earlier this month, Cruz then blamed the Great Recession not on the Federal Reserve’s artificial lowering of interest rates, but on its failure to continue pushing them down in a timely manner. Cruz said that the Federal Reserve’s decision to “[shift] to a tighter monetary policy...set the stage for the financial crisis.”

On the campaign trail, Senator Cruz has further demonstrated his unwillingness to rein in artificial credit expansion by repeatedly calling for the Fed to follow “rules-based” monetary policy. This means that he still wants to control the money supply in order to meet the requirements of a mandate or equation.

I couldn’t disagree more strongly. No true fiscal conservative should ever support the artificial lowering of interest rates—not in 2008, not now, not ever. Doing so is the equivalent of signing a death warrant for our country’s low income earners.

Former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh refers to the Fed’s easy-money policies as the reverse Robin Hood effect. “If you have access to credit—if you’ve got a big balance sheet—the Fed has made you richer,” he said in an interview. “This is a way to make the well-to-do even more well-to-do.”

The reason for this is simple: big banks, corporations, and government entities receive the Fed’s newly-created money long before anyone else, and they bid up the prices of goods before the rest of us can get to purchasing them.

The side effect of this uneven distribution of money is painfully apparent to many at the grocery store. Over the past 15 years, the price of white bread has increased by over 50 percent, while the price of eggs has more than doubled. As a more conservative-sounding Texas Senator pointed out in the October GOP debate, the cost of ground beef and electricity have also appreciated significantly, by 115 percent and 60 percent respectively.

As a result of the dovish Fed policies championed by legislators like Senator Cruz and President Obama, the middle class is rapidly shrinking. Although the money stock has increased by 5 billion since 2007, real median household income has declined by over 6 percent. While more than 60 percent of the country was part of the middle class in 1971, the middle class now encompasses only 50 percent of the population—and this drop comes despite the money supply rising by over 10 billion since that time.

The reason for this is because the newly-created money is disproportionately finding its way into the hands of those in the highest income bracket. From 2009 to 2012, as the money stock increased by over 2 billion, the real incomes of the top 1 percent jumped by more than 30 percent. Over the past four and a half decades, as the money stock increased by over two-thousand percent, the share of adults in the highest-income households has more than doubled. Meanwhile, members of the lowest-income tier now account for one-fifth of the country.

Not only has the Fed’s low interest rate policies widened the income gap, they have also resulted in fewer Americans working than at any time since the Jimmy Carter administration. Labor force participation has declined to a measly 62.5 percent of the workforce. As of November, 2015 was on track to have more layoffs than any other year since the Great Recession.

Contrary to what Senator Cruz and President Obama would argue, we don’t need to cut interest rates in order to escape recessions. We don’t need to choose between reducing income inequality and creating economic stability. Instead, we simply need to begin governing conservatively.

This tactic worked remarkably well for us during the 1920-1921 depression. Then, the Federal Reserve recognized that it inflated too much and for too long. The Fed proceeded to promptly correct its mistakes by decreasing the money supply to raise interest rates. While there was some short-term pain, the crisis was over in no time at all.

Contrast this approach to how Senator Cruz would have handled the Great Recession of 2008. After artificially low interest rates led millions of individuals to overinvest and overproduce in the housing industry, Senator Cruz would have cut rates to zero percent even faster—a recipe for creating more wide-scale malinvestment in other areas.

Since 2009, interest rates have remained at or near zero percent. Also since 2009, automobile production has increased by over 100 percent. Dealerships have stimulated more purchases by offering ridiculously low refinancing deals, similar to the infamous no-money down home loans offered during the Great Recession. As a result, auto loans have increased by nearly $80 billion, 20 percent of which are now given to consumers with credit scores below 620.

Coincidence? I think not. Like the housing bubble, this investment boom was created by artificially low interest rates, and like the housing bubble, this one will pop sometime in the future.

When push comes to shove, we need to stop feeding the economy with the cheap money that the wealthy all-too-frequently begs for. Our economy will never significantly improve—and income inequality will never appreciably fall —until bureaucrats like Senator Cruz and President Obama begin to accept this point.",1,http://www.businessinsider.com/rand-paul-heres-why-we-should-audit-the-fed-2015-12
660,Paul,Rand,courier,"Rand Paul

If you haven’t heard already, I’m running for president. But that doesn’t change the fact that I’m your senator, and that my number one priority is doing the job I was elected to do and serving you.

Being a senator means being a strong voice for your constituents. It means proposing bills and amendments that advocate for your issues, concerns, and priorities. I go beyond that, and I lead, by proposing bold new ideas to solve our biggest problems.

Washington has waged war on our Kentucky way of life my entire time in the Senate. And I have stood up each and every time to fight for Kentucky. I have forged alliances and gone it alone. I have worked with both sides and fought both sides.

I have done what I said I would do early and often. I’ve battled President Obama’s job-killing anti-coal policies, and am still working every day to end his EPA’s War on Coal. I continue to work on behalf of the Paducah community to meet their needs at the Department of Energy site and fight for your freedom to fish in Western Kentucky.

And I’m doing it while keeping one very important thing in mind. Your dollars. Since I took office in 2011, I have returned $1.8 million from my office back to the Treasury. A true conservative believes in being conservative all the time, and your taxpayer dollars are no exception.

In addition to being responsible with your tax dollars, I also believe Washington needs to be responsible about our debt. That's why I proposed the Cut Cap and Balance Act of 2015, which would cut the deficit in half this year. Action is desperately needed to address our nation’s debt crisis – our national debt currently stands at $18.4 trillion. We cannot keep piling debt on top of debt forever.

Recently I also introduced a resolution to help us fight Obama’s war on coal and Kentucky jobs. It says that any agreement coming from the United Nations climate negotiations is a treaty and must be approved by the supermajority required by the constitution. The president is dead set on using executive action to pursue his liberal agenda, and Kentuckians deserve to have someone fighting for their jobs and livelihoods in Washington. With my resolution, the president would have to find 67 votes in the Senate for his climate agenda – which is something he cannot do.

Additionally, this year I introduced the Economic Freedom Zones Act to help areas with crippling unemployment. Designating an area as an Economic Freedom Zone would dramatically reduce the area’s taxes in order to facilitate the creation of new jobs, entrepreneurial opportunities, enhance and renew educational opportunities, and increase community involvement. The total benefit to Kentucky is approximately $129 million per year, and $1.3 billion over 10 years.

I want to see Kentucky grow and improve, which is why I pushed for the legalization of industrial hemp here. Allowing our farmers to cultivate industrial hemp and benefit from its many uses will boost our economy, bring much-needed jobs to Kentucky’s farmers, and allow us to lead in this industry.

I’ve also led the charge on criminal justice reform. I re-introduced the Civil Rights Voting Restoration Act to restore federal voting rights for non-violent ex-offenders, and I worked with my colleagues across the aisle to re-introduce the REDEEM Act, which proposes wide-sweeping criminal justice reform.

When I’m in Washington working on legislation and being your voice, our office is working around the clock to serve the needs of everyone. From helping Kentuckians cut through government red tape, to making sure your local issues find their way to my desk, our staff’s hard work can be seen all across the Commonwealth.

Even when I’m not physically in the state or speaking on the floor of the Senate, I am hard at work for you.

Kentucky is and always has been my priority, which is why I have a nearly perfect attendance record in the Senate - something not many of my colleagues can say about themselves. I know my job is to be your voice in Washington, and I work hard to make sure Kentucky gets the representation it deserves.

From taking your concerns and turning them into tangible results to just simply listening to what you want to see done to move our country in a better direction, I take great pride in being your senator, and I hope you will continue to support me as I try to accomplish your goals for the Commonwealth and our nation.",1,http://www.courier-journal.com/story/opinion/2015/12/01/rand-paul-kentucky-remains-priority-one/76627712/
661,Paul,Rand,yourhoustonnews,"In a recent CNN interview on “State of the Nation,” Rand Paul called Hillary Clinton and Marco Rubio neoconservatives, which defines as a new or modern form of conservatism. He states that Clinton quickly intervened in Middle East conflicts by having a no-fly zone, supported activity in Libya, and sent armaments to Iraq. Also, these two government officials supported sending armaments to Syria, which Rand Paul claims made ISIS stronger.

If Rand Paul means neoconservative as keeping current institutions and practices, then why would sending armaments to Syria make ISIS stronger? Would not this support help fight terroristic groups? His woolly statements leave readers unclear why these policies failed and he leaves listeners clueless about his perspective on better handling problems.

Paul does not explain why neoconservative represents a bad political practice, hinting that his unsaid plans would work better. He draws the conclusion that Hillary Clinton and Marco Rubio would not work well as commander in chief of the country because of their neoconservative policies. Yet, he does not explain his strategy for the ongoing problems in the Middle East, and why neoconservatives would not effectively lead the United States, totally avoiding why it represents bad leadership.

Paul also censured and reproached Rubio over an immigration bill he once sponsored with New York Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer, which included methods and procedures to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.

“He was a coauthor of the bill — I mean it was the Rubio bill, the Rubio-Schumer bill,” Paul said. “So he does have to explain it. I think it will be a big part of things.”

As with the other issues, Paul mentions what he considers a problem, but does not explain why the immigration bill would not function effectively. Many undocumented immigrants live in the United States, and the government should promulgate an effective and reasonable law for them to obtain legal citizenship. If Paul reproached Rubio, he should identify the immigration bill’s problems and shortcomings, explaining why his solution would better resolve the matter.

Rand Paul should research the causes of the Middle East problems from their inception. He will learn that the United States’ involvement has an economic agenda, which requires extensive financial and military support. This exploitation has continued for many years and has reached a crisis stage of addiction and dependency; its solution will require many years of weaning and autonomy.

Applying a category to candidates for president shows a woolly, narrow approach to addressing the nation’s problems. This nation needs a president that deals directly with the issues and has a workable solution that yields good results at a minimal cost. Not a president who avoids conflicts in muddled, abstract language, but one who speaks concretely with a strong, practicable vision for the future.

663,Paul,Rand,wsj,"The recent tumult in U.S. equity markets has prompted many analysts to urge the Fed to postpone any increase in interest rates. This advice assumes that rock-bottom interest rates are balm for a weak economy, with the only possible side effect being price inflation. Yet it is the Fed’s artificially low interest rates that set up the economy for the 2008 crisis, not to mention previous crises.

The “doves” are right to point out that higher interest rates will lead to a repricing of many securities, aka a crash. But years of near-zero interest rates have made this inevitable. Continuing on the current course will only allow structural distortions caused by these interest rates to fester and an inevitable reckoning that will be much worse than seven years ago.

The master fallacy underlying so much economic commentary is to imagine that a handful of experts in Washington should be setting the price of borrowing money. Instead, the Fed should set markets free.

In their theory of business cycles, the Austrian economists Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek explained several decades ago that artificially cheap credit misleads entrepreneurs and investors into doing the wrong things—which in the current financial context includes making unsustainable, levered investments in risky assets, including companies loading up on debt to buy back and boost the price of their stock. Low interest rates may create an illusion of robust markets, but eventually rates spike, assets are suddenly revealed to be too highly priced, and debt unpayable. Many firms have to cut back production or shut down, unemployment rises and the boom goes bust.

The Austrian diagnosis leads to an unorthodox prescription: Rather than provide “stimulus” to boost demand during a slump, the Federal Reserve and Congress should stand aside. Recessions are a painful but necessary corrective process as resources—including labor—are guided toward more sustainable niches, in light of the errors made during the giddy boom period.

In 2000 the stock market, bloated by earlier Fed rate cuts, started falling when the tech bubble burst. Markets bottomed out in 2002, as the Fed slashed rates. Although people hailed then-chairman Alan Greenspan as “the Maestro” for providing a so-called soft landing, in hindsight he simply replaced the dot-com bubble with a housing bubble.

When the housing bubble eventually burst, the crisis was much worse than in 2000. When Lehman Brothers failed in September 2008, it seemed as if the whole financial infrastructure was in jeopardy. And Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke followed the same playbook: cut interest rates.

When near-zero-percent interest rates did not jump-start the economy, the Fed launched a series of “quantitative easing” (QE) programs, buying unprecedented amounts of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities. The Fed has roughly quintupled its balance sheet, going from $905 billion in early September 2008 to almost $4.5 trillion today.

The U.S. stock market rose with each new wave of QE. Does this wealth represent genuine economic progress? Economic growth is still far below previous recoveries. Unfortunately, the performance of equities, as well as the unprecedented increase in public and private debt, may be another asset bubble in the making, leading to another inevitable crisis likely worse than in 2008.

At its core, the market economy is a homeostatic mechanism that self-corrects by cleansing mistakes from the system. When policy makers—in the Fed or Congress—try to spare us from all pain, they cripple that mechanism and ironically make the system vulnerable to a major crash.

Consider an analogy. When the U.S. Forest Service took a zero-tolerance approach to forest fires 100 years ago, what ultimately happened was a massive wildfire at Yellowstone National Park in 1988 that wiped out more than 30 times the acreage of any previously recorded fire. Paradoxically, by refusing to allow small fires to run their natural course, the forest managers made the entire park vulnerable to a giant inferno.

What is true of forests holds for the economy: When governments create a lie, whether it’s a fabricated ecology of no fires or a fabricated economy of no failures, the truth reveals itself even more violently than otherwise. Attempts to stop any dips in the stock market with monetary stimulus postpone the necessary adjustments to how and where resources and workers are deployed. Interest rates are a vital signal in the market; they must be allowed to do their job—that is, they must be allowed to be free.

The sooner Fed officials withdraw their artificial monetary injections and let interest rates rise to their natural level set by free markets rather than government decree, the sooner the economy can return to genuine, sustainable growth.

664,Paul,Rand,spokesman,"Rand Paul told a crowd of just over 300 at Boise State University today that at a recent barbecue, the guy ahead of him was taking two plates of food, so he advised him he wasn’t going to live long eating like that. “He said well, my granddad lived to 105,” Paul said. Paul said he responded that he didn’t live to 105 eating like that. “He said, ‘No, he lived to be 105 by minding his own business.’”

Amid laughter, Paul said, “Sometimes I think we could sum up our political philosophy by saying we want a government that minds its own business.”

He said, “We want to be left alone, because we want to be more free. … But it also turns out there’s a great side benefit, prosperity.” Paul said, “I believe in your right to be left alone,” and he said that’s grounded in the U.S. Constitution.

Among his biggest applause lines came when he talked about the onerousness of the federal tax code, and said, “Let’s scrap the whole damn thing and start over.” People should be able to file their taxes on a simple card, he said. Companies would flock to the United States if the taxes and regulations were less onerous, he said.

Paul said what “President Obama is doing to this country” is “the collapse of the separation of powers.” He said, “It’s been going the wrong way.”

Said Paul, ""What the Constitution is about is not binding you, it's about binding and restraining"" the power of government. He added, amid light laughter, ""This isn't about blather from some reality TV star. This is about the fight to retain the power in the people. ... Whether you believe that Washington creates jobs, or that Boise creates jobs. ... The question you have to have is do you want more money left in Boise, or do you want it sent to Washington?""

""I want to make government smaller,"" Paul declared. ""Do you want your government to be smaller?"" The audience responded with cheers and applause.

Paul said any Republican will win Idaho. “That’s great, we love you,” he said. “But we’ve got to talk about how do we win Illinois.” Republican politicians, he said, have been saying “we need to dilute what we stand for … and if we were Democrat-lite we could win again. I say hogwash. That’s not what we need. What we need is to be boldly for what we are for.” He said, “I don’t want to be the party of the less bad. … I want to be the party that says we’re going to grow the economy gangbusters by cutting taxes dramatically , balancing the budget and making government smaller again.”

He spoke at length about foreign policy, saying, “Why don’t we start not giving any money or any arms to countries that hate us?” He said, “The great irony is that we’ll be back to fight against our own weapons,” and told the crowd, “If you want more war or if you want to be back in the Middle East, you’re looking at the wrong guy.” Paul said like Ronald Reagan, he believes in “peace through strength.”

He took several jabs at Donald Trump, saying Trump wanted a parking lot for his casino, so he got the government to condemn and take a woman’s house. “He’s a guy that has been on the wrong side of every issue” for the past 40 years, Paul said.

He also said Republicans are good at supporting the 2nd Amendment, but they need to support all the amendments. “You can be a minority because of the color of your skin or the shade of your ideology,” he said. “You can be a minority for a lot of different reasons.” The answer, he said, is “you separate that power. … You want to have the checks and balances.”

He said, “If we defend the 6th Amendment with the same passion that we defend the 2nd Amendment, you know what? We’re going to rock and roll to victory, and we’re going to be the dominant party. That’s the party that I want to be a part of.” The 6th Amendment deals with criminal prosecutions, guaranteeing the rights to a speedy, public and fair trial.",1,http://www.spokesman.com/blogs/boise/2015/aug/27/rand-paul-maybe-we-need-government-minds-its-own-business/

The 258 chairs are mostly full, and a few are starting to gather in standing room in the back for the “Stand With Rand” rally.

669,Paul,Rand,bloombergview,"The U.S. Federal Reserve has grown massively in recent years. Since the 2008 financial crisis, it has increased its balance sheet from less than $1 trillion to an incredible $4.4 trillion. Given this sharp increase in the Fed's risk, it's reasonable that the Fed should be audited more thoroughly than in the past.

My bill to audit the Fed is just three pages long, and simply says that the Government Accountability Office should conduct a full audit. It has 32 co-sponsors in the Senate and 142 in the House.

QuickTake The Fed's Countdown

Legislation to audit the Fed has twice passed the House by overwhelming majorities. The Fed opposes the measure on the view that it is already audited enough and that a broader audit might cause political interference.

I invite a thoughtful congressional discussion of the pros and cons of a more thorough audit. I've been encouraged by the broad public support for one and disappointed by the Fed's opposition. Confidence in our currency is important to all of us, and my view is that more information can only help.

According to Deloitte & Touche, which conducts a conventional audit of the Fed's financial statements, the Fed spent $6.1 billion for operating expenses in 2013 and an additional $5.2 billion in interest paid to banks. The audit I would like to see would assess whether those payments are reasonable and necessary or whether they raise conflicts of interest between the Fed's role in monetary policy and its role as a bank regulator.

The Constitution is explicit in assigning responsibility for money to Congress, and it is particularly blunt when it says: ""No money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by law."" None of the payments made by the Fed are pursuant to appropriations, but the Fed's actions facilitate the continued growth of the national debt, which is putting our economic future at risk.

If it goes forward with an interest-rate increase, the Fed is contemplating a doubling of its payments to banks to an annual rate of well more than $10 billion. In her recent testimony, Fed Chair Janet Yellen said the amounts owed to the banking system will decline only gradually. That points to a multiyear escalation of the Fed's payments to banks as interest rates go up. The GAO could address the question of whether the Fed has explored more cost-effective options.

The GAO could also determine the market value of the Fed's assets, not just their cost or par value. If bond yields go up, the Fed could easily find itself with a negative mark-to-market net worth.

The Fed says it intends to hold its bond portfolio to maturity, avoiding losses, so it isn't required to report market values under accounting rules. But the minute the Fed's net worth falls toward zero on a mark-to-market basis, currency markets and bond-rating companies will know it and publicize it.

The Fed has never had a negative net worth, so someone is sure to question the safety of a central bank with negative net worth and its ability to run monetary policy. It would be better if the Fed were transparent on this issue, routinely reporting the market value of its positions and explaining the strength of its financial position.

The Fed is able to continue adding to its size and power, undermining monetary and fiscal policy. The Fed owns $4.5 trillion in taxpayer-guaranteed bonds, mostly Treasuries. To put these big numbers in perspective, if all of the Fed's holdings were $200,000 houses, it would be as if the central bank owned 22 million houses financed 100 percent by a giant, adjustable-rate mortgage.

The Fed crows that it earns interest and has made great profits on its portfolio. But that's just one part of government lending to another part. There's no value creation. It's like charging interest to your spouse and counting it as family income.

The assets are bought not with real capital but with ""computer-entry"" fictions. The danger is that, at some point, the market will become aware that quantitative easing is an illusion and that the Fed can't cause growth or maintain calm, zero-interest markets with more computer-entry purchases.

Danger exists also in a market in which the most universal of prices, the price of money, is so manipulated as to lose its essential feedback mechanism. Danger exists in a market that is deprived of the information that freely floating interest rates provide.

In a market economy, savers are taught the power of compound interest and businesses learn discipline through the cost of capital. How does that work when interest rates have been set at zero for more than six years?

And when interest rates escape the clutches of the Fed, what happens then?

The Fed's interest payments to banks raise numerous questions: Which banks received the most interest? What percentage of the payments are going to U.S. banks versus foreign banks through their U.S. branches? Are there any conflicts of interest for the Fed in determining these payments? Are there any checks and balances on their size?

It would be important for a GAO audit to comment on the fiscal impact of the Fed's decisions. Regarding the Fed's interest payments, for example, do they increase the fiscal deficit and by how much? Could they be reduced?

The Fed has been purchasing longer-term bonds, which tend to pay higher yields. Has this reduced recent fiscal deficits? Is there a risk that it will increase future fiscal deficits as interest rates rise? What are the other ways the Fed is changing the fiscal deficit?

The Fed worries that these types of inquiries will scare markets, but I doubt it. The goals of the audit are constructive and clear -- to improve transparency and ultimately to make the Fed more effective. Markets are flexible and benefit from more information. The Fed itself has emphasized the importance of communication with markets to enhance its effectiveness.

The audit I want would evaluate the Fed's decisions in light of the relevant laws.

Earlier Congresses turned much of their constitutional responsibility for money over to the Fed, often during times of war or crisis. The Fed is sometimes called the fourth branch of government, even though the Constitution created only three branches. Congress is complicit in this concentration of power, and should take responsibility for helping the Fed find constructive limits. A more thorough audit would be a good start.

670,Paul,Rand,spokesman,"Presidential candidate Rand Paul has scheduled three “Stand with Rand” rallies in Idaho next week, one at the Shuler Performing Arts Center at North Idaho College on Aug. 26 at 6:30 p.m.; one at the BSU Student Union Aug. 27 at 11:30 a.m.; and one at the Nampa Civic Center also on Aug. 27, at 2:45 p.m. Paul already was scheduled to appear at a regional Idaho GOP BBQ event on the evening of Aug. 27 in Idaho Falls.

His campaign couldn’t be reached for comment, but the campaign website now lists the three Idaho rallies along with an array of others, including one in Spokane at 2:30 p.m. and in Seattle at 8:30 a.m. on the same day as the Coeur d’Alene rally. A campaign staffer said Paul is currently in Haiti performing eye surgeries; an email sent to his press spokesman Sergio Gor yielded an out-of-office message saying, “Thank you for your message. I am traveling internationally with very limited access to email.”

CNN reported on Saturday that Paul is launching an initiative called “300 in 30” in which he’s targeting college campuses in a bid to launch student chapters of his campaign at 300 college campuses in 30 days.

671,Paul,Rand,pionline,"Social Security had a brief mention at the first Republican presidential candidate debate for the 2016 election on Thursday night, with two of the 10 highest-polling Republican candidates discussing it.

New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who plugged a 12-point entitlement reform plan, proposed raising the Social Security retirement age to 69 from the current 67, by increasing it one month each year over the next 25 years, starting in 2022. He also called for eliminating benefits for people with retirement income above $200,000 and more than $4 million in savings. Not dealing with Social Security, he said, “will bankrupt our country or lead to massive tax increases.”

Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee defended the program, saying that of the 60 million Americans receiving Social Security benefits, one-third rely on it to provide 90% of their income. Mr. Huckabee challenged members of Congress to give up their own retirement benefits first.

“Christie may not have a perfect plan, but at least he understands the scale and urgency of the problem,” said Andrew G. Biggs, resident scholar with the American Enterprise Institute. “I expect the issue will come up some more during the GOP debates, but then start hitting really hard once the general election arrives. Democrats and Republicans have split even wider on Social Security in recent years,” Mr. Biggs said.

Shia Akabas, associate director of the Economic Policy Project at the Bipartisan Policy Center, said that with large numbers of baby boomers retiring and younger workers struggling with debt, Social Security and retirement security issues “are going to become more important over the coming years,” and presidential hopefuls will have to offer ideas.",1,http://www.pionline.com/article/20150807/ONLINE/150809898/republicans-debate-social-security-changes
672,Paul,Rand,time,"“Another boy!” Typically, we think of these words from a sonographer or an expectant mother during an 18-20 week checkup, or the voice of parents announcing the birth of their son to the world.

This week though, we heard these words come from the mouth of a Planned Parenthood employee as they sifted through a dish of body parts from an aborted baby boy as they worked to isolate organs for sale.

Planned Parenthood is the nation’s single largest provider of abortion services. Through a series of videos that have been recently released about Planned Parenthood’s callous harvesting operation, the realities of abortion have become public. Polite company does not want to discuss what really happens to children in an abortion clinic. For those brave enough to watch the videos, they have been horrified by the utter lack of compassion shown for these women and their babies. Even Hillary Clinton rightly acknowledged last week that the images are “disturbing.”

Tiny arms, legs and organs are placed in dishes and picked apart with tweezers. Unborn babies are seen as valuable – not as a new life, but as the source of parts eligible for sale. One employee haggles over prices and another discusses the benefit of selling individual organs rather than whole children because, “Per item works better so we can see how much we can get out of it.”

The videos also depict sterile discussions with Planned Parenthood employees raising questions about whether they may be altering the method of an abortion to increase the chances of keeping baby organs intact to make them more appealing to buyers. Intact, because human organs have value.

As one Planned Parenthood employee said, “You try to intentionally go above and below the thorax, so that, you know, we’ve been very good at getting heart, lung, liver, because we know that, so I’m not gonna crush that part, I’m going to basically crush below, I’m gonna crush above, and I’m gonna see if I can get it all intact.”

If they are human organs outside of the womb, they had to be human inside the womb. It is disingenuous for Planned Parenthood to say in one moment that it is just fetal tissue, but in another moment acknowledge that it is human baby organs to be harvested and sold for medical research. Children in the womb are still children.

The Senate will soon vote on a bill to redirect federal taxpayer money from Planned Parenthood to women’s health care at places like community health centers and hospitals, which have almost fifteen times more facilities nationwide and provide more comprehensive health services. Our focus remains on ensuring that taxpayer dollars are utilized to protect federal funding for health services for women, which may include diagnostic laboratory and radiology services, well-child care, contraceptives, prenatal and postnatal care, immunizations, cervical and breast cancer screenings and more.

These videos are hard for anyone to defend, and they pull back the curtain on Planned Parenthood’s callous actions that strike the moral fabric of our society. The American people have just cause to be horrified by the actions of Planned Parenthood. Protecting the most vulnerable in our society is an important measure of any society.

We disagree on many issues as a nation. However, there comes a point at which we must determine who we are as a people. We should not watch as unborn children of our nation are being callously rummaged for parts and sold at a price, nor should taxpayers be asked to contribute to Planned Parenthood, which has illustrated a stark lack of compassion for children. Surely we can all agree that this practice is not reflective of American values.

Senators Joni Ernst, Rand Paul and James Lankford represent Iowa, Kentucky and Oklahoma, respectively, and are the authors of S.1881, a bill to redirect federal funding from Planned Parenthood to community health centers. The U.S. Senate will vote on the bill Monday afternoon.

673,Paul,Rand,huffingtonpost,"WASHINGTON -- A historically large number of candidates and one very loud entrance by real estate mogul Donald Trump is threatening to turn the Republican presidential race into a silly, MythBusters-style contest to see who can blow stuff up the best.

In just the last week, several GOP presidential hopefuls have engaged in stunts, questionable rhetoric and grandstanding -- even prompting a strongly worded rebuke from President Barack Obama, who on Monday suggested they were engaging in ""ridiculous"" antics in ""an effort to push Mr. Trump out of the headlines.""

To the dismay of Republican Party leaders, Trump has continued to dominate in the polls. In the first national telephone poll since his widely denounced comments about Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), Trump was found topping the pack at 18 percent. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (R) placed second at 15 percent.

All the media surrounding the Trump show has left his rivals attention-starved. The celebrity hotelier's trip to the border on Thursday even overshadowed the presidential announcement of a more electable, experienced candidate like Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R).

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) caused quite a bit of fireworks during a rare Sunday session in the Senate, during which he claimed Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) lied to him and his colleagues about running an open amendment process. Because impugning a senator's character on the floor violates Senate rules, Cruz earned a reprimand from Senate President Pro Tempore Orrin Hatch (R-Utah).

""We are not here on some frolic, or to pursue personal ambitions,"" Hatch said. ""We serve the people, not our own egos.""

Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee (R) made his play on Saturday, when he accused the president of marching Israelis to ""the door of the oven"" by dealing with Iran over its nuclear program. After condemnation from Democrats and the Jewish community, Huckabee was happy to trumpet his remarks on social media and to his supporters, whom he emailed Monday to complain Obama was ""directly"" attacking him.

Credit: Rand Paul Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) went at a copy of the U.S. tax code with a chain saw, fire and a wood-chipper.

Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), meanwhile, has been reduced to torturing a copy of the U.S. tax code with a chain saw, fire and a wood chipper. Such stunts are typically characteristic of Senate races, not White House bids. For example, Joe Manchin memorably used a rifle to shoot a copy of a proposed ""Cap and Trade"" bill during his successful bid for the upper chamber in West Virginia. The stunt might have given Paul a photo op, but it didn't exactly spell out presidential material.

The presidential candidate who perhaps best capitalized on Trump mania was Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). After Trump gave out the South Carolina senator’s personal phone number to the public, Graham went on a rampage against flip phones in a viral video produced by the website IJReview. Graham, who actually owned a flip phone, is seen putting a number of the devices through a blender, dropping them off a rooftop, and chopping them with a butcher knife.

Great media strategy or desperate ploy for attention? Probably a bit of both. As it stands right now, ten days out from the first GOP debate in Cleveland, Graham would not make the cut for a primetime television slot. His 0.3 percent support among Republican voters places him short of the top 10 criteria host Fox News has set for the debate.

The cable network has not yet announced which national polls it will use to judge which candidates will participate. But one thing’s for certain: bottom-rung contenders are likely to engage in more of such antics as the debate nears.

675,Paul,Rand,wsj,"Some of my fellow Republican candidates for the presidency have proposed plans to fix the tax system. These proposals are a step in the right direction, but the tax code has grown so corrupt, complicated, intrusive and antigrowth that I’ve concluded the system isn’t fixable.

So on Thursday I am announcing an over $2 trillion tax cut that would repeal the entire IRS tax code—more than 70,000 pages—and replace it with a low, broad-based tax of 14.5% on individuals and businesses. I would eliminate nearly every special-interest loophole. The plan also eliminates the payroll tax on workers and several federal taxes outright, including gift and estate taxes, telephone taxes, and all duties and tariffs. I call this “The Fair and Flat Tax.”

President Obama talks about “middle-class economics,” but his redistribution policies have led to rising income inequality and negative income gains for families. Here’s what I propose for the middle class: The Fair and Flat Tax eliminates payroll taxes, which are seized by the IRS from a worker’s paychecks before a family ever sees the money. This will boost the incentive for employers to hire more workers, and raise after-tax income by at least 15% over 10 years.

Here’s why we have to start over with the tax code. From 2001 until 2010, there were at least 4,430 changes to tax laws—an average of one “fix” a day—always promising more fairness, more simplicity or more growth stimulants. And every year the Internal Revenue Code grows absurdly more incomprehensible, as if it were designed as a jobs program for accountants, IRS agents and tax attorneys.

Polls show that “fairness” is a top goal for Americans in our tax system. I envision a traditionally All-American solution: Everyone plays by the same rules. This means no one of privilege, wealth or with an arsenal of lobbyists can game the system to pay a lower rate than working Americans.",1,http://www.wsj.com/articles/blow-up-the-tax-code-and-start-over-1434582592

Congress will this week force the president to end his illegal collection of all American phone records. This is a victory for defenders of privacy.

The Fourth Amendment requires that government searches be individualized. Collecting all Americans' phone records all the time indiscriminately is what our Founders fought against when they objected to general warrants.

Some will ask: But how will we catch terrorists without this program? My reply: with the Constitution. The Fourth Amendment allows probing searches as long as the request is for an individual's records and as long as there is probable cause of a crime.

I don't object to collecting as many records as necessary to catch terrorists. In fact, I want to collect more records from terrorists and less from innocent, suspicion-less Americans.

President Obama's illegal collection of all of our phone records has not made us safer. Between 2004 and 2009, the FBI tripled its use of bulk data collection under Section 215 of the Patriot Act — yet law enforcement cannot point to a single foiled terrorist plot.

The ""lone wolf"" provision seen by pro-surveillance officials as critical to the fight against terror has never been used in a single investigation.

The president's own review group found the program was ""not essential to preventing attacks"" and the information ""could readily have been obtained in a timely manner using conventional (court) orders.""

My filibuster sought a compromise. I requested votes on two amendments to require that warrants only be issued to individuals and that evidence collected under the Patriot Act only be used against terrorists, not for domestic prosecution. I was denied.

Was my filibuster successful? Well, during the delay, 20 Republicans changed their vote to support ending the bulk collection of phone records.

The 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals recently ruled that the bulk collection of all American phone records is illegal. The president could have done the right thing and ended this illegal program. Instead, he chose to transfer blame to Congress.

Congress this week will force the president to end this illegal program. For those who cherish the right to be left alone, this is a victory.

679,Paul,Rand,richmond,"After we have been so outspoken about the National Security Agency’s bulk collection of Americans’ telephone data, many have asked why we so strongly oppose the USA Freedom Act. The Freedom Act, which passed the House last week and now goes to the Senate, reauthorizes and reforms the parts of the USA Patriot Act that are set to expire. While one of the reforms is an attempt to stop the government’s bulk data collection, the bill’s wording leaves considerable gaps in privacy protections, and that greatly concerns us both.

The Freedom Act directs phone companies, rather than the NSA, to hold certain data that the government can later search during an investigation. The act also limits the government to only asking for records based upon a “specific selection term.” Unfortunately, “specific selection term” is defined so broadly under the bill that it could include a whole corporation or a whole geographic region — a reduced form of bulk collection, but bulk collection nonetheless, and one that ropes in the records of many innocent people.

Additionally under the act, the standard required for initiating searches is much lower than what the Constitution calls for. The Fourth Amendment requires having “probable cause” that a crime has been committed before initiating a search, while the act lowers that bar to only “reasonable suspicion” — an unconstitutional standard.",1,http://www.richmond.com/opinion/their-opinion/guest-columnists/article_db5b9bef-a392-5bdc-a7d0-9a714f63f8f7.html
680,Paul,Rand,sacbee,"U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. speaks before the Senate on 0 Wednesday against renewing elements of the Patriot Act. Senate TV image

Just like the infamous Patriot Act before it, the so-called USA Freedom Act would continue the unprecedented warrantless searches of Americans’ personal records in direct defiance of the Fourth Amendment.

The routine, indiscriminate searches of Americans by the British crown is what John Adams believed began the American Revolution. Our founders wrote the Fourth Amendment to assure these injustices and indignities were never practiced upon Americans.

Before the government can search through your personal records, it must prove to an independent judge that there is probable cause to believe you have committed a crime and it must specify what it is looking for.

When it enacted the Patriot Act after the 9/11 attacks, Congress ignored Benjamin Franklin’s warning that “Those who surrender freedom for security will not have, nor do they deserve, either one.” Instead, it opened a disturbing era in which the private, personal data of millions of Americans were seized without warrants.

The Patriot Act was on its last legs, due to expire May 31. Revelations of abuses had turned the American people overwhelmingly against it, and the 2nd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals recently ruled the bulk collection of phone data to be illegal.

In a cynical sleight of hand, Congress is responding not by letting this law expire, but rather by repackaging it as the Freedom Act and selling it as “prohibiting NSA mass data collections.”

Instead of the federal government, itself, seizing and storing personal data, the legislation orders telephone companies and Internet service providers to store it for later perusal by the government – a distinction without a difference. In either case, Americans’ personal records are placed outside their control awaiting only a rubber-stamped order from a secret court to be fished through.

The Freedom Act reauthorizes Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act, which the National Security Agency uses to capture emails, text messages, browsing histories and other private communications of any American without a warrant, simply because data from a foreign target may have once flowed through the same server.

And it continues the practice of seizing “second hop” data. This means that if a basement blogger suspected of sympathizing with al-Qaida calls a pizzeria, the phone numbers of everyone who has called that store are subject to the government’s dragnet.

Our Constitution’s adversaries invariably justify trampling the Fourth Amendment to make it easier to catch terrorists. Imagine how easy it would be to catch terrorists by placing a soldier in every house. The Third Amendment protects us from this abuse just as the Fourth Amendment protects us from warrantless searches of our records.

For 224 years, the Bill of Rights has protected every American from retribution for expressing their political beliefs. It protects a free press from intimidation; it protects the free and open expression of religious beliefs; it protects the means of individuals to protect themselves and their freedom; it protects every individual from having their records searched or their property seized without due process of law. In recent years, these fundamental rights have been made a mockery by the agents of this administration – the Internal Revenue Service to the Justice Department to the NSA.

National Intelligence Director James Clapper brazenly lied to Congress when he denied the spying program existed at all. We also learned that this administration has taken confidential tax information belonging to political opponents and leaked it to supporters. Is there anyone so naive as to believe the same thing won’t be done with phone and Internet records if it suits the designs of powerful officials?

America has faced far greater threats through the years without surrendering our Fourth Amendment rights out of fear and panic. Americans are made of sterner stuff.",1,http://www.sacbee.com/opinion/op-ed/soapbox/article21727008.html
681,Paul,Rand,chron,"We believe that the unrestricted and unconstitutional bulk data collection program implemented by the NSA represents the worst of the Washington Machine, and a recent poll shows that a majority of Americans agree. The government should not have the authority to collect information without first obtaining a warrant. Period.

Our Founders feared a government powerful enough to commit unreasonable searches and seizures, and thus they crafted the Fourth Amendment to protect our right to privacy. Though technology has evolved, the Constitution remains everlasting. Gone are the days where Americans use their cellphones exclusively for phone calls and text messages.

Many people also use their phones for daily activities from tracking their steps to logging their finances or inputting what they ate that day. We believe the Fourth Amendment protects our phone conversations, our emails, our texts, our Internet history, our bank statements and more.

The NSA bulk-collection program tramples our rights. Recently, the 2nd U.S. Court of Appeals deemed this bulk collection of data illegal. Now, some members of Congress are trying to pass a law that allows this illegal surveillance to continue. We will not stand for it.

The House of Representatives recently passed the USA Freedom Act, which makes some steps to limit data collection under Section 215 of the Patriot Act; however, the bill does nothing to limit government spying under Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act.

Contrary to claims that the House bill would ""end bulk surveillance,"" the truth is it would not. The NSA uses Section 702 as a means to gather not only data, but actual content of communications - content of your phone calls, texts and emails. Section 702 is more intrusive than Section 215.

In the course of this collection, the content of American citizens, many of whom have done nothing wrong or illegal, is also collected. Current law allows law enforcement to then search through this data for information and they can do so without a warrant. Reverse-targeting of American citizens is inconsistent with the Constitution and must stop now.

Opponents of civil liberties will argue that these mass invasions of privacy will make us safer. We refuse to believe that you must give up your constitutional rights for national security. Casting too wide of a collection net for intelligence can be a distraction from the analysis necessary to stop plots and - to counter terrorism.

Let us be clear: The NSA should keep close watch on suspected terrorists to keep our country safe. But before invading the privacy of American citizens, a warrant must and can be obtained in a timely manner. Programs that permit due process and are held accountable by an open court will serve as a just way to collect intelligence. The sacrifice of our personal liberty for security is and will forever be a false choice.

We have introduced several pieces of legislation that would restrain the federal government. This legislation includes HR 2233, the End Warrantless Surveillance of Americans Act. HR 2233 would prohibit warrantless searches of government databases for information that pertains to U.S. citizens. It would also forbid government agencies from mandating or requesting ""back doors"" into commercial products that can be used for surveillance. The legislation mirrors an amendment we offered to the USA Freedom Act, which was backed by a broad bipartisan coalition, including members of Congress and outside groups across the political spectrum. We are proud to represent the masses in the fight for NSA reform, and we will continue to stand united in defense of the Bill of Rights.

682,Paul,Rand,tampabay,"This country was founded on the notion of liberty. It was the spark that started a revolution, the fire that forged our Constitution and the energy that has fueled our ascent to the great nation we are today. It is a word that is as synonymous with the United States as ""red, white and blue."" So it is striking to us that we have reached a point in our history when the expectation of privacy and liberty is dissolving.

In our constitutional republic, the burden is on the government to prove why it is justified in encroaching upon the rights of the citizens. The fact that intelligence organizations have the audacity to spy and collect information on American citizens — invading our privacy — shakes the very core of who we are as a nation.

Our founders wisely drafted a Constitution that would remain steadfast — even as political parties and presidents come and go. And with the Constitution comes protections for every citizen of this great country.

One of these protections — against unreasonable searches and seizures — is rooted in the Fourth Amendment. Despite the requirement that warrants must be specific and based on probable cause, the government's surveillance programs often undermine these constitutional standards. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court proceedings, where these warrants are granted, take place behind closed doors where records are hidden. These actions have essentially led to a rubber stamp for increased government surveillance on Americans. These secret, one-sided proceedings leave our citizens vulnerable, with no one to advocate on their behalf.

We oppose the most recent, watered-down version of the USA Freedom Act because it does not protect our citizens against unconstitutional surveillance. We need to go back to the basics and use the Fourth Amendment as our guide. This would include ending bulk collection; increasing transparency; improving advocacy for privacy; and closing the Section 702 back-door loophole, to name a few.

Given the appeals court's recent ruling that bulk collection is illegal and was never intended by Congress, the law is firmly on our side. We do not have to choose between the bad and the worse. We fear that passage of the USA Freedom Act into law will provide the court with the statutory basis to continue this mass surveillance.

Today, most Americans are dependent on their cellphones and emails. Everything we do can be monitored through these records. While technology evolves, the Constitution must endure.

Some of our colleagues will argue that this is a matter of national security, and thus the government is justified. We, however, align more with our founders and their desire for liberty.

While we believe U.S. intelligence should keep a close watch on suspected terrorists, the U.S. Constitution should not be trampled in the process. We too want a strong national defense and believe we should actively pursue potential terrorists and threats — but we must do so within the bounds of the Constitution.

This administration and some government officials think that violating American citizens' right to privacy is essential for national security. This proves just how out of touch and out of control our government has become. The National Security Agency's bulk collection of data represents the worst of the Washington Machine, and we will continue to do everything we can to stop it.

We took our oath of office seriously, and above all, it is our duty as members of Congress to protect, preserve, and defend our citizens and our Constitution.

683,Paul,Rand,thehill,"Congressional Republicans scored a major legislative victory on Tuesday as the Senate adopted the first bicameral GOP budget agreement in a decade.

The 51-48 vote capped weeks of work by Republican leaders in the House and Senate, who shepherded the blueprint through a messy debate over defense spending that at times threatened to split their conferences.

The blueprint passed the House last week, and will not require a signature from President Obama.

Passing a budget, which is always a heavy lift, was particularly important for Senate Republicans, who are seeking to demonstrate their ability to govern in a difficult 2016 election cycle — they are defending 24 seats.

“No budget will ever be perfect, but this is a budget that sensibly addresses the concerns of many different members. It reflects honest compromise from many different members with many different priorities,” the Kentucky Republican said on the Senate floor.

Democrats, who voted in unison against the budget in both chambers of Congress, said Republicans would come to regret calling for trillions of dollars in cuts to federal spending.

The White House signaled in statement Tuesday evening that the budget has no chance of getting Obama’s approval. ""The president has made clear that he will not accept a budget that locks in sequestration going forward, nor one that reverses sequestration for defense – whether explicitly or through backdoor gimmicks – without also reversing sequestration for non-defense,” the White House said. ""There is bipartisan support for a commonsense deal,” the statement added. “The administration looks forward to working with Congress on an agreement that will allow us to invest in our economy and protect our national security.""

The non-binding resolution approved Tuesday sets the top-line numbers that appropriators will use to craft 12 bills funding the government in fiscal 2016. The plan calls for balancing the budget in 10 years by cutting more than $5 trillion from spending.

Setting the stage for a clash this fall, Schumer vowed that Democrats would only support easing the budget cuts under sequestration if the legislation includes dollar-for-dollar increases in both defense and domestic programs.

“Those are bottom lines that unite our caucus, unite our caucus with the president, and there will not be a budget without it,” Schumer said.

House Republicans have already begun moving through a handful of fiscal 2016 spending bills that stick to the $1.017 trillion spending ceiling imposed under sequestration. Democrats say the spending levels simply aren’t high enough.

“I think there is an appetite to make some strong progress on the budget through an agreement,” he said. “I think it’s possible, but I don’t know how to put odds on it.”

While the GOP budget sticks to the spending caps for both the Defense Department and domestic programs, Republicans are seeking a way around the limits by channeling billions of dollars to a “war fund” that is exempt from sequestration.

Asked whether President Obama would veto a defense bill at the Republicans’ proposed spending level, Durbin replied: “Counting on it.”

The White House has already threatened to veto the GOP’s first two appropriations bills, and has implied that the other 10 bills will meet the same fate.

That could leave Congress facing a new government shutdown fight in September, with a deadline of Oct. 1 for passing some kind of legislation to keep the government funded.

A shutdown fight would be risky for both sides, but would be particularly perilous for Republicans as they seek to retain control of Congress and win back the White House. The last shutdown fight sent the GOP’s poll numbers to historic lows, though the party’s brand recovered ahead of a historic midterm elections triumph.

“It'd be nice to get it done soon. But obviously Sept. 30 is the key date.”

684,Paul,Rand,legalinsurrection,"The Republican “War on Women” isn’t over and if liberals have their way, it never will be.

Newly announced presidential candidate Rand Paul appeared on the Today Show yesterday morning and had the nerve to push back when Savannah Guthrie put words in his mouth.

Nick Gass of Politico:

Rand Paul clashes with Savannah Guthrie over changing views Sen. Rand Paul clashed with “Today” show host Savannah Guthrie over her line of questioning during an interview Wednesday morning, criticizing her for editorializing over perceived changes in his political views since his election to the Senate. “You have had views on foreign policy in the past that were somewhat unorthodox, but you seem to have changed over the years,” Guthrie told the Kentucky Republican, who was appearing via satellite from Nashua, New Hampshire. “You once said Iran was not a threat, now you say it is. You once proposed ending foreign aid to Israel, now you support it, at least for the time being, and you once offered to drastically cut … defense spending.” Paul attempted to speak as Guthrie continued.

MSNBC’s Ed Schultz, who once referred to conservative talk radio host Laura Ingraham as a “right wing slut” is just beside himself over all this misogyny:

Hat tip to Michelle Malkin:

Unbelievable. Sexist MSNBC pig who called @ingrahamangle a ""right-wing slut"" is attacking Rand Paul as sexist==> https://t.co/MibT5Tyjmv — Michelle Malkin (@michellemalkin) April 8, 2015

This is how the story begins but it doesn’t end there.

Behold the creation of a narrative.

Because they are.

685,Paul,Rand,politwoops,RT @UK_JediCat: Proud to have cast my vote for @RandPaul today. He is one of the very few in the U.S. Govt standing up for liberty and the Constitution.,1,http://politwoops.sunlightfoundation.com/user/RandPaul
686,Paul,Rand,theamericanconservative,"Last year, over 15,000 individuals worked for organizations whose sole goal was to rip you off. No, not the mafia or Goldman Sachs, but another distinctly criminal class—Washington lobbyists. In 2008, corporations and unions spent over $3 billion to bribe officials who claim to work for you.

Because the federal government has so much power and money, it makes sense that private companies want to influence public policy: make friends with the bully and try to snag some stolen lunch money. But this metaphor is unfair. The bully is a lone individual without much control over the school as a whole. The federal government, by contrast, regulates nearly every aspect of the economy. It legislates healthcare, controls the money supply, sets fuel standards and minimum wage laws, tells us what milk to drink and how much water should fill our toilets. Naturally, then, companies want to make sure that big bad government doesn’t vote to restrict their business. They might also get some lunch money out of it.

Unsurprisingly, the areas where government has the most involvement are the areas with the most lobbyists. Healthcare crisis? Over $3.4 billion in the last ten years spent lobbying. Banking crisis? Over $3.5 billion. Energy crisis? Over $2.4 billion. Those lobbyist dollars are one reason such problems persist. Instead of voting to address a crisis, politicians vote to appease a select few insiders.

The public has caught on and demands change. But Congress rarely delivers solutions. Instead, it uses problems as pretexts for restricting our liberties and aggrandizing itself. In response to the demand for reform, the best our Congress could come up with was McCain-Feingold.

This dangerous piece of legislation is a blatant violation of the First Amendment. My anti-tax group is prohibited from purchasing ads criticizing a congressman within 60 days of an election. McCain-Feingold and the courts believe that paid speech by private citizens is somehow different from speech by the mainstream media. They refuse to acknowledge that a newspaper editorial is also paid speech, in that it costs money to produce and even has an equivalent price if a political party wants to buy the column inches. Yet the law treats the individual’s speech as somehow less worthy of protection.

For the political class, a convenient consequence of McCain-Feingold has been to insulate incumbents from being voted out of office. The law has earned a nickname as the Incumbent Protection Act. That individuals are forced to declare publicly how much they donate and to whom scares many people away from funding a challenger for fear of getting on the incumbent’s bad side.

The solution is not to place more restrictions on individuals and their organizations, but rather to go to the heart of the problem: Washington, D.C.

Congress should remove corruption while still honoring individual liberty. One way of doing this is by placing voluntary limits on corporations that are the recipients of government contracts. It is galling that companies can receive billion-dollar no-bid contracts, then turn around and spend millions on lobbyists, who immediately begin to plead, “Please, sir, can I have some more, sir?”

This vicious circle is socialism for the rich. Companies no longer compete on the free market but rather seek special privileges from their men in Congress. This is disastrous for America’s long-term stability. We became a great nation because we did not rely on welfare but rather worked, innovated, and produced.

What can be done? I propose mandating a clause in all federal contracts over $1 million that requires the recipient to pledge not to lobby government or contribute to campaigns during the terms of the contract. Companies that have willingly entered the public sphere by taking taxpayer funds should not be allowed to use part of that money to secure more funds.

But this proposal is only part of the answer. While it is important to cut down on the demand for lobbyists, the supply side is even more important. Washington, D.C. has a supply of money and power that it can dole out to the highest bidder. As long as this golden goose exists, people will find ways to take advantage of it. The problem is not the abuse of power, but rather the power to abuse.

The only answer to that problem is for Congress to reduce severely the size and scope of the federal government, so that the market is allowed to operate according to the free forces of a laissez-faire economy. Regulations, price controls, and political cronyism only distort the economy, foster corruption, and decrease our wealth as a nation.

689,Paul,Rand,respectfulinsolence,"You remember Dr. Bob, don’t you?

I’m referring, of course, to Robert “Dr. Bob” Sears, the Capistrano Beach, CA pediatrician who’s arguably the most famous of the antivaccine pediatricians who have been spreading fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) about vaccines. (Sorry, Dr. Jay, but, regardless of your being Jenny McCarthy’s son’s pediatrician, I’d bet that more people have heard of Dr. Bob than have heard of you.) Dr. Bob has achieved this fame/notoriety based on his book, The Vaccine Book: Making the Right Decision for your Child, which is chock full of exaggerations about the dangers of vaccination and advocates a “delayed” vaccine schedule that is backed up by no scientific evidence. Dr. Bob has basically been cashing in on fear for a long time.

Given that the epicenter of the Disneyland measles outbreak (i.e., Disneyland) and other recent measles outbreaks is uncomfortably close to Dr. Bob’s practice, he’s been feeling the heat lately. Beginning about a year ago during an earlier measles outbreak he started lashing out on social media at the parents of his patients who, quite understandably concerned about the measles outbreak, were calling his office. It began last March, when he downplayed the risk of the measles and told his patients’ parents, “Measles will never go away – it’s always going to be a very small risk. If you aren’t comfortable with that, get the vaccine. If you don’t want the vaccine, accept the risk.” Not long after that, Dr. Bob basically told his parents’ patients, “Don’t worry, be happy, and if you’re worrying and not happy get the vaccine. Just don’t bother me about it anymore. Oh, and you nasty pro-science vaccine supporters out there are big meanies for pointing out that Dr. Bob is irresponsible.” Then, beginning about a month ago, Dr. Bob went on an embarrassing tear on Facebook, condescendingly downplaying the risks of measles-related pneumonia with a jaunty, “Ya, you don’t want those things to happen, but they are treatable” and then whining about it when it was pointed out to him that at no time in his prior rant did he recommend getting vaccinated in the middle of an outbreak. It was the tried-and-untrue antivaccine trope that the measles isn’t dangerous.



There’s a term I coined reading Dr. Bob’s nonsense: The antivaccine dog whistle. In politics, a “dog whistle” refers to terminology that sounds benign to most people but in reality tells those holding objectionable viewpoints that the speaker is sympathetic to them (or even one of them). In other words, most people can’t “hear” the message, and only those for whom it’s intended can “hear” it, recognizing for what it is. Let’s just put it this way. Dr. Bob is very good at antivaccine dog whistling. (So is Rand Paul.) Now, in a “point-counterpoint” pair of editorials, Dr. Bob does it again. Now, don’t get me started on the idiocy of false balance that presenting point-counterpoint editorials represents about a scientific topic like vaccination. Unfortunately, lately false balance has been rising from the grave again. (Apparently, like Michael Myers or Jason Voorhees, it never dies.) Dr. Bob’s editorial is entitled Mandatory vaccination is not the answer to measles and it starts out with some serious dog whistling right out of the box:

Measles. It used to be just a disease. Now it’s become a banner under which politicians gather to threaten one of our most sacred rights – the right to give informed consent for medical treatment. Whether you are for vaccines, against them, or neutral, allow me to ask this question: Is vaccination a medical treatment which should fall under the protection of informed consent, or does the government have the right to force them on every American?

See what I mean? Right out of the box, Dr. Bob is trying to reframe the debate over a bill being considered in the California legislature that would eliminate non-medical exemptions to school vaccine mandates. I realize that often the editorial writer doesn’t pick the title (usually the editor does), but the very title “mandatory vaccination” helps Dr. Bob frame the issue not as one of public health but rather personal freedom, just as Rand Paul did. Notice how obviously but nonetheless rather cleverly he does it, with a little rhetorical prestidigitation in which he’s saying, “You know, what’s important is not whether you’re for vaccines or antivaccines or “neutral” (whatever that means in this context), it’s that the government can’t take away our FREEDOM!

Of course, this is Dr. Bob, and there’s a whole lot of BS there. For one thing, what Dr. Bob advocates is not really “informed consent,” but rather what I like to call “misinformed consent,” wherein the severity of vaccine-preventable diseases and efficacy of vaccines are very much downplayed and the risks of vaccination exaggerated. It’s one reason why Dr. Bob was so opposed to California Bill AB 2109, because that bill required that real informed consent be given by parents requesting philosophical exemptions to California’s vaccine school vaccine mandate by requiring them to have a physician or other specified health care provider sign an attestation that the parents had been told the risks of not vaccinating.

The issue thus reframed, Dr. Bob launches into a list of the horrors of vaccination and the joy of measles. OK, I’m exaggerating, but not by a heck of a lot. It’s the same stuff Dr. Bob’s been spewing all along since the measles outbreaks began, antivaccine tropes about how the measles isn’t that bad and how vaccines are “dangerous,” all in the form of bullet points. For example:

About 2,000 severe reactions are reported to the CDC each year which result in prolonged hospitalization, permanent disability, or death. Most reactions aren’t even reported, so the true number may be even higher. Yet, because they can’t be proven, the medical community denies that they can happen.

Over $3 billion have been paid out to victims of vaccine reactions. Not $3 million. Not $30 million. Not even $300 million. But $3 billion. Are we paying that much money to victims of pretend reactions? I think not.

Dr. Bob should change that last sentence from “I think not” to “I don’t think,” as in “I don’t think,” a general statement of Dr. Bob’s intellectual prowess with respect to vaccines. I’m guessing that 2,000 severe reactions a year is probably referring to the > (VAERS) database, which, as regular readers here know, is an open database to which anyone can report any “reaction” to vaccination, whether it’s actually related to a vaccine or not. VAERS is not authoritative, and the adverse events are not generally verified. Indeed, as has been reported before, one pro-vaccine blogger, Dr. Jim Laidler, reported that the influenza vaccine turned him into the Incredible Hulk. True, the VAERS staff did contact this blogger and ask him about it, but, as he noted, if he had refused to remove the entry, it would still be there. Another pro-vaccine blogger, Kevin Leitch, verified that VAERS lets you enter basically anything by reporting that a vaccine had turned his daughter into Wonder Woman. That’s why VAERS is the antivaccinationist’s favorite database, and I like to refer to dubious correlations reported from VAERS as dumpster diving. Not surprisingly, antivaccine lawyers have made the database almost worthless as a source of information over the incidence of adverse events due to vaccines by encouraging their clients to enter all sorts of reports, in particular reports claiming that vaccines caused autism. Most recently, the Toronto Star completely misinterpreted how VAERS data should and shouldn’t be used in its utterly botched story falsely linking all sorts of horrific reactions to Gardasil.

Then Dr. Bob lists a bunch of bullet points, all consisting of tired antivaccine misinformation that was old when Dr. Bob was in medical school, including (my favorite) the claim that measles isn’t dangerous, a claim rebuked by medical science. For instance:

It has killed no one. It can kill about 1 person in every 1000 cases. Will someone die of measles in the United States in the years to come? Maybe. But it hasn’t killed anyone in the past 15 years or more.

The last time measles hit us hard was 25 years ago. Not last year, not this year, yet.

It’s measles, people. It’s not the plague. It’s not polio. It’s not Ebola. It’s measles. If the plague hits, let’s force everyone to vaccinate. But measles? Measles? We need something a lot more dangerous than that if we are going to rob each and every patient of the sacred right of informed consent.

So, measles is no big whoop, even though it can kill one out of a thousand children who get it. Of course, Dr. Bob neglects to note other, more common, complications of the measles that can be very serious, such as pneumonia (which he at least mentioned in his earlier rants) and he very much failed to mention how about one in four victims of this year’s measles outbreak have had to be hospitalized.

But notice the overall construction of Dr. Bob’s argument. To him, measles isn’t serious (which he explicitly states multiple times) and the vaccine is dangerous (which he implies with his listing of “severe complications” of vaccination in general); so to him it follows that “forcing” vaccination is an unacceptable affront to freedom:

Let’s stop panicking over what measles might do and calmly examine what it is doing. It has a small and intermittent presence in our country. It makes people sick, then they get over it. It has complications, but rarely so. Vaccination is important and protective. But it cannot be forced; a parent must give consent. If you would rather make your own medical decisions within the sacred confines of the doctor/patient relationship, then let Sacramento know now. If you would rather give politicians the power to make medical decisions for you, then give them your support. But you better hurry; the outbreak is winding down, and so is the fear. Give them the power before it’s too late. I’m sure they’ll make plenty of other wise medical decisions for you in the years to come.

Rand Paul couldn’t have said it better. Do you hear the dog whistle? Vaccine “choice” is freedom for parents, the health of their children and yours be damned.",1,https://respectfulinsolence.com/2015/02/20/blowing-the-antivaccine-dog-whistle-again/

Ah, the tempest of a media maelstrom. Headlines claim falsely that I am against vaccines or say they cause disorders. Quite ironic, that the press called me anti-vaccine on the same day I received my booster vaccine for Hepatitis A.

In two interviews on the subject this week, I spent the bulk of my time defending vaccines as one of the greatest advancements in medicine. As a doctor, I am well aware of their need and effectiveness.

To me, Dr. Zabdiel Boylston's inoculation of his son with live smallpox was one of the most courageous acts in the history of medicine.

At the time, mortality rate for smallpox was around 50%. The vaccine though, required taking pus from a recovering patient, slitting the arm of the patient and inserting the pus. Overwhelmingly the physician community in Boston opposed vaccination. Mobs gathered outside Bolyston's house. Bricks were thrown through his windows, but he persevered and his son survived.

Within 60 years, George Washington would choose to vaccinate his wife and family before they could visit him in the war camps, where infectious disease killed more people than bullets did.

Not only do I not denounce vaccines, I have always been a proponent of them.

I have been vaccinated — after stepping on nails as a child, in college, in medical school, and six months ago in preparation for my medical mission to Guatemala. I received the booster vaccine just this week.

I chose to vaccinate my children, though I did exercise my parental prerogative to wait a while to vaccinate them against Hepatitis B, a sexually transmitted or blood borne disease, as I thought it unlikely they would catch it in their crib.

When I was at Baylor University, we had an outbreak of measles and I chose to get re- vaccinated. And when my kids entered college, they were vaccinated for meningitis.

I believe in vaccines. But I also believe in the doctors, parents and patients having a say in their healthcare.

For the past five years, many of us having been fighting against coercion and oppose the government intervening in our healthcare decisions. We have been fighting against mandates that come between the doctor and the patient. We believe parents hold authority over their children, not government.

It is possible to believe all of those things, whether or not the mainstream media chooses to believe it. Of course, their prejudice to supporting government power over freedom becomes quite evident at moments like this.

Interestingly, they are acting like this parental choice isn't already the law — but it actually is in 48 states. People are encouraged to vaccinate, and they are asked to show vaccination records to attend school.

But 50 states also have medical exemptions and 48 states have religious exemptions in their laws for parents who wish to choose otherwise.

We should try for honest debates in this country, something that is missing when things are misreported or poorly understood by those writing about them.

I support vaccines. As a doctor, I stand firmly with modern medicine.

I also stand for freedom and for parents over government power.

Story highlights Raul Reyes: Disney announced new Latina princess, which is laudable, likely profitable in America with growing Hispanic population He says multicultural heroines, like Elena, let Disney fans, like Latina girls, feel more fully part of American society

(CNN) —

It matters that Disney has chosen to make its newest princess Hispanic.

Princess Elena of Avalor, who will debut next year on Disney Junior’s “Sofia the First,” according to the company, appears to represent a commitment to diversity – which also happens to be a smart business strategy in a country with a burgeoning Latino population.

But most importantly, Elena – a princess meant to reflect “diverse Latin cultures and folklore,” says Disney – will offer young Latina girls an opportunity to see themselves in the media that they consume. Just like other American girls.

And they will see a lot of her: Elena will have her own animated series later in 2016, and will be voiced by the Dominican-born actress Aimee Carrero, according to a Disney press release.

In other words: Move over Cinderella, there is a new princesa in town.

From Sleeping Beauty to Snow White, the Disney princesses are a staple of pop culture – fantasy heroines iconic to generations of young girls. Disney has introduced with great fanfare ethnically diverse princesses before: the Asian princess (Mulan), a Native-American princess (Pocahontas), a Middle Eastern princess (Jasmine), and an African-American princess (Tiana). And they are no longer primarily known for their ethnicity. They are simply seen as Disney princesses

The same will likely be true of Elena. What’s crucial, is that all young Disney fans can feel included, visible, and relevant through a multicultural lineup of heroines. By seeing themselves throughout our culture, the next generation of Latinas will feel more fully part of American society.

Besides, it couldn’t hurt for young Latinas have a positive role model, even if she is a fictional character. A 2012 study by the National Hispanic Media Coalition found that TV shows and films often contributed to the public’s negative perception of Latinos. In fact, the Coalition found that the top three ways that non-Latinos viewed Latinos in the media were as criminals, gardeners and maids.

Elena also reflects an important recognition by Disney of the power of the Latino consumer market. Last year, the Nielsen Company estimated that U.S. Hispanics have a spending power of $1.4 trillion, and companies like Ford, McDonalds, and Wal-Mart have all targeted Hispanic customers.

Disney already markets a line of quinceñera dresses, so Elena could be seen as a logical extension of their brand. It cannot be lost on Disney that its rival Nickelodeon has enjoyed phenomenal TV and merchandising success with their Latina character Dora the Explorer.

Sure, some critics have expressed reservations about Elena, noting that she is not getting her own movie like the other princesses, and that she is on Disney Junior channel, not the more popular Disney Channel. And Disney generated controversy when it debuted “Sofia the First” in 2013. Sofia was initially reported to be the first Latina princess, and then the company walked back on comments by a producer and declared that Sofia was not Latina after all.

But I think Disney should be applauded for trying again. The enormous reach of the company will ensure that millions of viewers are exposed to an uplifting Latina character. Consider Elena’s series will be rolled out in 25 languages on Disney Junior channels, in 154 countries around the world. That’s a lot of tiaras.

It is welcome news that Disney is finally introducing a princess that looks like thousands of little Hispanic girls. Here’s hoping that someday Elena will be seen not just as a Latina princess, but as a character as American as Mickey Mouse.

693,Paul,Rand,cnn,"Dallas County Sheriff Jim Clark used brute force with impunity to defend segregation in Alabama. On Bloody Sunday, when someone called for an ambulance to help the injured, Clark infamously declared, ""Let the buzzards eat them.""

Civil rights leaders Hosea Williams (wearing a suit) and John Lewis (on the ground) led the march on that Sunday afternoon. Lewis, who has been a congressman from Georgia since being elected in 1986, was badly injured in Selma, suffering a fractured skull after being beaten by troopers.

State troopers donned masks before they fired tear gas that sent the protesters running for safety. A National Voting Rights Museum and Institute was opened many years later at the foot of the Edmund Pettus Bridge.

The march, which became known as ""Bloody Sunday,"" moved the nation to pass the landmark Voting Rights Act, which mandated federal oversight over elections in states with histories of discrimination. The new movie ""Selma"" portrays the march in vivid detail.

About 600 people began a 50-mile march from Selma to the Alabama state capitol in Montgomery on March 7, 1965. They intended to protest discriminatory practices that prevented black people from voting. But as the marchers descended to the foot of the Edmund Pettus Bridge, state troopers used brutal force and tear gas to push them back.

Story highlights ""Selma"" triggered historical debate and claims that some were trying to ""smear"" the movie Julian Zelizer says the value of the film shouldn't get lost in the accusations

Editor’s Note: Julian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University and a New America fellow. He is the author of the new book, “The Fierce Urgency of Now: Lyndon Johnson, Congress and the Battle for the Great Society.” The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.

(CNN) —

Even in their greatest moments of triumph, American presidents can make decisions that in the long run will devastate their legacies.

As soon as the movie opened, it provoked an intense controversy about its portrayal of President Lyndon Johnson. Although most of the movie centers on civil rights activists who organized the marches for voting rights in March 1965, some critics have argued that the depiction of LBJ, played by Tom Wilkinson, was misleading on two fronts. The critics argue that the movie depicts the President as indifferent or even hostile to voting rights until King really forces his hand. The movie, in their minds, understates how much he wanted the voting legislation to pass from the very time of his reelection in November 1964.

Julian Zelizer

Former presidential adviser Joe Califano (who went so far as to credit on LBJ for giving King the idea of Selma), LBJ Library Director Mark Updegrove and others also claim that the movie depicts LBJ as responsible for the FBI wiretaps into the private life of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., culminating with Coretta King receiving tapes of the leader sleeping with another woman, when the authorization for the wiretapping happened under President John Kennedy, his brother Robert who was the attorney general, and J. Edgar Hoover. (Full disclosure: I am one of the people who has raised concerns about some of these issues).

For some people, however, this criticism quickly rolled over into questions about whether the movie deserved to be nominated for the Oscars and if the movie as a whole was any good. One columnist, who admitted being moved to tears upon watching it, wrote that if “Selma” wins the academy award, “truth loses.”

Those on the other side of the debate have raised many objections as well – to the critics rather than the movie. They have insisted that the movie really was about the impact of grass-roots activists, not about Lyndon Johnson. They have been particularly frustrated with Califano’s suggestion that the idea for Selma came from LBJ.

In their viewing of the movie, the narrative about Johnson was also more complex than the critics contended. Some of them have a different read of how Johnson is portrayed, disputing the notion that he comes off as indifferent to voting rights.

But this side has also unfortunately descended into nastier attacks with unfounded allegations that there has been some kind of a “smear” campaign to prevent the film from receiving awards.

It would be great if those involved in this debate could keep their attention on the very important issues that have been raised by Ava Duvernay’s film. In addition to a stirring look at the work that was undertaken by brave civil rights activists who marched right into a brutally violent response from police authorities, she has triggered a vibrant debate about one of the most important issues in American political history: the complex relationship between presidents and grass-roots activists.

How do Washington leaders and movement activists interact in the passage of legislation? How does social action lead to political change? What can presidents and Congress to do respond to social pressure? What are some of the competing demands that each faces in pursuing their goals?

This is the kind of issue that is usually only of interest to political junkies and academic scholars. But because of this film, Duvernay has pushed this question to the front and center of national debate. Moviegoers are talking about the kinds of issues too often confined to the classroom.

The nature of the relationship between presidents and grass-roots activists has been at the heart of most important moments in American politics. During the 1930s, organized labor pressured President Franklin Roosevelt into moving forward with the Wagner Act of 1935, legislation that legitimated unions and created the National Labor Relations Board.

During the 1960s, LBJ constantly turned to civil rights activists to help him build the kind of pressure on Congress and public opinion that was necessary for passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. He always knew that arm-twisting and trading pork could only go so far.

In turn, activists like King counted on Johnson to be a president who would take advantage of the favorable political conditions when they emerged so that the bloodshed was not in vain.

During the 1980s, the conservative movement maintained political pressure on President Ronald Reagan to stay true to its principles, such as insisting on tax cuts and sticking to a hawkish stance against communism.

Sometimes the relationship between presidents and activists has been a partnership, as was the case with LBJ and King in 1965, while at other moments this has broken down into an adversarial situation where neither side believed that the other was serving their interest. This was the case when Johnson treated anti-war activists as his enemies for their protests about Vietnam or when conservatives railed against President George H.W. Bush for having increased taxes in 1990, or when the right turned against his son after 2004 for allowing the federal government to grow.

This relationship has been very much on the minds of many Americans during the current presidency. Under President Obama, there have been many twists and turns in this story.

Early on in his presidency, Obama depended on the momentum and fervor generated from the groups that helped him win office in 2008 as he pushed for the Affordable Care Act and financial regulation. But since the 2010 midterm elections, there have been many progressive groups, such as environmentalists and labor organizers, who have been frustrated with the feeling that the President has turned a cold shoulder to their causes as he tries to deal with an obstructionist Congress.

These kinds of questions are central to my new book about Lyndon Johnson and the Great Society, as I attempted to show that it is impossible to understand why so many domestic programs passed in the mid-1960s without grasping the impact that civil rights activists and voters (in the election of 1964) had on Congress between 1963 and the midterm elections of 1966.

Although I have raised questions about how the film depicts President Johnson on voting rights, the basic message of the film resonates with the story that I try to tell in my book. At a personal level, it has been inspiring to see how Duvernay has been able to extend this conversation to a bigger audience, including young people.

Let’s hope that those who seek to turn this debate about “Selma” into accusation and slander, such as dismissing all criticism about the treatment of LBJ as a smear campaign or those who brush off the entire value of the film because of this depiction, take a step back from the table, leaving space for those who want a serious and legitimate discussion. Movies and television shows have often been effective at triggering robust conversations about politics for a broader public.

The filmmaker deserves for her work to be treated with this kind of respect given the important work that she has done. We can’t allow this to become one more political football in the partisan wars of our time.

Mitt Romney took himself out of the picture last week, but Republicans still have a huge number of potential presidential candidates. While it seems as if Democrats will probably coalesce around one candidate, whenever Hillary Clinton announces her intent to run, the Republicans have a number of key figures – including Chris Christie, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Scott Walker, Jeb Bush, Mario Rubio, to name a few – vying for the nomination.

Tech giants like Apple, Microsoft, and Google have tons of cash, but there's a catch: most of it is offshore.

That means they can either spend their cash abroad or bring it home and hand over up to 35% to Uncle Sam, according to Bloomberg.

Companies can defer paying taxes on revenue earned abroad, so there's not much incentive to bring it back to the states.

But Senators Barbara Boxer (D-CA) and Rand Paul (R-KY) announced a plan on Thursday that could have Silicon Valley grinning ear-to-ear.

The ""Invest In Transportation Act,"" would create a repatriation tax holiday allowing companies to pay just 6.5% on cash they bring home — a huge discount.

The tax holiday would go towards the Highway Trust Fund, which pays for state and local infrastructure projects across the country.

The bill, which hasn't been introduced yet, stipulates that repatriated cash would have to go towards initiatives like R&D, public-private partnerships, and acquisitions. None of it could be used for executive compensation increases or stock buybacks.

The Boxer-Paul plan stems from Congress' opposition to raising the gas tax, which has traditionally gone towards the Highway Trust Fund.

Fuel-efficient cars and ballooning infrastructure costs have run the Highway Trust Fund dry. It will run out of money in May without Congressional action.

Though tech companies would love it, the idea of a tax holiday has already faced skepticism from Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT), Chair of the Senate Finance Committee.

“Tax holiday proposals designed to pay for the transportation bill sound great until you look at the details,"" Hatch said in a statement to The Hill.

This wouldn't be the first time Congress passed a repatriation tax holiday — in 2004, companies were able to bring overseas cash home and suffer only a 5.25% rate. However, a study by a congressional subcommittee found that the 15 companies who brought the most money home cut jobs and spent slightly less on R&D from 2004 through 2007.",1,http://www.businessinsider.com/repatriation-tax-holiday-proposed-by-senators-barbara-boxer-and-rand-paul-2015-1

696,Paul,Rand,newsweek,"On October 23, Senator Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, gave a foreign policy address at the Center for the National Interest in which he declared himself a ""conservative realist,"" aligning himself with the tradition of Ronald Reagan and Caspar Weinberger. (See ""The Case for Conservative Realism."")

As he did in a similar February 2013 speech at the conservative Heritage Foundation, the libertarian-leaning 2016 GOP presidential contender attempted to sell his foreign policy vision to fellow Republicans as a middle path between the near-absolute anti-intervention of his (unmentioned) father and the hyper-interventionism of the Washington Republican establishment.

Reaction to the speech varied widely. Anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist, who has long advocated a less interventionist foreign policy, told reporters, ""I think I just heard Ronald Reagan speaking."" The lefty analysis site Vox enthused that ""Rand Paul just gave one of the most important foreign policy speeches in decades"" because he ""declared war on his own party."" The Hill described the address as ""anti-isolationist,"" while neoconservative Washington Post writer Jennifer Rubin scoffed that Paul was ""still pretending he's not an isolationist."" And so on.

Of particular interest to libertarians looking to probe the senator's foreign policy principles was his seemingly dissonant support for U.S. air strikes against the Islamic State (ISIS) and opposition to intervening in the ongoing Syrian civil war. When Paul first backed hitting ISIS in mid-September, the national political press erupted in a spasm of articles accusing him of politically motivated flip-flopping, a charge the senator testily rejects.

Four days after the speech, Reason magazine Editor-in-Chief Matt Welch spoke with Paul over the telephone to flesh out his notion of realism and probe some limiting principles on taking the nation to war.

Reason magazine: You mentioned in your speech that America shouldn't fight wars when there is no plan for victory. And you're still supporting airstrikes against ISIS. How do you visualize our plan for victory while doing airstrikes against ISIS?

Rand Paul: I see the airstrikes really as defending vital American interests, and that would be our embassy in Baghdad as well as our consulate in Erbil. I've been very critical of Hillary Clinton over the last couple of years for her lack of defense for Benghazi. I do think that it is a function of our national defense and our foreign policy that when we do have embassies around the world, we do defend that presence.

Reason magazine: But then what would be the limiting factor on that? Because we have embassies all around the world, obviously, and bad things will happen from time to time. So how do you prevent that from being a reason to launch airstrikes anytime some random group of bad guys gets within 15 miles of a place that you control?

Rand Paul: I think actually if you look at the world, you'll find very few of our embassies are actually under threat from war. There's probably a list of 20 that may have some threat. Then you narrow the list down, there's probably only I would think less than five. I would think Libya would have been one of those.

""Can we really with certainty believe that anyone is going to defend our embassy other than us in Baghdad?""

One of the reasons I fault Hillary Clinton is for not recognizing and understanding that Libya probably would have been either at the top of the list or in the top five most dangerous places to be in the world for an American diplomat. Right now probably top of the list would be our consulate in Erbil and our embassy in Baghdad. So I don't think that is a generalized warrant to go to war anytime. In fact, I've also said that the president should have made the case to the Congress and asked for authority to be involved in defense of these embassies and in defense of this consulate. He should have asked for permission from Congress the way the Constitution intends.

Reason magazine: What happened to that notion? In September 2013, when you were leading a ragtag army of bipartisan backbenchers against the president, something like 140 congressmen signed a letter saying you can't engage in airstrikes in Syria without coming to us first. What happened to those people and that movement?

Rand Paul: I think there are still a lot of them there. I think, though, there are two sorts of issues. One issue is how you go to war. The other question is whether you go to war.

I think the how you go to war, that coalition is still out there, of people who believe in the Constitution, that Congress declares war. I think that principle actually is a very general principle that includes not only libertarians but conservatives as well.

""I think there is a role for America to be involved with trying to help find a negotiated end or settlement in Iraq that involves people who live there doing more to try to fix the problem.""

The question on whether to go to war, I think as events have unfolded, or whether or not we have to have a response or a defense against ISIS, has changed as circumstances have changed. I think when Syria came up a year ago, there were people, myself included, who were loud voices against getting involved in that messy civil war because we felt like it would be counterproductive, and that you actually might enable and embolden ISIS and other radical jihadist groups in that war. I still maintain that.

My main reason for saying that we have to be involved now is that you have a group that is attacking and killing Americans—I think there is a reasonable threat of [them] attacking our embassy or consulate—and also that has frankly declared war on us. Their spokesmen have said that they will come when they are able and that they do consider that they're at war with us.

Reason magazine: Do you see the Islamic State as more dangerous and worthy of us coming up with a robust response than, say, you would have seen Al-Qaeda or some of their offshoots three or four years ago? Is there a qualitative difference in the type of organization that they have, do you think?

Rand Paul: I think it's hard to compare and contrast. The one thing that many writers have talked about with ISIS is that they control territory and they control munitions and they control access to money, to capital. So in some ways they have a greater degree of organization and ability to be a threat than others would. You could see how if there were a nation that were created called the Islamic State that it would be basically the breeding ground for barbarity. So I think you can make that argument.

You can make some of the argument that in 1998 bin Laden was already sowing, and that him training in Afghanistan was a threat even back into '98. But to give a qualitative or exact differentiation between the two, I don't know if that's helpful.

I think there's a pretty strong argument to be made that this group that took Mosul in a matter of hours, with Erbil not being that far away, that there is some threat to that. As they grow stronger, can we really with certainty believe that anyone is going to defend our embassy other than us in Baghdad? That's the sad state of things over there. For 10 years we were supporting the Iraqi people, supporting the government, giving them arms, training them, but I have my doubts as to whether they're going to show up on the day that ISIS comes rolling in to breach the walls of the embassy.

Reason magazine: That looks to me like a Saigon 1975 situation, where we've poured in $26 billion just in military aid in Iraq to prop up the guys who gave the weapons to the bad guys. What do you look at as a nightmare scenario, of the things that could go horribly, horribly wrong in the Middle East if we don't reverse course or if things just don't get better?

Rand Paul: Instead of looking at the nightmare scenario, I'd look at the opposite way: What can we do to try to prevent a nightmare scenario? I think there are several things.

One, I think that encouragement through diplomatic means or through withholding or advancing help to the Iraqi government is something that we ought to do. That would mean that it needs to be a government that is inclusive as well as an army that is inclusive. If they're an army of Shia, they're never taking back any of those cities and [ISIS] will continue to grow and it will basically be a divided Iraq. Maybe that is what ends up happening anyway. But the only chance for the national government to function is for it to be inclusive of Sunnis.

The other thing that could dramatically change the situation on the ground and lessen the risk of ISIS—to our consulate as well as to our embassy—would be to see if we could be part of facilitating a peace agreement between the Kurds and the Turks. The main thing that prevents the Turks from being involved—and they could be involved in a big way—is that they're not sure who they dislike worse; in fact, they probably dislike the Kurds worse than they dislike ISIS.

""I think it was not advisable to put Georgia and Ukraine into NATO, and at this point in time it is still not advisable.""

So they're watching things unfold on their border because the people in those towns on the border have been fighting them for 70 years, trying to take Turkish land and make it into a Kurdish homeland. I think there is a possibility for there being a Kurdish homeland as part of Iraq. If that were to happen, and we were to support it, you might find that the Turkish Kurds would maybe be interested in a peace deal that would allow them, the Turks, to be more helpful.

None of this is easy, but I think there is a role for America to be involved with trying to help find a negotiated end or settlement that involves people who live there doing more to try to fix the problem.

Reason magazine: You said a couple of different things which may very well be true but might seem to be at least at some tension with one another. The two that stuck out at me were ""the war on terror is not over"" and ""we can't have perpetual war."" How do you square that circle, or how do you even visualize an approach that can contain both of those truisms?

Rand Paul: Understanding that people over there dislike us for a variety of reasons. Sometimes they dislike us for our policy and our presence there. But sometimes they also dislike us just because they have an aberrant and bizarre notion of religion that hates people that are not part of the true religion. So, I think it is a combination of both.

I think [we also have to understand] that perpetual war is not going to win. The long war only wins when civilized Islam decides to stamp out this aberrant form. [Hernando] de Soto had an article in The Wall Street Journal a couple of weeks ago that we quoted from [in my speech]. In it he talked about the experience in Peru, where they did build up their military presence, they did recruit citizens to be involved in it, but they also recognized that the recruitment to the Shining Path [terrorist group] was often one where people were outside the economy because of government obstruction.

So they made it much easier to incorporate people from the nonofficial marketplace into an official marketplace, meaning making it easier to get licenses, easier to sell your stuff on the corner. In doing that, he felt that there was a great deal of lessening of the impetus for people to join the Shining Path. I think [the reformers] have largely won that war.

He studied the problem in Egypt, and I like the way that he looked at the man who committed self-immolation in Tunisia. He wasn't a religious radical. He wasn't really looking so much for religious counterbalance; he was looking basically for economic freedom. [De Soto] mentioned how much off-the-books economy there is in Egypt because of the crony capitalism, that if you can get that as part of the official marketplace then the economy booms and things become more secure, title becomes more certain and really the impetus for terrorism [recedes].

So there are other ways to fight other than perpetual war, is what I'm trying to say.

Reason magazine: How have your travels to the region, your term in office, even the process of running—or, I'm sorry, not running for president, just being a nationally prominent politician—how has that, if at all, altered your worldview about U.S. foreign policy?

Rand Paul: Some of it is, four years ago I was an ophthalmologist practicing in a small town. So my worldview might have been a little more narrow at the time because I really wasn't thinking that an ophthalmologist had to have a foreign policy.

I've had some principles that I've had probably for a long time. They're principles that we should obey the law in foreign policy, that the Constitution is important, that our Founding Fathers were very explicit that it would be difficult to go to war and they would have to pass through Congress and that's a messy process, that it probably would be infrequent because you have to have consensus when it happens. That remains a steadfast belief.

The second part, though, is not the process of how it occurs, but the facts of it. I think that's something that good people can debate, but it involves facts and it involves presentation of whether or not something is in our national security interest or a vital American interest. I think that's where the real debate needs to occur. One is how you do it: The Congress should do it, not the president unilaterally. But then when you get to Congress, then it is a debate over the facts, and sometimes reasonable people might disagree on when exactly a vital American interest is broached.

But the thing that we should do is not just make a conclusion [without] a debate. I think probably too often in the past several decades politicians have simply said, ""Oh, it's in our national interest."" Well, that's a conclusion, and that skips the debate. Part of the reason to come into Congress is that then there would be a full-throated debate, hearing the facts, listening to it, discussing whether or not involvement in a region around the world is in our vital interest.

""It is no longer probably as necessary to have large amounts of land troops in different places.""

But having skipped that step is a serious problem, and I will continue to push when Congress comes back that it is our obligation, it is our role to vote on this. Although it seems a day late and a dollar short to do it four months after the campaign has commenced.

Reason magazine: Shifting gears a little bit here, you've been digging deep in the well of George Kennan, and you've read enough of him by now to realize that George Kennan contained multitudes throughout a very long and storied career. He was a huge late-in-life critic of expanding NATO, which a lot of libertarians are against and for whatever reasons I am not. Do you agree with that bit of Kennanism? Do you think we expanded NATO too much?

Rand Paul: There are two sides to the argument. One side says, well if you put them in NATO then Russia won't attack them because they'll know that we'll defend them. The other side says, you put them in NATO and you provoke the bear and you end up having more war. I think some of it depends on exactly what geography we're talking about.

We have included the Baltic nations, but we did not include Georgia or Ukraine, I think, because Georgia and Ukraine had historically been part of Russia for a long, long time. I think it was not advisable to put them into NATO, and at this point in time it is still not advisable.

The Baltic nations are part of NATO, and I think that is what it is. We have to approach things from where we are, and not from where we want to be, because I think once people become part of NATO, there's not an undoing part of that process.

Reason magazine: Speaking of the world as it is, we are extended into any number of hundreds of bases and troop deployments in Korea and Japan and the usual litany that I don't need to bore us both with. To what extent, even as maintaining a very robust defense, to what extent can or should America withdraw some of its reach or just numbers in places that are relatively peaceful?

Rand Paul: I think the world we live in, it is no longer probably as necessary to have large amounts of land troops in different places. Is it still necessary to have air bases and places to refuel and to have our presence out there as a force for open commerce? For example, since the beginning of the republic we thought there was a role for not letting pirates attack our ships. Is there a role for us around the world? I would say yes.

Over time, even without having a lot of libertarian influence, I think cost influences downsizing greatly. The number of folks that are stationed in Europe, I don't have the exact numbers, but it's considerably less than it was 20 years ago. I think there is definitely an argument to be made that we don't have to have hundreds of thousands of troops forward-deployed, but that we should have good relations with allies, good places to be at port with allies, and there will still be presences in certain places around the world.

But our goal should not be to be involved in every civil war around the world, but to actually try to be able to defend our interests without being drawn into every war.

Reason magazine: I'll end on politics. [In] 2007 it was basically Ron Paul versus nine uber-hawks; 2012, the field starts to look a little bit different, people questioning the Iraq war, at least a little bit. How do you assess the comparative broad strains of the foreign policy debate in the Republican Party heading into the 2016 election?

Rand Paul: I think there are two audiences. The audience in Washington is basically in favor of involvement everywhere, all the time. At the top of both parties, often they're for indiscriminate involvement, I think. But if you talk to the American people, in the Republican Party or the Democratic Party, I think you'll find that, even within the rank and file of the military, there's less enthusiasm for being involved in every civil war around the world, and that people out in the countryside recognize that we have problems here at home: that the economy is still struggling, that we have to defend the country and that we need strong leadership.

I think the vast majority of people are not for sending 50,000 troops back into Iraq at this point. But the vast majority is also for standing up and saying to barbarians that we're not going to let you behead our citizens. So I think it's a little bit of both. I think if you're looking at audiences in Washington you'll find that there's an opinion that doesn't really reflect the American opinion that well.

697,Paul,Rand,washingtontimes,"ANALYSIS/OPINION:

Originally published April 25, 2013

I am firmly committed to being part of reforming our nation’s immigration laws. Conservatives and liberals agree that our complex immigration system is broken and in need of repair. Although the two sides disagree on solutions, I have three important ideas that should be part of the debate and that should please most Americans.

My “Trust but Verify” plan has three elements: secure the border, secure the vote and secure the taxpayer’s dollar. If these three elements are met, I think, Congress can move forward on a comprehensive plan to reform immigration law.

Securing the border is my first priority. Under my plan, national and border security will move as the first element of any reform and would require annual votes of Congress to establish that the border is truly secure. No other reform can go forward until this happens. In addition to increased border security, our nation needs to modernize our visa system. We need to know who comes and goes on travel, student and other temporary visas. There must be a workable system to ensure that visitors don’t use travel visas as a way to enter the country, then disappear. This will address the problem of visa overstayers.

National security has to be a cornerstone to any border-security and visa-reform initiative. Our nation needs to look back at the 9/11 Commission report and study the recommendations with regard to terrorists’ use of visas to commit acts of violence against America. The Sept. 11 hijackers used visas to enter the country and to stay here while planning their attacks.

Strong border security includes using cutting-edge technology. Satellites, physical barriers, screening to bar criminals and terrorists from entry, increased patrols on the border and yes, surveillance drones all should be part of a comprehensive plan to physically protect the border. My idea is to take specific measures at the border and then have the office of inspector general for the Government Accountability Office produce a report to Congress on the progress of border security.

My idea takes border security a step further than the proposals of anybody else in Congress. Under my plan, Congress will vote every year on border security. If Congress votes that the border is not secure, elements of immigration reform will cease going forward and visa programs will be slowed. If Congress does not think the border is secure after five years, every element of immigration reform will be stopped.

Securing the vote is also important in this debate, and I think Congress should look at reforming our “motor voter” laws to prevent fraud as a large bloc of immigrants are legalized but are not eligible to vote. President Clinton signed the National Voter Registration Act in 1993 that allows state governments to register voters when people come in to get driver’s licenses. Still, some of these same states resist the idea that people need to produce a driver’s license to prove who they are when they vote. Preventing noncitizens from being included on the voter rolls is necessary for and consistent with fair immigration reform.

The third plank of my plan is to secure the taxpayers’ dollars through welfare reform. When reforming immigration laws, our nation needs to make sure we don’t explode our national debt with a pathway to the welfare state. In a perfect world, Congress would be debating welfare reform alongside immigration reform.

America is a nation of immigrants. Our Founding Fathers fled the tyranny of the British Empire and declared independence in 1776. Throughout history, our nation has been flooded with immigrants with a flavor for the home country, yet they have assimilated into what we know today as America. This idea, and the American dream, must be protected and preserved.

Immigrants are drawn to the magnet of free-market capitalism in the United States. Our nation should have open arms to immigrants who want to work hard to make a new life in a free nation. As a libertarian-minded senator, I am attracted to the idea of somebody coming to this country with a couple of dollars in his pocket and then, through hard work, making it big.

That American dream has been attacked by welfare dependency and crony capitalism. The poor get hooked on welfare money that saps the will to work. Welfare is supposed to be a last-line-of-defense safety net, yet today, it is a magnet that pulls people away from the American dream and toward an addiction to socialist government dependency.

I want federal and state agencies to coordinate with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement arm of the Department of Homeland Security to make sure immigrants don’t get on the welfare rolls. If you come here to work, we have a place for you.

There is no way America can keep borrowing billions of dollars from China to fund annual deficits of more than $1 trillion. Our national debt is a staggering $16.8 trillion. Our nation is driving off a cliff of debt. Two chief reasons for this are the massive welfare state and crony capitalism. The government bails out corporations with friendly lobbyists for Republicans while funding a massive welfare state for Democrats. This must end.

I am committed to immigration reform that will secure the border, secure the vote and secure the taxpayers’ money from the welfare state.

699,Paul,Rand,ocregister,"We’re surprised at how many people ask why we, as Republicans, are working to change our criminal justice and prison systems. Why wouldn’t we?

We must change our current system – a system that drains tax dollars, destabilizes families and, worse, isn’t making us any safer. That’s why we have joined other Republicans, law enforcement officials, crime victims and many others in support of Proposition 47, a California ballot initiative that will prioritize incarceration resources for serious and violent crime, while investing savings in proven crime-prevention approaches.

This common-sense measure epitomizes an important trend in our country. There is a growing consensus among Americans from all political persuasions and walks of life that we must replace ineffective, unfair and expensive incarceration practices with new, smarter approaches to keeping communities safe.

The United States has 500 percent more people today in its prisons and jails than 30 years ago. Our general population certainly has not grown at this rate (it rose only 36.3 percent from 1980 to 2010); the real driver has been “tough on crime” laws that sent more people to prison for longer terms.

Criminologists, law enforcement officials and policymakers are realizing that in an effort to be tough on crime, we actually ended up being tougher on families and taxpayers, without improving safety.

The Golden State is the under a federal mandate to reduce prison crowding and has watched its prison budget balloon to $10 billion in 2014. That exceeds the total budgets for 12 U.S. states.

Despite all this investment, 61 percent of individuals leaving California prisons return within the first three years. Many are addicted to drugs and are not required to seek treatment, and 45 percent of California prisoners have recently experienced mental illness.

When you consider these factors – and the $62,000 price tag for each prisoner per year – California is right to look for new ways to hold people accountable for non-violent crimes.

That’s where Prop. 47 comes in. Called the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Act, Prop. 47 will reclassify six nonviolent felonies to misdemeanor punishments. Instead of sending someone to prison for simple drug possession, writing a bad check or petty shoplifting, other forms of accountability – focused on actually changing behavior – will be utilized by prosecutors and judges.

The California Legislative Analyst’s Office projects the Act saving taxpayers $150 million to $250 million every year, which would go into drug and mental health treatment, K-12 crime-prevention programs and victims’ services.

It’s therefore no surprise that conservatives embrace this measure, along with district attorneys, judges, veteran law enforcement leaders, crime-victim groups, chambers of commerce, faith leaders and many more. When something offers so much promise for our public safety and public resources, why wouldn’t we?

700,Paul,Rand,reason,"On August 23, 2014 Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) gave the following speech in New York City at the annual dinner of The National Interest. Founded in 1985 by Irving Kristol and Owen Harries, the publication has long argued that U.S. foreign policy should fundamentally reflect American interests and needs.

The current editors write that the magazine's large approach ""is guided by the belief that nothing will enhance [U.S.] interests as effectively as the approach to foreign affairs commonly known as realism—a school of thought traditionally associated with such thinkers and statesmen as Disraeli, Bismarck, and Henry Kissinger. Though the shape of international politics has changed considerably in the past few decades, the magazine's fundamental tenets have not. Instead, they have proven enduring and, indeed, appear to be enjoying something of a popular renaissance. Until recently, however, liberal hawks and neoconservatives have successfully attempted to stifle debate by arguing that prudence about the use of American power abroad was imprudent—by, in short, disparaging realism as a moribund doctrine that is wholly inimical to American idealism. This has been disastrous.""

What follows is the prepared text of Paul's speech.

Immediately before the fall of the Berlin Wall, Francis Fukuyama wrote that we are at ""the end of history.""

The world, Fukuyama argued, had arrived at what he called the universal triumph of ""Western liberal democracy as the final point of human government.""

Almost 25 years later, we know Fukuyama was either wrong or, at the very least, a bit optimistic.

History has not ended.

Russia slides backward vainly hoping to resurrect the Soviet Union.

Vladimir Putin justifies aggression in Ukraine as defense against decadent and hypocritical Western powers.

In East Asia, Beijing extols the remarkable rise of China as the supremacy of a one-party state capitalism.

In the Middle East, secular dictatorships have been replaced by the rise of radical jihadist movements, who in their beliefs and barbarity—represent the antithesis of liberal democracy.

These challenges are in part consequences of failing to define our national security interest in a new era.

Our allies and our enemies are unsure where America stands.

Until we develop the ability to distinguish, as George Kennan put it, between vital interests and more peripheral interests, we will continue to drift from crisis to crisis.

Today I want to share with you my views on how to address these threats and how I see America's role in the world.

I want to spell out for you what I believe to be the principles of a national security strategy of strength and action.

Americans want strength and leadership but that doesn't mean they see war as the only solution.

Reagan had it right when he spoke to potential adversaries: ""Our reluctance for conflict should not be misjudged as a failure of will.""

After the tragedies of Iraq and Libya, Americans are right to expect more from their country when we go to war.

America shouldn't fight wars where the best outcome is stalemate. America shouldn't fight wars when there is no plan for victory.

America shouldn't fight wars that aren't authorized by the American people, by Congress.

America should and will fight wars when the consequences….intended and unintended….are worth the sacrifice.

The war on terror is not over, and America cannot disengage from the world.

President Obama claims that al Qaeda is decimated. But a recent report by the RAND Corporation tracked a 58 percent increase over the last three years in jihadist terror groups.

To contain and ultimately defeat radical Islam, America must have confidence in our constitutional republic, our leadership, and our values.

To defend our country we must understand that a hatred of our values exists, and acknowledge that interventions in foreign countries may well exacerbate this hatred, but that ultimately, we must be willing and able to defend our country and our interests.

As Reagan said: ""When action is required to preserve our national security, we will act.""

Will they hate us less if we are less present?

Perhaps….but hatred for those outside the circle of ""accepted"" Islam, exists above and beyond our history of intervention overseas.

?The world does not have an Islam problem.

The world has a dignity problem, with millions of men and women across the Middle East being treated as chattel by their own governments.

Many of these same governments have been chronic recipients of our aid.

When the anger boils over as it did in Cairo, the anger is directed not only against Mubarak but also against the United States because of our support for Mubarak.

Some anger is blowback, but some anger originates in an aberrant and intolerant distortion of religion that wages war against all infidels.

We can't be sentimental about neutralizing that threat, but we also can't be blind to the fact that drone strikes that inadvertently kill civilians may create more jihadists than we eliminate.

The young activist Malala Yousafzai, whom the Taliban in Pakistan shot in the head at point-blank range for insisting that girls have the right to attend school, voiced this concern when she met with President Obama.

She said: ""It is true that when there's a drone attack…terrorists are killed. But 500 and 5,000 more people rise against it and more terrorism occurs.""

The truth is, you can't solve a dignity problem with military force. It was Secretary Gates who warned that our foreign policy has become over-militarized.

Yes, we need a hammer ready, but not every civil war is a nail.

There is a time to eliminate our enemies, but there is also a time to cultivate allies and encouragers among civilized Muslim nations.

Those of you who are familiar with me know that I deeply believe in individual liberty.

But I have learned through experience that this ideal can only be achieved by recognizing, as Bismarck said, that, policy is the art of the possible.

We need a foreign policy that recognizes our limits and preserves our might, a common-sense conservative realism of strength and action.

We can't retreat from the world, but we can't remake it in our own image either.

We can't and shouldn't engage in nation building, but we can facilitate trade and extend the blessings of freedom and free markets around the world.

Here's how I see the most important principles that should drive America's foreign policy.

First, the Use of Force is and always has been an indispensable part of defending our country.

War is necessary when America is attacked or threatened, when vital American interests are attacked and threatened, and when we have exhausted all other measures short of war.

While no foreign policy should preclude the use of force, Reagan understood that war should never be the first resort.

Eisenhower understood this also when he said, ""Belligerence is the hallmark of insecurity.""

The war in Afghanistan is an example of a just, necessary war. I supported the decision to go into Afghanistan after 9/11.

I still do today.

America was attacked by Al Qaeda, and there was a clear initial objective: dismantle the Taliban, and deny Al Qaeda safe haven.

The invasion showcased the best of modern American military strength and ingenuity: we went in with Special Forces and heavy air power, and formed critical alliances.

The Taliban were ousted from power, and Al Qaeda fled. We kept a limited force in Afghanistan to wage counterterrorism and we understood, at first, the limits of nation building in a country decimated by over 30 years of constant war.

?Only after our initial success did the lack of a clear objective give rise to mission creep. Today Afghanistan is more violent than when President Obama came into office.

He deployed another 50,000 troops, nearly doubling our forces in Afghanistan, and added $120 billion dollars to the deficit.

And yet, the results are discouraging. The leading cause of death among our soldiers now comes from enemies disguised in the uniforms of our allies.

1,422 troops have died since President Obama ordered the surge.

We have now spent more money in Afghanistan than we did for the Marshall Plan and yet after the killing of Bin Laden and the toppling of the Taliban, it is hard to understand our exact objective.

Stalemate and perpetual policing seem to be our mission now in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria.

A precondition to the use of force must be a clear end goal. We can't have perpetual war.

A second principle is that Congress, the people's representative, must authorize the decision to intervene.

Reagan's defense secretary, Caspar Weinberger, outlined a systematic approach to sending American troops to war.

A critical component of this doctrine is support from the American public.

The Libyan war was fought without the approval of Congress or the American people.

President Obama claimed our military was ""being volunteered by others to carry out missions"" in Libya. He fundamentally misunderstands our Republic.

Let me be very clear:

France doesn't send our men and women in uniform to war, the United Nations doesn't send our soldiers to war, Congress, and only Congress can constitutionally initiate war!

The war in Libya was not in our national interest. It had no clear goal and it led to less stability.

Today, Libya is a jihadist wonderland, a sanctuary and safe haven for terror groups across North Africa.

Our Ambassador was assassinated and our Embassy forced to flee over land to Tunisia. Jihadists today swim in our Embassy swimming pool.

The Obama administration, urged on by Hillary Clinton, wanted to go to war but didn't anticipate the consequences of war.

Libya is now more chaotic and America is less safe.

War should not be a unilateral decision taken in the isolation of the White House. But that is what happened.

In failing to seek Congressional authority, President Obama missed a chance to galvanize the country. He missed a chance to lead.

A President who recognizes the Constitutional limitations of power is not weakened, but actually empowered by the public debate that comes with a declaration of war.

I support a strategy of air strikes against ISIS.

Our airpower must be used to rebalance the tactical situation in favor of the Kurds and Iraqis and to defend Americans and our assets in the region.

Just as we should have defended our consulate in Benghazi, so too we must defend our consulate in Erbil and our embassy in Baghdad.

I don't support arming the so-called Sunni moderates in Syria, though.

I said a year ago and I say it again now. The ultimate sad irony is that we are forced to fight against the very weapons we send to Syrian rebels.

The weapons are either indiscriminately given to ""less than moderate rebels"" or simply taken from moderates by ISIS.

600 tons of weapons have been given to the Syrian rebels, inadvertently creating a safe haven for ISIS.

Although I support the call for defeating and destroying ISIS, I doubt that a decisive victory is possible in the short term, even with the participation of the Kurds, the Iraqi government, and other moderate Arab states.

In the end, only the people of the region can destroy ISIS. In the end, the long war will end only when civilized Islam steps up to defeat this barbaric aberration.

A third principle is the belief that peace and security require a commitment to diplomacy and leadership.

Around the world we see the consequences of failed diplomacy and absence of leadership after 6 years of the Obama administration.

Military force is meaningless if our leaders cannot reinforce American diplomacy through engagement and leadership.

President Obama never invested in relationships with Congress, and the same is true of his foreign policy. To have friends, you have to be a friend.

In the run up to the Gulf War in 1991, Arab nations believed that once President Bush drew a line, he wouldn't let Iraq cross it.

And President Bush didn't ""dance on the Berlin Wall"" when it crumbled; instead he worked behind the scenes to help the Cold War end calmly.

In light of the new threat posed by ISIS, I believe it is even more imperative that Tehran and Washington find an effective diplomatic solution for limiting the Iranian enrichment program. A nuclear armed Iran would only further destabilize a region in turmoil.

Another diplomatic challenge is Russia's military intervention in Ukraine. Putin's actions not only threaten Ukraine, but represent a threat to the post-Cold War European order.

I support the sanctions that the U.S. and the European Union put in place against Russia.

I also agree with the measures taken at the NATO Summit to increase the Alliance's military preparedness, especially increased European defense spending.

We need to use sanctions and defense spending to achieve a diplomatic settlement that takes into account Russia's long-standing ties with Ukraine and allows Kiev to develop its relations both with Russia and the West.

As Kissinger put it: ""If Ukraine is to survive and thrive, it must not be either side's outpost against the other — it should function as a bridge between them.""

Ukraine is geographically and historically bound to both regions.

We will need to understand that even with our help, Ukraine will not be able to stand up to Russian pressure unless it undertakes some fundamental reforms, such as stamping out corruption and restructuring its energy sector.

This brings me to the last principle I'd like to discuss today: we are only as strong as our economy.

Admiral Mike Mullen, then the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, put it succinctly: the biggest threat to our national security is our debt.

A bankrupt nation doesn't project power but rather weakness.

Our national power is a function of the national economy. During the Reagan renaissance, our strength in the world reflected our successful economy.

Low growth, high unemployment, and big deficits have undercut our influence in the world. Americans have suffered real consequences from a weak economy.

President George W. Bush understood that part of the projection of American power is the exporting of American goods and culture. His administration successfully brokered fourteen new free trade agreements and negotiated three others that are the only new free trade agreements approved since President Obama took office. Instead of just talking about a so-called ""pivot to Asia,"" the Obama administration should prioritize negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership by year's end.

Free trade and technology should be the greatest carrot of our statecraft.

Trade is a critical element of building a productive relationship with other nations, including China.

While our relations with China are complicated, trade has drawn us together and mutual investment can also play a constructive role. In an era in which geopolitics could drive us apart, we need to look for new areas for US-Chinese cooperation.

Promoting free markets should be a priority.

The only long-term strategy that will change the world is fostering successful capitalist economies that increase living standards and connect people through trade.

From Kiev to Cairo to Tunis, we are witnessing a historic time of protest against the injustice of overbearing, corrupt governments.

If the long war is ever to end, we must understand the frustrations of the street.

It isn't always abject poverty or religion that motivates recruits or sets off conflict.

Often it is the despair and humiliation that comes from overbearing government.

Twenty-six year old Mohamed Bouazizi, the Tunisian street merchant who set himself afire and began the Arab Spring, was an aspiring entrepreneur foiled by a corrupt government.

Bouazizi had a dream: he'd save for a pick-up truck. But cronyism and an overbearing government stifled his dream.

Constantly harassed for money he didn't have, Bouazizi doused himself in kerosene and lit a match.

My great-grandfather came to America with a dream not unlike Bouazizi's. He peddled vegetables until he saved enough to purchase a truck, elevating him to what they called then a ""truck farmer,"" a level that allowed him to purchase a home and small bit of land.

The difference between America in the late nineteenth century and places in the Middle East…South Asia..Africa…and South America…today is that bribes and cronyism were not necessary to get a license to purchase a truck or sell vegetables.

Peruvian economist Hernando de Soto spoke to Bouazizi's brother and asked if he left a legacy. Bouazizi's brother responded: ""Of course, he believed the poor had the right to buy and sell.""

Tonight I have outlined the principles we must remember if we are to advance security, peace, and human dignity.

These principles of conservative realism are a return to traditional Republican values that recognize our limits and realize our might.

Americans yearn for leadership and for strength, but they don't yearn for war.

Our enemies should bear witness to the unmatched and unstoppable American force that was justifiably unleashed after 9/11 and know that terrorism will never defeat America, that terrorism will only awaken and embolden our resolve.

But the world should also know that America aspires to peace, trade, and commerce with all.

That though we will not abide injustice we will not instigate war.

That our noblest intentions are sincere and war will always be our last resort, and that ""our reluctance for war must not be mistaken for lack of resolve"" …

That the exceptional ideas that formed our republic unify us in the defense of freedom, and we will never back down in the defense of our naturally derived, inalienable rights.",1,http://reason.com/archives/2014/10/24/rand-paul-the-case-for-foreign-policy-re

It’s time to end aid to the Palestinian Authority.

This week, three young boys were buried in Israel. The victims of kidnapping, they had been murdered by terrorists from Hamas.

The boys, Eyal Yifrach, 19; Gilad Shaar, 16; and Naftali Frenkel, a 16-year-old dual U.S.–Israeli citizen, were like any other children — their lives ready to be lived, their dreams ahead of them. They grew up in a nation that was at war but desperately wanted peace.

Advertisement

It is a peace they did not live to see, nor will others their age if action is not taken.

The Obama administration responded with its condolences to the families and to the state of Israel, as well it should have. But it also called, as it always does in situations like this, for restraint on the part of Israel.

How many times must Israel hear this call? Children are murdered — please show restraint. Cafés and buses are bombed — please show restraint. Towns are victimized by hundreds of rockets — please show restraint while you bury your dead once again.

I think it is clear by now: Israel has shown remarkable restraint. It possesses a military with clear superiority over that of its Palestinian neighbors, yet it does not respond to threat after threat, provocation after provocation, with the type of force that would decisively end their conflict.

But sometimes restraint can work against you. Sometimes you just have to say, enough is enough.

Nearly six weeks ago, I proposed a bill called the “Stand With Israel Act.” Its purpose was to cut off the flow of U.S. taxpayer dollars to the Palestinian Authority if it allied with Hamas — the same Hamas that just murdered these three teenagers.

So let’s be clear: U.S. taxpayer money may soon be going to an entity kidnapping and murdering Israeli and U.S. children.

Advertisement

That is unconscionable, and it must end.

There are those who have said my bill is unnecessary, that current law will allow the Obama administration to cut off the aid money.

I don’t believe that, and no supporter of Israel should believe that. Remember, the Obama administration did not respond to these murders by calling for Palestinian/Hamas aid to be cut off. Instead, they called for “restraint.” The Obama administration chose to lecture Israel instead of punish the perpetrators.

I call for all aid to the Palestinian Authority — every penny — to be cut off. Not one more U.S. taxpayer dollar should flow to Hamas or to the Palestinian Authority as long as it is allied with Hamas.

Some say my position is too hard-line, too strong. To them I say, how many more children must die before it is acceptable to cut off the flow of money to terrorists?

I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting my Stand with Israel Act, and urge the Senate to take action immediately upon its return.

I asked for unanimous consent to pass this bill weeks ago. I will do so again next week. Whoever wants to come down to object will need to explain to the parents of these teenagers why the United States of America is funding their murderers.

703,Paul,Rand,nytimes,"WASHINGTON — I BELIEVE that killing an American citizen without a trial is an extraordinary concept and deserves serious debate. I can’t imagine appointing someone to the federal bench, one level below the Supreme Court, without fully understanding that person’s views concerning the extrajudicial killing of American citizens.

But President Obama is seeking to do just that. He has nominated David J. Barron, a Harvard law professor and a former acting assistant attorney general, to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.

While he was an official in the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel, Mr. Barron wrote at least two legal memos justifying the execution without a trial of an American citizen abroad. Now Mr. Obama is refusing to share that legal argument with the American people.

On April 30, I wrote to the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, urging him to delay this nomination, pending a court-ordered disclosure of the first memo I knew about. Since that letter, I have learned more. The American Civil Liberties Union sent a letter to all senators on May 6, noting that in the view of the Senate Intelligence Committee chairwoman, Dianne Feinstein, “there are at least eleven OLC opinions on the targeted killing or drone program.” It has not been established whether Mr. Barron wrote all those memos, but we do know that his controversial classified opinions provided the president with a legal argument and justification to target an American citizen for execution without a trial by jury or due process.",1,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/12/opinion/show-us-the-drone-memos.html
704,Paul,Rand,theamericanconservative,"The Bill of Rights is and should be popular. It is something most Americans overwhelmingly support. Conservatives love the Second Amendment and honest progressives defend the First Amendment. But it is sometimes harder for the public to embrace and champion the due process of the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth amendments.

Why? Because to defend due process sometimes means defending trials, lawyers, and privacy for people accused of heinous crimes. Understandably, some don’t choose to think about the fact that the worst imaginable people in our society are still guaranteed rights as citizens—the right to trial by jury, the right to an attorney, the right to be free from suspicionless searches.

Who would want to defend the rights of awful rapists and murderers? The easy response is that we defend due process to try to ensure that the person who is punished is guilty of the crime. There have been times in our country’s history when due process was ignored or absent. The lynching of black men in the South is the most egregious. The internment of Japanese Americans during World War II is another stain on our history when we strayed from due process.

Last year, President Obama signed into law a bill that allows for the indefinite detention without charge of an American citizen. When I asked a fellow Senator if this meant that an American citizen could be sent to Guantanamo Bay without charge or jury trial, and be indefinitely detained for the rest of their life, he responded: “If they are dangerous.”

But this only begs the question: Who gets to decide if they are dangerous?

We have a Bill if Rights to protect us—innocent, law-abiding Americans citizens, not criminals, not terrorists, not enemies.

The Bill of Rights exists to protect citizens like Richard Jewell, the security guard whose efforts helped save lives during the bombing of the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. After the bombing, Jewell became a suspect in the investigation and was quickly convicted in the court of public opinion. Everyone rushed to label him a terrorist.

After 88 days of media speculation and slander, Jewell was formally cleared of all charges. They eventually caught the real culprit who set the bombs. Today, one could easily imagine some calling for Jewell’s constitutional rights to be waived and for him to be indefinitely detained as an enemy combatant.

But luckily for Jewell, and all Americans, we have a Bill of Rights that protects us.

If Jewell had been a black man in Jim Crow South he might have been lynched from the nearest tree. Due process not only protects the innocent, but becomes a necessity if democratic majorities begin to oppress minorities, which, tragically, has happened in our history.

Last week the Supreme Court decided that DNA evidence can be extracted from arrestees—someone merely accused of a crime. In the past, DNA has been extracted from individuals convicted of a crime, with it being understood by all that one’s liberties and access to normal freedoms is curtailed after conviction.

The problem with allowing DNA to be forcefully taken from accused individuals is that people wrongly accused could be made part of a national registry. Some would respond that if you’ve done nothing wrong, you have nothing to fear from a national registry. That might be true if government were always and everywhere comprised of angels. Experience tells us that government officials often fall short of being angelic.

Think of the recent IRS targeting of the President’s political opponents.

On the other side, some would argue that the DNA evidence obtained helped us catch a rapist. This is true but, interestingly enough, in this case, the DNA evidence could have been collected after his conviction for the crime for which he was arrested.

In his dissent in Maryland v. King, Justice Scalia makes this point well, “the ironic result is … that the only arrestees to whom the outcome here will ever make a difference are those who have been acquitted of the crime of arrest.”

So, really by limiting DNA collection to only convicted criminals all we are really doing is excluding people from the invasive search of DNA who are deemed innocent. Scalia dissented because he believes that DNA should not be collected from those merely accused. I agree.

Scalia said, pithily, in his dissent: “I doubt that the proud men who wrote the charter of our liberties would have been so eager to open their mouths for royal inspection.”

The Founding Fathers knew that the protection of liberty was contingent upon never giving government too much power or trust. Maryland v. King gives government a benefit of the doubt that common sense, history and the Constitution tell us it does not deserve.

Rand Paul, a Republican, is a U.S. senator from Kentucky.

If I had planned to speak for 13 hours when I took the Senate floor Wednesday, I would’ve worn more comfortable shoes. I started my filibuster with the words, “I rise today to begin to filibuster John Brennan’s nomination for the CIA. I will speak until I can no longer speak” — and I meant it.

I wanted to sound an alarm bell from coast to coast. I wanted everybody to know that our Constitution is precious and that no American should be killed by a drone without first being charged with a crime. As Americans, we have fought long and hard for the Bill of Rights. The idea that no person shall be held without due process, and that no person shall be held for a capital offense without being indicted, is a founding American principle and a basic right.

My official starting time was 11:47 a.m. on Wednesday, March 6, 2013.

I had a large binder of materials to help me get through my points, but although I sometimes read an op-ed or prepared remarks in between my thoughts, most of my filibuster was off the top of my head and straight from my heart. From 1 to 2 p.m., I barely looked at my notes. I wanted to make sure that I touched every point and fully explained why I was demanding more information from the White House.

Just before 3 p.m., Sens. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) came to the Senate floor to help out. Under Senate rules, I could not yield the floor or my filibuster would end, and Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) could have shut me down. The only way for me to continue and allow Sens. Lee and Cruz to speak was to yield the floor for questions.

Their presence gave me strength and inspiration. Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) also arrived to help. Sen. Ron Wyden (Ore.), the only Democrat who came to my defense, explained how we have worked together to demand more information from the White House about the rules for drone strikes. At about 4:30 p.m., Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) joined. I was flagging for a while, but these senators kept me going.

Sen. Reid came to the Senate floor to ask me when I would be done so he could schedule a vote. But I wasn’t ready to yield. I felt I had a lot more explaining to do.

At about 6:30 p.m., something extraordinary happened. Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.), who has been recovering from a stroke, came to the floor to give me something. I was not allowed to drink anything but water or eat anything but the candy left in our Senate desks. But he brought me an apple and a thermos full of tea — the same sustenance Jimmy Stewart brought to the Senate floor in the movie “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.” That was a moment I will never forget.

Sen. Cruz came to the floor again just before 7:30 p.m. and said, “Given that the Senate rules do not allow for the use of cellular phones on the floor of the Senate, I feel quite confident that the senator from Kentucky is not aware of the Twitter-verse that has been exploding.”

I had little idea of what was going on. I was allowed only to talk and listen to questions. As I started to walk around the Senate chamber to loosen up my legs, I was energized by the responses on Twitter. Sen. Cruz really lifted my spirits when he read the tweets.

Then something unexpected happened. House conservatives started appearing in the back of the chamber to show their support. Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Tex.), who stayed for five hours, offered me his boots when I complained that I had not worn my most comfortable shoes. My good friend Rep. Thomas Massie from Kentucky came over. And then came the conservative cavalry of Reps. Justin Amash (Mich.), Ron DeSantis (Fla.), Doug LaMalfa (Calif.), Garland “Andy” Barr (Ky.), Trey Radel (Fla.), Michael Burgess (Tex.), Jim Bridenstine (Okla.), Raul R. Labrador (Idaho), Keith Rothfus (Pa.), Paul Gosar (Ariz.), Steve Daines (Mont.), Bill Huizenga (Mich.), Richard Hudson (N.C.) and David Schweikert (Ariz.).

Over the evening I had the support of Republican Sens. John Barrasso (Wyo.), Mitch McConnell (Ky.), Saxby Chambliss (Ga.), John Cornyn (Tex.), John Thune (S.D.), Pat Toomey (Pa.) and Ron Johnson (Wis.). And Sens. Cruz, Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) and Tim Scott (R-S.C.) used the opportunity to make their first speaking appearances on the Senate floor. Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) came at the end to speak, but after midnight, I had said enough.

By the end of the night, I was tired and my voice was cracking. I ended by saying, “The cause here is one that I think is important enough to have gone through this procedure.” I talked about the idea of compromise, but said that “you don’t get half of the Fifth Amendment.” I argued that we need more extended debates. And finally, at 12:40 a.m., I yielded the floor.

On Thursday, the Senate confirmed John Brennanas director of the CIA. But this debate isn’t over.

The Senate has the power to restrain the executive branch — and my filibuster was the beginning of the fight to restore a healthy balance of powers. The president still needs to definitively say that the United States will not kill American noncombatants. The Constitution’s Fifth Amendment applies to all Americans; there are no exceptions.

The outpouring of support for my filibuster has been overwhelming and heartening. My office has fielded thousands of calls. Millions have followed this debate on TV, Twitter and Facebook. On Thursday, the White House produced another letter explaining its position on drone strikes. But the administration took too long, and parsed too many words and phrases, to instill confidence in its willingness or ability to protect our liberty.

I hope my efforts help spur a national debate about the limits of executive power and the scope of every American’s natural right to be free. “Due process” is not just a phrase that can be ignored at the whim of the president; it is a right that belongs to every citizen in this great nation.

I believe the support I received this past week shows that Americans are looking for someone to really stand up and fight for them. And I’m prepared to do just that.

(THE BRONX, N.Y.) Emilio's Bakery in the Bronx is using its funds to help the community after receiving a grant that helped the business keep its doors open, News 12 reports.

Guadalupe Pita, who manages the bakery, says the pandemic was tough on the business but they are still able to help the community at this time.

""We serve like eight schools and they closed so that’s when we had to start laying off employees and we had to close for a couple of weeks,” said Pita.

After a temporary closure, Pita and her family returned to the bakery, working 90 hours a week. She told News 12 it was necessary to do so to keep the business open and helping the community.

Emilio's Bakery rehired employees in December after receiving a $10,000 grant courtesy of the nonprofit Lisc NYC, which donated over $1 million to minority-owned small businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The bakery has donated over 100,000 meals, mostly to single mothers in the neighborhood who have lost their jobs.",1,https://www.newsbreak.com/new-york/bronx/news/2185771421530/bronx-bakery-sharing-with-community-after-being-granted-10000
707,Tafel,Rich,ssir,"Motivational speakers love the starfish story: A man walking along a shore covered with washed-up, dying starfish notices a boy throwing them back into the ocean, one by one. The man says to the boy that there are miles and miles of beach and hundreds of starfish, and that he’ll never make a difference. As the boy throws a starfish back into the ocean, he says, “I just made a difference to that one.”

This story epitomizes the mindset of our social entrepreneur movement—the lone hero making a difference in the life of one person by not falling into the paralysis of cynicism. The power of one.

But the story also represents the great failure of the social entrepreneur movement. Too often we fail to recognize the complex nature of the problems we face. We engage in linear, simplistic solutions, when lasting change requires collaborative efforts.

Action is important, but we also need to ask the bigger, strategic questions to create real solutions. In the starfish story, that would mean asking questions like: “What caused all of these starfish to dry up on the beach? What systems are at work here? Where can we have the greatest impact?”

As it happens, in 2008, thousands of starfish actually did wash up on the shores of Kent, England. Agencies and environmentalists considered weather and the possibility of disease as the cause, but after asking more questions, they found the cause was likely man-made. Dredgers, a tool fisherman use to scrape the sea floor for mussels, were almost certainly to blame, and the Marine Conservation Society (MCS) concluded that the incident was an example of overfishing. The MCS began to lobby the government “to dramatically extend its protection of the seas.” One group member said about the lobby efforts, “It's about protecting the whole ecosystem.”

Real world problems usually result from a broken ecosystem, and solutions most often require some kind of change to the rules. Had the citizens of Kent organized a starfish-throwing campaign, they would have been perpetuating the problem. Without new fishing practices and policy, those same starfish surely would wash ashore again. Worse, the rescuers would have tricked themselves into believing they were actually solving the problem.

The same is true for much of what passes as social entrepreneurism today. Many of us throw a few lucky ones back into the ocean and pat ourselves on the back saying, “Well, it made it difference to that one.” We might even frame our heroics at our annual fundraising banquet, giving the impression that we’re solving the problem.

Starfish throwing, like charity, isn’t a bad thing, but it is not a solution. When we confuse charity and justice, we perpetuate injustice. True world change requires more of its leaders. We must have the courage to work within our complex systems to change the rules.

Foundations that fund nonprofits must take the lead. They must ask potential grantees what root causes, policies, rules, and systems their innovation will engage to bring lasting world change. These simple questions will force the social change agents to find ways to create lasting change—to do more than throw starfish.

With the turmoil in American politics, progressive nonprofits and social ventures have been left scratching their heads, trying to figure out whether to engage the new GOP-controlled Hill and White House—and if so, how. Some have decided their strategy is to resist; others realize they must find ways to work with the federal government if they are to successfully serve their constituencies. The good news is that with the right approach, a progressive policy agenda can thrive under GOP control. To see how, we need only look back to the Republican Revolution of 1994, when the GOP took control of Congress for the first time in decades.

A year earlier, I had opened the doors of Log Cabin Republicans—a group dedicated to representing LGBT conservatives and allies—with the goal of educating Republicans on Capitol Hill about gay and AIDS issues. The November election threw progressive groups into a tizzy, and no group was more concerned than advocates fighting against the spread of AIDS. I found myself tasked with translating between progressive activists and GOP lawmakers, none of whom had much respect for the other side.

What I learned back then still has resonance today. Over the years, I’ve worked with dozens of social change organizations seeking to accomplish policy goals through conservative governments, and many have met with amazing success. For organizations facing this challenge today, here are 10 strategies that can help.

1. Change your mindset.

Somewhere in your organization’s mission or values is a commitment to diversity. This usually translates along the lines of race, gender, and sexual orientation—all of which are important—but the real dividing lines in America are ideological, and we’re losing the ability to cross boundaries around politics.

When meeting with people on the other side of the aisle, start with the premise that you share similar goals but see different ways of getting there, as opposed to thinking you’re on the right side of history and they are evil.

The AIDS crisis in Africa was ignored for years even under a Democratic president, so in 1994, most AIDS activists couldn’t imagine making progress under the new Republican-controlled Congress and White House. Nevertheless, a few nonprofits set up Congressional trips to Africa to educate staffers on the epidemic and its dangers. Rather than assuming that government leaders would ignore the problem, the nonprofits created an opportunity for them to see the problem from a new perspective, first-hand—a strategy that ultimately lead to a bipartisan coalition later known as PEPFAR. PEPFAR saved millions of lives as America’s largest humanitarian effort since the Marshall Plan.

2. Keep your eyes on the prize.

Engaging in advocacy requires nonlinear thinking. The political arena is an ecosystem. Advocates must be crystal clear about what they are seeking to accomplish and completely flexible on how they get there.

Most leaders feel that once the strategy or path they are on fails them, the quest is over. They lose heart and retreat. Instead, start with a hypothesis about the best route to your goal, then let go of that original plan as new information and networks emerge. Constantly be on the lookout for faster routes to where you want to go, and think of all strategy as temporary.

In the mid 1990’s, a coalition of LGBT groups was seeking to gain some type of visible support for gay rights from Members of Congress. Our original strategy was to get them to support a federal non-discrimination bill, but after numerous complaints that signing such a bill wasn’t the proper role for government, we changed our request, asking Member offices to sign a pledge saying they would not discriminate against gay staff in their office. By 1994, more than 52 GOP Members and 172 Democrats had signed pledges—a milestone at the time.

3. Map your assets.

You may not be a Republican, but you have allies who are. Look within your organization, on your board, and among your donors for people who have strong relations with the staffers you need to engage, and then map them out to get a clear picture of your potential network and reach.

At one health care nonprofit, we conducted a simple online survey of all staff, board members, and strategic partners. We asked questions like: Do you know any Republicans working on the Hill? Do you have connections or clients in the following geographic areas? Just asking moved people beyond their initial thinking of “We don’t know anyone.”

What you find may surprise you. After the survey above, an employee in one of the regional offices contacted me to tell me she was the niece of a GOP senator, but hadn’t told her team about it for fear that they might give her a hard time. In a different instance, during the AIDS crisis, programs with pharmaceutical partners used those companies to open Congressional doors to Senators who employed many workers in a number of critical states.

4. Focus on your top 10.

While there are times when a full-blown national campaign is necessary to make progress, most successful efforts focus on finding the 10 or so key players in Washington DC that can make it happen.

To find them, first identify the House committee that has jurisdiction over your issue, then look to see if there’s a subcommittee with an even greater focus on your issue. From this pool, find two Republicans and two Democrats to champion your issue—maybe they appear in your asset map, or maybe they represent a critical geographic region or have spoken about your issue. Repeat this process on the Senate side, and then look for two allies within the executive branch—usually, they are in the agency you're focused on, but sometimes they are in the White House.

5. Move right to left.

As an advocate of a nonprofit or social venture with connections on the Democratic side of the aisle, it is important to line up your Republicans allies first—even when Democrats control Congress. Many progressive groups launch their agenda with 40 far-left cosponsors, but the partisan reality is that a conservative Member would face criticism and even a primary challenge simply by being on the Democrat’s bill. Democrats face less risk of signing onto a GOP bill that achieves a progressive goal. In some cases, progressive advocacy groups introduce bills they know can’t pass in an effort to raise money or signal to their constituents that they are doing something. The reality is their effort arrives dead on arrival.

Start building your coalition of supporters by going as far to the right on the political spectrum as you can, and move left. When we were working on AIDS funding in the 1990s, Rep. Tom Coburn (R-OK) was an unlikely champion. He was later known as “Dr. No” for his opposition to funding increases. But he was also a doctor, who knew the power of early and effective treatment. Once he was on board, he made it safe for fellow Republicans to support our agenda, and in the end, democratic support was a nice but unnecessary addition. As conservative allies see your organization marry up the various parts of Congress from right to left, they will recognize you are doing your homework and give you even more time down the line.

6. Move Hill to White House.

Thanks to celebrity-like coverage and the growing use of executive orders, most organizations I’ve worked with believe the President and executive branch of government are more powerful than they are. Meanwhile, Congress is much more powerful than advocates think. Though agencies like the Department of Education and the Department of Health and Human Services are part of the executive branch, for example, Congress governs them.



One of the best ways to access an agency is to get a Member of the House or Senate to request that the agency meet with you. An education group I worked with had been trying for years to meet with the Secretary of Education, but we didn’t achieve a meeting until our Hill champions requested that the Secretary hear our proposal.

7. Create a win for everyone.

Every great negotiator creates wins for all involved, and policy strategy is negotiation strategy on steroids. An obvious win for politicians is something that helps them get re-elected. How does winning their support make them look good? Will your agenda create new jobs or save government funding?

Many Republicans are very frustrated with their pop culture image as self-interested politicians who don’t care about the issues many nonprofits are tackling. Supporting your cause can be a tangible way for them to show their compassionate side, which might also help in their re-election. Ask for their help in identifying how your agenda aligns with theirs, and couch it in terms the benefit everyone.

8. Speak morally.

While you want to create a win, it’s worth remembering that politicians are motivated by more than just re-election. As hard as it is to believe, most staffers on Capitol Hill went there to do good and want to work toward positive outcomes. Appeal to this sense of purpose using language that resonates; Republicans speak in moral and spiritual terms more than most Democrats do.

The creation of the US response to the AIDS crisis in Africa (see “Change your mindset,” above) hit a brick wall when the head of USAID at the time argued that Africans were too primitive to successfully adhere to drug regimens. Though we knew this was untrue, it put our entire advocacy strategy into a tailspin.

In a critical meeting with GOP Senate staffers, we asked, “Why did you come to DC?” They responded from the heart, “To do good.” We made the case that America had a moral and spiritual responsibility to do good by responding to the crisis. Their support following that meeting probably didn’t help any of them win their next election, but each person spoke about the positive impact it had on their lives.

9. Articulate your plan of action—succinctly.

The average Hill staffer holds about 12 meetings a day. They are overworked and overwhelmed, which means that as they sit across from you nodding and smiling, they are quietly hoping your meeting won’t be actionable.

Before you engage with Republican leaders, spend time making your pitch actionable and clear. Instead of using your meeting to talk about the importance of ending income inequality, you might specifically demonstrate that your program lifts individuals in their district out of poverty and into the workforce, and then offer case studies of real people and summary of how much your program saves the government.

As above, take the time to frame your message in a way that will resonate. Having a constituent make the case is a powerful way to start. The advice I gave in a 2010 article on “speaking Republican”—with examples from issues like lifting the ban on gays serving in the military, immigration, and health care—still stands today.

10. Hire a lobbying firm.

I put this last, because it can get very expensive, very fast—a decent lobbyist starts at $10,000 a month, and most require a yearlong engagement. But lobbyists can ultimately save you time and money by getting you to the right person quickly.

That said, citizen advocates can do a lot without them if they follow the steps outlined here. Hill staffers know nonprofits don’t have big budgets to pay world-class lobbyists, and many will be sympathetic to your effort even when they don’t align to your cause. A nonprofit or social venture that can present its own case can sometimes have more impact than a “hired gun.”

One prominent Republican Hill staffer told me that when a nonprofit leader came into his office last month with a lobbyist, he shoved his card into the hand of the nonprofit leader and said, “Here is my business card. You can call me directly anytime you want. I’ll respond directly to you.” He was, he told me, trying to communicate that the nonprofit didn’t need to pay a high-priced lobbyist to get the next meeting. No lobby firm will tell you this, but advocacy can carry more weight if your organization is doing the meetings.

In this time of hyper-partisan political partisanship, advocacy has never been more challenging. Most progressive causes will give up. But true advocates with the right strategies can make progress where others won’t—and those we seek to serve are counting on us to try.",0,https://ssir.org/articles/entry/how_progressive_nonprofits_can_navigate_conservative_gop_washington
709,Tafel,Rich,bold,"The year 2016 will be remembered as when our two political parties collapsed inward, dragged down by their worst instincts. This meltdown will create the opportunity for renewal in each party.

The Republicans are imploding first. A party that was once built on individual rights, personal responsibility, less government, free enterprise and ”peace through strength” is now lead by a “crony capitalist” who stiffed customers and small business suppliers alike, who advocates religious persecution of Muslims, a police state against Mexican immigrants, and withdrawal from global commitments.

But the Republican Party’s problems go beyond Trump. The Republican platform, written by the activist base, seeks a “human life amendment,” condemns gay families, and advocates for dangerous reparative therapy for gay youth. The right is still fighting the culture wars of the 1990s that it already lost.

Democrats are also reverting to old pathologies, offering something for every possible voting group: free college, expansion of Social Security, Medicare, and a “public option” for Obamacare, a national minimum wage of $15, plus mandates on business, states and local governments and more taxes on the rich. At the same time, their platform offers no solution to the deficit, supports government-subsidized abortion and has dropped its 2012 commitment to religious liberty.

On immigration, both parties chart extreme positions. The Republican platform would deport 11 million people, while the Democrats’ suggests no plan, or need, to secure our borders.

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton affirmed her support for implementing the Democratic platform as written. Trump is less attached to the Republican platform but named a strict social conservative as his running mate and still displays the egoism and bigotry that should have disqualified him in the party of Lincoln.

Neither of the parties has a plan to address today’s $19 trillion federal debt, which by 2026 reaches $29 trillion under Clinton and $39 trillion under Trump. Instead of solutions, each party blames a “them” for American’s problems: “illegal immigrants” and “Muslims,” or “the 1%,” both decrying “a rigged system” and the other party.

In short, each party lacks balance and has retreated to its political corner. Each embraces pandering and the politics of division. And each has nominated a candidate that voters rightly don’t trust, leaving us a choice of “lesser evils.”

As lifelong Republicans who have spent our political life seeking to build bridges, we know that Trump’s bullying, imprudence, and unpreparedness would be dangerous for our country. On Election Day, we must vote against Trump, to protect the country, and for most down-ballot Republicans, to restrain the Democrats in Congress.

But Americans deserve better. Gallup polls now confirm that most Americans are “socially liberal and fiscally conservative.” As hopeful believers in the American dream, most Americans want a sustainable society based on innovation and opportunity, security and trust, private charity and public safety-net, inclusion and religious liberty, personal freedom and human dignity. That aspiration should be at the core of each political party. It is not.

And we Republicans must create a Party that once again champions civil debate, science, inclusion and religious freedom for all faiths, including Muslims. We must build a movement that fights for prison and police reform because we do not have justice until we have justice for all. We must stand for the middle class and the poor, one nation of opportunity, undivided by class, race, or gender. We must remain committed to fiscal and environmental sustainability, for the benefit of future generations and support a strong defense–including a plan to defeat terrorists and minimize war.

For America’s sake, Trump must fail, but each party still needs real change. The irony is that, in the wake of Trump’s self-destruction, we Republicans may be more motivated to make that change, from which could rise a renewed, inclusive party of Lincoln. That is our opportunity.

710,Tafel,Rich,huffingtonpost,"There's a tremor in the force. Innovation is about to democratize philanthropy.

Crowdfunding, the online technology that transformed the field of fundraising, is about to disrupt America's grant-giving, and for leaders trying to change the world for the better, this change can't come fast enough.

In Detroit, America's silicon valley of social innovation, entrepreneur Chris Blauvelt has come up with a completely new way to raise over $3M in grants for social change and his model is about to go national.

Chris came up with the idea of leveraging online Crowdfunding models to solve Detroit's blight. When he first described it, no one got it. ""Everyone kept saying that it sounds like Kickstarter or GoFundMe,"" Blauvelt remembers, when he entered a statewide social entrepreneur competition in 2013. ""But I saw a whole new way to use Crowdfunding to flip grant-giving on its head""

His platform, Patronicity, went on to win and become the nation's first CrowdGranting site. Within two years, the site has processed over $3M in grants for local entities in MI, making it one of the leading social enterprises in the state.

Here's how it works. The model builds on the Crowdfunding concept of engaging donors online. Local community members identify a problem they see, such as a vacant lot, crumbling buildings or a poorly lit street. Citizens create a budget and project page, then send their plan of action to Patronicity for approval. And here's the twist: Patronicity partners with the State of Michigan who matches every dollar raised in the community.

Innovation and state government are two words that rarely go together, but the Michigan Economic Development Corporation (MEDC) took a big risk and partnered with Patronicity, and it paid off beyond expectations. Katharine Czarnecki, who pioneered the partnership at MEDC, is thrilled, ""I was hoping for a 50-percent success rate, the fact that we have 97 percent is crazy.""

Social entrepreneurs looking for a multiple ""win-win solution"" have a case study here. Citizen activists win when they are empowered to identify problems. Citizen donors win when they can vote with their dollars to solve problems. Community members win through a transparent granting process that rebuilds their area. The state wins as they identify problems quickly and gain citizen support to solve them without the need to hire a large paid staff to identify, approve and process grants.

Eric Schramm experienced the power of this initiative. As the Associate Director of Development and Alumni Relations at UM, he helped support a student effort to create a space to train community members in new areas, such as 3-D printing, welding, and computer training in one of Detroit's most isolated neighborhoods. The effort not only met the match, $25,000, but also reached far beyond at $31,700. The state match made the project possible with a total of $56,700 in funds raised. Schramm recognized the force of innovation, ""I don't know where we would be if we had not held our campaign with Patronicity.""

Patronicity's president, Ebrahim Varachia, credited with bringing this model to life, sums up the innovative genius of CrowdGranting: ""No longer is the grant process solely the home of black box review committees, tedious paperwork, and high administrative costs that eat into the very dollars the grantor seeks to use to improve communities. Our innovation democratizes granting, helping organizations extend their reach while building goodwill in communities. We believe our model will reimagine philanthropy as we know it.""

Philanthropy and grant-giving has long been the least innovative arena of social change. Now, it too is about to innovate through the CrowdGranting model pioneered by Patronicity, and other states and cities are calling the Detroit offices to seek their council. Varachia is already in conversations with three other states and individual philanthropists who want to double their giving dollars.

This innovation is literally putting the power of change back into the hands of the people. Patronicity's CrowdGranting is a much-needed ""great disturbance in the force"" for social change.

711,Tafel,Rich,huffingtonpost,"Last week both Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton more formally launched their campaigns for president. The pundits tell us that Jeb is the likely GOP nominee while Hillary is definitely the Democrat's candidate. Over one year before votes are cast, the election is over before it has even begun. If either Mrs. Clinton or Mr. Bush win in 2016, then at their retirement 36 of last 44 years will have had a member of their family in the Executive Branch -- an entire generation. After two terms in the White House, Americans will be ready for the 2024 campaign featuring George P. Bush versus Chelsea Clinton. But what if the pundits are wrong? What if the people choose something else? It could happen. First, on the Democrat's side the early Clinton campaign has demonstrated so far is that they don't trust the candidate. Keeping her in controlled settings with no ability to make a gaffe tells us they know something we don't. There is a lot of potential for trouble in the Clinton Foundation and email stories that have yet to be discovered. What if Hillary Democrats demand a choice?

We'd first see dissatisfaction with candidate Clinton by a spike in support for Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT). If this leads to panic, the Democrat Party establishment would draft Vice President Biden as the establishment alternative. The fact that he didn't seek the office will enhance his image with the public. His goofy factor will be perceived as refreshing authenticity in contrast to the overly crafted Clinton campaign. Biden can make the powerful case they he really does have the ability to work across the aisle.



On the GOP side, the donor class is heavily invested in Bush. But if they begin to see his inevitability fade, they will look elsewhere. Rubio won't do as he reminds Republicans too much of Obama--young and untested with no life experience. Walker's lack of experience at the international level will lead the donor establishment to look elsewhere. The search for an affable candidate with the best chance to win Ohio will lead them to Governor John Kasich (R-OH). Additionally his experience having been a TV commentator and ability to work across the aisle will emerge as his major assets.



Kasich v. Biden is a far-fetched scenario. However, unprecedented dissatisfaction among voters in 2016 means anything can happen. The great thing about American democracy is that the future is impossible to predict. We do have a chance to reject the pundit's predictions. In 2016, we might just win our democracy back.",0,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rich-tafel/biden-v-kasich-americans-might-just-choose-democracy-in-2016_b_7615546.html
712,Tafel,Rich,huffingtonpost,"The story of how gay marriage has gone from a political impossibility to a cultural reality offers America a practical way forward on the seemingly impossible issue of political gridlock.

In his State of the Union address, the president drew a connection between the success of gay marriage and the possibility of ending gridlock in politics, ""I've seen something like gay marriage go from a wedge issue used to drive us apart to a story of freedom across our country, a civil right now legal in states that seven in ten Americans call home.""

But what the President didn't explain was why gay marriage has succeeded, while so many other progressive issues, such as climate change and abortion rights, have lost ground with the American public during the last decade. The secret to the success of gay marriage was that early advocates for the issue integrated conservative values into their proposals, as brilliantly outlined in Andrew Sullivan's 1989 New Republic cover story entitled ""Here Comes the Groom: A Conservative Case for Gay Marriage.""

In the early 1990s when I headed to Washington D.C. to launch Log Cabin Republicans, we did something very counterintuitive. In a series of gay marriage debates with socially conservative organizations, we used faith-based, family oriented, conservative arguments for why gay marriage advanced conservative values. In fact, some progressive LGBT leaders actually opposed gay marriage as an issue to pursue.

The lesson to be learned in the success of gay marriage is found in the way this issue integrates strong American values from both the left and right. And this suggests how we can overcome our hyper-partisan, dysfunctional politics overall, which Americans now rate as the number one threat to our nation's future.

To overcome our nations' political gridlock, we'll need to develop new ways to integrate both the conservative and liberal values that underlie the polarization. Attempting to reform politics, without appreciating the very real cultural world views that drive polarization, will only lead each side to find clever new ways of gaming or disrupting the system to their advantage.

Like gay marriage, policy solutions that actually incorporate some of the best values of the Tea Party right and the Occupy left can move us beyond polarization. But before right and left can come together, we need to depolarize each party first.

Here are three steps we can take to depolarize American politics:

Step one: Depolarize our own thinking by increasing the scope of what we are able to value. This involves taking perspectives that respect the values of those we disagree with, and recognizing the positive motivations of our political opponents.

Step two: Depolarize the conflicting values found within each party. In 2015, this can be accomplished by convening thought leaders from each party in small conclaves tasked with developing policy stances that incorporate the values of both the pragmatic establishment and the ideological base within each party.

Step three: Using the same strategy outlined in step two, work to depolarize the electorate as a whole by crafting policies that incorporate the core values of both sides. While it may sound counterintuitive, the moral views of both conservatives and progressives have more in common then we think. The success of gay marriage demonstrates that when forward-looking issues manage to incorporate and respect traditional values, we create a win for all sides, and our politicians can get things done.
